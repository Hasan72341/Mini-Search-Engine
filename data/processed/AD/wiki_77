Upper Canada included all of modern-day Southern Ontario and all those areas of Northern Ontario in the which had formed part of New France, essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River or Lakes Huron and Superior, excluding any lands within the watershed of Hudson Bay. The \"upper\" prefix in the name reflects its geographic position along the Great Lakes, mostly above the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River, contrasted with Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) to the northeast.\nUpper Canada was the primary destination of Loyalist refugees and settlers from the United States after the American Revolution, who often were granted land to settle in Upper Canada. Already populated by Indigenous peoples, land for settlement in Upper Canada was made by treaties between the new British government and the Indigenous peoples, exchanging land for one-time payments or annuities. The new province was characterized by its British way of life, including bicameral parliament and separate civil and criminal law, rather than mixed as in Lower Canada or elsewhere in the British Empire. The division was created to ensure the exercise of the same rights and privileges enjoyed by loyal subjects elsewhere in the North American colonies. In 1812, war broke out between Great Britain and the United States, leading to several battles in Upper Canada. The United States attempted to capture Upper Canada, but the war ended with the situation unchanged.\nThe government of the colony came to be dominated by a small group of persons, known as the \"Family Compact\", who held most of the top positions in the Legislative Council and appointed officials. In 1837, an unsuccessful rebellion attempted to overthrow the undemocratic system. Representative government would be established in the 1840s. Upper Canada existed from its establishment on 26 December 1791 to 10 February 1841, when it was united with adjacent Lower Canada to form the Province of Canada.\nEstablishment.\nAs part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris which ended the Seven Years' War global conflict and the French and Indian War in North America, Great Britain retained control over the former New France, which had been defeated in the French and Indian War. The British had won control after Fort Niagara had surrendered in 1759 and Montreal capitulated in 1760, and the British under Robert Rogers took formal control of the Great Lakes region in 1760. Fort Michilimackinac was occupied by Roger's forces in 1761.\nThe territories of contemporary southern Ontario and southern Quebec were initially maintained as the single province of Quebec, as it had been under the French. From 1763 to 1791, the Province of Quebec maintained its French language, cultural behavioural expectations, practices and laws. The British passed the \"Quebec Act\" in 1774, which expanded the Quebec colony's authority to include part of the Indian Reserve to the west (i.e., parts of southern Ontario), and other western territories south of the Great Lakes including much of what would become the United States' Northwest Territory, including the modern states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota.\nAfter the American War of Independence ended in 1783, Britain retained control of the area north of the Ohio River. The official boundaries remained undefined until 1795 and the Jay Treaty. The British authorities encouraged the movement of people to this area from the United States, offering free land to encourage population growth. For settlers, the head of the family received and per family member, and soldiers received larger grants. These settlers are known as United Empire Loyalists and were primarily English-speaking Protestants. The first townships (Royal and Cataraqui) along the St. Lawrence and eastern Lake Ontario were laid out in 1784, populated mainly with decommissioned soldiers and their families.\n\"Upper Canada\" became a political entity on 26 December 1791 with the Parliament of Great Britain's passage of the Constitutional Act 1791. The act divided the province of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada, but did not yet specify official borders for Upper Canada. The division was effected so that Loyalist American settlers and British immigrants in Upper Canada could have English laws and institutions, and the French-speaking population of Lower Canada could maintain French civil law and the Catholic religion. The first lieutenant-governor was John Graves Simcoe.\nThe 1795 Jay Treaty officially set the borders between British North America and the United States north to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. On 1 February 1796, the capital of Upper Canada was moved from Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) to York (now Toronto), which was judged to be less vulnerable to attack by the US.\nThe Act of Union 1840, passed 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841, merged Upper Canada with Lower Canada to form the short-lived United Province of Canada.\nGovernment.\nProvincial administration.\nUpper Canada's constitution was said to be \"the very image and transcript\" of the British constitution, and based on the principle of \"mixed monarchy\" \u2013 a balance of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy.\nThe Executive arm of government in the colony consisted of a lieutenant-governor, his executive council, and the Officers of the Crown (equivalent to the Officers of the Parliament of Canada): the Adjutant General of the Militia, the Attorney General, the Auditor General of Land Patents for Upper Canada, the Auditor General (only one appointment ever made), Crown Lands Office, Indian Office, Inspector General, Kings' Printer, Provincial Secretary and Registrar's Office, Receiver General of Upper Canada, Solicitor General, and Surveyor General.\nThe Executive Council of Upper Canada had a similar function to the Cabinet in England but was not responsible to the Legislative Assembly. They held a consultative position, however, and did not serve in administrative offices as cabinet ministers do. Members of the Executive Council were not necessarily members of the Legislative Assembly but were usually members of the Legislative Council.\nParliament.\nThe Legislative branch of the government consisted of the parliament comprising legislative council and legislative assembly. When the capital was first moved to Toronto (then called York) from Newark (present-day Niagara-on-the-Lake) in 1796, the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada were at the corner of Parliament and Front Streets, in buildings that were burned by US forces in the War of 1812, rebuilt, then burned again by accident in 1824. The site was eventually abandoned for another, to the west.\nThe Legislative Council of Upper Canada was the upper house governing the province of Upper Canada. Although modelled after the British House of Lords, Upper Canada had no aristocracy. Members of the Legislative council, appointed for life, formed the core of the oligarchic group, the Family Compact, that came to dominate government and economy in the province.\nThe Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada functioned as the lower house in the Parliament of Upper Canada. Its legislative power was subject to veto by the appointed Lieutenant Governor, Executive Council, and Legislative Council.\nDistricts and local government.\nLocal government in the province of Upper Canada was based on districts. Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester created four districts 24 July 1788.\nFor militia and parliamentary purposes, Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe in a proclamation 16 July 1792 divided these districts into the nineteen original counties of Ontario: Glengarry, Stormont, Dundas, Grenville, Leeds, Frontenac, Ontario, Addington, Lennox, Prince Edward, Hastings, Northumberland, Durham, York, Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent.\nBy 1800, the four districts of Eastern, Midland, Home and Western had been increased to eight, the new ones being Johnston, Niagara, London and Newcastle. Additional districts were created from the existing districts as the population grew until 1849, when local government mainly based on counties came into effect. At that time, there were 20 districts; legislation to create a new Kent District was never completed. Up until 1841, the district officials were appointed by the lieutenant-governor, although usually with local input.\nJustices of the peace were appointed by the Lt. Governor. Any two justices meeting together could form the lowest level of the justice system, the Courts of Request. A Court of Quarter Sessions was held four times a year in each district composed of all the resident justices. The Quarter Sessions met to oversee the administration of the district and deal with legal cases. They formed, in effect, the municipal government until an area was incorporated as either a police board or a city after 1834.\nList of cities and towns of Upper Canada.\nIncorporated in Upper Canada era (to 1841)\nIncorporated in Province of Canada (1841\u20131867)\nPolitics.\nFamily Compact.\nThe Family Compact is the epithet applied to an oligarchic group of men who exercised most of the political and judicial power in Upper Canada from the 1810s to the 1840s. It was noted for its conservatism and opposition to democracy. The uniting factors amongst the Compact were its loyalist tradition, hierarchical class structure and adherence to the established Anglican Church. Leaders such as John Beverley Robinson and John Strachan proclaimed it an ideal government, especially as contrasted with the rowdy democracy in the nearby United States. The Family Compact emerged from the War of 1812 and collapsed in the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837.\nReform movement.\nThere were many outstanding individual reform politicians in Upper Canada, including Robert Randal, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, William Ketchum and Dr. William Warren Baldwin; however, \"organized\" collective reform activity began with Robert Fleming Gourlay. Gourlay was a well-connected Scottish emigrant who arrived in 1817, hoping to encourage \"assisted emigration\" of the poor from Britain. He solicited information on the colony through township questionnaires, and soon became a critic of government mismanagement. When the local legislature ignored his call for an inquiry, he called for a petition to the British Parliament. He organized township meetings, and a provincial convention\u00a0\u2013 which the government considered dangerous and seditious. Gourlay was tried in December 1818 under the Sedition Act 1804 and jailed for 8 months. He was banished from the province in August 1819. His expulsion made him a martyr in the reform community.\nThe next wave of organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s through the work of William Lyon Mackenzie, James Lesslie, John Rolph, William John O'Grady and Dr Thomas Morrison, all of Toronto. They were critical to introducing the British Political Unions to Upper Canada. Political Unions were not parties. The unions organized petitions to Parliament.\nThe Upper Canada Central Political Union was organized in 1832\u201333 by Dr Thomas David Morrison (mayor of Toronto in 1836) while William Lyon Mackenzie was in England. This union collected 19,930 signatures on a petition protesting Mackenzie's unjust expulsion from the House of Assembly by the Family Compact.\nThis union was reorganized as the Canadian Alliance Society (1835). It shared a large meeting space in the market buildings with the Mechanics Institute and the Children of Peace. The Canadian Alliance Society adopted much of the platform (such as secret ballot &amp; universal suffrage) of the Owenite National Union of the Working Classes in London, England, that were to be integrated into the Chartist movement in England.\nThe Canadian Alliance Society was reborn as the Constitutional Reform Society (1836), when it was led by the more moderate reformer, Dr William W. Baldwin. After the disastrous 1836 elections, it took the final form as the Toronto Political Union in 1837. It was the Toronto Political Union that called for a Constitutional Convention in July 1837, and began organizing local \"Vigilance Committees\" to elect delegates. This became the organizational structure for the Rebellion of 1837.\nUpper Canada Rebellion of 1837.\nThe Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the oligarchic government of the Family Compact in December 1837, led by William Lyon Mackenzie. Long term grievances included antagonism between Later Loyalists and British Loyalists, political corruption, the collapse of the international financial system and the resultant economic distress, and a growing republican sentiment. While public grievances had existed for years, it was the Lower Canada Rebellion (in present-day Quebec) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to revolt openly soon after. The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) \u2013 mainly through the support of the Hunters' Lodges, a secret anti-British American militia that emerged in states around the Great Lakes. They launched the Patriot War in 1838\u201339.\nJohn Lambton, Lord Durham's support for \"responsible government\" undercut the Tories and gradually led the public to reject what it viewed as poor administration, unfair land and education policies, and inadequate attention to urgent transportation needs. Durham's report led to the administrative unification of Upper and Lower Canada as the Province of Canada in 1841. Responsible government did not occur until the late 1840s under Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine.\nSydenham and the Union of the Canadas.\nAfter the Rebellions, the new governor, Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham, proved an exemplary Utilitarian, despite his aristocratic pretensions. This combination of free trade and aristocratic pretensions needs to be underscored; although a liberal capitalist, Sydenham was no radical democrat. Sydenham approached the task of implementing those aspects of Durham's report that the colonial office approved of, municipal reform, and the union of the Canadas, with a \"campaign of state violence and coercive institutional innovation\u00a0... empowered not just by the British state but also by his Benthamite certainties.\" Like governors Bond Head before him, and Metcalfe after, he was to turn to the Orange Order for often violent support. It was Sydenham who played a critical role in transforming Compact Tories into Conservatives.\nSydenham introduced a vast expansion of the state apparatus through the introduction of municipal government. Areas not already governed through civic corporations or police boards would be governed through centrally controlled District Councils with authority over roads, schools, and local policing. A strengthened Executive Council would further usurp much of the elected assembly's legislative role, leaving elected politicians to simply review the administration's legislative program and budgets.\nSettlement.\nFirst Nations dispossession and reserves.\nThe First Nations occupying the territory that was to become Upper Canada were:\nPrior to the creation of Upper Canada in 1791, much land had already been ceded by the First Nations to the Crown in accordance with the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The first treaty was between the Seneca and the British in 1764, giving access to lands adjoining the Niagara River. During the American Revolutionary War most of the First Nations supported the British. After the Americans launched a campaign that burned the villages of the Iroquois in New York State in 1779 the refugees fled to Fort Niagara and other British posts, and remained permanently in Canada.\nLand was granted to these allied Six Nations who had served on the British side during the American Revolution by the Haldimand Proclamation (1784). Haldimand had purchased a tract of land from the Mississaugas. The nature of the grant and the administration of land sales by Upper Canada and Canada is a matter of dispute.\nBetween 1783 and 1812, fifteen land surrender treaties were concluded in Upper Canada. These involved one-time payments of money or goods to the Indigenous peoples. Some of the treaties spelled out designated reserve lands for the Indigenous peoples.\nFollowing the War of 1812, European settlers came in increasing numbers. The Indian Department focussed on converting the Indigenous peoples to abandon their old way of life and adopt agriculture. The treaties shifted from one-time payments in exchange to annual annuities from the sale of surrendered lands. Between 1825 and 1860, treaties were concluded for nearly all of the land-mass of the future province of Ontario. In 1836, Manitoulin Island was designated as a reserve for dispossessed natives, but much of this was ceded in 1862.\nLoyalists and the land grant system.\nCrown land policy to 1825 was multi-fold in the use of a \"free\" resource that had value to people who themselves may have little or no money for its purchase and for the price of settling upon it to support themselves and a create a new society. First, the cash-strapped Crown government in Canada could pay and reward the services and loyalty of the \"United Empire Loyalists\" who, originated outside of Canada, without encumbrance of debt by being awarded with small portions of land (under ) with the proviso that it be settled by those to which it was granted; Second, portions would be reserved for the future use of the Crown and the clergy that did not require settlement by which to gain control. Lt. Governor Simcoe saw this as the mechanism by which an aristocracy might be created, and that compact settlement could be avoided with the grants of large tracts of land to those Loyalists not required to settle on it as the means of gaining control.\nAssisted immigration.\nThe Calton weavers were a community of handweavers established in the community of Calton, then in Lanarkshire just outside Glasgow, Scotland in the 18th century. In the early 19th century, many of the weavers emigrated to Canada, settling in Carleton Place and other communities in eastern Ontario, where they continued their trade.\nIn 1825, 1,878 Irish Immigrants from the city of Cork arrived in the community of Scott's Plains. The British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish families to Upper Canada in 1822. The scheme was managed by Peter Robinson, a member of the Family Compact and brother of the Attorney General. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour.\nTalbot settlement.\nThomas Talbot emigrated in 1791, where he became personal secretary to John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Talbot convinced the government to allow him to implement a land settlement scheme of in Elgin County in the townships of Dunwich and Aldborough in 1803. According to his government agreement, he was entitled to for every settler who received ; in this way he gained an estate of . Talbot's administration was regarded as despotic. He was infamous for registering settlers' names on the local settlement map in pencil and if displeased, erasing their entry. Talbot's abuse of power was a contributing factor in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837.\nCrown and clergy reserves.\nThe Crown reserves, one seventh of all lands granted, were to provide the provincial executive with an independent source of revenue not under the control of the elected Assembly. The clergy reserves, also one seventh of all lands granted in the province, were created \"for the support and maintenance of a Protestant clergy\" in lieu of tithes. The revenue from the lease of these lands was claimed by the Rev. John Strachan on behalf of the Church of England. These reserves were directly administered by the Crown; which, in turn, came under increasing political pressure from other Protestant bodies. The Reserve lands were to be a focal point of dissent within the Legislative Assembly.\nThe Clergy Corporation was incorporated in 1819 to manage the clergy reserves. After the Rev. John Strachan was appointed to the Executive Council, the advisory body to the Lieutenant Governor, in 1815, he began to push for the Church of England's autonomous control of the clergy reserves on the model of the Clergy Corporation created in Lower Canada in 1817. Although all clergymen in the Church of England were members of the body corporate, the act prepared in 1819 by Strachan's former student, Attorney General John Beverly Robinson, also appointed the Inspector General and the Surveyor General to the board, and made a quorum of three for meetings; these two public officers also sat on the Legislative Council with Strachan. These three were usually members of the Family Compact.\nThe clergy reserves were not the only types of landed endowment for the Anglican Church and clergy. The \"1791 Act\" also provided for glebe land to be assigned and vested in the Crown (for which were set aside), where the revenues would be remitted to the Church. The act also provided for the creation of parish rectories, giving parishes a corporate identity so that they could hold property (although none were created until 1836, prior to the recall of John Colborne, in which he created 24 of them). They were granted lands amounting to , of which were drawn from the clergy reserves and other glebe lots, while were taken from ordinary Crown lands. A later suit to have this action annulled was dismissed by the Court of Chancery of Upper Canada. The Province of Canada would later pass an Act in 1866 to authorize the disposal of such glebe and rectory lands not specifically used as churches, parsonages or burial grounds.\nCommon school lands.\nIn 1797, lands in twelve townships (six east of York, and six west, totalling about , were set aside, from which revenues arising from their sale or lease were dedicated to support the establishment of grammar schools and a university for the Province. They were distributed as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLand sale system.\nThe land grant policy changed after 1825 as the Upper Canadian administration faced a financial crisis that would otherwise require raising local taxes, thereby making it more dependent on a local elected legislature. The Upper Canadian state ended its policy of granting land to \"unofficial\" settlers and implemented a broad plan of revenue-generating sales. The Crown replaced its old policy of land grants to ordinary settlers in newly opened districts with land sales by auction. It also passed legislation that allowed the auctioning of previously granted land for payment of back-taxes.\nCanada Company.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nFew chose to lease the Crown reserves as long as free grants of land were still available. The Lieutenant Governor increasingly found himself depending upon the customs duties shared with, but collected in Lower Canada for revenue; after a dispute with the lower province on the relative proportions to be allocated to each, these duties were withheld, forcing the Lieutenant Governor to search for new sources of revenue. The Canada Company was created as a means of generating government revenue that was not under the control of the elected Assembly, thereby granting the Lt. Governor greater independence from local voters.\nThe plan for the Canada Company was promoted by the province's Attorney General, John Beverly Robinson, then studying law at Lincoln's Inn in London. The Lt. Governor's financial crisis led to a quick adoption of Robinson's scheme to sell the Crown reserves to a new land company which would provide the provincial government with annual payments of between \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000. The Canada Company was chartered in London in 1826; after three years of mismanagement by John Galt, the company hired William Allan and Thomas Mercer Jones to manage the company's Upper Canadian business. Jones was to manage the \"Huron Tract,\" and Allan to sell the Crown reserves already surveyed in other districts.\nAccording to the Canada Company, \"the poorest individual can here procure for himself and family a valuable tract; which, with a little labour, he can soon convert into a comfortable home, such as he could probably never attain in any other country\u00a0\u2013 all his own!\" However, recent studies have suggested that a minimum of \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 plus the cost of land was required to start a new farm in the bush. As a result, few of these poor settlers had any hope of starting their own farm, although many tried.\nHuron Tract.\nThe Huron Tract lies in the counties of Huron, Perth, Middlesex and present-day Lambton County, Ontario, bordering on Lake Huron to the west and Lake Erie to the east. The tract was purchased by the Canada Company for resale to settlers. Influenced by William \"Tiger\" Dunlop, John Galt and other businessmen formed the Canada Company. The Canada Company was the administrative agent for the Huron Tract.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHerbert C. Northcott and Donna M. Wilson emphasize that conditions were severe in the early period: While the infectious diseases brought to Canada by the Europeans were especially devastating for the Indigenous peoples, they did not spare European explorers, traders, and settlers. The harsh climate, rough pioneer existence, low standards of living, and unsanitary practices contributed to many early deaths in the colonies. Infant mortality was high, as was maternal mortality, and life expectancy in general was low. Health care was relatively ineffective, and the few hospitals that existed were considered places of death.\nEthnic groups.\nThere were multiple ethnic or cultural groups in Upper Canada, but statistics are incomplete before 1842. An idea of the diversity can be had if one considers the religious census of 1842, which is helpfully provided below: Roman Catholics were 15% of the population, and adherents to this religion were, at the time, mainly drawn from the Irish and the French settlers. The Roman Catholic faith also numbered some votaries from amongst the Scottish settlers. The category of \"other\" religious adherents, somewhat under 5% of the population, included the Aboriginal and Metis culture.\nFirst Nations.\nSee above: Land Settlement\nM\u00e9tis.\nMany British and French-Canadian fur traders married First Nations women from the Cree, Ojibwa, or Saulteaux First Nations. The majority of these fur traders were Scottish and French and were Catholic.\nCanadiens/French-Canadians.\nEarly settlements in the region include the Mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons at Midland in 1649, Sault Ste. Marie in 1668, and Fort Pontchartrain du D\u00e9troit in 1701. Southern Ontario was part of the \"Pays d'en-haut\" (Upper Country) of New France, and later part of the province of Quebec until Quebec was split into Upper and Lower Canada in 1791. The first wave of settlement in the Detroit/Windsor area came in the 18th century during the French regime. A second wave came in the 19th and early 20th centuries to the areas of Eastern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario. In the Ottawa Valley, in particular, some families have moved back and forth across the Ottawa River for generations (the river is the border between Ontario and Quebec). In the city of Ottawa some areas such as Vanier and Orleans have a rich Franco-heritage where families often have members on both sides of the Ottawa River.\nLoyalists/Later Loyalists.\nAfter an initial group of about 7,000 United Empire Loyalists were thinly settled across the province in the mid-1780s, a far larger number of \"late-Loyalists\" arrived in the late 1790s and were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown to obtain land if they came from the US. Their fundamental political allegiances were always considered dubious. By 1812, this had become acutely problematic since the American settlers outnumbered the original Loyalists by more than ten to one. Following the War of 1812, the colonial government under Lt. Governor Gore took active steps to prevent Americans from swearing allegiance, thereby making them ineligible to obtain land grants. The tensions between the Loyalists and late Loyalists erupted in the \"Alien Question\" crisis in 1820\u201321 when the Bidwells (Barnabas and his son Marshall) sought election to the provincial assembly. They faced opponents who claimed they could not hold elective office because of their American citizenship. If the Bidwells were aliens so were the majority of the province. The issue was not resolved until 1828 when the Colonial government retroactively granted them citizenship.\nFreed slaves.\nThe Act Against Slavery passed in Upper Canada on 9 July 1793. The 1793 \"Act against Slavery\" forbade the importation of any additional slaves and freed children. It did not grant freedom to adult slaves\u2014they were finally freed by the British Parliament in 1833. As a consequence, many Canadian slaves fled south to New England and New York, where slavery was no longer legal. Many American slaves who had escaped from the South via the Underground Railroad or fleeing from the Black Codes in the Ohio Valley came north to Ontario, a good portion settling on land lots and began farming. It is estimated that thousands of escaped slaves entered Upper Canada from the United States.\nBritish.\nThe Great Migration from Britain from 1815 to 1850 has been numbered at 800,000. The population of Upper Canada in 1837 is documented at 409,000. Given the lack of detailed census data, it is difficult to assess the relative size of the American and Canadian born \"British\" and the foreign-born \"British.\" By the time of the first census in 1841, only half of the population of Upper Canada were foreign-born British.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChurch of England.\nThe first Lt. Governor, Sir John Graves Simcoe, sought to make the Church of England the Established Church of the province. To that end, he created the clergy reserves, the revenues of which were to support the church. The clergy reserves proved to be a long-term political issue, as other denominations, particularly the Church of Scotland (Presbyterians) sought a proportional share of the revenues. The Church of England was never numerically dominant in the province, as it was in England, especially in the early years when most of the American born Later Loyalists arrived. The growth of the Church of England depended largely on later British emigration for growth.\nThe Church was led by the Rev. John Strachan (1778\u20131867), a pillar of the Family Compact. Strachan was part of the oligarchic ruling class of the province, and besides leading the Church of England, also sat on the Executive Council, the Legislative Council, helped found the Bank of Upper Canada, Upper Canada College, and the University of Toronto.\nCatholic Church.\nFather Alexander Macdonell was a Scottish Catholic priest who formed his evicted clan into The Glengarry Fencibles regiment, of which he was chaplain. He was the first Catholic chaplain in the British Army since the Reformation. When the regiment was disbanded, Rev. Macdonell appealed to the government to grant its members a tract of land in Canada, and, in 1804, were provided in what is now Glengarry County, Canada.\nIn 1815, he began his service as the first Roman Catholic Bishop at St. Raphael's Church in the Highlands of Ontario. In 1819, he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Upper Canada, which in 1826 was erected into a suffragan bishopric of the Archdiocese of Quebec. In 1826, he was appointed to the legislative council.\nMacdonell's role on the Legislative Council was one of the tensions with the Toronto congregation, led by Father William O'Grady. O'Grady, like Macdonell, had been an army chaplain (to Connell James Baldwin's soldiers in Brazil). O'Grady followed Baldwin to Toronto Gore Township in 1828. From January 1829 he was pastor of St. Paul's church in York. Tensions between the Scottish and Irish came to a head when O'Grady was defrocked, in part for his activities in the Reform movement. He went on to edit a Reform newspaper in Toronto, the \"Canadian Correspondent\".\nRyerson and the Methodists.\nThe undisputed leader of the highly fractious Methodists in Upper Canada was Egerton Ryerson, editor of their newspaper, \"The Christian Guardian\". Ryerson (1803\u20131882) was an itinerant minister\u00a0\u2013 or circuit rider\u00a0\u2013 in the Niagara area for the Methodist Episcopal Church\u00a0\u2013 an American branch of Methodism. As British immigration increased, Methodism in Upper Canada was torn between those with ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church and the British Wesleyan Methodists. Ryerson used the \"Christian Guardian\" to argue for the rights of Methodists in the province and, later, to help convince rank-and-file Methodists that a merger with British Wesleyans (effected in 1833) was in their best interest.\nPresbyterians.\nThe earliest Presbyterian ministers in Upper Canada came from various denominations based in Scotland, Ireland, and the United States. The \"Presbytery of the Canadas\" was formed in 1818 primarily by Scottish Associate Presbyterian missionaries, yet independently of their mother denomination in the hope of including Presbyterian ministers of all stripes in Upper and Lower Canada. Although successfully including members from Irish Associate, and American Presbyterian and Reformed denominations, the growing group of missionaries belonging to the Church of Scotland remained separate. Instead, in 1831, they formed their own \"Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in Connection with the Established Church of Scotland\". That same year the \"Presbytery of the Canadas\", having grown and been re-organized, became the \"United Synod of Upper Canada\". In its continued pursuit for Presbyterian unity (and a share of government funding from the clergy reserves for established churches) the United Synod sought a union with the Church of Scotland synod which it finally joined in 1840. However, some ministers had left the United Synod prior to this merger (including, notably, Rev. James Harris, Rev. William Jenkins, and Rev. Daniel Eastman). In the 1832 new Secessionist missionaries began to arrive, belonging to \"The United Associate Synod in Scotland\" (after 1847, the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland). Committed to the voluntarist principle of rejecting government funding they decided against joining the \"United Synod of Upper Canada\" and on Christmas Day 1834 formed the \"Missionary Presbytery of the Canadas\". Although this new presbytery was formed at Rev. James Harris's church in Toronto, he and his congregation remained independent from it. However, the voluntarist, Rev. Jenkins and his congregation in Richmond Hill joined the Missionary Presbytery a few years later. Rev. Eastman had left the United Synod in 1833 to form the \"Niagara Presbytery\" of the Presbyterian Church in the USA. After this presbytery dissolved following the Rebellion of 1837, he rejoined the United Synod which then joined the Church of Scotland. Outside of these four Presbyterian denominations, only two others gained a foothold in the province. The small \"Stamford Presbytery\" of the American Secessionist tradition was formed in 1835 in the Niagara region, and the Scottish Reformed Presbyterian or \"Covenanter\" tradition was represented in the province to an even lesser extent. Despite the numerous denominations, by the late 1830s, the Church of Scotland was the main expression of Presbyterianism in Upper Canada.\nMennonites, Tunkers, Quakers, and Children of Peace.\nThese groups of later Loyalists were proportionately larger in the early decades of the province's settlement. The Mennonites, Tunkers, Quakers and Children of Peace are the traditional Peace churches. The Mennonites and Tunkers were generally German-speaking and immigrated as Later Loyalists from Pennsylvania. Many of their descendants continue to speak a form of German called Pennsylvania Dutch. The Quakers (Society of Friends) immigrated from New York, the New England States and Pennsylvania. The Children of Peace were founded during the War of 1812 after a schism in the Society of Friends in York County. A further schism occurred in 1828, leaving two branches, \"Orthodox\" Quakers and \"Hicksite\" Quakers.\nPoverty.\nIn the decade ending in 1837, the population of Upper Canada doubled, to 397,489, fed in large part by erratic spurts of displaced paupers, the \"surplus population\" of the British Isles. Historian Rainer Baehre estimated that between 1831 and 1835 a bare minimum of one-fifth of all emigrants to the province arrived totally destitute, forwarded by their parishes in the United Kingdom. The pauper immigrants arriving in Toronto were the excess agricultural workers and artisans whose growing ranks sent the cost of parish-based poor relief in England spiralling; a financial crisis that generated frenetic public debate and the overhaul of the Poor Laws in 1834. \"Assisted emigration\", a second solution to the problem touted by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Colonial Office, Robert Wilmot Horton, would remove them permanently from the parish poor rolls.\nThe roots of Wilmot-Horton's \"assisted emigration\" policies began in April 1820, in the middle of an insurrection in Glasgow, where a young, already twice bankrupted William Lyon Mackenzie was setting sail for Canada on a ship called Psyche. After the week-long violence, the rebellion was easily crushed; the participants were driven less by treason than distress. In a city of 147,000 people without a regular parish system of poor relief, between ten and fifteen thousand were destitute. The Prime Minister agreed to provide free transportation from Quebec to Upper Canada, a land grant, and a year's supply of provisions to any of the rebellious weavers who could pay their own way to Quebec. In all, in 1820 and 1821, a private charity helped 2,716 Lanarkshire and Glasgow emigrants to Upper Canada to take up their free grants, primarily in the Peterborough area. A second project was the Petworth Emigration Committee organized by Thomas Sockett, who chartered ships and sent emigrants from England to Canada in each of the six years between 1832 and 1837. This area in the south of England was terrorized by the Captain Swing Riots, a series of clandestine attacks on large farmers who refused relief to unemployed agricultural workers. The area hardest hit\u00a0\u2013 Kent\u00a0\u2013 was the area where Sir Francis Bond Head, later Lt. Governor of Upper Canada in 1836, was the Assistant Poor Law Commissioner. One of his jobs was to force the unemployed into \"Houses of Industry.\"\nTrade, monetary policy, and financial institutions.\nCorporations.\nThere were two types of corporate actors at work in the Upper Canadian economy: the legislatively chartered companies and the unregulated joint-stock companies. The joint stock company was popular in building public works, since it should be for general public benefit, as the benefit would otherwise be sacrificed to legislated monopolies with exclusive privileges, or lie dormant. An example of the legislated monopoly is found in the Bank of Upper Canada. However, the benefit of the joint-stock shareholders, as the risk takers, was whole and entire; and the general public benefitted only indirectly. As late as 1849, even the moderate reform politician Robert Baldwin was to complain that \"unless a stop were made to it, there would be nothing but corporations from one end of the country to the other.\" Radical reformers, like William Lyon Mackenzie, who opposed all \"legislated monopolies,\" saw joint stock associations as the only protection against \"the whole property of the country... being tied up as an irredeemable appendage to incorporated institutions, and put beyond the reach of individual possession.\" As a result, most of the joint-stock companies formed in this period were created by political reformers who objected to the legislated monopolies granted to members of the Family Compact.\nCurrency and banking.\nCurrency.\nThe government of Upper Canada never issued a provincial currency. A variety of coins, mainly of French, Spanish, English and American origin circulated. The government used the Halifax standard, where one pound Halifax equalled four Spanish dollars. One pound sterling equalled \u00a31 2s 2\u00bed (until 1820), and \u00a31 2s 6\u00bdd Halifax pounds after 1820.\nPaper currency was issued primarily by the Bank of Upper Canada, although with the diversification of the banking system, each bank would issue its own distinctive notes.\nBank of Upper Canada.\nThe Bank of Upper Canada was \"captured\" from Kingston merchants by the York elite at the instigation of John Strachan in 1821, with the assistance of William Allan, a Toronto merchant and Executive Councillor. York was too small to warrant such an institution as indicated by the inability of its promoters to raise even the minimal 10% of the \u00a3200,000 authorized capital required for start-up. It succeeded where the Bank of Kingston had failed only because it had the political influence to have this minimum reduced by half, and because the provincial government subscribed for two thousand of its eight thousand shares. The administration appointed four of the bank's fifteen directors that, as with the Clergy Corporation, made for a tight bond between the nominally private company and the state. Forty-four men served as bank directors during the 1830s; eleven of them were executive councillors, fifteen of them were legislative councillors, and thirteen were magistrates in Toronto. More importantly, all 11 men who had ever sat on the Executive Council also sat on the board of the Bank at one time or another. 10 of these men also sat on the Legislative Council. The overlapping membership on the boards of the Bank of Upper Canada and on the Executive and Legislative Councils served to integrate the economic and political activities of church, state, and the \"financial sector.\" These overlapping memberships reinforced the oligarchic nature of power in the colony and allowed the administration to operate without any effective elective check. The Bank of Upper Canada was a political sore point for the Reformers throughout the 1830s.\nBank wars: the Scottish joint-stock banks.\nThe difference between the chartered banks and the joint-stock banks lay almost entirely on the issue of liability and its implications for the issuance of bank notes. The joint-stock banks lacked limited liability, hence every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank's debts to the full extent of their personal property. The formation of new joint-stock banks blossomed in 1835 in the aftermath of a parliamentary report by Dr Charles Duncombe, which established their legality here. Duncombe's report drew in large part on an increasingly dominant banking orthodoxy in the United Kingdom which challenged the English system of chartered banks. Duncombe's Select Committee on Currency offered a template for the creation of joint-stock banks based on several successful British banks. Within weeks two Devonshire businessmen, Capt. George Truscott and John Cleveland Green, established the \"Farmer's Bank\" in Toronto. The only other successful bank established under this law was \"The Bank of the People\" which was set up by Toronto's Reformers. The Bank of the People provided the loan that allowed William Lyon Mackenzie to establish the newspaper The Constitution in 1836 in the lead up to the Rebellion of 1837. Mackenzie wrote at the time: \"Archdeacon Strachan's bank (the old one)\u00a0... serve the double purpose of keeping the merchants in chains of debt and bonds to the bank manager, and the Farmer's acres under the harrow of the storekeeper. You will be shewn how to break this degraded yoke of mortgages, ejectments, judgments and bonds. Money bound you \u2013 money shall loose you\". During the financial panic of 1836, the Family Compact sought to protect its interests in the nearly bankrupt Bank of Upper Canada by making joint-stock banks illegal.\nTrade.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, as industrial production in Britain took off, English manufacturers began dumping cheap goods in Montreal; this allowed an increasing number of shopkeepers in York to obtain their goods competitively from Montreal wholesalers. It was during this period that the three largest pre-war merchants who imported directly from Britain retired from business as a result; Quetton St. George in 1815, Alexander Wood in 1821, and William Allan in 1822. Toronto and Kingston then underwent a boom in the number of increasingly specialized shops and wholesalers. The Toronto wholesale firm of Isaac Buchanan and Company were one of the largest of the new wholesalers. Isaac Buchanan was a Scots merchant in Toronto, in partnership with his brother Peter, who remained in Glasgow to manage the British end of the firm. They established their business in Toronto in 1835, having bought out Isaac's previous partners, William Guild and Co., who had established themselves in Toronto in 1832. As a wholesale firm, the Buchanan's had invested more than \u00a310,000 in their business.\nAnother of those new wholesale businesses was the Farmers' Storehouse Company. The Farmers Storehouse Company was formed in the Home District and is probably Canada's first Farmers' Cooperative. The Storehouse expedited the sale of farmer's wheat to Montreal, and provided them with cheaper consumer goods.\nWheat and grains.\nUpper Canada was in the unenviable position of having few exports with which to pay for all its imported manufactured needs. For the vast majority of those who settled in rural areas, debt could be paid off only through the sale of wheat and flour; yet, throughout much of the 1820s, the price of wheat went through periodic cycles of boom and bust depending upon the British markets that ultimately provided the credit upon which the farmer lived.\nIn the decade 1830\u201339, exports of wheat averaged less than \u00a31 per person a year (less than \u00a36 per household), and in the 1820s just half that.\nGiven the small amounts of saleable wheat and flour, and the rarity of cash, some have questioned how market oriented these early farmers were. Instead of depending on the market to meet their needs, many of these farmers depended on networks of shared resources and cooperative marketing. For example, rather than hire labour, they met their labour needs through \"work bees.\" such farmers are said to be 'subsistence oriented' and not to respond to market cues; rather, they engage in a moral economy seeking 'subsistence insurance' and a 'just price'. The Children of Peace in the village of Hope (now Sharon) are a well documented example. They were the most prosperous agricultural community in Canada West by 1851.\nTimber.\nThe Ottawa River timber trade resulted from Napoleon's 1806 Continental Blockade in Europe. The United Kingdom required a new source of timber for its navy and shipbuilding. Later the UK's application of gradually increasing preferential tariffs increased Canadian imports. The trade in squared timber lasted until the 1850s. The transportation of raw timber by means of floating down the Ottawa River was proved possible in 1806 by Philemon Wright. Squared timber would be assembled into large rafts which held living quarters for men on their six-week journey to Quebec City, which had large exporting facilities and easy access to the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe timber trade was Upper and Lower Canada's major industry in terms of employment and value of the product. The largest supplier of square red and white pine to the British market was the Ottawa River and the Ottawa Valley. They had \"rich red and white pine forests.\" Bytown (later called Ottawa), was a major lumber and sawmill centre of Canada.\nTransportation and communications.\nCanal system.\nThe early nineteenth century was the age of canals. The Erie Canal, stretching from Buffalo to Albany, New York, threatened to divert all of the grain and other trade on the upper Great Lakes through the Hudson River to New York city after its completion in 1825. Upper Canadians sought to build a similar system that would tie this trade to the St Lawrence River and Montreal.\nRideau Canal.\nThe Rideau Canal's purpose was military and hence was paid for by the British and not the local treasury. It was intended to provide a secure supply and communications route between Montreal and the British naval base in Kingston. The objective was to bypass the St. Lawrence River bordering New York; a route which would have left British supply ships vulnerable to an attack. Westward from Montreal, travel would proceed along the Ottawa River to Bytown (now Ottawa), then southwest via the canal to Kingston and out into Lake Ontario. Because the Rideau Canal was easier to navigate than the St. Lawrence River due to the series of rapids between Montreal and Kingston, it became a busy commercial artery from Montreal to the Great Lakes. The construction of the canal was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel John By of the Royal Engineers. The work started in 1826, and was completed 6 years later in 1832 at a cost of \u00a3822,000.\nWelland Canal.\nThe Welland Canal was created to directly link Lake Erie with Lake Ontario, bypassing Niagara Falls and the Erie Canal. It was the idea of William Hamilton Merritt who owned a sawmill, grist mill and store on the Twelve Mile Creek. The Legislature authorized the joint-stock Welland Canal Company on 19 January 1824, with a capitalization of $150,000, and Merritt as the agent. The canal was officially opened exactly five years later on 30 November 1829. However, the original route to Lake Erie followed the Welland and Niagara Rivers and was difficult and slow to navigate. The Welland Canal Company obtained a loan of 50,000 pounds from the province of Upper Canada in March 1831 to cut a canal directly to Gravelly Bay (now Port Colborne) as the new Lake Erie terminus for the canal.\nBy the time the canal was finished in 1837, it had cost the province \u00a3425,000 in loans and stock subscriptions. The company was supposed to have been a private one using private capital; but the province had little private capital available, hence most of the original funds came from New York. To keep the canal in Upper Canadian hands, the province had passed a law barring Americans from the company's directorate. The company was thus controlled by the Family Compact, even though they had few shares. By 1834, it was clear the canal would never make money and that the province would be on the hook for the large loans; the canal and the canal company thus became a political issue, as local farmers argued the huge expense would ultimately only benefit American farmers in the west and the merchants who transported their grain.\nDesjardins Canal.\nThe Desjardins Canal, named after its promoter Pierre Desjardins, was built to give Dundas, Ontario, easier access to Burlington Bay and Lake Ontario. Access to Lake Ontario from Dundas was made difficult by the topography of the area, which included a natural sand and gravel barrier, across Burlington Bay which allowed only boats with a shallow draft through. In 1823 a canal was dug through the sandbar. In 1826 the passage was completed, allowing schooners to sail to neighbouring Hamilton. Hamilton then became a major port and quickly expanded as a centre of trade and commerce. In 1826 a group of Dundas businessmen incorporated to compete with Hamilton and increase the value of their real estate holdings. The project to build Desjardins Canal continued for ten years, from 1827 to 1837, and required constant infusions of money from the province. In 1837, the year it opened, the company's income was \u00a36,000, of which \u00a35,000 was from a government loan and \u00a3166 was received from canal tolls.\nLake traffic: steamships.\nThere is disagreement as to whether the Canadian-built (), launched on 7 September 1816, at Ernestown, Ontario or the US-built \"Ontario\" (), launched in the spring of 1817 at Sacketts Harbor, New York, was the first steamboat on the Great Lakes. While \"Frontenac\" was launched first, \"Ontario\" began active service first. The first steamboat on the upper Great Lakes was the passenger-carrying \"Walk-In-The-Water\", built in 1818 to navigate Lake Erie.\nIn the years between 1809 and 1837 just over 100 steamboats were launched by Upper and Lower Canadians for the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes trade, of which ten operated on Lake Ontario. The single largest engine foundry in British North America before 1838 was the Eagle Foundry of Montreal, founded by John Dod Ward in the fall of 1819 which manufactured 33 of the steam engines. The largest Upper Canadian engine manufacturer was Sheldon &amp; Dutcher of Toronto, who made three engines in the 1830s before being driven to Bankruptcy by the Bank of Upper Canada in 1837.\nThe major owner-operators of steamships on Lake Ontario were Donald Bethune, John Hamilton, Hugh Richardson, and Henry Gildersleeve, each of whom would have invested a substantial fortune.\nRoads.\nBesides marine travel, Upper Canada had a few Post roads or footpaths used for transportation by horse or stagecoaches along the key settlements between London to Kingston.\nThe Governor's Road was built beginning in 1793 from Dundas to Paris and then to the proposed capital of London by 1794. The road was further extended eastward with new capital of York in 1795. his road was eventually known as Dundas Road.\nA second route was known as Lakeshore Road or York Road which was built from York to Trent River from 1799 to 1900 and later extended eastwards to Kingston in 1817. This road was later renamed as Kingston Road.\nUnited States relations.\nWar of 1812 (1812\u20131815).\nDuring the War of 1812 with the United States, Upper Canada was the chief target of the Americans, since it was weakly defended and populated largely by American immigrants. However, division in the United States over the war, a lackluster American militia, the incompetence of American military commanders, and swift and decisive action by the British commander, Sir Isaac Brock, kept Upper Canada part of British North America.\nDetroit was captured by the British on 6 August 1812. The Michigan Territory was held under British control until it was abandoned in 1813. The Americans won the decisive Battle of Lake Erie (10 September 1813) and forced the British to retreat from the western areas. On the retreat they were intercepted at the Battle of the Thames (5 October 1813) and destroyed in a major American victory that killed Tecumseh and broke the power of Britain's Indian allies.\nMajor battles fought on territory in Upper Canada included:\nMany other battles were fought in American territory bordering Upper Canada, including the Northwest Territory (most in modern-day Michigan), upstate New York and naval battles in the Great Lakes.\nThe Treaty of Ghent (ratified in 1815) ended the war and restored the status quo ante bellum.\n1837 Rebellion and Patriot War.\nMackenzie, Duncombe, John Rolph and 200 supporters fled to Navy Island in the Niagara River, where they declared themselves the Republic of Canada on 13 December. They obtained supplies from supporters in the United States, resulting in British reprisals (see Caroline affair). This incident has been used to establish the principle of \"anticipatory self-defense\" in international politics, which holds that it may be justified only in cases in which the \"necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation\". This formulation is part of the \"Caroline\" test. The \"Caroline\" affair is also now invoked frequently in the course of the dispute around preemptive strike (or preemption doctrine).\nOn 13 January 1838, under attack by British armaments, the rebels fled. Mackenzie went to the United States where he was arrested and charged under the Neutrality Act. The Neutrality Act of 1794 made it illegal for an American to wage war against any country at peace with the United States. Application of the Neutrality Act during the Patriot War led to the largest use of US government military force against its own citizens since the Whiskey Rebellion.\nThe extended series of incidents comprising the Patriot War were finally settled by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster and Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton, in the course of their negotiations leading to the Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty of 1842.\nEducation.\nIn 1807, the Grammar School Act allowed the government to take over various grammar schools across the province and incorporating them into a network of eight new, public grammar schools (secondary schools), one for each of the eight districts (Eastern, Johnstown, Midland, Newcastle, Home, Niagara, London, and Western):\nCanada West.\nCanada West was the western portion of the United Province of Canada from 10 February 1841, to 1 July 1867. Its boundaries were identical to those of the former province of Upper Canada. Lower Canada would also become Canada East.\nThe area was named the province of Ontario under the British North America Act 1867.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, with a foreword by Grady Booch. The book is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters describing 23 classic software design patterns. The book includes examples in C++ and Smalltalk.\nIt has been influential to the field of software engineering and is regarded as an important source for object-oriented design theory and practice. More than 500,000 copies have been sold in English and in 13 other languages. The authors are often referred to as the \"Gang of Four\" (GoF).\nDevelopment and publication history.\nThe book started at a birds-of-a-feather session at the 1990 OOPSLA meeting, \"Towards an Architecture Handbook\", where Erich Gamma and Richard Helm met and discovered their common interest. They were later joined by Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides. The book was originally published on 21 October 1994, with a 1995 copyright, and was made available to the public at the 1994 OOPSLA meeting.\nIntroduction.\nChapter 1 is a discussion of object-oriented design techniques, based on the authors' experience, which they believe would lead to good object-oriented software design, including:\nThe authors claim the following as advantages of interfaces over implementation:\nUse of an interface also leads to dynamic binding and polymorphism, which are central features of object-oriented programming.\nThe authors refer to inheritance as \"white-box reuse\", with white-box referring to visibility, because the internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses. In contrast, the authors refer to object composition (in which objects with well-defined interfaces are used dynamically at runtime by objects obtaining references to other objects) as \"black-box reuse\" because no internal details of composed objects need be visible in the code using them.\nThe authors discuss the tension between inheritance and encapsulation at length and state that in their experience, designers overuse inheritance (Gang of Four 1995:20). The danger is stated as follows:\n\"Because inheritance exposes a subclass to details of its parent's implementation, it's often said that 'inheritance breaks encapsulation'\". (Gang of Four 1995:19)\nThey warn that the implementation of a subclass can become so bound up with the implementation of its parent class that any change in the parent's implementation will force the subclass to change. Furthermore, they claim that a way to avoid this is to inherit only from abstract classes\u2014but then, they point out that there is minimal code reuse.\nUsing inheritance is recommended mainly when adding to the functionality of existing components, reusing most of the old code and adding relatively small amounts of new code.\nTo the authors, 'delegation' is an extreme form of object composition that can always be used to replace inheritance. Delegation involves two objects: a 'sender' passes itself to a 'delegate' to let the delegate refer to the sender. Thus the link between two parts of a system are established only at runtime, not at compile-time. The Callback article has more information about delegation.\nThe authors also discuss so-called parameterized types, which are also known as generics (Ada, Eiffel, Java, C#, Visual Basic (.NET), and Delphi) or templates (C++). These allow any type to be defined without specifying all the other types it uses\u2014the unspecified types are supplied as 'parameters' at the point of use.\nThe authors admit that delegation and parameterization are very powerful but add a warning:\n\"Dynamic, highly parameterized software is harder to understand and build than more static software.\" (Gang of Four 1995:21)\nThe authors further distinguish between 'Aggregation', where one object 'has' or 'is part of' another object (implying that an aggregate object and its owner have identical lifetimes) and acquaintance, where one object merely 'knows of' another object. Sometimes acquaintance is called 'association' or the 'using' relationship. Acquaintance objects may request operations of each other, but they are not responsible for each other. Acquaintance is a weaker relationship than aggregation and suggests much looser coupling between objects, which can often be desirable for maximum maintainability in designs.\nThe authors employ the term 'toolkit' where others might today use 'class library', as in C# or Java. In their parlance, toolkits are the object-oriented equivalent of subroutine libraries, whereas a 'framework' is a set of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design for a specific class of software. They state that applications are hard to design, toolkits are harder, and frameworks are the hardest to design.\nPatterns by type.\nCreational.\nCreational patterns are ones that create objects, rather than having to instantiate objects directly.

A primary criticism of \"Design Patterns\" is that its patterns are simply workarounds for missing features in C++, replacing elegant abstract features with lengthy concrete patterns, essentially becoming a \"human compiler\".

Related observations were made by Hannemann and Kiczales who implemented several of the 23 design patterns using an aspect-oriented programming language (AspectJ) and showed that code-level dependencies were removed from the implementations of 17 of the 23 design patterns and that aspect-oriented programming could simplify the implementations of design patterns.\nIn an interview with InformIT in 2009, Erich Gamma stated that the book authors had a discussion in 2005 on how they would have refactored the book and concluded that they would have recategorized some patterns and added a few additional ones, such as extension object/interface, dependency injection, type object, and null object.

They were to be slower but larger, better armored, and with superior firepower. Five were approved for construction during World War II, but changes in wartime building priorities resulted in their cancellation in favor of continuing production of s and \"Iowa\"-class battleships before any \"Montana\"-class keels were laid.\nTheir intended armament would have been twelve Mark 7 guns in four 3-gun turrets, up from the nine Mark 7 guns in three turrets used by the \"Iowa\" class. Unlike the three preceding classes of battleships, the \"Montana\" class was designed without any restrictions from treaty limitations. With increased anti-aircraft capability and substantially thicker armor in all areas, the \"Montana\"s would have been the largest, best-protected, and most heavily armed US battleships ever, and the only ones to rival the Empire of Japan's s in terms of displacement.\nPreliminary design work for the \"Montana\" class began before the US entry into World War II. The first two vessels were approved by Congress in 1939 following the passage of the Naval Act of 1938. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor delayed the construction of the \"Montana\"-class. The success of carrier combat at the Battle of the Coral Sea and, to a greater extent, the Battle of Midway, diminished the perceived value of the battleship. Consequently, the US Navy chose to cancel the \"Montana\"-class in favor of more urgently needed aircraft carriers as well as amphibious and anti-submarine vessels.\nBackground.\nDuring the interwar period, the US Navy was primarily concerned with its rival in the Pacific Ocean, the Imperial Japanese Navy. The international naval arms limitation system initiated by the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 had accorded the US Navy superiority over Japan in terms of total tonnage. After the ten-year construction moratorium that had been imposed by the Washington Treaty expired, the US Navy began building the fast battleships in 1937 to replace old pre-World War I ships that were by then obsolescent. But by the late 1930s, the Washington system, which had been extended by the First and Second London Naval Treaties, had begun to break down after Japan refused to sign the Second London Treaty in 1936. This prompted the other major naval powers to begin rearmament programs, beginning in the United States with the battleships in 1938. Funding for the first two new ships was provided in Fiscal Year 1937, though work would not commence until 1939.\nThe Second Vinson Act of 1938 added two more \"South Dakota\"s; it also authorized the construction of two more battleships yet to be designed. The US Navy had already begun design work on the successors to the \"South Dakota\"s in 1937, which was to become the ; the Navy sought larger, faster ships that would handily exceed the limit on battleship displacement imposed under the Washington Treaty system. Because Japan had already refused to abide by the terms of the Second London Naval Treaty, the other major naval powers moved to loosen the restrictions on their own new battleship designs. On 31 March 1938, the US, Britain, and France exchanged notes indicating that they would accept increasing the displacement limit to .\nAs the US Navy's designers worked on proposals for the new ships, two distinct strains emerged: a comparatively slow, heavily armed and armored variant and a much faster, but lighter-armed and armored vessel that was primarily intended to catch Japanese cruisers and counter the fast s. The latter type, which eventually emerged essentially as an improved \"South Dakota\", was capable of a speed of , but work on the former proceeded at the same time. The General Board intended it to become the next generation of standard-type battleships, which was to be set at 45,000-ton ships armed with twelve guns, and capable of , the same speed as the \"South Dakota\"s.\nBy 1939, it had become apparent to the naval leadership that war was approaching, and so the need for new ships had become pressing. The start of World War II in Europe, and particularly the Fall of France in June 1940 only increased the pressure to speed construction of new warships. The first two ships ordered to the 33-knot improved \"South Dakota\" design\u2014 and \u2014were ordered under the 1939 fiscal year. The passage of the Two-Ocean Navy Act on 19 July 1940 provided significant increases to the Navy's strength, including an increase of some for battleships alone, along with hundreds of thousands of tons for new aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers. Under the 1941 fiscal year program, the third and fourth \"Iowa\"-class battleships were authorized, but in May, two more ships were added to the program. These were to have been built to the next battleship design, but the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, decided that these should be additional \"Iowa\"-class ships to speed up production.\nDesign.\nInitial design work.\nThough the 33-knot design had been chosen for \"Iowa\", it was clear to naval leadership that these would be exceptions to normal Navy doctrine, and that a reversion to the 27-knot standard-type battleship would occur with the next design. The primary consideration for this new class was the development of the super-heavy armor-piercing shell that had been developed during the construction of the \"North Carolina\" class. Standard design practice stated that battleships should be immune to guns of their own calibers at expected battle ranges, but the new super-heavy shell had significantly better penetrating power than older, lighter shells. None of the existing designs, from \"North Carolina\" to \"Iowa\", were proof against the 2,700-pound shell, and the General Board wanted the next design to be better protected. They requested proposals from the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R) that conformed to the 45,000-ton limit, armed with twelve 16-inch guns, and capable of 27-knots.\nC&amp;R initially responded with a design labeled \"BB 65A\", which used \"South Dakota\" as a baseline, but increased the length to accommodate the fourth main battery turret. Displacement was already over the limit at , and the ship was only protected against the earlier AP shell. The design staff estimated that more than would be needed to protect the ship against the heavier shells. A second variant, \"BB 65B\" substituted twelve new /47 guns in place of the existing twenty /38 cal guns for their secondary batteries, but this increased displacement even further. Another pair of designs, \"BB 65C\" and \"65D\", adopted three quadruple main battery turrets instead of four triple turrets, which accounted for some of weight savings. This latter pair mirrored the first set in the use of 5-inch and 6-inch secondaries. All of these designs were only protected against the 2,250\u00a0lb shell, but since \"C\" and \"D\" were below the displacement limit, C&amp;R attempted to use the free weight to strengthen their armor with design \"BB 65E\". They realized that though the deck could be improved to provide a relatively narrow zone of immunity against plunging fire, strengthening the belt armor to protect against the heavier shell would increase displacement to as much as .\nNone of the initial proposals was deemed acceptable, and there were concerns about the feasibility of the quadruple turrets. Other guns were suggested, ranging from guns to experimental 16-inch/56 caliber guns. C&amp;R provided another series of studies beginning with \"65F\". Several of these proposals experimented with mixed quadruple, triple, and double turrets for either ten or eleven guns to save weight but still increase firepower over the nine-gun \"South Dakota\"s. One proposal, \"65J\", suggested adopting a twelve-gun ship that would be well-protected against the 2,700\u00a0lb AP shell. The 18-inch gun was ruled out after a design study demonstrated that only six of the guns could be mounted within the 45,000-ton displacement limit. By September 1939, one of the ten-gun variants had been selected, which carried two triple-turrets forward and a quadruple turret aft.\nWartime designs.\nThe outbreak of World War II in September 1939 radically altered the constraints imposed on C&amp;R. The remaining limits imposed by the Washington and London treaties were now removed entirely; the new ship would only be limited by logistical restrictions of existing naval infrastructure, most significantly the Panama Canal and available dry docks. The Navy had been pushing for a third, wider set of locks for the Panama Canal since 1938, which was approved in 1940. Nevertheless, some limitations still existed; the length and height of the BB65 designs had to take into account one of the shipyards at which they were to be built: the New York Navy Yard slipways could not handle the construction of a ship more than , and vessels built there had to be low enough to clear the Brooklyn Bridge at low tide. Consequently, the yard's number 4 dry dock had to be enlarged and the ships would be floated out rather than conventionally launched. In October, the General Board asked for new twelve-gun designs that were sufficiently armored, which was estimated could be accomplished on a displacement of around . The Preliminary Design department at C&amp;R responded with a design in mid-January 1940 that largely met the General Board's requirements, but displacement was set at . An option to replace the standard 5-inch/38 secondaries with longer-barrel 5-inch/54 guns would add about to the ships.\nDuring a meeting on 16 February 1940, the Board requested a new series of proposals. These included a modified version of the nine-gun \"Iowa\" design that was two knots slower but better protected, an enlarged \"Iowa\" variant that maintained the 33-knot speed but displaced , and several twelve-gun designs that had speeds ranging from 28 to 33 knots. These were given designations from \"BB 65-1\" to \"BB 65-8\". Displacement on these proposals increased to as much as . All of these designs were armed with the 16-inch/50 gun, and were well protected against the super-heavy shell. During discussions in March, the decision was made to revert to externally applied belt armor, since the internal armor belts of the \"South Dakota\" and \"Iowa\" classes were more difficult to install and repair in the event of battle damage, and the weight savings associated with them no longer mattered now that displacement limits were gone. Two additional designs were produced in June: 65-9 and 65-10, which were 28-knot ships.\nBy July, Navy's senior leadership still could not agree on design priorities, and disagreed sharply on points ranging from top speed to the cost and logistical challenges of the larger designs. The Board requested another round of design studies from Preliminary Design, which responded with nine-, ten-, and twelve-gun ships that, again, included slow and fast variants. The Board finally selected one of the designs, \"BB 65-5A\", which was armed with twelve guns on a displacement of , and capable of 28\u00a0knots. The Board submitted the design to Knox, which he approved on 19 August. The ships were not actually authorized at that point, and design work continued. Because the battleships that would have received the BB-65 and BB-66 hull numbers had been assigned to the \"Iowa\" class, the next design was labeled \"BB 67-1\". This design shortened the hull to at the waterline, likely to keep the length within the limits of the new slipways being built at the Norfolk Navy Yard and the Philadelphia Navy Yard. This variant displacement increased to . Further iterative improvements of the armor layout produced \"BB 67-2\", which had a slightly reduced displacement of . This version incorporated an internal lower belt that provided additional protection against underwater shell hits.\nDetail work on the design continued well into 1941, which included replacing the original battery of light anti-aircraft guns, which were to be the ineffective guns with Bofors guns. The searchlights were rearranged, the navigational rangefinders were removed, and the waterline hull length was increased slightly to . Displacement was increased slightly, to , while the designers discovered that the propulsion system could be reduced in power, from , which allowed smaller and lighter propulsion machinery. These changes provided further savings in weight that allowed the bomb deck to be extended further aft, and improvements to the light anti-aircraft battery. Protection of the propulsion shafts also changed from an extension of the belt and main armored deck aft of the citadel to armored tubes around the shafts, with the steering gears becoming its own armored compartment. This design was immune to the super-heavy shells when fired at ranges between ; their resistance to standard 16-inch AP shells extended to . The final version of the design, dated March 1941, was designated \"BB 67-4\".\nConstruction and cancellation.\nThe General Board planned to build four ships to the new design, which would have constituted a single battleship division, but five were authorized by the Two-Ocean Navy Act on 19 July 1940. Work was intended to begin later that year, but shortages of the necessary steel caused delays. Work on the new locks for the Panama Canal was also halted in 1941, also owing to a shortage of steel due to the changing strategic and material priorities. The final contract design was issued in June 1942. Construction was authorized by the United States Congress and the projected date of completion was estimated to be somewhere between 1 July and 1 November 1945.\nIn October 1942, work on the ships was again delayed by the order of some eighty destroyers, which were badly needed for the Battle of the Atlantic against German U-boats that were raiding the supply convoys to Britain. Additional work on the design continued into 1942, including detail work on the anti-aircraft batteries to be carried. The Bureau of Ships suggested the armor decks could be increased in thickness, but these changes were not pursued. All five ships were ultimately cancelled on 21 July 1943, as production priorities had shifted decisively toward aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines. The time spent refining the \"Montana\" design was not entirely a waste, as the arrangement of the propulsion system was modified for the s.\nSpecifications.\nGeneral characteristics.\nAs authorized, the \"Montana\"-class ships (design \"BB 67-4\") would have been long at the waterline and long overall. At the waterline, their beam was to have been , but their maximum beam increased to . The ships were to have had a standard displacement of , with a designed trials displacement of . Full load displacement increased to , and emergency load grew further to . At their standard displacement, the ships would have had a draft of , while at emergency load, the draft increased to . The ships would have had a metacentric height of . Their projected crew was to have amounted to 115\u00a0officers and 2,240\u00a0enlisted men; this grew to 189\u00a0officers and 2,789\u00a0enlisted men while serving as a flagship.\nThe \"Montana\" design shares many characteristics with the previous classes of American fast battleships starting from the \"North Carolina\" class, such as a bulbous bow, a triple bottom under the armored citadel, and twin skegs in which the inner shafts were housed. The \"Montana\"s' overall construction would have made extensive use of welding for joining structural plates and homogeneous armor, which saved weight compared to traditional riveting. Like all of the US interwar designs, the \"Montana\"s would have had a flush main deck that was steeply flared at the bow to reduce the amount of water taken on in heavy seas. The \"Montana\" class would have carried three aircraft for reconnaissance and gunnery spotting. They would have been operated from catapults on the ship's fantail, as was standard for US battleship designs of the period.\nPropulsion.\nThe propulsion plant of the \"Montana\"s would have consisted of eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox two-drum boilers with a steam pressure of and a steam temperature of . The boilers supplied steam to four geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller. The boilers were vented through a pair of funnels placed on the centerline amidships. To meet the high electrical loads anticipated for the ships, the design was to have ten 1,250\u00a0kW ship service turbogenerators (SSTG), providing a total of 12,500\u00a0kW of non-emergency electrical power at 450 volts alternating current. The ships were also to be equipped with two 500\u00a0kW emergency diesel generators.\nThe turbines were rated to produce each, for a total propulsive power of . The propulsion system was intended to produce a design speed of 28 knots at 70,500 tons displacement. The \"Montana\"s were designed to carry of fuel oil and had a nominal range of at . Two semi-balanced rudders were placed behind the two inboard screws. The inboard shafts were housed in skegs, which, while increasing hydrodynamic drag, substantially strengthened the stern structure.\nWhile less powerful than the powerplant used by the \"Iowa\"s, the \"Montana\"'s plant enabled the machinery spaces to be considerably more subdivided, with extensive longitudinal and traverse subdivisions of the boiler and engine rooms. The machinery arrangement was reminiscent of that of the , with the boiler rooms flanking the two central turbine rooms for the inboard shafts, while the turbine rooms for the wing shafts were placed at the after end of the machinery spaces. \"Montana\"'s machinery arrangement combined with increased power would eventually be used on the \"Midway\" class.\nArmament.\nThe primary armament of a \"Montana\"-class battleship would have been twelve /50 caliber Mark 7 guns, which were to be mounted in four three-gun turrets. The turrets were placed in two superfiring pairs, one forward and one aft. The guns fired two types of shells: a armor-piercing shells and high capacity (HC) shells that carried a larger high-explosive bursting charge. The shells had muzzle velocities of and , respectively. Firing AP shells at the maximum elevation of 45\u00a0degrees, the guns could reach targets out to , while the lighter HC shells had a slightly reduced range of . The shells had a flight time in excess of eighty seconds at those distances. At a realistic engagement distance of , the AP shells could penetrate of steel armor. The guns had a rate of fire of two shots per minute, and had a rate of train of four degrees per second. They had to be returned to 5\u00a0degrees elevation for reloading.\nThe secondary armament for the \"Montana\"-class ships was to be twenty /54 cal Mark 16 dual-purpose guns housed in ten two-gun turrets along the superstructure. These guns, designed for the \"Montana\" class, were intended to improve the effective range over the shorter-barreled Mark 12 guns then in service. They fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of and had a maximum range of against surface targets and a maximum ceiling of against aerial targets. The guns had a rate of fire of fifteen shots per minute.\nEach ship would have carried a light anti-aircraft armament of thirty-two Bofors guns and twenty Oerlikon guns. The Bofors guns were to be carried in eight quadruple mounts, while the Oerlikons were to have been mounted individually, although the number of Bofors and Oerlikon mounts would likely have increased considerably had the ships been built. The Bofors guns fired shells at a velocity of , and they had a maximum ceiling of . The Oerlikon guns were supplied with shells, which they fired with a muzzle velocity of .\nArmor.\nAs designed, the \"Montana\"s used the \"all or nothing\" armor philosophy, with most of the armor concentrated on the citadel that includes the machinery spaces, armament, magazines, and command and control facilities. The belt armor would be Class A face-hardened Krupp cemented (K.C.) armor mounted on Special Treatment Steel (STS), inclined at 19 degrees. Below the waterline, the belt tapered to . To protect against potential underwater shell hits, the ships would have a separate Class B homogeneous Krupp-type armor lower belt, by the magazines and by the machinery, that would also have served as one of the torpedo bulkheads, inclined at 10 degrees; this lower belt would taper to 1 inch at the triple bottom and be mounted on STS. The ends of the armored citadel would be closed by Class A traverse bulkheads thick in the front and in the aft.\nThe deck armor would be in three layers: the first consisting of STS laminated on STS for a total of STS weather deck, the second consisting of Class B laminated on STS for a total of , and a third splinter deck. Over the magazines, the splinter deck would be replaced by a STS third deck to protect from spalling. Total armor thickness on the centerline would therefore have been 9.925 in (252\u00a0mm) over the citadel and 10.3 in (262\u00a0mm) thick over the magazines. The outboard section would have had Class B laminated on STS for a total of second deck and a splinter deck. The total thickness for the outboard section of the deck would have been 8.1 in (206\u00a0mm).\nThe main batteries were designed to have very heavy protection, with turret faces having Class B mounted on STS, resulting in thick laminated plate. The turret sides were to have up to Class A and turret roofs would have Class B. The barbettes would have been protected by up to Class A forward and aft, while the conning tower sides would have Class A.\n\"Montana\"'s torpedo protection system design incorporated lessons learned from those of previous US fast battleships, and was to consist of four internal longitudinal torpedo bulkheads behind the outer hull shell plating that would form a multi-layered \"bulge\". Two of the compartments would be liquid loaded in order to disrupt the gas bubble of a torpedo warhead detonation while the bulkheads would elastically deform and absorb the energy. Due to the external armor belt, the geometry of the \"bulge\" was more similar to that of the \"North Carolina\" class rather than that of the \"South Dakota\" and \"Iowa\" classes. The design of the \"Montana\"'s torpedo defense system addressed a potential vulnerability of the \"South Dakota\"-type system, where caisson tests in 1939 showed that extending the main armor belt that tapers to the keel to act as one of the torpedo bulkheads had detrimental flooding effects due to the belt's rigidity. \"South Dakota\"'s and \"Iowa\"'s systems were modified in light of these tests, and \"Iowa\"'s system was also further reinforced. Like on the \"South Dakota\" and \"Iowa\" classes, the two outer compartments would be liquid loaded, while two inner ones be void with the lower Class B armor belt to form the holding bulkhead between them. The greater beam of the \"Montana\"s would allow a higher system depth of compared to of the \"North Carolina\"s.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Garfield", "text": "President of the United States in 1881\nJames Abram Garfield (November 19, 1831\u00a0\u2013 September 19, 1881) was the 20th president of the United States, serving from March 1881 until his death in September that year after being shot in July. A preacher, lawyer, and Civil War general, Garfield served nine terms in the United States House of Representatives and is the only sitting member of the House to be elected president. Before running for the presidency, he had been elected to the U.S. Senate by the Ohio General Assembly\u2014a position he declined when he became president-elect.\nGarfield was born into poverty in a log cabin and grew up in northeastern Ohio. After graduating from Williams College in 1856, he studied law and became an attorney. He was a preacher in the Restoration Movement and president of the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, affiliated with the Disciples. Garfield was elected as a Republican member of the Ohio State Senate in 1859, serving until 1861. He opposed Confederate secession, was a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and fought in the battles of Middle Creek, Shiloh, and Chickamauga. He was elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio's 19th district. Throughout his congressional service, he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator. He initially agreed with Radical Republican views on Reconstruction but later favored a Moderate Republican\u2013aligned approach to civil rights enforcement for freedmen. Garfield's aptitude for mathematics extended to his own proof of the Pythagorean theorem, which he published in 1876.\nAt the 1880 Republican National Convention, delegates chose Garfield, who had not sought the White House, as a compromise presidential nominee on the 36th ballot. In the 1880 presidential election, he conducted a low-key front porch campaign and narrowly defeated the Democratic nominee, Winfield Scott Hancock. Garfield's accomplishments as president included his assertion of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments, a purge of corruption in the Post Office, and his appointment of a Supreme Court justice. He advocated for agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for African Americans. He also proposed substantial civil service reforms, which were passed by Congress in 1883 as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and signed into law by his successor, Chester A. Arthur. Garfield was a member of the intraparty \"Half-Breed\" faction that used the powers of the presidency to defy the powerful \"Stalwart\" Senator Roscoe Conkling from New York. He did this by appointing Blaine faction leader William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York. The ensuing political battle resulted in Robertson's confirmation and the resignations of Conkling and Thomas C. Platt from the Senate.\nOn July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a deluded office seeker. He died on September 19 due to infection caused by his doctors' unsanitary methods in treating the wound. Due to his brief term in office and lack of major changes during his tenure, historians tend to rank Garfield as a below-average president or omit him entirely from rankings, though some view Garfield's potential favorably, praising him for anti-corruption and pro-civil rights stances.\nChildhood and early life.\nJames Abram Garfield was born the youngest of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio. Garfield's ancestor Edward Garfield migrated from Hillmorton, Warwickshire, England, to Massachusetts around 1630. James's father Abram was born in Worcester, New York, and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married. He instead wed her sister Eliza, who was born in New Hampshire. James was named after an earlier son of Eliza and Abram who had died in infancy.\nIn early 1833, Abram and Eliza Garfield joined a Stone-Campbell church, a decision that influenced their youngest son's life. Abram died later that year, and James was raised in poverty in a household led by his strong-willed mother. He was her favorite child and the two remained close for the rest of his life. Eliza remarried in 1842, but soon left her second husband, Warren (or Alfred) Belden, and a scandalous divorce was awarded in 1850. James took his mother's side in the matter and noted Belden's 1880 death with satisfaction in his diary. Garfield also enjoyed his mother's stories about his ancestry, especially those about his Welsh great-great-grandfathers and an ancestor who served as a knight of Caerphilly Castle.\nPoor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by his peers and became sensitive to slights throughout his life; he sought escape through voracious reading. He left home at age 16 in 1847 and was rejected for work on the only ship in port in Cleveland. Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, managing the mules that pulled it. Horatio Alger later used this labor to good effect when he wrote Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.\nAfter six weeks, illness forced Garfield to return home, and during his recuperation, his mother and a local school official secured his promise to forgo canal work for a year of school. In 1848, he began at Geauga Seminary, in nearby Chester Township, Geauga County, Ohio. Garfield later said of his childhood, \"I lament that I was born to poverty, and in this chaos of childhood, seventeen years passed before I caught any inspiration... a precious 17 years when a boy with a father and some wealth might have become fixed in manly ways.\"\nEducation, marriage and early career.\nGarfield attended Geauga Seminary from 1848 to 1850 and learned academic subjects for which he had not previously had time. He excelled as a student and was especially interested in languages and elocution. He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience, writing that the speaker's platform \"creates some excitement. I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error.\" Geauga was coeducational, and Garfield was attracted to one of his classmates, Lucretia Rudolph, whom he later married. To support himself at Geauga, he worked as a carpenter's assistant and teacher. The need to go from town to town to find work as a teacher aggravated Garfield, and he developed a dislike of what he called \"place-seeking\", which became, he said, \"the law of my life.\" In later years, he astounded his friends by disregarding positions that could have been his with little politicking. Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God, but in his late teens he underwent a religious awakening. He attended many camp meetings, which led to his being born again on March 4, 1850, when he was baptized into Christ by being submerged in the icy waters of the Chagrin River.\nAfter he left Geauga, Garfield worked for a year at various jobs, including teaching jobs. Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college, Garfield determined to do the same and sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later named Hiram College) in Hiram, Ohio, a school founded by and still affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). While there, he was most interested in the study of Greek and Latin but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered. Securing a position on entry as janitor, he obtained a teaching position while he was still a student there. Lucretia Rudolph also enrolled at the Institute and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek. He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches and, in some cases, earned one gold dollar per service. By 1854, Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full-time teacher. Garfield then enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, as a third-year student; he received credit for two years' study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination. Garfield was also impressed with the college president, Mark Hopkins, who had responded warmly to Garfield's letter inquiring about admission. He said of Hopkins, \"The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other.\" Hopkins later said of Garfield in his student days, \"There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject. There was no pretense of genius, or alternation of spasmodic effort, but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions.\" After his first term, Garfield was hired to teach penmanship to the students of nearby Pownal, Vermont, a post Chester A. Arthur previously held.\nGarfield graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Williams in August 1856, was named salutatorian, and spoke at the commencement. His biographer Ira Rutkow writes that Garfield's years at Williams gave him the opportunity to know and respect those of different social backgrounds, and that, despite his origin as an unsophisticated Westerner, socially conscious New Englanders liked and respected him. \"In short,\" Rutkow writes, \"Garfield had an extensive and positive first experience with the world outside the Western Reserve of Ohio.\"\nUpon his return to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern college made Garfield a man of distinction. He returned to Hiram to teach at the Institute and in 1857 was made its principal, though he did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. The abolitionist atmosphere at Williams had enlightened him politically, after which he began to consider politics as a career. He campaigned for Republican presidential candidate John C. Fr\u00e9mont in 1856. In 1858, he married Lucretia, and they had seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he registered to read law at the office of attorney Albert Gallatin Riddle in Cleveland, though he did his studying in Hiram. He was admitted to the bar in 1861.\nLocal Republican leaders invited Garfield to enter politics upon the death of Cyrus Prentiss, the presumptive nominee for the local state senate seat. He was nominated at the party convention on the sixth ballot and was elected, serving from 1860 to 1861. Garfield's major effort in the state senate was an unsuccessful bill providing for Ohio's first geological survey to measure its mineral resources.\nCivil War.\nAfter Abraham Lincoln's election as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union to form a new government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, one of the South's last federal outposts, beginning the Civil War. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew his place was in the Union Army.\nAt Governor William Dennison's request, Garfield deferred his military ambitions to remain in the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. When the legislature adjourned, Garfield spent the spring and early summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment. The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of his neighbors and former students. The regiment traveled to Camp Chase, outside Columbus, Ohio, to complete training. During this period, on November 19, 1861, Garfield became a Freemason, at Magnolia Lodge, No. 20 in Columbus, Ohio, receiving the third degree after his military service was completed in 1864. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell.\nBuell's command.\nBuell quickly assigned Garfield the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units. They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through the valley of the Big Sandy River. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek. Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing the rebels were outnumbered. Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia, and Garfield ordered his troops to take up the pursuit. They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle of Middle Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield commanded personally. At the fighting's end, the Confederates withdrew from the field and Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision.\nIn recognition of his success, Garfield was promoted to brigadier general. After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes, lived peaceably, and remained loyal to the Union. The proclamation was surprisingly lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery. Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap, the last rebel units in the area were outflanked and retreated to Virginia.\nGarfield's promotion gave him command of the 20th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio, which received orders to join Major General Ulysses S. Grant's forces as they advanced on Corinth, Mississippi, in early 1862. Before the 20th Brigade arrived, however, Confederate forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston surprised Grant's men in their camps, driving them back. Garfield's troops received word of the battle and advanced quickly, joining the rest of the army on the second day to drive the Confederates back across the field and into retreat. The action, later known as the Battle of Shiloh, was the bloodiest of the war to date; Garfield was exposed to fire for much of the day, but emerged uninjured. Major General Henry W. Halleck, Grant's superior, took charge of the combined armies and advanced ponderously toward Corinth; when they arrived, the Confederates had fled.\nThat summer, Garfield suffered from jaundice and significant weight loss. He was forced to return home, where his wife nursed him back to health. While he was home, Garfield's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress, but he refused to campaign with the delegates. He returned to military duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment. During this period of idleness, a rumor of an extramarital affair caused friction in the Garfields' marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it. Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn, to his frustration. In the meantime, he served on the court-martial of Fitz John Porter for his tardiness at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was convinced of Porter's guilt and voted with his fellow generals to convict Porter. The trial lasted almost two months, from November 1862 to January 1863, and, by its end, Garfield had procured an assignment as chief of staff to Major General William S. Rosecrans.\nChief of staff for Rosecrans.\nGenerals' chiefs of staff were usually more junior officers, but Garfield's influence with Rosecrans was greater than usual, with duties extending beyond communication of orders to actual management of his Army of the Cumberland. Rosecrans had a voracious appetite for conversation, especially when unable to sleep; in Garfield, he found \"the first well read person in the Army\" and the ideal candidate for discussions that ran deep into the night. They discussed everything, especially religion, and the two became close despite Garfield's being 12 years his junior. Rosecrans, who had converted from Methodism to Roman Catholicism, softened Garfield's view of his faith.\nGarfield recommended that Rosecrans replace wing commanders Alexander McCook and Thomas Crittenden, as he believed they were ineffective, but Rosecrans ignored the suggestion. With Rosecrans, Garfield devised the Tullahoma Campaign to pursue and trap Confederate General Braxton Bragg in Tullahoma. After initial Union success, Bragg retreated toward Chattanooga, where Rosecrans stalled and requested more troops and supplies. Garfield argued for an immediate advance, in line with demands from Halleck and Lincoln. After a council of war and lengthy deliberations, Rosecrans agreed to attack.\nAt the ensuing Battle of Chickamauga on September 19 and 20, 1863, confusion among the wing commanders over Rosecrans's orders created a gap in the lines, resulting in a rout of the right flank. Rosecrans concluded that the battle was lost and fell back on Chattanooga to establish a defensive line. Garfield, however, thought part of the army had held and, with Rosecrans's approval, headed across Missionary Ridge to survey the scene. Garfield's hunch was correct. Consequently, his ride became legendary and Rosecrans's error reignited criticism about the latter's leadership. While Rosecrans's army had avoided disaster, they were stranded in Chattanooga, surrounded by Bragg's army. Garfield sent a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton alerting Washington to the need for reinforcements to avoid annihilation. Lincoln and Halleck responded to the request for reinforcements by sending 20,000 troops to Garfield by rail within nine days. In the meantime, Grant was promoted to command of the western armies and quickly replaced Rosecrans with George H. Thomas. Garfield was ordered to report to Washington, where he was promoted to major general. According to historian Jean Edward Smith, Grant and Garfield had a \"guarded relationship\" since Grant promoted Thomas, rather than Garfield, to command of the Army of the Cumberland after Rosecrans's dismissal.\nCongressional career.\nElection in 1862; Civil War years.\nWhile he served in the Army in early 1862, friends of Garfield approached him about running for Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn and heavily Republican 19th district. He worried that he and other state-appointed generals would receive obscure assignments, and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career. That the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 allowed him to continue his war service for a time. Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862 on the eighth ballot. In the October general election, he defeated D.B. Woods by a two-to-one margin for a seat in the 38th Congress.\nDays before his Congressional term began, Garfield lost his eldest daughter, three-year-old Eliza, and became anxious and conflicted, saying his \"desolation of heart\" might require his return to \"the wild life of the army.\" He also assumed that the war would end before his joining the House, but it had not, and he felt strongly that he belonged in the field, rather than in Congress. He also thought he could expect a favorable command, so he decided to see President Lincoln. During their meeting, Lincoln recommended he take his House seat, as there was an excess of generals and a shortage of administration congressmen, especially those with knowledge of military affairs. Garfield accepted this recommendation and resigned his military commission to do so.\nGarfield met and befriended Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, who saw Garfield as a younger version of himself. The two agreed politically and both were part of the Radical wing of the Republican Party. Once he took his seat in December 1863, Garfield was frustrated at Lincoln's reluctance to press the South hard. Many radicals, led in the House by Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, wanted rebel-owned lands confiscated, but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that proposed to do so on a widespread basis. In debate on the House floor, Garfield supported such legislation and, discussing England's Glorious Revolution, hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting it. Garfield had supported Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and marveled at the \"strange phenomenon in the world's history, when a second-rate Illinois lawyer is the instrument to utter words which shall form an epoch memorable in all future ages.\"\nGarfield not only favored the abolition of slavery, but also believed the leaders of the rebellion had forfeited their constitutional rights. He supported the confiscation of Southern plantations and even exile or execution of rebellion leaders as a means to ensure a permanent end to slavery. Garfield felt Congress had an obligation \"to determine what legislation is necessary to secure equal justice to all loyal persons, without regard to color.\" He was more supportive of Lincoln when he took action against slavery.\nGarfield showed leadership early in his congressional career; he was initially the only Republican vote to terminate the use of bounties in military recruiting. Some financially able recruits had used the bounty system to buy their way out of service (called commutation), which Garfield considered reprehensible. He gave a speech pointing out the flaws in the existing conscription law: 300,000 recruits had been called upon to enlist, but barely 10,000 had done so, with the remainder claiming exemption, providing money, or recruiting a substitute. Lincoln appeared before the Military Affairs committee on which Garfield served, demanding a more effective bill; even if it cost him reelection, Lincoln was confident he could win the war before his term expired. After many false starts, Garfield, with Lincoln's support, procured the passage of a conscription bill that excluded commutation.\nUnder Chase's influence, Garfield became a staunch proponent of a dollar backed by a gold standard, and strongly opposed the \"greenback\". He also accepted the necessity of suspension of payment in gold or silver during the Civil War with strong reluctance. He voted with the Radical Republicans in passing the Wade\u2013Davis Bill, designed to give Congress more authority over Reconstruction, but Lincoln defeated it with a pocket veto.\nGarfield did not consider Lincoln very worthy of reelection, but there seemed to be no viable alternative. \"He will probably be the man, though I think we could do better\", he said. Garfield attended the party convention and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln's running mate, but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. Lincoln was reelected, as was Garfield. By then, Chase had left the Cabinet and been appointed Chief Justice, and his relations with Garfield became more distant.\nGarfield took up the practice of law in 1865 to improve his personal finances. His efforts took him to Wall Street where, the day after Lincoln's assassination, a riotous crowd drew him into an impromptu speech to calm their passions: \"Fellow citizens! Clouds and darkness are round about Him! His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies! Justice and judgment are the establishment of His throne! Mercy and truth shall go before His face! Fellow citizens! God reigns, and the Government at Washington still lives!\" The speech, with no mention or praise of Lincoln, was, according to Garfield biographer Robert G. Caldwell, \"quite as significant for what it did not contain as for what it did.\" In the following years, Garfield had more praise for Lincoln; a year after Lincoln's death, Garfield said, \"Greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln,\" and in 1878 he called Lincoln \"one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power\".\nWhen in Washington, Garfield attended Vermont Avenue Christian Church, which later became National City Christian Church, a building constructed and funded by the Disciples.\nReconstruction.\nIn 1864, the U.S. Senate passed the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery throughout the Union. The bill failed to pass the House by a two-thirds majority until January 31, 1865, when it was then sent to the states for ratification. The Amendment opened other issues concerning African American civil rights. Garfield asked, \"[What] is freedom? Is it the bare privilege of not being chained?...If this is all, then freedom is a bitter mockery, a cruel delusion.\"\nGarfield supported black suffrage as firmly as he supported abolition. President Johnson sought the rapid restoration of the Southern states during the months between his accession and the meeting of Congress in December 1865; Garfield hesitantly supported this policy as an experiment. Johnson, an old friend, sought Garfield's backing and their conversations led Garfield to assume Johnson's differences with Congress were not large. When Congress assembled in December (to Johnson's chagrin, without the elected representatives of the Southern states, who were excluded), Garfield urged conciliation to his colleagues, although he feared that Johnson, a former Democrat, might join other Democrats to gain political control. Garfield foresaw conflict even before February 1866, when Johnson vetoed a bill to extend the life of the Freedmen's Bureau, charged with aiding the former slaves. By April, Garfield had concluded that Johnson was either \"crazy or drunk with opium.\"\nThe conflict between Congress and President Johnson was the major issue of the 1866 campaign, with Johnson taking to the campaign trail in a Swing Around the Circle and Garfield facing opposition within the Republican party in his home district. With the South still disenfranchised and Northern public opinion behind the Republicans, they gained a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress. Garfield, having overcome his challengers at the district nominating convention, won reelection easily.\nGarfield opposed the proposed impeachment of Johnson initially when Congress convened in December 1866, but supported legislation to limit Johnson's powers, such as the Tenure of Office Act, which restricted Johnson's ability to remove presidential appointees. Distracted by committee duties, Garfield spoke about these bills rarely, but was a loyal Republican vote against Johnson.\nOn January 7, 1867, Garfield voted in support of the resolution that launched the first impeachment inquiry against Johnson (run by the House Committee on the Judiciary). On December 7, 1867, he voted against the unsuccessful resolution to impeach Johnson that the House Committee on the Judiciary had sent the full House. On January 27, 1868, he voted to pass the resolution that authorized the second impeachment inquiry against Johnson (run by the House Select Committee on Reconstruction). Due to a court case, he was absent on February 24, 1868, when the House impeached Johnson, but gave a speech aligning himself with Thaddeus Stevens and others who sought Johnson's removal shortly thereafter. Garfield was present on March 2 and 3, 1868, when the House voted on specific articles of impeachment, and voted in support of all 11 articles. During the March 2 debate on the articles, Garfield argued that what he characterized as Johnson's attempts to render Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and William H. Emory personal tools of his demonstrated Johnson's intent to disregard the law and override the Constitution, suggesting that Johnson's trial perhaps could be expedited to last only a day in order to hasten his removal. When Johnson was acquitted in his trial before the Senate, Garfield was shocked and blamed the outcome on the trial's presiding officer, Chief Justice Chase, his onetime mentor.\nBy the time Grant succeeded Johnson in 1869, Garfield had moved away from the remaining radicals (Stevens, their leader, had died in 1868). By this time, many in the Republican Party wanted to remove the \"Negro question\" from national affairs. Garfield hailed the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870 as a triumph and favored Georgia's readmission to the Union as a matter of right, not politics. An influential Republican, Garfield said, \"[The] Fifteen Amendment confers on the African race the care of its own destiny. It places their fortunes in their own hands.\" In 1871, Congress took up the Ku Klux Klan Act, which was designed to combat attacks on African Americans' suffrage rights. Garfield opposed the act, saying, \"I have never been more perplexed by a piece of legislation.\" He was torn between his indignation at the Klan, whom he called \"terrorists\", and his concern for the power given to the president to enforce the act through suspension of habeas corpus.\nTariffs and finance.\nThroughout his political career, Garfield favored the gold standard and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold, and later, through the free and unlimited coinage of silver. In 1865, he was put on the House Ways and Means Committee, a long-awaited opportunity to focus on financial and economic issues. He reprised his opposition to the greenback, saying, \"Any party which commits itself to paper money will go down amid the general disaster, covered with the curses of a ruined people.\" In 1868 Garfield gave a two-hour speech on currency in the House, which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point; in it, he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments, that is, the government paying out silver and gold, rather than paper money that could not be redeemed.\nTariffs had been raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterward, Garfield, who made a close study of financial affairs, advocated moving toward free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held the majority in the House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. One reason he was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor Horace Greeley.\nStarting in January 1870, Garfield, then chairman of the House Banking Committee, led an investigation into the Black Friday Gold Panic scandal. In 1869, during Grant's first term in office, two New York conspirators, Jay Gould and James Fisk, launched a scheme to corner the gold market. The conspiracy was broken on Friday, September 24, 1869, when Grant and Treasury Secretary George Boutwell released gold into the market, causing widespread financial panic. During the investigation, rumors spread that Grant's family might have been involved. In order not to force Grant's wife to testify, Garfield had a private meeting with Grant at the White House. When Garfield showed Grant testimony about him and his family, Grant thanked Garfield but refused to read it or give a response. Grant personally resented Garfield for investigating Black Friday and his wife Julia concerning possible involvement in the scandal.\nGarfield's investigation and final majority report, released on September 12, 1870, were thorough but found no indictable offenses and exonerated Grant and Julia of wrongdoing. Garfield thought the scandal was enabled by the greenbacks that financed the speculation. Garfield was not at all enthused about President Grant's reelection in 1872\u2014until Greeley, who emerged as the candidate of the Democrats and Liberal Republicans, became the only serious alternative. Garfield said, \"I would say Grant was not fit to be nominated and Greeley is not fit to be elected.\" Both Grant and Garfield were overwhelmingly reelected.\nCr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal; salary grab.\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier of America scandal involved corruption in the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with it to undertake construction of the railroad. The railroad paid the company's grossly inflated invoices with federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.\nThe story broke in July 1872, in the middle of the presidential campaign. Among those named were Vice President Schuyler Colfax, Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson (the Republican candidate for vice president), Speaker James G. Blaine of Maine, and Garfield. Greeley had little luck taking advantage of the scandal. When Congress reconvened after the election, Blaine, seeking to clear his name, demanded a House investigation. Evidence before the special committee exonerated Blaine. Garfield had said in September 1872 that Ames had offered him stock but he had repeatedly refused it. Testifying before the committee in January, Ames said he had offered Garfield ten shares of stock at par value, but that Garfield had never taken them or paid for them, though a year passed, from 1867 to 1868, before Garfield had finally refused. Appearing before the committee on January 14, 1873, Garfield confirmed much of this. Ames testified several weeks later that Garfield agreed to take the stock on credit, and that it was paid for by the company's huge dividends. The two men differed over $300 that Garfield received and later paid back, with Garfield deeming it a loan and Ames a dividend.\nGarfield's biographers have been unwilling to exonerate him in the scandal. Allan Peskin writes, \"Did Garfield lie? Not exactly. Did he tell the truth? Not completely. Was he corrupted? Not really. Even Garfield's enemies never claimed that his involvement in the affair influenced his behavior.\" Rutkow writes, \"Garfield's real offense was that he knowingly denied to the House investigating committee that he had agreed to accept the stock and that he had also received a dividend of $329.\" Caldwell suggests Garfield \"told the truth [before the committee, but] certainly failed to tell the whole truth, clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty.\" That Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a badly kept secret, even mentioned on the floor of Congress, and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield, in his positions on committees dealing with finance, \"had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this, than the sentinel has to snore on his post.\"\nAnother issue that caused Garfield trouble in his 1874 reelection bid was the so-called \"Salary Grab\" of 1873, which increased the compensation for members of Congress by 50%, retroactive to 1871. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Garfield was responsible for shepherding the appropriations bill through the House; during the debate in February 1873, Massachusetts Representative Benjamin Butler offered the increase as an amendment, and despite Garfield's opposition, it passed the House and eventually became law. The law was very popular in the House, as almost half the members were lame ducks, but the public was outraged, and many of Garfield's constituents blamed him, though he personally refused to accept the increase. In a bad year for Republicans, who lost control of the House for the first time since the Civil War, Garfield had his closest congressional election, winning with only 57% of the vote.\nFloor leader; Hayes administration.\nThe Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1875 meant the loss of Garfield's chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee, though the Democrats did put him on the Ways and Means Committee. With many of his leadership rivals defeated in the 1874 Democratic landslide, and Blaine elected to the Senate, Garfield was seen as the Republican floor leader, and the likely Speaker, should the party regain control of the chamber.\nGarfield thought the land grants given to expanding railroads was an unjust practice. He also opposed monopolistic practices by corporations, as well as the power sought by workers' unions. He supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the practice of forcing government workers, in exchange for their positions, to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions.\nAs the 1876 presidential election approached, Garfield was loyal to the candidacy of Senator Blaine, and fought for the former Speaker's nomination at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. When it became clear, after six ballots, that Blaine could not prevail, the convention nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes. Although Garfield had supported Blaine, he had kept good relations with Hayes, and wholeheartedly supported the governor. Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full-time to the practice of law, but to help his party, he sought re-election, and won it easily that October. Any celebration was short-lived, as Garfield's youngest son, Neddie, fell ill with whooping cough shortly after the congressional election, and soon died.\nWhen Hayes appeared to have lost the presidential election the following month to Democrat Samuel Tilden, the Republicans launched efforts to reverse the results in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida, where they held the governorship. If Hayes won all three states, he would take the election by a single electoral vote. Grant asked Garfield to serve as a \"neutral observer\" of the recount in Louisiana. The observers soon recommended to the state electoral commissions that Hayes be declared the winner\u2014Garfield recommended the entire vote of West Feliciana Parish, which had given Tilden a sizable majority, be thrown out. The Republican governors of the three states certified that Hayes had won their states, to the outrage of Democrats, who had the state legislatures submit rival returns, and threatened to prevent the counting of the electoral vote\u2014under the Constitution, Congress is the final arbiter of the election. Congress then established an Electoral Commission, consisting of eight Republicans and seven Democrats, to determine the winner. Despite his objection to the Commission, Garfield was appointed to it. He felt Congress should count the vote and proclaim Hayes victorious. Hayes emerged the victor by a party line vote of 8\u20137. In exchange for recognizing Hayes as president, Southern Democrats secured the removal of federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction.\nAlthough an Ohio Senate seat would be vacated by the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise to protect him from the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield agreed. As Hayes's key legislator in the House, he gained considerable prestige and respect for his role there. When Congress debated the Bland\u2013Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into legal tender dollar coins, Garfield opposed it as a deviation from the gold standard; it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.\nIn 1876, Garfield purchased the property in Mentor that reporters later dubbed Lawnfield, where he conducted the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency. Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879, seeing that as a road likely to take Garfield to the White House. Garfield preferred to seek election as a U.S. senator. Rivals were spoken of for the seat, such as Secretary Sherman, but he had presidential ambitions (for which he sought Garfield's support), and other candidates fell by the wayside. The General Assembly elected Garfield to the Senate in January 1880, though his term was not scheduled to commence until March 4, 1881.\nLegal career and other activities.\nIn 1865, Garfield became a partner in the law firm of a fellow Disciple of Christ, Jeremiah Black. They had much in common, except politics: Black was an avid Democrat, having served in the cabinet of President James Buchanan. The next year, Black was retained by some pro-Confederate northern civilians who had been found guilty of treason in a military court and sentenced to death. Black saw an opportunity to strike a blow against military courts and the Republicans. He had heard Garfield's military speeches, and learned of not only his oratory skills but also his resistance to expansive powers of military commissions. Black assigned the case to Garfield one week before arguments were to be made before the U. S. Supreme Court. When Black warned him of the political peril, Garfield responded, \"It don't make any difference. I believe in English liberty and English law.\" In this landmark case, \"Ex parte Milligan,\" Garfield successfully argued that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals, despite a declaration of martial law, as long as civil courts were still operating. In his first court appearance, Garfield's oral argument lasted over two hours, and though his wealthy clients refused to pay him, he had established himself as a preeminent lawyer.\nDuring Grant's first term, Garfield was discontented with public service and in 1872 again pursued opportunities in the law. But he declined a partnership offer from a Cleveland law firm when told his prospective partner was of \"intemperate and licentious\" reputation. In 1873, after Chase's death, Garfield appealed to Grant to appoint Justice Noah H. Swayne Chief Justice, but Grant appointed Morrison R. Waite.\nIn 1871, Garfield traveled to Montana Territory to negotiate the removal of the Bitterroot Salish tribe to the Flathead Indian Reservation. Having been told that the people would happily move, Garfield expected an easy task. Instead, he found the Salish determined to stay in their Bitterroot Valley homeland. His attempts to coerce Chief Charlo to sign the agreement nearly brought about a military clash. In the end, he convinced two subchiefs to sign and move to the reservation with a few of the Salish people. Garfield never convinced Charlo to sign, although the official treaty document voted on by Congress bore his forged mark.\nIn 1876, Garfield developed a trapezoid proof of the Pythagorean theorem, which was published in the \"New England Journal of Education\". Mathematics historian William Dunham wrote that Garfield's trapezoid work was \"really a very clever proof.\" According to the \"Journal\", Garfield arrived at the proof \"in mathematical amusements and discussions with other members of congress.\"\nAfter his conversion experience in 1850, religious inquiry was a high priority for Garfield. He read widely and moved beyond the confines of his early experience as a member of the Disciples of Christ. His new, broader perspective was rooted in his devotion to freedom of inquiry and his study of history. The intensity of Garfield's religious thought was also influenced by his experience in combat and his interaction with voters.\nPresidential election of 1880.\nRepublican nomination.\nHaving just been elected to the Senate with John Sherman's support, Garfield was committed to Sherman for the 1880 Republican presidential nomination. Before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield the best choice for the nomination. Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former President Grant; several other candidates attracted delegates as well.\nThe Republican Party at the time was split into two factions: the \"Stalwarts\", who supported the existing federal government patronage system, and the \"Half-Breeds\", who wanted civil service reform. As the convention began, New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, floor leader for the Stalwarts, who supported former President Ulysses S. Grant, proposed that the delegates pledge to back the eventual nominee in the general election. When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from the convention. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense of their right to reserve judgment. The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who were then convinced he was the only one who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.\nAfter speeches in favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little excitement for Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes to Blaine's 284, and Sherman's 93 votes placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots demonstrated a deadlock between Grant and Blaine, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. Jeremiah McLain Rusk, a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and Benjamin Harrison, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a dark horse candidate\u2014Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and a stampede began. Garfield protested to the Ohio delegation that he did not seek the nomination and would not betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes, and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, Chester A. Arthur, a former New York customs collector and member of Conkling's political machine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee. Levi P. Morton was initially offered the vice-presidential nomination, but declined after consulting with Conkling.\nCampaign against Hancock.\nEven with a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried over from the convention, so Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign focused on a few close states, including New York and Indiana.\nPractical differences between the candidates were few, but Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt. They reminded Northern voters the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and Democrats would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury. Fifteen years had passed since the end of the war, and with Union generals at the head of both tickets, the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters. With a few months to go before the election, the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the tariff. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a \"tariff for revenue only\", Republicans told Northern workers a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said, \"The tariff question is a local question.\" The Republican ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield. Ultimately, of the more than 9.2million popular votes cast, fewer than 2,000 separated the two candidates. But in the Electoral College, Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155. The election made Garfield the only sitting member of the House ever to be elected to the presidency.\nPresidency (1881).\nCabinet and inauguration.\nBefore his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that might engender peace between the party's Conkling and Blaine factions. Blaine's delegates had provided much of the support for Garfield's nomination, so the Maine senator received the place of honor as Secretary of State. Blaine was not only the president's closest advisor, but he was also obsessed with knowing all that took place in the White House, and allegedly posted spies there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.\nBecause Garfield was distracted by cabinet maneuvering, his inaugural address was a \"compendium of platitudes\" and fell below expectations. At one high point, however, Garfield emphasized the civil rights of African Americans, saying \"Freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen.\" After discussing the gold standard, the need for education, and an unexpected denunciation of Mormon polygamy, the speech ended. The crowd applauded, but the speech, according to Peskin, \"however sincerely intended, betrayed its hasty composition by the flatness of its tone and the conventionality of its subject matter.\"\nGarfield's appointment of James infuriated Conkling, a factional opponent of the Postmaster General, who demanded a compensatory appointment for his faction, such as the position of Secretary of the Treasury. The resulting squabble occupied much of Garfield's brief presidency. The feud with Conkling reached a climax when the president, at Blaine's instigation, nominated Conkling's enemy, Judge William H. Robertson, to be Collector of the Port of New York. This was one of the prize patronage positions below cabinet level and was then held by Edwin A. Merritt. Conkling raised the time-honored principle of senatorial courtesy in an attempt to defeat the nomination, to no avail. Garfield, who believed the practice was corrupt and refused to rubber-stamp selections by powerful senators, did not back down and threatened to withdraw all nominations unless Robertson was confirmed, intending to \"settle the question whether the president is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States\". Ultimately, Conkling and his New York colleague Senator Thomas C. Platt resigned their Senate seats to seek vindication but found only further humiliation when the New York legislature elected others in their places. Robertson was confirmed as Collector and Garfield's victory was clear. To Blaine's chagrin, Garfield returned to his goal of balancing the interests of party factions and nominated a number of Conkling's Stalwart friends to offices.\nWith his cabinet complete, Garfield had to contend with myriad office seekers. He exclaimed, \"My God! What is there in this place that a man should ever get into it.\" Garfield's family happily settled into the White House, but he found presidential duties exasperating.\nRefinance of national debt.\nGarfield ordered Treasury Secretary William Windom to refund (\"refinance\") the national debt by calling in outstanding U.S. bonds paying 6% interest. Holders would have the option of accepting cash or new bonds at 3%, closer to the interest rates of the time. Taxpayers were saved an estimated $10 million. By comparison, federal expenditures in 1881 were below $261 million (~$ in 2024).\nSupreme Court nomination.\nIn 1880, President Hayes had nominated Stanley Matthews to the Supreme Court but the Senate declined to act on the nomination. In March 1881, Garfield re-nominated Matthews to the Court and the Senate confirmed Matthews by a vote of 24\u201323. According to \"The New York Times\", \"opposition to Matthews's Supreme Court appointment... stemmed from his prosecution in 1859 of a newspaper editor who had assisted two runaway slaves.\" Because Matthews was \"a professed abolitionist at the time, the matter was later framed as political expediency triumphing over moral principle.\" Matthews served on the Court until his death in 1889.\nReforms.\nGrant and Hayes had both advocated civil service reform, and by 1881 such reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation. Garfield sympathized with them, believing the spoils system damaged the presidency and often eclipsed more important concerns. Some reformers became disappointed when Garfield promoted limited tenure only to minor office seekers and gave appointments to his old friends.\nCorruption in the post office also cried out for reform. In April 1880, there had been a congressional investigation of corruption in the Post Office Department, where profiteering rings allegedly stole millions of dollars, securing bogus mail contracts on star routes. After obtaining contracts with the lowest bid, costs to run the mail routes would be escalated and profits would be divided among ring members. Shortly after taking office, Garfield received word of postal corruption by an alleged star route ringleader, Assistant Postmaster General Thomas J. Brady. Garfield demanded Brady's resignation and ordered prosecutions that ended in trials for conspiracy. When told that his party, including his campaign manager, Stephen W. Dorsey, was involved, Garfield directed that the corruption in the Post Office be rooted out \"to the bone\", regardless of where it might lead. Brady resigned and was indicted for conspiracy, though jury trials in 1882 and 1883 found Brady not guilty.\nCivil rights and education.\nGarfield believed the key to improving the state of African American civil rights was government supported education. During Reconstruction, freedmen had gained citizenship and suffrage, which enabled them to participate in government, but Garfield believed their rights were being eroded by Southern white resistance and illiteracy, and he was concerned that blacks would become America's permanent \"peasantry\". He proposed a \"universal\" education system funded by the federal government. In February 1866, as a congressman from Ohio, Garfield and Ohio School Commissioner Emerson Edward White had drafted a bill for the National Department of Education. They believed that through the use of statistics they could push the U.S. Congress to establish a federal agency for school reform. But by the time of Garfield's presidency, Congress and the northern white public had lost interest in African-American rights, and Congress did not pass federal funding for universal education during his term.\nGarfield also worked to appoint several African Americans to prominent positions: Frederick Douglass, recorder of deeds in Washington; Robert Elliot, special agent to the Treasury; John M. Langston, Haitian minister; and Blanche K. Bruce, register to the Treasury. Garfield believed Southern support for the Republican Party could be gained by \"commercial and industrial\" interests rather than race issues and began to reverse Hayes's policy of conciliating Southern Democrats. He appointed William H. Hunt, a Republican from Louisiana, as Secretary of the Navy. To break the hold of the resurgent Democratic Party in the Solid South, Garfield took patronage advice from Virginia Senator William Mahone of the biracial independent Readjuster Party, hoping to add the independents' strength to the Republicans' there.\nForeign policy and naval reform.\nGarfield had little foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine. They agreed on the need to promote freer trade, especially within the Western Hemisphere. Garfield and Blaine believed increasing trade with Latin America would be the best way to keep the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from dominating the region. By encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity. Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade.\nAt the same time, they hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine favored a resolution that would result in Peru yielding no territory, but Chile by 1881 had occupied the Peruvian capital of Lima, and rejected any settlement that restored the previous \"status quo\".\nGarfield sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement and attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii. Garfield's and Blaine's plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar.\nGarfield also considered enhancing U.S. military strength abroad, asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the navy's condition with an eye toward expansion and modernization. In the end, these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated. Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan-American conference, but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur, Garfield's successor, cancelled the conference. Naval reform continued under Arthur, on a more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned, ultimately ending in the construction of the Squadron of Evolution.\nAssassination.\nGuiteau and shooting.\nCharles J. Guiteau had followed various professions in his life, but in 1880 had determined to gain federal office by supporting what he expected would be the winning Republican ticket. He composed a speech, \"Garfield vs. Hancock\", and got it printed by the Republican National Committee. One means of persuading the voters in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate's merits, but with the Republicans seeking more famous men, Guiteau received few opportunities to speak. On one occasion, according to Kenneth D. Ackerman, Guiteau was unable to finish his speech due to nerves. Guiteau, who considered himself a Stalwart, deemed his contribution to Garfield's victory sufficient to justify his appointment to the position of consul in Paris, despite the fact that he spoke no French, nor any foreign language. One medical expert has since described Guiteau as possibly a narcissistic schizophrenic; neuroscientist Kent Kiehl assessed him as a clinical psychopath.\nOne of Garfield's more wearying duties was seeing office-seekers, and he saw Guiteau at least once. White House officials suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions. Blaine, who had no intention of giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply said the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.\nGuiteau came to believe he had lost the position because he was a Stalwart. He decided the only way to end the Republican Party's internecine warfare was for Garfield to die\u2014though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.\nThe assassination of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke due to the Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason the president should be guarded; his movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew Garfield would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, 1881, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one\u2014Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2.\nGuiteau concealed himself by the ladies' waiting room at the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him at least part of the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau as he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice. Guiteau was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him, Guiteau was led away, and said, \"I did it. I will go to jail for it. I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be President.\" News of his motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.\nTreatment and death.\nOne shot glanced off Garfield's arm while the other pierced his back, shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen. \"My God, what is this?\" he exclaimed. Among those at the station was Robert Todd Lincoln, who was deeply upset, thinking back to when his father Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated 16 years earlier. Garfield was taken on a mattress upstairs to a private office, where several doctors examined him. At his request, Garfield was taken back to the White House, and his wife, then in New Jersey, was sent for. Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City, who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau's statements.\nAlthough Joseph Lister's pioneering work in antisepsis was known to American doctors, few of them had confidence in it, and none of his advocates was among Garfield's treating physicians. The physician who took charge at the depot and then at the White House was Doctor Willard Bliss. A noted physician and surgeon, Bliss was an old friend of Garfield, and about a dozen doctors, led by Bliss, were soon probing the wound with unsterilized fingers and instruments. Garfield was given morphine for the pain and asked Bliss to tell him frankly what his chances were, which Bliss put at one in a hundred. \"Well, Doctor, we'll take that chance.\"\nOver the next few days Garfield made some improvement, as the nation viewed the news from the capital and prayed. Although he never stood again, he was able to sit up and write several times, and his recovery was viewed so positively that a steamer was fitted out as a seagoing hospital to aid with his convalescence. He was nourished on oatmeal porridge (which he detested) and milk from a cow on the White House lawn. When told that Indian chief Sitting Bull, a prisoner of the army, was starving, Garfield said, \"Let him starve...\" initially, but a few moments later said, \"No, send him my oatmeal.\"\nX-ray imaging, which could have assisted physicians in precisely locating the bullet in Garfield's body, would not be invented for another 14 years. Alexander Graham Bell tried to locate the bullet with a primitive metal detector but was unsuccessful, though the device had been effective when tested on others. But Bliss limited its use on Garfield, ensuring he remained in charge. Because Bliss insisted the bullet rested someplace it did not, the detector could not locate it. Bell shortly returned after adjusting his device, which emitted an unusual tone in the area where Bliss believed the bullet was lodged. Bliss took this as confirmation that the bullet was where he declared it to be. Bliss recorded the test as a success, saying it was: now unanimously agreed that the location of the ball has been ascertained with reasonable certainty, and that it lies, as heretofore stated, in the front wall of the abdomen, immediately over the groin, about five inches [] below and to the right of the navel.\nOne means of keeping Garfield comfortable in Washington's summer heat was one of the first successful air conditioning units: air propelled by fans over ice and then dried reduced the temperature in the sickroom by . Engineers from the navy and other scientists worked together to develop the unit, though there were problems to solve, such as excessive noise and increased humidity.\nOn July 23 Garfield took a turn for the worse when his temperature increased to ; doctors, concerned by an abscess at the wound, inserted a drainage tube. This initially helped, and the bedridden Garfield held a brief cabinet meeting on July 29; members were under orders from Bliss to discuss nothing that might excite Garfield. Doctors probed the abscess, hoping to find the bullet; they likely made the infections worse. Garfield performed only one official act in August, signing an extradition paper. By the end of the month he was much feebler than he had been and his weight had decreased from to .\nGarfield had long been anxious to escape hot, unhealthy Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon, part of Long Branch, New Jersey, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He left the White House for the last time on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Francklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. After arriving in Elberon the next day, Garfield was moved from the train car to a bedroom from which he could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, Joe Stanley Brown, wrote forty years later, \"to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy.\"\nOn September 18 Garfield asked Colonel A.F. Rockwell, a friend, if he would have a place in history. Rockwell assured him he would and told Garfield he had much work still before him, but his response was, \"No, my work is done.\" The following day Garfield, then also suffering from pneumonia and hypertension, marveled that he could not pick up a glass despite feeling well and went to sleep without discomfort. He awoke that evening around 10:15\u00a0p.m. complaining of great pain in his chest to his chief of staff General David Swaim, who was watching him, as he placed his hand over his heart. The president then requested a drink of water from Swaim. After finishing his glass, Garfield said, \"Oh Swaim, this terrible pain\u2014press your hand on it.\" As Swaim put his hand on Garfield's chest, Garfield's hands went up reflexively. Clutching his heart, he exclaimed, \"Oh, Swaim, can't you stop this? Oh, oh, Swaim!\" Those were Garfield's last words. Swaim ordered another attendant to send for Bliss, who found Garfield unconscious. Despite efforts to revive him, Garfield never awoke, and he was pronounced dead at about 10:30\u00a0p.m. Learning from a reporter of Garfield's death the following day, Chester A. Arthur took the presidential oath of office administered by New York Supreme Court Justice John R. Brady.\nAccording to some historians and medical experts, Garfield might have survived his wounds had the doctors attending him had at their disposal today's medical research, knowledge, techniques and equipment. Standard medical practice at the time dictated that priority be given to locating the path of the bullet. Several of his doctors inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, a common practice in the 1880s. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in Garfield's demise. Biographer Peskin said medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal fragmentation. Rutkow, a professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, has argued that starvation also played a role. Rutkow suggests \"Garfield had such a nonlethal wound. In today's world, he would have gone home in a matter of two or three days.\" The conventional narrative regarding Garfield's post-shooting medical condition was challenged by Theodore Pappas and Shahrzad Joharifard in a 2013 article in \"The American Journal of Surgery\". They argued that Garfield died from a late rupture of a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, which developed secondary to the path of the bullet adjacent to the splenic artery. They also argued that his sepsis was actually caused by post-traumatic acute acalculous cholecystitis. Based on the autopsy report, the authors speculate that his gallbladder subsequently ruptured, leading to the development of a large bile-containing abscess adjacent to the gallbladder. Pappas and Joharifard say this caused the septic decline in Garfield's condition that was visible starting from July 23, 1881. Pappas and Joharifard also state that they don't believe that Garfield's doctors could have saved him even if they had been aware of his cholecystitis, since the first successful cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) was performed a year after Garfield's death.\nGuiteau was indicted on October 14, 1881, for the murder of the president. During his trial, Guiteau declared that he was not responsible for Garfield's death, admitting to the shooting but not the killing. In his defense, Guiteau wrote: \"General Garfield died from malpractice. According to his own physicians, he was not fatally shot. The doctors who mistreated him ought to bear the odium of his death, and not his assailant. They ought to be indicted for murdering James A. Garfield, and not me.\" After a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often interrupted and argued, and in which his counsel used the insanity defense, the jury found him guilty on January 25, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau may have had neurosyphilis, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.\nFuneral, memorials and commemorations.\nGarfield's funeral train left Long Branch on the same special track that had brought him there, traveling over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. Shocked by his death, Marine Band leader John Philip Sousa composed the march \"\", which was played when Garfield's body was received in Washington, D.C. More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body lay in state from September 21 to 23, 1881, at the United States Capitol rotunda; on September 25, in Cleveland, Garfield's casket was paraded down Euclid Avenue from Wilson Avenue to Public Square, with those in attendance including former presidents Grant and Hayes, and Generals William Sherman, Sheridan and Hancock. More than 150,000\u2014a number equal to the city's population\u2014likewise paid their respects, and Sousa's march was again played. Garfield's body was temporarily interred in the Schofield family vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built.\nMemorials to Garfield were erected across the country. On April 10, 1882, seven months after Garfield's death, the U.S. Post Office Department issued a postage stamp in his honor. In 1884, sculptor Frank Happersberger completed a monument on the grounds of the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers. In 1887, the James A. Garfield Monument was dedicated in Washington. Another monument, in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park, was erected in 1896. In Victoria, Australia, Cannibal Creek was renamed Garfield in his honor.\nOn May 19, 1890, Garfield's body was permanently interred, with great solemnity and fanfare, in a mausoleum in Lake View Cemetery. Attending the dedication ceremonies were former President Hayes, President Benjamin Harrison, and future president William McKinley. Treasury Secretary William Windom also attended. Harrison said Garfield was always a \"student and instructor\" and that his life works and death would \"continue to be instructive and inspiring incidents in American history\". Three panels on the monument display Garfield as a teacher, Union major general, and orator; another shows him taking the presidential oath, and a fifth shows his body lying in state at the Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C.\nGarfield's murder by a deranged office-seeker awakened public awareness of the need for civil service reform legislation. Senator George H. Pendleton, a Democrat from Ohio, launched a reform effort that resulted in the Pendleton Act in January 1883. This act reversed the \"spoils system\" where office seekers paid up or gave political service to obtain or keep federally appointed positions. Under the act, appointments were awarded on merit and competitive examination. To ensure the reform was implemented, Congress and Arthur established and funded the Civil Service Commission. The Pendleton Act, however, covered only 10% of federal government workers. For Arthur, previously known for having been a \"veteran spoilsman\", civil service reform became his most noteworthy achievement.\nA marble statue of Garfield by Charles Niehaus was added to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the Capitol in Washington, D.C., a gift from the State of Ohio in 1886.\nGarfield is honored with a life-size bronze sculpture inside the Cuyahoga County Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Cleveland, Ohio.\nMany cities and towns in the U.S., Canada, and Australia are named for Garfield, as are several high schools.\nOn March 2, 2019, the National Park Service erected exhibit panels in Washington to mark the site of his assassination.\nThe folk song \"Mister Garfield\", released as a single by Johnny Cash in 1965 but sometimes credited to Ramblin' Jack Elliott, is about Garfield's assassination. \nGarfield has been portrayed on screen by Francis Sayles in the 1939 film \"The Night Riders\", by Van Johnson in the 1969 film \"The Price of Power\", by Robert Wagner in the 2007 film \"Netherbeast Incorporated\", and by Michael Shannon in the 2025 miniseries \"Death by Lightning\", based on Candice Millard's 2011 book \"Destiny of the Republic\".\nPolitical views.\nWhile serving as president, Garfield opposed labor unions and sided with the Republican Party's hard-money wing. He was also suspicious of cooperative farm programs supported by the Grange, a farmers' organization he called \"communism in disguise\". But Garfield also opposed corporate monopoly and advocated a federal education department along with increased federal support for the education of African Americans in southern states.\nAnother study has said of Garfield:\nNo man could be in politics as long as Garfield had been without forming some opinions of the nature of presidential leadership, and his, by and large, were negative. Philosophically, as has been noted, he was a believer in laissez faire, and he had been suspicious of presidential power from the time when he fought Andrew Johnson.\nGarfield's successor as president, Chester A. Arthur, shared his laissez-faire views.\nLegacy and historical view.\nFor a few years after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story\u2014that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States. Peskin wrote: \"In mourning Garfield, Americans were not only honoring a president; they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations.\" As the rivalry between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield. In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes. Increasingly, Garfield's short time as president was forgotten.\nThe 20th century saw no revival for Garfield. Thomas Wolfe deemed the presidents of the Gilded Age, including Garfield, \"lost Americans\" whose \"gravely vacant and bewhiskered faces mixed, melted, swam together\". The politicians of the Gilded Age faded from the public eye, their luster eclipsed by those who had influenced America outside of political office during that time; the robber barons, the inventors, those who had sought social reform, and others who had lived as America rapidly changed. Current events and more recent figures occupied America's attention. According to Ackerman, \"the busy Twentieth Century has made Garfield's era seem remote and irrelevant, its leaders ridiculed for their very obscurity.\"\nGarfield's biographers, and those who have studied his presidency, tend to think well of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end. Historian Justus D. Doenecke, while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma, chronicles his achievements: \"by winning a victory over the Stalwarts, he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office. As a man, he was intelligent, sensitive, and alert, and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched.\" Doenecke criticizes Garfield's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson's favor, and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter's confirmation. In 1931, Caldwell wrote: \"If Garfield lives in history, it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality\u2014but also because in life and in death, he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation. Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more.\" Rutkow writes that \"James Abram Garfield's presidency is reduced to a tantalizing 'what if.'\"\nIn 2002, historian Bernard A. Weisberger said, \"[Garfield] was, to some extent, a perfect moderate. He read widely (and unobtrusively) without its visibly affecting his Christianity, his Republicanism, or his general laissez-faire orthodoxy. He was not so much a scholar in politics as a politic scholar.\" Peskin believes Garfield deserves more credit for his political career than he has received: \"True, his accomplishments were neither bold nor heroic, but his was not an age that called for heroism. His stormy presidency was brief, and in some respects, unfortunate, but he did leave the office stronger than he found it. As a public man he had a hand in almost every issue of national importance for almost two decades, while as a party leader he, along with Blaine, forged the Republican Party into the instrument that would lead the United States into the twentieth century.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

The Republican ticket of Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio and House Representative William A. Wheeler of New York very narrowly defeated the Democratic ticket of Governor Samuel J. Tilden of New York and Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana.\nFollowing President Ulysses S. Grant's decision to retire after his second term, U.S. Representative James G. Blaine emerged as frontrunner for the Republican nomination; however, Blaine was unable to win a majority at the 1876 Republican National Convention, which settled on Hayes as a compromise candidate. The 1876 Democratic National Convention nominated Tilden on the second ballot.\nThe election was among the most contentious in American history, and was widely speculated to have been resolved by the Compromise of 1877, in which Hayes supposedly agreed to end Reconstruction in exchange for the presidency. In the first count, Tilden had 184 electoral votes (one vote short of a majority) to Hayes's 165, with the 20 votes from Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon disputed. To address this constitutional crisis, Congress established the Electoral Commission, which awarded all twenty votes and thus the presidency to Hayes in a strict party-line vote. Some Democratic representatives filibustered the commission's decision, hoping to prevent Hayes's inauguration; their filibuster was ultimately ended by party leader Samuel J. Randall. On March 2, 1877, the House and Senate confirmed Hayes as president. This was the last election taken under Reconstruction, in which some Southern states voted for a Republican candidate. Following the election Southern states were able to fully implement Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising black Americans, beginning a period of Democrat domination known as the Solid South. No Republican presidential nominee would win a former Confederate state until Warren G. Harding in the 1920 United States presidential election.\nIt was the fifth of six consecutive presidential election victories for the Republican Party and the second of five U.S. presidential elections in which the winner did not win a plurality of the national popular vote, after the 1824 election. Although Tilden defeated Hayes in the official popular vote tally, the election involved substantial electoral fraud, voter intimidation by paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts, and disenfranchisement of black Republicans. The election had the highest voter turnout of the eligible voting-age population in American history, at 82.6%. Tilden's share of the popular vote, 50.9%, is the largest received by a candidate who was not elected to the presidency, and he was the only losing candidate in a U.S. presidential election who won a majority of the popular vote. Tilden was also the last person to win an outright majority of the popular vote until William McKinley in 1896. As of 2024, this remains the only presidential election in which both candidates were sitting governors, and was the last presidential election during which the presidential electors of a state (Colorado) were appointed at the discretion of the state legislature rather than by popular vote.\nNominations.\nRepublican Party nomination.\nIt was widely assumed during the year 1875 that incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant would run for a third term as president despite the poor economic conditions, the numerous political scandals that had developed since he assumed office in 1869, and despite a longstanding tradition set by George Washington not to stay in office for more than two terms. Grant's inner circle advised him to go for a third term and he almost did so, but on December 15, 1875, the House, by a sweeping 233\u201318 vote, passed a resolution declaring that the two-term tradition was to prevent a dictatorship. Later that year, Grant ruled himself out of running in 1876. He instead tried to persuade Secretary of State Hamilton Fish to run for the presidency, but the 67-year-old Fish declined since he believed himself too old for that role. Grant nonetheless sent a letter to the convention imploring them to nominate Fish, but the letter was misplaced and never read to the convention. Fish later confirmed that he would have declined the presidential nomination even if it had been offered to him.\nWhen the Sixth Republican National Convention assembled in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 14, 1876, James G. Blaine appeared to be the presidential nominee. On the first ballot, Blaine was just 100 votes short of a majority. His vote began to slide after the second ballot, however, as many Republicans feared that Blaine could not win the general election. Anti-Blaine delegates could not agree on a candidate until his total rose to 41% on the sixth ballot. Leaders of the reform Republicans met privately and considered alternatives. They chose the reforming Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes, who had been gradually building support during the convention until he finished second on the sixth ballot. On the seventh ballot, Hayes was nominated for president with 384 votes, compared to 351 for Blaine and 21 for Benjamin Bristow. New York Representative William A. Wheeler was nominated for vice president by a much larger margin (366\u201389) over his chief rival, Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen, who later served as a member of the Electoral Commission, which awarded the election to Hayes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Republican Presidential Nomination Vote by State Delegation By Ballot\nResults by state.\nSource: Data from Walter Dean Burnham, \"Presidential ballots, 1836\u20131892\" (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1955) pp 247\u201357.\nClose states.\nMargin of victory less than 1% (7 electoral votes):\nMargin of victory less between 1% and 5% (164 electoral votes):\nMargin of victory between 5% and 10% (33 electoral votes):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "40405", "revid": "7125342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40405", "title": "George Whitefield", "text": "English cleric and preacher (1714\u20131770)\nGeorge Whitefield (; 27 December\u00a0[O.S. 16 December]\u00a01714\u00a0\u2013 30 September 1770), also known as George Whitfield, was an English Anglican priest and preacher who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement. \nBorn in Gloucester, he matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1732. There, he joined the \"Holy Club\" and was introduced to John and Charles Wesley, with whom he would work closely in his later ministry. Unlike the Wesleys, he embraced Calvinism.\nWhitefield was ordained after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree. He immediately began preaching, but he did not settle as the minister of any Church of England parish; rather, he became an itinerant preacher and evangelist. In 1740, Whitefield traveled to British North America where he preached a series of Christian revivals that became part of the Great Awakening. His methods were controversial, and he engaged in numerous debates and disputes with other clergymen.\nWhitefield received widespread recognition during his ministry; he preached at least 18,000 times to perhaps ten million listeners in the British Empire. Whitefield could enthrall large audiences through a potent combination of drama, religious eloquence, and patriotism.\nEarly life.\nWhitefield was born on 27 December\u00a0[O.S. 16 December]\u00a01714 at the Bell Inn, Southgate Street, Gloucester. Whitefield was the fifth son (seventh and last child) of Thomas Whitefield and Elizabeth Edwards, who kept an inn at Gloucester. His father died when George was two years old, and he subsequently helped his mother with the inn. At an early age, he found that he had a passion and talent for acting in the theatre, a passion that he would carry on with the very theatrical re-enactments of Bible stories he told during his sermons. He was educated at The Crypt School in Gloucester and at Pembroke College, Oxford.\nBecause business at the inn had diminished, Whitefield did not have the means to pay for his tuition. He therefore came up to the University of Oxford as a servitor, the lowest rank of undergraduates. Granted free tuition, he acted as a servant to fellows and fellow-commoners; duties including teaching them in the morning, helping them bathe, cleaning their rooms, carrying their books, and assisting them with work. Whitfield would later confess that though he did good works and tried to obey the law of God, he was not yet truly converted to Christ. It was Henry Scougal's book \"The Life of God in the Soul of Man\" that Whitfield says opened his eyes to the Gospel and led to his conversion. It was that book, he said, that God used to show him that he was still lost despite all his attempts to gain the favor of God by means of good works. Only by God's grace can a person realize they have offended God and realize also their need for Jesus Christ, God's Son, and His righteousness imputed to them by faith. Scougal's book showed him the need for a man to be born of God from above, and that this is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit creating a new heart and a new nature within that wants to serve God, not in order to be saved, but because one has been already graciously and undeservedly saved. In 1736, after Whitfield's conversion, the Bishop of Gloucester ordained him a deacon of the Church of England.\nEvangelism.\nWhitefield preached his first sermon at St Mary de Crypt Church in his home town of Gloucester, a week after his ordination as deacon. The Church of England did not assign him a church, so he began preaching in parks and fields in England on his own, reaching out to people who normally did not attend church.\nIn 1738 he went to Christ Church in Savannah, Province of Georgia, in the American colonies which had been founded by John Wesley. While there Whitefield decided that one of the great needs of the area was an orphan house. He decided this would be his life's work. In 1739 he returned to England to raise funds, as well as to receive priest's orders. While preparing for his return, he preached to large congregations. At the suggestion of friends he preached to the miners of Kingswood, outside Bristol, in the open air. Because he was returning to Georgia he invited John Wesley to take over his Bristol congregations and to preach in the open air for the first time at Kingswood and then at Blackheath, London.\nWhitefield, like many other 18th-century Anglican evangelicals such as Augustus Toplady, John Newton, and William Romaine, accepted a plain reading of Article 17\u2014the Church of England's doctrine of predestination\u2014and disagreed with the Wesley brothers' Arminian views on the doctrine of the atonement. However, Whitefield finally did what his friends hoped he would not do\u2014hand over the entire ministry to John Wesley. Whitefield formed and was the president of the first Methodist conference, but he soon relinquished the position to concentrate on evangelistic work.\nThree churches were established in England in his name\u2014one in Penn Street, Bristol, and two in London, in Moorfields and in Tottenham Court Road\u2014all three of which became known by the name of \"Whitefield's Tabernacle\". The society meeting at the second Kingswood School at Kingswood was eventually also named Whitefield's Tabernacle. Whitefield acted as chaplain to Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, and some of his followers joined the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, whose chapels were built by Selina, where a form of Calvinistic Methodism similar to Whitefield's was taught. Many of Selina's chapels were built in the English and Welsh counties, and one, Spa Fields Chapel, was erected in London.\nBethesda Orphanage.\nWhitefield's endeavour to build an orphanage in Georgia was central to his preaching. The Bethesda Orphanage and his preaching comprised the \"two-fold task\" that occupied the rest of his life. On 25 March 1740, construction began. Whitefield wanted the orphanage to be a place of strong Gospel influence, with a wholesome atmosphere and strong discipline. Having raised the money by his preaching, Whitefield \"insisted on sole control of the orphanage\". He refused to give the trustees a financial accounting. The trustees also objected to Whitefield's using \"a wrong method\" to control the children, who \"are often kept praying and crying all the night\".\nIn 1740 he engaged Moravian Brethren from Georgia to build an orphanage for negro children on land he had bought in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. Following a theological disagreement, he dismissed them and was unable to complete the building, which the Moravians subsequently bought and completed. This now is the Whitefield House in the center of the Moravian borough of Nazareth, Pennsylvania.\nRevival meetings.\nBeginning in 1740, Whitefield preached nearly every day for months to large crowds as large as eighty thousand people as he travelled throughout the colonies, especially New England. His journey on horseback from New York City to Charleston, South Carolina, was at that time the longest in North America ever documented. Like Jonathan Edwards, he developed a style of preaching that elicited emotional responses from his audiences. But Whitefield had charisma, and his loud voice, his small stature, and even his cross-eyed appearance (which some people took as a mark of divine favor) all served to help make him one of the first celebrities in the American colonies. Like Edwards, Whitefield preached staunchly Calvinist theology that was in line with the \"moderate Calvinism\" of the Thirty-nine Articles. While explicitly affirming God's sole agency in salvation, Whitefield freely offered the Gospel, saying at the end of his sermons: \"Come poor, lost, undone sinner, come just as you are to Christ.\"\nTo Whitefield \"the gospel message was so critically important that he felt compelled to use all earthly means to get the word out.\" Thanks to widespread dissemination of print media, perhaps half of all colonists eventually heard about, read about, or read something written by Whitefield. He employed print systematically, sending advance men to put up broadsides and distribute handbills announcing his sermons. He also arranged to have his sermons published. Much of Whitefield's publicity was the work of William Seward, a wealthy layman who accompanied Whitefield. Seward acted as Whitefield's \"fund-raiser, business co-ordinator, and publicist\". He furnished newspapers and booksellers with material, including copies of Whitefield's writings.\nWhen Whitefield returned to England in 1742, an estimated crowd of 20\u201330,000 met him. One such open-air congregation took place on Minchinhampton Common, Gloucestershire. Whitefield preached to the \"Rodborough congregation\"\u2014a gathering of 10,000 people\u2014at a place now known as \"Whitefield's tump\". Whitefield sought to influence the colonies after he returned to England. He contracted to have his autobiographical \"Journals\" published throughout America. These \"Journals\" have been characterized as \"the ideal vehicle for crafting a public image that could work in his absence.\" They depicted Whitefield in the \"best possible light\". When he returned to America for his third tour in 1745, he was better known than when he had left.\nSlaveholder.\nWhitefield was a plantation owner and slaveholder and viewed the work of slaves as essential for funding his orphanage's operations. John Wesley denounced slavery as \"the sum of all villainies\" and detailed its abuses. However, defenses of slavery were common among 18th-century Protestants, especially missionaries who used the institution to emphasize God's providence. Whitefield was at first conflicted about slaves. He believed that they were human and was angered that they were treated as \"subordinate creatures\". Nevertheless, Whitefield and his friend James Habersham played an important role in the reintroduction of slavery to Georgia. Slavery had been outlawed in the young colony of Georgia in 1735. In 1747, Whitefield attributed the financial woes of his Bethesda Orphanage to Georgia's prohibition of black people in the colony. He argued that \"the constitution of that colony [Georgia] is very bad, and it is impossible for the inhabitants to subsist\" while blacks were banned. Though he was a big advocate for being against slavery he still owned over 70+ slaves that were mostly women of color and more than a few African-American men.\nAdvocate of slavery.\nBetween 1748 and 1750, Whitefield campaigned for the legalization of African-American emigration into the colony because the trustees of Georgia had banned slavery. Whitefield argued that the colony would never be prosperous unless slaves were allowed to farm the land. Whitefield wanted slavery legalized for the prosperity of the colony as well as for the financial viability of the Bethesda Orphanage. \"Had Negroes been allowed\" to live in Georgia, he said, \"I should now have had a sufficiency to support a great many orphans without expending above half the sum that has been laid out.\" Whitefield's push for the legalization of slave emigration to Georgia \"cannot be explained solely on the basics of economics\". It was also his hope for their adoption and for their eternal salvation.\nBlack slaves were permitted to live in Georgia in 1751. Whitefield saw the \"legalization of (black residency) as part personal victory and part divine will\". Whitefield argued a scriptural justification for black residency as slaves. He increased the number of the black children at his orphanage, using his preaching to raise money to house them. Whitefield became \"perhaps the most energetic, and conspicuous, evangelical defender and practitioner of the rights of black people\". By propagating such \"a theological defense for \"black residency, Whitefield helped slaveholders prosper. Upon his death, Whitefield left everything in the orphanage to the Countess of Huntingdon. This included 4,000 acres of land and 49 black slaves.\nOn the Excesses of Slavery.\nIn 1740, during his second visit to America, Whitefield published \"an open letter to the planters of South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland \"chastising them for their cruelty to their slaves. He wrote, \"I think God has a Quarrel with you for your Abuse of and Cruelty to the poor Negroes.\" Furthermore, Whitefield wrote: \"Your dogs are caressed and fondled at your tables; but your slaves who are frequently styled dogs or beasts, have not an equal privilege.\" However, Whitefield \"stopped short of rendering a moral judgment on slavery itself as an institution\".\nWhitefield is remembered as one of the first to preach to slaves. Some have claimed that the Bethesda Orphanage \"set an example of humane treatment\" of black people. Phillis Wheatley (1753\u20131784), who was a slave, wrote a poem \"On the Death of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield\" in 1770. The first line calls Whitefield a \"happy saint\".\nRelationship with Benjamin Franklin.\nBenjamin Franklin attended a revival meeting in Philadelphia and was greatly impressed with Whitefield's ability to deliver a message to such a large group. Franklin had previously dismissed as exaggeration reports of Whitefield preaching to crowds of the order of tens of thousands in England. When listening to Whitefield preaching from the Philadelphia court house, Franklin walked away towards his shop in Market Street until he could no longer hear Whitefield distinctly\u2014Whitefield could be heard over 500 feet. He then estimated his distance from Whitefield and calculated the area of a semicircle centred on Whitefield. Allowing two square feet per person he computed that Whitefield could be heard by over 30,000 people in the open air. After one of Whitefield's sermons, Franklin noted the:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;wonderful ... change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it seem'd as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street.\nFranklin was an ecumenist and approved of Whitefield's appeal to members of many denominations but unlike Whitefield was not an evangelical. He admired Whitefield as a fellow intellectual, and published several of his tracts, but thought Whitefield's plan to run an orphanage in Georgia would lose money. A lifelong close friendship developed between the revivalist preacher and the worldly Franklin. True loyalty based on genuine affection, coupled with a high value placed on friendship, helped their association grow stronger over time. Letters exchanged between Franklin and Whitefield can be found at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. These letters document the creation of an orphanage for boys named the Charity School. In 1749, Franklin chose the Whitefield meeting house, with its Charity School, to be purchased as the site of the newly-formed Academy of Philadelphia which opened in 1751, followed in 1755 with the College of Philadelphia, both the predecessors of the University of Pennsylvania.\nMarriage.\n\"I believe it is God's will that I should marry\", George Whitefield wrote to a friend in 1740. But he was concerned: \"I pray God that I may not have a wife till I can live as though I had none.\" That ambivalence\u2014believing God willed a wife, yet wanting to live as if without one\u2014brought Whitefield a disappointing love life and a largely unhappy marriage.\nOn 14 November 1741 Whitefield married Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Gwynne), a widow previously known as Elizabeth James. After their 1744\u20131748 stay in America, she never accompanied him on his travels. Whitefield reflected that \"none in America could bear her\". His wife believed that she had been \"but a load and burden\" to him. In 1743 after four miscarriages, Elizabeth bore the couple's fifth child, and the only to survive to birth, a son. The baby died at four months old. Twenty-five years later, Elizabeth died of a fever on 9 August 1768 and was buried in a vault at the Tottenham Court Road Chapel. At the end of the 19th century the Chapel needed restoration and all those interred there, except Augustus Toplady, were moved to Chingford Mount cemetery in north London; her grave is unmarked in its new location.\nCornelius Winter, who for a time lived with the Whitefields, observed of Whitefield, \"He was not happy in his wife.\" And, \"He did not intentionally make his wife unhappy. He always preserved great decency and decorum in his conduct towards her. Her death set his mind much at liberty.\" After Elizabeth's death, however, Whitfield said, \u201cI feel the loss of my right hand daily.\u201d\nDeath and legacy.\nIn 1770, the 55-year-old Whitefield continued preaching in spite of poor health. He said, \"I would rather wear out than rust out.\" His last sermon was preached in a field \"atop a large barrel\". The next morning, 30 September 1770, Whitefield died in the parsonage of Old South Presbyterian Church, Newburyport, Massachusetts, and was buried, according to his wishes, in a crypt under the pulpit of this church. A bust of Whitefield is in the collection of the Gloucester City Museum &amp; Art Gallery.\nIt was John Wesley who preached his funeral sermon in London, at Whitefield's request.\nWhitefield left almost \u00a31,500 () to friends and family. Furthermore, he had deposited \u00a31,000 () for his wife if he predeceased her and had contributed \u00a33,300 () to the Bethesda Orphanage. \"Questions concerning the source of his personal wealth dogged his memory. His will stated that all this money had lately been left him 'in a most unexpected way and unthought of means.'\"\nIn an age when crossing the Atlantic Ocean was a long and hazardous adventure, he visited America seven times, making 13 ocean crossings in total. (He died in America.) It is estimated that throughout his life, he preached more than 18,000 formal sermons, of which 78 have been published. In addition to his work in North America and England, he made 15 journeys to Scotland\u2014most famously to the \"Preaching Braes\" of Cambuslang in 1742\u2014two journeys to Ireland, and one each to Bermuda, Gibraltar, and the Netherlands. In England and Wales, Whitefield's itinerary included every county.\nWhitfield County, Georgia, is named after Whitefield. When the act by the Georgia General Assembly was written to create the county, the \"e\" was omitted from the spelling of the name to reflect the pronunciation of the name.\nA statue of George Whitefield was erected on the Philadelphia campus of the University of Pennsylvania in 1919 and removed in 2020.\nGeorge Whitefield College, Whitefield College of the Bible, and Whitefield Theological Seminary are all named after him. The Banner of Truth Trust's logo depicts Whitefield preaching.\n summarizes Whitefield's legacy.\nMark Galli wrote of Whitefield's legacy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;George Whitefield was probably the most famous religious figure of the eighteenth century. Newspapers called him the 'marvel of the age'. Whitefield was a preacher capable of commanding thousands on two continents through the sheer power of his oratory. In his lifetime, he preached at least 18,000 times to perhaps 10 million hearers.\nRelation to other Methodist leaders.\nIn terms of theology, Whitefield, unlike Wesley, was a supporter of Calvinism. The two differed on eternal election, final perseverance, and sanctification, but were reconciled as friends and co-workers, each going his own way. It is a prevailing misconception that Whitefield was not primarily an organizer like Wesley. However, as Luke Tyerman, a historian of Wesley, states, \"It is notable that the first Calvinistic Methodist Association was held eighteen months before Wesley held his first Methodist Conference.\" He was a man of profound experience, which he communicated to audiences with clarity and passion. His patronization by Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, reflected this emphasis on practice.\nOpposition and controversy.\nWhitefield welcomed opposition because as he said, \"the more I am opposed, the more joy I feel\". He proved himself adept at creating controversy. In his 1740 visit to Charles Town, it \"took Whitefield only four days to plunge Charles Town into religious and social controversy.\" Whitefield thought he might be martyred for his views. After he attacked the established church he predicted that he would \"be set at nought by the Rabbies of our Church, and perhaps at last be killed by them\".\nClergy.\nWhitefield chastised other clergy for teaching only \"the shell and shadow of religion\" because they did not hold the necessity of a new birth, without which a person would be \"thrust down into Hell\". In his 1740\u201341 visit to North America (as he had done in England), he attacked other clergy (mostly Anglican) calling them \"God's persecutors\". He said that Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London with supervision over Anglican clergy in America, knew no \"more of Christianity, than Mahaomet, or an Infidel\". After Whitefield preached at St. Philip's Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina, the Commissary, Alexander Garden, suspended him as a \"vagabond clergyman.\" After being suspended, Whitefield attacked all South Carolina's Anglican clergy in print. Whitefield issued a blanket indictment of New England's Congregational ministers for their \"lack of zeal\".\nIn 1740, Whitefield published attacks on \"the works of two of Anglicanism's revered seventeenth-century authors\". Whitefield wrote that John Tillotson, archbishop of Canterbury (1691\u20131694), had \"no more been a true Christian than had Muhammad\". He also attacked Richard Allestree's \"The Whole Duty of Man\", one of Anglicanism's most popular spiritual tracts. At least once Whitefield had his followers burn the tract \"with great Detestation\". In England and Scotland (1741\u20131744), Whitefield bitterly accused John Wesley of undermining his work. He preached against Wesley, arguing that Wesley's attacks on predestination had alienated \"very many of my spiritual children\". Wesley replied that Whitefield's attacks were \"treacherous\" and that Whitefield had made himself \"odious and contemptible\". However, the two reconciled in later life. Along with Wesley, Whitefield had been influenced by the Moravian Church, but in 1753 he condemned them and attacked their leader, Count Nicolaus Zinzendorf, and their practices. When Joseph Trapp criticized Whitefield's \"Journals\", Whitefield retorted that Trapp was \"no Christian but a servant of Satan\".\nEnglish, Scottish, and American clergy attacked Whitefield, often in response to his attacks on them and Anglicanism. Early in his career, Whitefield criticized the Church of England. In response, clergy called Whitefield one of \"the young quacks in divinity\" who are \"breaking the peace and unity\" of the church. From 1738 to 1741, Whitefield issued seven \"Journals\". A sermon in St Paul's Cathedral depicted them as \"a medley of vanity, and nonsense, and blasphemy jumbled together\". Trapp called the \"Journals\" \"blasphemous\" and accused Whitefield of being \"besotted either with pride or madness\". In England, by 1739 when he was ordained priest, Whitefield wrote that \"the spirit of the clergy began to be much embittered\" and that \"churches were gradually denied me\". In response to Whitefield's \"Journals\", the bishop of London, Edmund Gibson, published a 1739 pastoral letter criticizing Whitefield. Whitefield responded by labelling Anglican clergy as \"lazy, non-spiritual, and pleasure seeking\". He rejected ecclesiastical authority claiming that 'the whole world is now my parish'.\nIn 1740, Whitefield had attacked Tillotson and Richard Allestree's \"The Whole Duty of Man\". These attacks resulted in hostile responses and reduced attendance at his London open-air preaching. In 1741, Whitefield made his first visit to Scotland at the invitation of \"Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine, leaders of the breakaway Associate Presbytery. When they demanded and Whitefield refused that he preach only in their churches, they attacked him as a \"sorcerer\" and a \"vain-glorious, self-seeking, puffed-up creature\". In addition, Whitefield's collecting money for his Bethesda orphanage, combined with the hysteria evoked by his open-air sermons, resulted in bitter attacks in Edinburgh and Glasgow.\"\nWhitefield's itinerant preaching throughout the colonies was opposed by Bishop Benson who had ordained him for a settled ministry in Georgia. Whitefield replied that if bishops did not authorize his itinerant preaching, God would give him the authority. In 1740, Jonathan Edwards invited Whitefield to preach in his church in Northampton. Edwards was \"deeply disturbed by his unqualified appeals to emotion, his openly judging those he considered unconverted, and his demand for instant conversions\". Whitefield refused to discuss Edwards' misgivings with him. Later, Edwards delivered a series of sermons containing but \"thinly veiled critiques\" of Whitefield's preaching, \"warning against over-dependence upon a preacher's eloquence and fervency\". During Whitefield's 1744\u20131748 visit to America, ten critical pamphlets were published, two by officials of Harvard and Yale. This criticism was in part evoked by Whitefield's criticism of \"their education and Christian commitment\" in his Journal of 1741. Whitefield saw this opposition as \"a conspiracy\" against him. Whitefield would be derided with names such as \"Dr. Squintum\", mocking him for his esotropia.\nLaity.\nWhen Whitefield preached in a dissenting church and \"the congregation's response was dismal,\" he ascribed the response to \"the people's being hardened\" as were \"Pharaoh and the Egyptians\" in the Bible.\nMany New Englanders claimed that Whitefield destroyed \"New England's orderly parish system, communities, and even families\". The \"Declaration of the Association of the County of New Haven, 1745\" stated that after Whitefield's preaching \"religion is now in a far worse state than it was\". After Whitefield preached in Charlestown, a local newspaper article attacked him as \"blasphemous, uncharitable, and unreasonable.\" After Whitefield condemned Moravians and their practices, his former London printer (a Moravian) called Whitefield \"a Mahomet, a Caesar, an imposter, a Don Quixote, a devil, the beast, the man of sin, the Antichrist\".\nIn the open air in Dublin, Ireland (1757), Whitefield condemned Roman Catholicism, inciting an attack by \"hundreds and hundreds of papists\" who cursed and wounded him severely and smashed his portable pulpit. On various occasions, a woman assaulted Whitefield with \"scissors and a pistol, and her teeth\". \"Stones and dead cats\" were thrown at him. A man almost killed him with a brass-headed cane. \"Another climbed a tree to urinate on him.\" In 1760, Whitefield was burlesqued by Samuel Foote in \"The Minor\".\nNobility.\nSelina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, made Whitefield her personal chaplain. In her chapel, it was noted that his preaching was \"more Considered among persons of a Superior Rank\" who attended the countess's services. Whitefield was humble before the countess saying that he cried when he was \"thinking of your Ladyship's condescending to patronize such a dead dog as I am\". He now said that he \"highly esteemed bishops of the Church of England because of their sacred character\". He confessed that in \"many things\" he had \"judged and acted wrong\" and had \"been too bitter in my zeal\". In 1763, in a defense of Methodism, Whitefield \"repeated contrition for much contained in his \"Journals\"\".\nAmong the nobility who heard Whitefield in the Countess of Huntingdon's home was Lady Townshend. Regarding the changes in Whitefield, someone asked Lady Townshend, \"Pray, madam, is it true that Whitefield has \"recanted\"?\" She replied, \"No, sir, he has only \"canted\".\" One meaning of cant is \"to affect religious or pietistic phraseology, especially as a matter of fashion or profession; to talk unreally or hypocritically with an affectation of goodness or piety\".\nReligious innovation.\nIn the First Great Awakening, rather than listening demurely to preachers, people groaned and roared in enthusiastic emotion. Whitefield was a \"passionate preacher\" who often \"shed tears\". Underlying this was his conviction that genuine religion \"engaged the heart, not just the head\". In his preaching, Whitefield used rhetorical ploys that were characteristic of theater, an artistic medium largely unknown in colonial America. Harry S. Stout refers to him as a \"divine dramatist\" and ascribes his success to the theatrical sermons which laid foundations to a new form of pulpit oratory. Whitefield's \"Abraham Offering His Son Isaac\" is an example of a sermon whose whole structure resembles a theatrical play.\nDivinity schools opened to challenge the hegemony of Yale and Harvard; personal experience became more important than formal education for preachers. Such concepts and habits formed a necessary foundation for the American Revolution. Whitefield's preaching bolstered \"the evolving republican ideology that sought local democratic control of civil affairs and freedom from monarchial and parliamentary intrusion.\"\nWorks.\nWhitefield's sermons were widely reputed to inspire his audience's devotion. Many of them, as well as his letters and journals, were published during his lifetime. He was an excellent orator as well, strong in voice and adept at extemporaneity. His voice was so expressive that people are said to have wept just hearing him allude to \"Mesopotamia\". His journals, originally intended only for private circulation, were first published by Thomas Cooper. James Hutton then published a version with Whitefield's approval. His exuberant and \"too apostolical\" language were criticised; his journals were no longer published after 1741.\nWhitefield prepared a new installment in 1744\u201345, but it was not published until 1938. 19th-century biographies generally refer to his earlier work, \"A Short Account of God's Dealings with the Reverend George Whitefield\" (1740), which covered his life up to his ordination. In 1747 he published \"A Further Account of God's Dealings with the Reverend George Whitefield\", covering the period from his ordination to his first voyage to Georgia. In 1756, a vigorously edited version of his journals and autobiographical accounts was published. Whitefield was \"profoundly image-conscious\". His writings were \"intended to convey Whitefield and his life as a model for biblical ethics ... , as humble and pious\".\nAfter Whitefield's death, John Gillies, a Glasgow friend, published a memoir and six volumes of works, comprising three volumes of letters, a volume of tracts, and two volumes of sermons. Another collection of sermons was published just before he left London for the last time in 1769. These were disowned by Whitefield and Gillies, who tried to buy all copies and pulp them. They had been taken down in shorthand, but Whitefield said that they made him say nonsense on occasion. These sermons were included in a 19th-century volume, \"Sermons on Important Subjects\", along with the \"approved\" sermons from the \"Works\". An edition of the journals, in one volume, was edited by William Wale in 1905. This was reprinted with additional material in 1960 by the Banner of Truth Trust. It lacks the Bermuda journal entries found in Gillies' biography and the quotes from manuscript journals found in 19th-century biographies. A comparison of this edition with the original 18th-century publications shows numerous omissions\u2014some minor and a few major.\nWhitefield also wrote several hymns and revised one by Charles Wesley. Wesley composed a hymn in 1739, \"Hark, how all the welkin rings\"; Whitefield revised the opening couplet in 1758 for \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the father of King Harald II of Denmark, King Cnut the Great, and Queen Estrid Svendsdatter.\nIn the mid-980s, Swein revolted against his father, Harald Bluetooth, and seized the throne. Harald was driven into exile and died shortly afterwards in November 986 or 987. In 1000, with the allegiance of Eric, Earl of Lade, Swein ruled most of Norway. In 1013, shortly before his death, he became the first Danish king of the English after a long effort.\nLife.\nHistoriographical sources on Swein's life include the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (where his name is rendered as \"Swegen\"), Adam of Bremen's 11th-century \"Deeds of the Bishops of Hamburg\", and Snorri Sturluson's 13th-century \"Heimskringla\". Conflicting accounts of Swein's later life also appear in the \"Encomium Emmae Reginae\", an 11th-century Latin \"encomium\" in honour of his son king Cnut's queen Emma of Normandy, along with \"Chronicon ex chronicis\" by Florence of Worcester, another 11th-century author.\nAccording to Adam of Bremen, Swein was the son of Harald Bluetooth and a woman named \"Gunhild\". When Harald converted to Christianity, Swein was baptised \"Otto\" (in honour of German king Otto I).\nSwein married the widow of Erik, king of Sweden, named \"Gunhild\" in some sources, or identified as an unnamed sister of Boleslaus, ruler of Poland.\nHistorian Ian Howard describes Swein as \"a competent military commander, politician and diplomat\" who made \"a formidable and successful king.\"\nRevolt and possible exile.\nIn the mid-980s, Swein revolted against his father and seized the throne. Harald was driven into exile and died shortly afterwards in November 986 or 987.\nAdam of Bremen depicted Swein as a rebellious pagan who persecuted Christians, betrayed his father and expelled German bishops from Scania and Zealand. According to Adam, Swein was sent into exile by his father's German friends and deposed in favour of king Eric the Victorious of Sweden, whom Adam wrote ruled Denmark until his death in 994 or 995. S\u00f8rensen (2001) argues that Adam's depiction of Swein may be overly negative, as seen through an \"unsympathetic and intolerant eye\".\nAdam's account is thus not seen as entirely reliable; the claimed 14 years' exile of Swein to Scotland does not seem to agree with Swein's building churches in Denmark throughout the same period, including the churches in Lund and Roskilde. According to Adam, Swein was punished by God for leading the uprising which led to king Harald's death, and had to spend fourteen years abroad (i.e. 986\u20131000). The historicity of this exile, or its duration, is uncertain. Adam writes that Swein was shunned by all those with whom he sought refuge, but was finally allowed to live for a while in Scotland. Adam also suggests that Swein in his youth lived among heathens, and only achieved success as a ruler after accepting Christianity.\nBattle of Svolder.\nHarald Bluetooth had already established a foothold in Norway, controlling Viken in c.\u2009970. He may have lost control over his Norwegian claims following his defeat against a German army in 974.\nSwein built an alliance with Swedish king Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung and Eirik H\u00e1konarson, Jarl of Lade, against Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason.\nThe Kings' sagas ascribe the causes of the alliance to Olaf Tryggvason's ill-fated marriage proposal to Sigrid the Haughty and his problematic marriage to Thyri, sister of Swein Forkbeard. According to the sagas, Sigrid pushed Swein into war with Olaf because Olaf had slapped her.\nThe allies attacked and defeated king Olaf in the western Baltic Sea when he was sailing home from an expedition, in the Battle of Svolder, fought in September 999 or 1000. The victors divided Norway among them. According to the account of the \"Heimskringla\", Swein regained direct control of Viken district.\nKing Olof of Sweden received four districts in Trondheim as well as M\u00f8re, Romsdal and R\u00e5nrike (the \"Fagrskinna\", by contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland and a part of Trondheim). He gave these to his son in law, Jarl Svein H\u00e1konarson, to hold as a vassal. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik H\u00e1konarson as King Svein's vassal.\nThe Jarls Eirik and Svein proved strong, competent rulers, and their reign was prosperous. Most sources say that they adopted Christianity but allowed the people religious freedom, leading to a backlash against Christianity which undid much of Olaf Tryggvason's missionary work.\nReligion.\nSwein apparently recruited priests and bishops from England, in preference to the Archbishopric of Bremen. In part, this reflected the fact that there were numerous Christian priests of Danish origin in the Danelaw, while Swein had few personal connections to Germany. Swein's preference for the English church may also have had a political motive, because German bishops were an integral part of the state. It has been suggested that Swein was seeking to pre-empt any diminution of his independence by German leaders. This may have been a reason for Adam of Bremen's apparent hostility in his accounts of Swein; by accentuating English ecclesiastical influence in his kingdom, Swein was effectively spurning the Archbishop of Bremen.\nInvasions of England.\nThe \"Chronicle of John of Wallingford\" (c. 1225\u20131250) records Swein's involvement in raids against England during 1002\u20131005, 1006\u20131007 and 1009\u20131012. According to Ashley (1998), Swein's invasion was partly motivated by the St Brice's Day Massacre in November 1002, where Danes in England were massacred under orders from \u00c6thelred the Unready, in which Swein's sister and brother-in-law are said to have been killed, but Lund (2001) argues that the main motivation for the raids was more likely the prospect of revenue.\nAt the outset of the invasions, Swein negotiated an agreement with Duke Richard II of Normandy whereby the Danes gained permission to sell their spoils of war in Normandy.\nSwein campaigned in Wessex and East Anglia in 1003\u20131004, but a famine forced him to return to Denmark in 1005. Further raids took place in 1006\u20131007, and in 1009\u20131012 Thorkell the Tall led a Viking invasion into England. Simon Keynes regards it as uncertain whether Swein supported these invasions, but \"whatever the case, he was quick to exploit the disruption caused by the activities of Thorkell's army\".\nSwein acquired massive sums of \"Danegeld\" through the raids. In 1013, he is reported to have personally led his forces in a full-scale invasion of England.\nThe medieval \"Peterborough Chronicle\" (part of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\") states:\nbefore the month of August came king Swein with his fleet to Sandwich. He went very quickly about East Anglia into the Humber's mouth, and so upward along the Trent till he came to Gainsborough. Earl Uchtred and all Northumbria quickly bowed to him, as did all the people of the Kingdom of Lindsey, then the people of the Five Boroughs. He was given hostages from each shire. When he understood that all the people had submitted to him, he bade that his force should be provisioned and horsed; he went south with the main part of the invasion force, while some of the invasion force, as well as the hostages, were with his son Cnut. After he came over Watling Street, they went to Oxford, and the town-dwellers soon bowed to him, and gave hostages. From there they went to Winchester, and the people did the same, then eastward to London.\nBut the Londoners put up a strong resistance, because King \u00c6thelred and Thorkell the Tall, a Viking leader who had defected to \u00c6thelred, personally held their ground against him in London itself. Swein then went west to Bath, where the western thanes submitted to him and gave hostages. The Londoners then followed suit, fearing Swein's revenge if they resisted any longer. King \u00c6thelred sent his sons Edward and Alfred to Normandy, and himself spent Christmas on the Isle of Wight, and then followed them into exile.\nBased in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, Swein began to organise his vast new kingdom, but he died there on 3 February 1014, having ruled England for only five weeks. Swein's cause of death is unknown. Some theorise that he was killed, whereas other sources say he died after falling off a horse. His embalmed body was returned to Denmark for burial in the church he had built. Tradition locates this church in Roskilde, but it is more plausible that it was actually located in Lund in Scania (now part of Sweden).\nAftermath.\nSwein's elder son, Harald II, succeeded him as King of Denmark, while his younger son, Cnut, was proclaimed King of England by the people of the Danelaw. However, the English nobility sent for \u00c6thelred, who upon his return from exile in Normandy in early 1014 managed to drive Cnut out of England. Cnut soon returned and became king of all England in 1016, following the deaths of \u00c6thelred and his son Edmund Ironside; he succeeded his brother as King of Denmark in 1019 and eventually also ruled Norway, parts of Sweden, Pomerania and Schleswig.\nCnut and his sons, Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut, ruled England over a combined 26-year period (1016\u20131042). After Harthacnut's death, the English throne reverted to the House of Wessex under \u00c6thelred's younger son Edward the Confessor (reigned 1042\u20131066).\nSwein's daughter, Estrid Svendsdatter, was the mother of King Sweyn II of Denmark. Her descendants continue to reign in Denmark to this day.\nIssue.\nThe \"Chronicon\" of Thietmar of Merseburg and the \"Encomium Emmae\" report Cnut's mother as having been \u015awi\u0119tos\u0142awa, a daughter of Mieszko I of Poland. Norse sources of the High Middle Ages, most prominently \"Heimskringla\" by Snorri Sturluson, also give a Polish princess as Cnut's mother, whom they call Gunhild and a daughter of Burislav, the king of Vindland. Since in the Norse sagas the king of Vindland is always Burislav, this is reconcilable with the assumption that her father was Mieszko (not his son Boles\u0142aw). Adam of Bremen in \"Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum\" is unique in equating Cnut's mother (for whom he also produced no name) with the former queen of Sweden, wife of Eric the Victorious and by this marriage mother of Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung. To complicate the matter, Heimskringla and other sagas also have Swein marrying Eric's widow, but she is distinctly another person in these texts, named Sigrid the Haughty, whom Swein married only after Gunhild, the Slavic princess who bore Cnut, had died. Different theories regarding the number and ancestry of Swein's wives (or wife) have been advanced (see Sigrid the Haughty and Gunhild). But since Adam is the only source to equate the identity of Cnut's and Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung's mother, this is often seen as an error on Adam's part, and it is often assumed that Swein had two wives, the first being Cnut's mother, and the second being the former Queen of Sweden. Cnut's brother Harald was the younger of the two brothers, according to \"Encomium Emmae.\"\nSwein had seven children with Sigrid the Haughty and Gunhild of Wenden:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The islands form part of the archipelago of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch, and the Sea of the Hebrides. The Outer Hebrides are considered to be the traditional heartland of the Gaelic language. The islands form one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, which since 1998 has used only the Gaelic form of its name, including in English language contexts. The council area is called Na h-Eileanan an Iar ('the Western Isles') and its council is ('Council of the Western Isles').\nMost of the islands have a bedrock formed from ancient metamorphic rocks, and the climate is mild and oceanic. The 19 inhabited islands had an estimated population of 26,020 in 2024, and there are more than 50 substantial uninhabited islands. The distance from Barra Head to the Butt of Lewis is roughly .\nThere are various important prehistoric structures, many of which pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. The Western Isles became part of the Norse kingdom of the \"\", which lasted for over 400 years, until sovereignty over the Outer Hebrides was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs, principal amongst whom were the MacLeods, MacDonalds, and the MacNeils. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities, and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline. Much of the land is now under local control, and commercial activity is based on tourism, crofting, fishing, and weaving.\nSea transport is crucial for those who live and work in the Outer Hebrides, and a variety of ferry services operate between the islands and to mainland Scotland. Modern navigation systems now minimise the dangers, but in the past the stormy seas in the region have claimed many ships. The Gaelic language, religion, music and sport are important aspects of local culture, and there are numerous designated conservation areas to protect the natural environment.\nEtymology.\nThe earliest surviving written references relating to the islands were made by Pliny the Elder in his \"Natural History\", in which he states that there are 30 ', and makes a separate reference to \"Dumna\", which Watson (1926) concludes is unequivocally the Outer Hebrides. Writing about 80 years later, in 140\u2013150 AD, Ptolemy, drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of , also distinguished between the ', of which he writes there were only five (and thus possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and . ' is cognate with the Early Celtic \"dumnos\" and means the \"deep-sea isle\". Pliny probably took his information from Pytheas of Massilia who visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC. It is possible that Ptolemy did as well, as Agricola's information about the west coast of Scotland was of poor quality. Breeze also suggests that might be Lewis and Harris, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides although he conflates this single island with the name \"Long Island\". Watson (1926) states that the meaning of Ptolemy's ' is unknown and that the root may be pre-Celtic. Murray (1966) claims that Ptolemy's ' was originally derived from the Old Norse ', meaning \"isles on the edge of the sea\". This idea is often repeated but no firm evidence of this derivation has emerged.\nOther early written references include the flight of the Nemed people from Ireland to \"Domon\", which is mentioned in the 12th-century ' and a 13th-century poem concerning , then the heir to the throne of Mann and the Isles, who is said to have \"broken the gate of '\". \"\" means \"the plain of Domhna (or Domon)\", but the precise meaning of the text is not clear.\nIn Irish mythology the islands were the home of the Fomorians, described as \"huge and ugly\" and \"ship men of the sea\". They were pirates, extracting tribute from the coasts of Ireland and one of their kings was (i.e. Indech, son of the goddess Domnu, who ruled over the deep seas).\nGeography.\nThe islands form an archipelago whose major islands are Lewis and Harris, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, and Barra. Lewis and Harris has an area of and is the largest island in Scotland and the third-largest in the British Isles, after Great Britain and Ireland. It incorporates Lewis in the north and Harris in the south, both of which are frequently referred to as individual islands, although they are connected by land. The island does not have a single name in either English or Gaelic, and is referred to as \"Lewis and Harris\", \"Lewis with Harris\", \"Harris with Lewis\" etc.\nThe largest islands are deeply indented by arms of the sea such as Loch R\u00f2g, Loch Seaforth and Loch nam Madadh. There are also more than 7,500 freshwater lochs in the Outer Hebrides, about 24% of the total for the whole of Scotland. North and South Uist and Lewis, in particular, have landscapes with a high percentage of fresh water and a maze and complexity of loch shapes. Harris has fewer large bodies of water but has innumerable small lochans. Loch Langavat on Lewis is long, and has several large islands in its midst, including Eilean M\u00f2r. Although Loch Suaineabhal has only 25% of Loch Langavat's surface area, it has a mean depth of and is the most voluminous on the island. Of Loch Sgadabhagh on North Uist it has been said that \"there is probably no other loch in Britain which approaches Loch Scadavay in irregularity and complexity of outline.\" Loch B\u00ec is South Uist's largest loch and at long it all but cuts the island in two.\nMuch of the western coastline of the islands is machair, a fertile low-lying dune pastureland. Lewis is comparatively flat, and largely consists of treeless moors of blanket peat. The highest eminence is Mealisval at in the south west. Most of Harris is mountainous, with large areas of exposed rock and Clisham, the archipelago's only Corbett, reaches in height. North and South Uist and Benbecula (sometimes collectively referred to as The Uists) have sandy beaches and wide cultivated areas of machair to the west and virtually uninhabited mountainous areas to the east. The highest peak here is Beinn Mh\u00f2r at . The Uists and their immediate outliers have a combined area of . This includes the Uists themselves and the islands linked to them by causeways and bridges. Barra is in extent and has a rugged interior, surrounded by machair and extensive beaches.\nThe scenic qualities of the islands are reflected in the fact that three of Scotland's forty national scenic areas (NSAs) are located here. The national scenic areas are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development, and are considered to represent the type of scenic beauty \"popularly associated with Scotland and for which it is renowned\". The three NSA within the Outer Hebrides are:\nFlora and fauna.\nMuch of the archipelago is a protected habitat, including both the islands and the surrounding waters. There are 53 Sites of Special Scientific Interest of which the largest are Loch an Duin, North Uist () and North Harris (). South Uist is considered the best place in the UK for the aquatic plant Slender Naiad, which is a European Protected Species.\nThere has been considerable controversy over hedgehogs on the Uists. Hedgehogs are not native to the islands but were introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden pests. Their spread posed a threat to the eggs of ground-nesting wading birds. In 2003 Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area, but these were halted in 2007; trapped animals are now relocated to the mainland.\nNationally important populations of breeding waders are present in the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The islands also provide a habitat for other important species such as corncrake, hen harrier, golden eagle and otter. Offshore, basking shark and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000\u00a0northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000\u00a0breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000\u00a0pairs of puffin and 67,000\u00a0northern fulmar pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important breeding ground for razorbills, with 9,514\u00a0pairs, 6.3% of the European population.\nThe bumblebee \"Bombus jonellus\" var. \"hebridensis\" is endemic to the Hebrides and there are local variants of the dark green fritillary and green-veined white butterflies. The St Kilda wren is a subspecies of wren whose range is confined to the islands whose name it bears.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe islands' total population was 26,502 at the 2001 census, and the 2011 figure was 27,684. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. By 2024 the population was 26,020. The largest settlement in the Outer Hebrides is Stornoway on Lewis, which has a population of about 8,100.\nThe population estimate for 2019 was 26,720 according to a Comhairle nan Eilean Siar report which added that \"the population of the Outer Hebrides is ageing\" and that \"young adults [...] leave the islands for further education or employment purposes\". Of the total population, 6,953 people reside in the \"Stornoway settlement Laxdale (Lacasdal), Sandwick (Sanndabhaig) and Newmarket\" with the balance distributed over 280 townships.\nIn addition to the major North Ford (\"\") and South Ford causeways that connect North Uist to Benbecula via the northern of the Grimsays, and another causeway from Benbecula to South Uist, several other islands are linked by smaller causeways or bridges. Great Bernera and Scalpay have bridge connections to Lewis and Harris respectively, with causeways linking Baleshare and Berneray to North Uist; Eriskay to South Uist; , and the southern Grimsay to Benbecula; and the Vatersay Causeway linking Vatersay to Barra. This means that all the inhabited islands are now connected to at least one other island by a land transport route.\nUninhabited islands.\nThere are more than fifty uninhabited islands greater in size than in the Outer Hebrides, including the Barra Isles, Flannan Isles, Monach Islands, the Shiant Islands and the islands of . In common with the other main island chains of Scotland, many of the more remote islands were abandoned during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since the prehistoric period. More than 35 such islands have been identified in the Outer Hebrides alone. On Barra Head, for example, Historic Scotland have identified eighty-three archaeological sites on the island, the majority being of a pre-medieval date. In the 18th century, the population was over fifty, but the last native islanders had left by 1931. The island became completely uninhabited by 1980 with the automation of the lighthouse.\nSome of the smaller islands continue to contribute to modern culture. The \"Mingulay Boat Song\", although evocative of island life, was written after the abandonment of the island in 1938 and Taransay hosted the BBC television series \"Castaway 2000\". Others have played a part in Scottish history. On 4 May 1746, the \"Young Pretender\" Charles Edward Stuart hid on with some of his men for four days whilst Royal Navy vessels patrolled the Minch.\nSmaller isles and skerries and other island groups pepper the North Atlantic surrounding the main islands. Some are not geologically part of the Outer Hebrides, but are administratively and in most cases culturally, part of . to the west of Lewis lies St Kilda, now uninhabited except for a small military base. A similar distance to the north of Lewis are North Rona and , two small and remote islands. While Rona used to support a small population who grew grain and raised cattle, is an inhospitable rock. Thousands of northern gannets nest here, and by special arrangement some of their young, known as \"\", are harvested annually by the men of Ness. The status of Rockall, which is to the west of North Uist and which the Island of Rockall Act 1972 decreed to be a part of the Western Isles, remains a matter of international dispute.\nSettlements.\nA 2018 development plan divides the Outer Hebrides settlements into four types: Stornoway core, main settlements, rural settlements and outwith settlements. The main settlements are Tarbert, Lochmaddy, Balivanich, Lochboisdale/Daliburgh, Greater Castlebay and greater Stornoway (excluding Stornoway core).\nCombining with data from the National Records of Scotland, the principal settlements are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe dispersed settlements consisting of rural settlements and outwith settlements account for about two-thirds of the population of the council area, since the total population of the table is about 9,000.\nGeology.\nMost of the islands have a bedrock formed from Lewisian gneiss. These are amongst the oldest rocks in Europe, having been formed in the Precambrian period up to three billion years ago. In addition to the Outer Hebrides, they form basement deposits on the Scottish mainland west of the Moine Thrust and on the islands of Coll and Tiree. These rocks are largely igneous in origin, mixed with metamorphosed marble, quartzite and mica schist and intruded by later basaltic dykes and granite magma. The gneiss's delicate pink colours are exposed throughout the islands and it is sometimes referred to by geologists as \"The Old Boy\".\nGranite intrusions are found in the parish of Barvas in west Lewis, and another forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Islands and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. The sandstone at Broad Bay was once thought to be Torridonian or Old Red Sandstone.\nClimate.\nThe Outer Hebrides have a cool temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude, due to the influence of the North Atlantic Current. The average temperature is 6\u00a0\u00b0C (44\u00a0\u00b0F) in January and 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer. The average annual rainfall in Lewis is and sunshine hours range from 1,100 to 1,200 per year. The summer days are relatively long and May to August is the driest period. Winds are a key feature of the climate and even in summer there are almost constant breezes. According to the writer W. H. Murray if a visitor asks an islander for a weather forecast \"he will not, like a mainlander answer dry, wet or sunny, but quote you a figure from the Beaufort Scale.\" There are gales one day in six at the Butt of Lewis and small fish are blown onto the grass on top of 190\u00a0metre (620\u00a0ft) high cliffs at Barra Head during winter storms.\nPrehistory.\nThe Hebrides were originally settled in the Mesolithic era and have a diversity of important prehistoric sites. in on North Uist was constructed around 3200\u20132800 BC and may be Scotland's earliest crannog (a type of artificial island). The Callanish Stones, dating from about 2900 BC, are the finest example of a stone circle in Scotland, the 13 primary monoliths of between one and five metres high creating a circle about in diameter. on South Uist, the only site in the UK where prehistoric mummies have been found, and the impressive ruins of Dun Carloway on Lewis both date from the Iron Age.\nHistory.\nIn Scotland, the Celtic Iron Age way of life, often troubled but never extinguished by Rome, re-asserted itself when the legions abandoned any permanent occupation in 211 AD. Hanson (2003) writes: \"For many years it has been almost axiomatic in studies of the period that the Roman conquest must have had some major medium or long-term impact on Scotland. On present evidence that cannot be substantiated either in terms of environment, economy, or, indeed, society. The impact appears to have been very limited. The general picture remains one of broad continuity, not of disruption\u00a0... The Roman presence in Scotland was little more than a series of brief interludes within a longer continuum of indigenous development.\" The Romans' direct impact on the Highlands and Islands was scant and there is no evidence that they ever actually landed in the Outer Hebrides.\nThe later Iron Age inhabitants of the northern and western Hebrides were probably Pictish, although the historical record is sparse. Hunter (2000) states that in relation to King Bridei I of the Picts in the sixth century AD: \"As for Shetland, Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles, their inhabitants, most of whom appear to have been Pictish in culture and speech at this time, are likely to have regarded Bridei as a fairly distant presence.\" The island of Pabbay is the site of the Pabbay Stone, the only extant Pictish symbol stone in the Outer Hebrides. This 6th century stele shows a flower, V-rod and lunar crescent to which has been added a later and somewhat crude cross.\nNorse control.\nViking raids began on Scottish shores towards the end of the 8th century AD and the Hebrides came under Norse control and settlement during the ensuing decades, especially following the success of Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord in 872. In the Western Isles Ketill Flatnose was the dominant figure of the mid 9th century, by which time he had amassed a substantial island realm and made a variety of alliances with other Norse leaders. These princelings nominally owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown, although in practice the latter's control was fairly limited. Norse control of the Hebrides was formalised in 1098 when Edgar, King of Scotland formally signed the islands over to Magnus III of Norway. The Scottish acceptance of Magnus III as King of the Isles came after the Norwegian king had conquered Orkney, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man in a swift campaign earlier the same year, directed against the local Norwegian leaders of the various islands\u2018 petty kingdoms. By capturing the islands Magnus imposed a more direct royal control, although at a price. His skald Bjorn Cripplehand recorded that in Lewis \"fire played high in the heaven\" as \"flame spouted from the houses\" and that in the Uists \"the king dyed his sword red in blood\". Thompson (1968) provides a more literal translation: \"Fire played in the fig-trees of Liodhus; it mounted up to heaven. Far and wide the people were driven to flight. The fire gushed out of the houses\".\nThe Hebrides were now part of Kingdom of the Isles, whose rulers were themselves vassals of the Kings of Norway. The Kingdom had two parts: the ' or South Isles encompassing the Hebrides and the Isle of Man; and the ' or North Isles of Orkney and Shetland. This situation lasted until the partitioning of the Western Isles in 1156, at which time the Outer Hebrides remained under Norwegian control while the Inner Hebrides broke out under Somerled, the Norse-Celtic kinsman of the Manx royal house.\nFollowing the ill-fated 1263 expedition of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides along with the Isle of Man, were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and placenames, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find from this time is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.\nScots rule.\nAs the Norse era drew to a close the Norse-speaking princes were gradually replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, the MacDonalds of the Uists and MacNeil of Barra. This transition did little to relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control.\nThe growing threat that Clan Donald posed to the Scottish crown led to the forcible dissolution of the Lordship of the Isles by James IV in 1493, but although the king had the power to subdue the organised military might of the Hebrides, he and his immediate successors lacked the will or ability to provide an alternative form of governance. The House of Stuart's attempts to control the Outer Hebrides were then at first desultory and little more than punitive expeditions. In 1506 the Earl of Huntly besieged and captured Stornoway Castle using cannon. In 1540 James V himself conducted a royal tour, forcing the clan chiefs to accompany him. There followed a period of peace, but all too soon the clans were at loggerheads again.\nIn 1598 King James VI authorised some \"Gentleman Adventurers\" from Fife to civilise the \"most barbarous Isle of Lewis\". Initially successful, the colonists were driven out by local forces commanded by Murdoch and Neil MacLeod, who based their forces on in . The colonists tried again in 1605 with the same result but a third attempt in 1607 was more successful, and in due course Stornoway became a Burgh of Barony. By this time Lewis was held by the Mackenzies of Kintail, (later the Earls of Seaforth), who pursued a more enlightened approach, investing in fishing in particular. The historian W. C. MacKenzie was moved to write:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the end of the 17th century, the picture we have of Lewis that of a people pursuing their avocation in peace, but not in plenty. The Seaforths\u00a0..., besides establishing orderly Government in the island.. had done a great deal to rescue the people from the slough of ignorance and incivility in which they found themselves immersed. But in the sphere of economics their policy apparently was of little service to the community.\nThe Seaforth's royalist inclinations led to Lewis becoming garrisoned during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms by Cromwell's troops, who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway and in 1645 Lewismen fought on the royalist side at the Battle of Auldearn. A new era of Hebridean involvement in the affairs of the wider world was about to commence.\nBritish era.\nWith the implementation of the Treaty of Union in 1707 the Hebrides became part of the new Kingdom of Great Britain, but the clans' loyalties to a distant monarch were not strong. A considerable number of islandmen \"came out\" in support of the Jacobite Earl of Mar in the \"15\" although the response to the 1745 rising was muted. Nonetheless, the aftermath of the decisive Battle of Culloden, which effectively ended Jacobite hopes of a Stuart restoration, was widely felt. The British government's strategy was to estrange the clan chiefs from their kinsmen and turn their descendants into English-speaking landlords whose main concern was the revenues their estates brought rather than the welfare of those who lived on them. This may have brought peace to the islands, but in the following century it came at a terrible price.\nThe Highland Clearances of the 19th century destroyed communities throughout the Highlands and Islands as the human populations were evicted and replaced with sheep farms. For example, Colonel Gordon of Cluny, owner of Barra, South Uist and Benbecula, evicted thousands of islanders using trickery and cruelty, and even offered to sell Barra to the government as a penal colony. Islands such as were completely cleared of their populations and even today the subject is recalled with bitterness and resentment in some areas. The position was exacerbated by the failure of the islands' kelp industry, which thrived from the 18th century until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and large scale emigration became endemic. For example, hundreds left North Uist for Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. The pre-clearance population of the island had been almost 5,000, although by 1841 it had fallen to 3,870 and was only 2,349 by 1931.\nThe Highland potato famine (Gaiseadh a\u2019 bhunt\u00e0ta, in Scottish Gaelic), caused by a blight, started in 1846 and had a serious impact, because many islanders were crofters; potatoes were a staple of their diet. Violent riots became common. Charities, encouraged by George Pole and others in the Commissariat (a military agency) encouraged charities to come to the rescue. The Free Church was particularly helpful, \"delivering oatmeal to famine-affected families all across the West Highlands and Islands\", according to one report. Another report states that the Church \"was prompt in organising an efficient system of private charity across the Hebrides and on the Western seaboard. It cooperated with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Relief Committees\".\nAn interdenominational charity was in place by early 1847 and took the most significant role in famine relief. Some landowners also provided a great deal of assistance, according to one history of the region: \"MacLeod of Dunvegan bought in food for his people, some eight thousand of them\" ... MacLean of Ardgour provided food, and introduced new crops into the area - peas, cabbages and carrots ... Sir James Matheson on Lewis spent \u00a3329,000 (Equivalent to \u00a337,000,000 in 2024) on improving his lands, hoping to provide a more secure future for his people\". The government of Britain provided some assistance, thanks to Sir Charles Trevelyan, who arranged for food distribution at Portree and Tobermory. The \"British Association for the Relief of Distress in Ireland and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland\" also helped as did donations received from North America. The blight struck again over the next two years, requiring an extra tax on landowners to help feed the population. The British government began encouraging mass emigration.\nFor those who remained new economic opportunities emerged through the export of cattle, commercial fishing and tourism. During the summer season in the 1860s and 1870s five thousand inhabitants of Lewis could be found in Wick on the mainland of Scotland, employed on the fishing boats and at the quaysides. Nonetheless, emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. By 2001 the population of North Uist was only 1,271.\nThe work of the Napier Commission and the Congested Districts Board, and the passing of the Crofting Act of 1886 helped, but social unrest continued. In July 1906 grazing land on Vatersay was raided by landless men from Barra and its isles. Lady Gordon Cathcart took legal action against the \"raiders\" but the visiting judge took the view that she had neglected her duties as a landowner and that \"long indifference to the necessities of the cottars had gone far to drive them to exasperation\". Millennia of continuous occupation notwithstanding, many of the remoter islands were abandoned \u2014 Mingulay in 1912, Hirta in 1930, and in 1942 among them. This process involved a transition from these places being perceived as relatively self-sufficient agricultural economies to a view becoming held by both island residents and outsiders alike that they lacked the essential services of a modern industrial economy.\nThere were gradual economic improvements, among the most visible of which was the replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design. The creation of the Highlands and Islands Development Board and the discovery of substantial deposits of North Sea oil in 1965, the establishment of a unitary local authority for the islands in 1975 and more recently the renewables sector have all contributed to a degree of economic stability in recent decades. The Arnish yard has had a chequered history but has been a significant employer in both the oil and renewables industries. , the local authority, employs 2,000 people, making it the largest employer in the Outer Hebrides. See also the \" area plan 2010\" and the 's \"Factfile \u2013 Economy\".\nEconomy.\nModern commercial activities centre on tourism, crofting, fishing, and weaving including the manufacture of Harris tweed. Crofting remains popular especially on Lewis and Harris (population 21,000) with over 920 active crofters according to a 2020 report: \"with crofts ranging in size from as small as a single hectare to having access to thousands of hectares through the medium of community grazing\". Crofters can apply for subsidy grants; some of these are intended to help them find other avenues to supplement their incomes. Some of the funding schemes available to crofters in the Hebrides include the \"Basic Payment Scheme, the suckler beef support scheme, the upland sheep support scheme and the Less Favoured Area support scheme and the Crofting Agricultural Grant Scheme (CAGS), as of March 2020.\nAccording to the Scottish Government, \"tourism is by far and away the mainstay industry\" of the Outer Hebrides, \"generating \u00a365m in economic value for the islands, sustaining around 1000 jobs\" The report adds that the \"islands receive 219,000 visitors per year\".\nSome of the larger islands have development trusts that support the local economy and, in striking contrast to the 19th and 20th century domination by absentee landlords, more than two thirds of the Western Isles population now lives on community-owned estates. However the economic position of the islands remains relatively precarious. The Western Isles, including Stornoway, are defined by Highlands and Islands Enterprise as an economically \"Fragile Area\" and they have an estimated trade deficit of some \u00a3163.4\u00a0million. Overall, the area is relatively reliant on primary industries and the public sector, and fishing and fish farming in particular are vulnerable to environmental impacts, changing market pressures, and European legislation.\nThere is some optimism about the possibility of future developments in, for example, renewable energy generation, tourism, and education, and after declines in the 20th century the population has stabilised since 2003, although it is ageing. A 2019 report, using key assumptions, (mortality, fertility and migration) was less optimistic. It predicted that the population is \"projected to fall to 22,709 by 2043\"; that translates to a 16% decline, or 4,021 people, between 2018 and 2043.\nThe UK's largest community-owned wind farm, Beinn Ghrideag, is located outside Stornoway, and operated by Point and Sandwick Trust (PST). Beinn Ghrideag is a 9 MW project (consisting of three 3 MW wind turbines) that generates 30 GWh of electricity annually; its profits fund 80% of the Western Isles woodland project, which plants hundreds of thousands of native trees across the islands.\nThe Isle of Lewis web site states that Stornoway's sheltered harbour has been important for centuries; it was named Steering Bay by Vikings who often visited. A December 2020 report stated that a new deep water terminal was to be developed, the Stornoway Deep Water Terminal, using a \u00a349 million investment. The plan included berths for cruise ships as long as 360 meters, berths for large cargo vessels, and a freight ferry berth.\nPolitics and local government.\nThe local authority is Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, based at the Council Offices in Stornoway. The council is often known locally simply as \"the \" or \"\".\nAdministrative history.\nAfter the Scottish crown claimed control of the islands, they were included in Inverness-shire. In 1661 Inverness-shire was split, with the northern parts becoming a new county called Ross-shire. The interests of landowners influenced the boundary of the new county. Kenneth Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Seaforth, owned extensive lands in Ross on the mainland and also owned the Isle of Lewis. Lewis was therefore included in Ross-shire, whereas the rest of the Outer Hebrides stayed in Inverness-shire (including Harris, despite it being part of the same island as Lewis). In 1889, Ross-shire merged with Cromartyshire to form a new county called Ross and Cromarty.\nLocal government was reformed in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland's counties, burghs and landward districts. In most of Scotland a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts was used, but a single-tier structure of island areas was used for Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides, the latter being named the Western Isles. Further local government reform in 1996 introduced single-tier council areas across all of Scotland. The councils of the three island areas created in 1975, including the Western Isles, continued to provide the same services after 1996, but their areas were redesignated as council areas.\nAs part of the 1975 reforms the area was also made a lieutenancy area, represented by the Lord Lieutenant of the Western Isles.\nIn 1998, following the Local Government (Gaelic Names) (Scotland) Act 1997, the Western Isles Council formally changed the English language version of the council area's name from Western Isles to \"Na h-Eileanan an Iar\" (Gaelic for 'the Western Isles'), and the name of the council to \"Comhairle nan Eilean Siar\" ('Council of the Western Isles'), to be used in both English and Gaelic contexts.\nWider politics.\nThe name for the British Parliament constituency covering this area is , the seat being held by Torcuil Crichton MP since 2024, while the Scottish Parliament constituency for the area is , the incumbent being Alasdair Allan MSP.\nDuring the 2014 Scottish independence referendum the area voted against independence by a margin of 53.42% (10,544) to 46.58% (9,195) in favour on a turnout of 86.2%\nIn 2022, as part of the Levelling Up White Paper, an \"Island Forum\" was proposed, which would allow local policymakers and residents in the Outer Hebrides to work alongside their counterparts in Shetland, Orkney, Anglesey and the Isle of Wight on common issues, such as broadband connectivity, and provide a platform for them to communicate directly with the government on the challenges island communities face in terms of levelling up.\nScottish Gaelic language.\nThe Outer Hebrides have historically been a very strong Scottish Gaelic (\"G\u00e0idhlig\") speaking area. Both the 1901 and 1921 census reported that all parishes were over 75% Gaelic speaking, including areas of high population density such as Stornoway. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 mandated English-only education, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living can recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school. By 1971 most areas were still more than 75% Gaelic speaking \u2013 with the exception of Stornoway, Benbecula and South Uist at 50\u201374%.\nIn the 2001 census, each island overall was over 50% Gaelic speaking \u2013 South Uist (71%), Harris (69%), Barra (68%), North Uist (67%), Lewis (56%) and Benbecula (56%). With 59.3% of Gaelic speakers or a total of 15,723 speakers, this made the Outer Hebrides the most strongly coherent Gaelic speaking area in Scotland.\nMost areas were between 60 and 74% Gaelic speaking and the areas with the highest density of over 80% are Scalpay near Harris, Newtonferry and Kildonan, whilst Daliburgh, Linshader, Eriskay, Brue, Boisdale, West Harris, Ardveenish, Soval, Ness, and Bragar all have more than 75%. The areas with the lowest density of speakers are Stornoway (44%), Braigh (41%), Melbost (41%), and Balivanich (37%).\nThe Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament in 2005 to provide continuing support for the language. However, by 2011 the overall percentage of Gaelic speakers in the Outer Hebrides had fallen to 52%, due to white English (Anglo Saxon) settlers. \nThe 2022 Scottish Census reported that out of 25,562 residents aged three and over, 11,780 (46.1%) considered themselves able to speak or read Gaelic. \nIn modern Gaelic the islands are sometimes referred to collectively as ' (the Long Island) or ' (the Outer Isles). \"\" (islands of the foreigners or strangers) is also heard occasionally, a name that was originally used by mainland Highlanders when the islands were ruled by the Norse.\nThe individual island and place names in the Outer Hebrides have mixed Gaelic and Norse origins. Various Gaelic terms are used repeatedly:\nThere are also several islands called ' from the Norse ' meaning \"tidal\" or \"ebb island\".\nOther languages.\nThe 2022 Scottish Census reported that out of 25,559 residents aged three and over, 4,169 (16.3%) considered themselves able to speak or read the Scots language. \nTransport.\nScheduled ferry services between the Outer Hebrides and the Scottish mainland and Inner Hebrides operate on the following routes:\nOther ferries operate between some of the islands.\nNational Rail services are available for onward journeys, from stations at Oban and Mallaig, which has direct services to Glasgow. However, parliamentary approval notwithstanding, plans in the 1890s to lay a railway connection to Ullapool were unable to obtain sufficient funding.\nThere are scheduled flights from Stornoway, Benbecula and Barra airports both inter-island and to the mainland. Barra's airport is claimed to be the only one in the world to have scheduled flights landing on a beach. At high water the runways are under the sea so flight times vary with the tide.\nBus na Comhairle.\nBus na Comhairle (meaning \"Bus of the Council\") is the council-owned local bus company of the Western Isles. The company serves the Broadbay area of Lewis with 7 buses: 6 Optare Solos and 1 ADL Enviro 200.\nShipwrecks.\nThe archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and lighthouses are sited as an aid to navigation at locations from Barra Head in the south to the Butt of Lewis in the north. There are numerous sites of wrecked ships, and the Flannan Isles are the location of an enduring mystery that occurred in December 1900, when all three lighthouse keepers vanished without trace.\n\"Annie Jane\", a three-masted immigrant ship out of Liverpool bound for Montreal, Canada, struck rocks off the West Beach of Vatersay during a storm on Tuesday 28 September 1853. Within ten minutes the ship began to founder and break up, casting 450 people into the sea. In spite of the conditions, islanders tried to rescue the passengers and crew. The remains of 350 men, women and children were buried in the dunes behind the beach and a small cairn and monument marks the site.\nThe tiny Beasts of Holm off the east coast of Lewis were the site of the sinking of during the first few hours of 1919, one of the worst maritime disasters in United Kingdom waters during the 20th century. Calvay in the Sound of Barra provided the inspiration for Compton Mackenzie's novel \"Whisky Galore\" after the ran aground there with a cargo of single malt whisky in 1941.\nCulture.\nChristianity has deep roots in the Western Isles, but owing mainly to the different allegiances of the clans in the past, the people in the northern islands (Lewis, Harris, North Uist) have historically been predominantly Presbyterian, and those of the southern islands (Benbecula, South Uist, Barra) predominantly Roman Catholic.\nAt the time of the 2001 Census, 42% of the population identified themselves as being affiliated with the Church of Scotland, with 13% Roman Catholic and 28% with other Christian churches. Many of this last group belong to the Free Church of Scotland, known for its strict observance of the Sabbath. 11% stated that they had no religion. This made the Western Isles the Scottish council area with the smallest percentage of non-religious in the population. There are also small Episcopalian congregations in Lewis and Harris, and the Outer Hebrides are part of the Diocese of Argyll and The Isles in both the Episcopalian and Catholic traditions.\nGaelic music is popular in the islands and the Lewis and Harris Traditional Music Society plays an active role in promoting the genre. F\u00e8is Bharraigh began in 1981 with the aim of developing the practice and study of the Gaelic language, literature, music, drama and culture on the islands of Barra and Vatersay. This two-week festival has inspired 43 other \"feisean\" throughout Scotland. The Lewis Pipe Band was founded in 1904 and the Lewis and Harris Piping Society in 1977.\nOutdoor activities including rugby, football, golf, shinty, fishing, riding, canoeing, athletics, and multi-sports are popular in the Western Isles. The Hebridean Challenge is an adventure race, run in five daily stages, which takes place along the length of the islands and includes hill and road running, road and mountain biking, short sea swims and demanding sea kayaking sections. There are four main sports centres: \"Ionad Spors Leodhais\" in Stornoway, which has a 25 m swimming pool; Harris Sports Centre; Lionacleit Sports Centre on Benbecula; and Castlebay Sports Centre on Barra. The Western Isles is a member of the International Island Games Association.\nSouth Uist is home to the Askernish Golf Course. The oldest links in the Outer Hebrides, it was designed by Old Tom Morris. Although it was in use until the 1930s, its existence was largely forgotten until 2005 and it is now being restored to Morris's original design.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It aids original information in becoming associated with something more accessible or meaningful\u2014which in turn provides better retention of the information.\nCommonly encountered mnemonics are often used for lists and in auditory form such as short poems, acronyms, initialisms or memorable phrases. They can also be used for other types of information and in visual or kinesthetic forms. Their use is based on the observation that the human mind more easily remembers spatial, personal, surprising, physical, sexual, humorous and otherwise \"relatable\" information rather than more abstract or impersonal forms of information.\nAncient Greeks and Romans distinguished between two types of memory: the \"natural\" memory and the \"artificial\" memory. The former is inborn and is the one that everyone uses instinctively. The latter in contrast has to be trained and developed through the learning and practice of a variety of mnemonic techniques.\nMnemonic systems are techniques or strategies consciously used to improve memory. They help use information already stored in long-term memory to make memorization an easier task.\nEtymology.\n\"Mnemonic\" is derived from the Ancient Greek word () which means 'of memory' or 'relating to memory'. It is related to Mnemosyne, the name of the goddess of memory in Greek mythology. Both of these words are derived from (), 'remembrance, memory'. Mnemonics in antiquity were most often considered in the context of what is today known as the art of memory.\nHistory.\nThe general name of mnemonics, or \"memoria technica\", was the name applied to devices for aiding the memory, to enable the mind to reproduce a relatively unfamiliar idea, and especially a series of dissociated ideas, by connecting it, or them, in some artificial whole, the parts of which are mutually suggestive. Mnemonic devices were much cultivated by Greek sophists and philosophers and are frequently referred to by Plato and Aristotle.\nPhilosopher Charmadas was famous for his outstanding memory and for his ability to memorize whole books and then recite them.\nIn later times, the poet Simonides was credited for development of these techniques, perhaps for no reason other than that the power of his memory was famous. Cicero, who attaches considerable importance to the art, but more to the principle of order as the best help to memory, speaks of Carneades (perhaps Charmades) of Athens and Metrodorus of Scepsis as distinguished examples of people who used well-ordered images to aid the memory. The Romans valued such helps in order to support facility in public speaking.\nThe Greek and the Roman system of mnemonics was founded on the use of mental places and signs or pictures, known as \"topical\" mnemonics. The most usual method was to choose a large house, of which the apartments, walls, windows, statues, furniture, etc., were each associated with certain names, phrases, events or ideas, by means of symbolic pictures. To recall these, an individual had only to search over the apartments of the house until discovering the places where images had been placed by the imagination.\nIn accordance with this system, if it were desired to fix a historic date in memory, it was localised in an imaginary town divided into a certain number of districts, each with ten houses, each house with ten rooms, and each room with a hundred quadrates or memory-places, partly on the floor, partly on the four walls, partly on the ceiling. Therefore, if it were desired to fix in the memory the date of the invention of printing (1436), an imaginary book, or some other symbol of printing, would be placed in the thirty-sixth quadrate or memory-place of the fourth room of the first house of the historic district of the town. Except that the rules of mnemonics are referred to by Martianus Capella, nothing further is known regarding the practice until the 13th century.\nAmong the voluminous writings of Roger Bacon is a tractate \"De arte memorativa\". Ramon Llull devoted special attention to mnemonics in connection with his \"ars generalis.\" The first important modification of the method of the Romans was that invented by the German poet Conrad Celtes, who, in his \"Epitoma in utramque Ciceronis rhetoricam cum arte memorativa nova\" (1492), used letters of the alphabet for associations, rather than places. About the end of the 15th century, Peter of Ravenna (b. 1448) provoked such astonishment in Italy by his mnemonic feats that he was believed by many to be a necromancer. His \"Phoenix artis memoriae\" (Venice, 1491, 4 vols.) went through as many as nine editions, the seventh being published at Cologne in 1608.\nAbout the end of the 16th century, Lambert Schenkel (\"Gazophylacium\", 1610), who taught mnemonics in France, Italy and Germany, similarly surprised people with his memory. He was denounced as a sorcerer by the University of Louvain, but in 1593 he published his tractate \"De memoria\" at Douai with the sanction of that celebrated theological faculty. The most complete account of his system is given in two works by his pupil Martin Sommer, published in Venice in 1619. In 1618 John Willis (d. 1628?) published \"Mnemonica; sive ars reminiscendi\", containing a clear statement of the principles of topical or local mnemonics. Giordano Bruno included a \"memoria technica\" in his treatise \"De umbris idearum,\" as part of his study of the \"ars generalis\" of Llull. Other writers of this period are the Florentine Publicius (1482); Johannes Romberch (1533); Hieronimo Morafiot, \"Ars memoriae\" (1602);and B. Porta, \"Ars reminiscendi\" (1602).\nIn 1648 Stanislaus Mink von Wennsshein revealed what he called the \"most fertile secret\" in mnemonics\u2014using consonants for figures, thus expressing numbers by words (vowels being added as required), in order to create associations more readily remembered. The philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz adopted an alphabet very similar to that of Wennsshein for his scheme of a form of writing common to all languages.\nWennsshein's method was adopted with slight changes afterward by the majority of subsequent \"original\" systems. It was modified and supplemented by Richard Grey (1694\u20131771), a priest who published a \"Memoria technica\" in 1730. The principal part of Grey's method is briefly this:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To remember anything in history, chronology, geography, etc., a word is formed, the beginning whereof, being the first syllable or syllables of the thing sought, does, by frequent repetition, of course draw after it the latter part, which is so contrived as to give the answer. Thus, in history, the Deluge happened in the year before Christ two thousand three hundred forty-eight; this is signified by the word Del-\"etok\", Del standing for Deluge and \"etok\" for 2348.Wennsshein's method is comparable to a Hebrew system by which letters also stand for numerals, and therefore words for dates.\nTo assist in retaining the mnemonical words in the memory, they were formed into memorial lines. Such strange words in difficult hexameter scansion, are by no means easy to memorise. The vowel or consonant, which Grey connected with a particular figure, was chosen arbitrarily.\nA later modification was made in 1806 Gregor von Feinaigle, a German monk from Salem near Constance. While living and working in Paris, he expounded a system of mnemonics in which (as in Wennsshein) the numerical figures are represented by letters chosen due to some similarity to the figure or an accidental connection with it. This alphabet was supplemented by a complicated system of localities and signs. Feinaigle, who apparently did not publish any written documentation of this method, travelled to England in 1811. The following year one of his pupils published \"The New Art of Memory\" (1812), giving Feinaigle's system. In addition, it contains valuable historical material about previous systems.\nOther mnemonists later published simplified forms, as the more complicated mnemonics were generally abandoned. Methods founded chiefly on the so-called laws of association (cf. Mental association) were taught with some success in Germany.\n Songs and jingles can be used as a mnemonic. A common example is how children remember the alphabet by singing the ABCs. Another example are book tunes.\n The first letter of each word is combined into a new word. For example: VIBGYOR (or ROY G BIV) for the colours of the rainbow or H O M E S (Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, Lake Superior) or \"Shake my hand, Evil Octopus!\" for the Great Lakes.\n The first letter of each word is combined to form a phrase or sentence \u2013 e.g. \"Richard of York gave battle in vain\" for the colours of the rainbow.\n A model is used to help recall information. Applications of this method involve the use of diagrams, cycles, graphs, and flowcharts to help understand or memorize an idea. e.g. Freytag's Pyramid to show the different parts of a five-act dramatic structure.\n The information is placed into a poem or doggerel, \u2013 e.g. \"Note socer, gener, liberi, and Liber god of revelry, like puer these retain the 'e'\" (most Latin nouns of the second declension ending in -er drop the -e in all of the oblique cases except the vocative, these are the exceptions).\n The method of note organization can be used as a memorization technique. Applications of this method involve the use of flash cards and lists. Flash cards are used by putting a question or word on one side of a paper and the answer or definition on the other side of the paper. Lists involve the organization of data from broad to detailed. e.g. Earth \u2192 Continent \u2192 Country.\n The information is constructed into a picture.\n New knowledge is connected to knowledge already known.\n Techniques such as the method of loci allow the user to create unique associations in an imagined space.\nApplications and examples.\nA wide range of mnemonics are used for several purposes. The most commonly used mnemonics are those for lists, numerical sequences, foreign-language acquisition, and medical treatment for patients with memory deficits.\nFor lists.\nA common mnemonic technique for remembering a list is to create an easily remembered acronym. Another is to create a memorable phrase with words which share the same first letter(s) (i.e.: the same initialism) as the list members. Mnemonic techniques can be applied to most memorization of novel materials.\nSome common examples for first-letter mnemonics:\nFor numerical sequences and mathematical operations.\nMnemonic phrases or poems can be used to encode numeric sequences by various methods, one common one is to create a new phrase in which the number of letters in each word represents the according digit of pi. For example, the first 15 digits of the mathematical constant pi (3.14159265358979) can be encoded as \"Now I need a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics\"; \"Now\", having 3 letters, represents the first number, 3. Piphilology is the practice dedicated to creating mnemonics for pi.\nAnother is used for \"calculating\" the multiples of 9 up to 9 \u00d7 10 using one's fingers. Begin by holding out both hands with all fingers stretched out. Now count left to right the number of fingers that indicates the multiple. For example, to figure 9 \u00d7 4, count four fingers from the left, ending at your left-hand index finger. Bend this finger down and count the remaining fingers. Fingers to the left of the bent finger represent tens, fingers to the right are ones. There are three fingers to the left and six to the right, which indicates 9 \u00d7 4 = 36. This works for 9 \u00d7 1 up through 9 \u00d7 10.\nFor remembering the rules in adding and multiplying two signed numbers, Balbuena and Buayan (2015) made the letter strategies LAUS (like signs, add; unlike signs, subtract) and LPUN (like signs, positive; unlike signs, negative), respectively.\n ('thresher') is a Finnish mnemonic regarding electricity: the first and last three letters can be arranged into the equations formula_1 and formula_2. (The letter \"M\" is ignored, which can be explained with another, politically incorrect mnemonic.)\nFor foreign-language acquisition.\nMnemonics may be helpful in learning foreign languages, for example by transposing difficult foreign words with words in a language the learner knows already, also called \"cognates\" which are very common in Romance languages and other Germanic languages. A useful such technique is to find linkwords, words that have the same pronunciation in a known language as the target word, and associate them visually or auditorially with the target word.\nFor example, in trying to assist the learner to remember (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05dc\u200e), the Hebrew word for \"tent\", the linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann proposes the memorable sentence \"\"Oh hell\", there's a raccoon in my \"tent\"\". The memorable sentence \"There's a \"fork\" in \"Ma's leg\"\" helps the learner remember that the Hebrew word for \"fork\" is ' (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05de\u05d6\u05dc\u05d2\u200e). Similarly, to remember the Hebrew word ' (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u200e), meaning \"house\", one can use the sentence \"that's a lovely \"house\", I'd like to \"buy it\".\" The linguist Michel Thomas taught students to remember that \"\" is the Spanish word for \"to be\" by using the phrase \"to be a star\".\nAnother Spanish example is by using the mnemonic \"Vin Diesel Has Ten Weapons\" to teach irregular command verbs in the you () form. Spanish verb forms and tenses are regularly seen as the hardest part of learning the language. With a high number of verb tenses, and many verb forms that are not found in English, Spanish verbs can be hard to remember and then conjugate. The use of mnemonics has been proven to help students better learn foreign languages, and this holds true for Spanish verbs. A particularly hard verb tense to remember is command verbs. Command verbs in Spanish are conjugated differently depending on who the command is being given to. The phrase, when pronounced with a Spanish accent, is used to remember \"Ven Di Sal Haz Ten Ve Pon S\u00e9\", all of the irregular Spanish command verbs in the you () form. This mnemonic helps students attempting to memorize different verb tenses.\nAnother technique is for learners of gendered languages to associate their mental images of words with a colour that matches the gender in the target language. An example here is to remember the Spanish word for \"foot\", \",\" [pee-eh] with the image of a foot stepping on a pie, which then spills blue filling (blue representing the male gender of the noun in this example).\nFor French verbs which use \u00eatre as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses: DR and MRS VANDERTRAMPP: descendre, rester, monter, revenir, sortir, venir, arriver, na\u00eetre, devenir, entrer, rentrer, tomber, retourner, aller, mourir, partir, passer.\nMasculine countries in French (le): \"Neither can a breeze make a sane Japanese chilly in the USA.\" (les) Netherlands (Pays-Bas), Canada, Brazil (Br\u00e9sil), Mexico (Mexique), Senegal, Japan (Japon), Chile (Chili), &amp; (les) USA (\u00c9tats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique).\nFor patients with memory deficits.\nMnemonics can be used in aiding patients with memory deficits that could be caused by head injuries, strokes, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and other neurological conditions.\nIn a study conducted by Doornhein and De Haan, the patients were treated with six different memory strategies including the mnemonics technique. The results concluded that there were significant improvements on the immediate and delayed subtest of the RBMT, delayed recall on the Appointments test, and relatives rating on the MAC from the patients that received mnemonics treatment. However, in the case of stroke patients, the results did not reach statistical significance.\nEffectiveness.\nAcademic study of the use of mnemonics has shown their effectiveness. In one such experiment, subjects of different ages who applied mnemonic techniques to learn novel vocabulary outperformed control groups that applied contextual learning and free-learning styles.\nMnemonics were seen to be more effective for groups of people who struggled with or had weak long-term memory, like the elderly. Five years after a mnemonic training study, a research team followed-up 112 community-dwelling older adults, 60 years of age and over. Delayed recall of a word list was assessed prior to, and immediately following mnemonic training, and at the 5-year follow-up. Overall, there was no significant difference between word recall prior to training and that exhibited at follow-up. However, pre-training performance gains scores in performance immediately post-training and use of the mnemonic predicted performance at follow-up. Individuals who self-reported using the mnemonic exhibited the highest performance overall, with scores significantly higher than at pre-training. The findings suggest that mnemonic training has long-term benefits for some older adults, particularly those who continue to employ the mnemonic.\nThis contrasts with a study from surveys of medical students that approximately only 20% frequently used mnemonic acronyms.\nIn humans, the process of aging particularly affects the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus, in which the episodic memory is synthesized. The episodic memory stores information about items, objects, or features with spatiotemporal contexts. Since mnemonics aid better in remembering spatial or physical information rather than more abstract forms, its effect may vary according to a subject's age and how well the subject's medial temporal lobe and hippocampus function.\nThis could be further explained by one recent study which indicates a general deficit in the memory for spatial locations in aged adults (mean age 69.7 with standard deviation of 7.4 years) compared to young adults (mean age 21.7 with standard deviation of 4.2 years). At first, the difference in target recognition was not significant.\nThe researchers then divided the aged adults into two groups, aged unimpaired and aged impaired, according to a neuropsychological testing. With the aged groups split, there was an apparent deficit in target recognition in aged impaired adults compared to both young adults and aged unimpaired adults. This further supports the varying effectiveness of mnemonics in different age groups.\nMoreover, different research was done previously with the same notion, which presented with similar results to that of Reagh et al. in a verbal mnemonics discrimination task.\nStudies (notably \"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two\") have suggested that the short-term memory of adult humans can hold only a limited number of items; grouping items into larger chunks such as in a mnemonic might be part of what permits the retention of a larger total amount of information in short-term memory, which in turn can aid in the creation of long-term memories.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; The dictionary definition of \"mnemonic\" at Wiktionary"}
{"id": "40412", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40412", "title": "License", "text": "Legal concept\nA license (American English) or licence (Commonwealth English) is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit).\nA license is granted by a party (licensor) to another party (licensee) as an element of an agreement between those parties. In the case of a license issued by a government, the license is obtained by applying for it. In the case of a private party, it is by a specific agreement, usually in writing (such as a lease or other contract). The simplest definition is \"A license is a promise not to sue\", because a license usually either permits the licensed party to engage in an illegal activity, and subject to prosecution, without the license (e.g. fishing, driving an automobile, or operating a broadcast radio or television station), or it permits the licensed party to do something that would violate the rights of the licensing party (e.g. make copies of a copyrighted work), which, without the license, the licensed party could be sued, civilly, criminally, or both.\nIn particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability (or both). The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to allow them to set conditions and limitations.\nA licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a patented invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor. A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor.\nTerm: many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement.\nTerritory: a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to \"North America\" (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Kyrgyzstan.\nAgain, a shorthand definition of a license is \"a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee\". That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so.\nIntellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing.\nReal property licenses.\nA license provides one party with the authority to act on another's land, when such action would typically amount to trespass absent that license. A key distinction between licenses and leases is that a license grants the licensee a revocable non-assignable privilege to act upon the land of the licensor, without granting any possessory interest in the land. Once a license is agreed upon, the licensee may occupy the land only so far as is necessary to complete the act. Another key distinction between a license and a lease is that leases are generally required to be in writing, where the statute of frauds requires it, while licenses can be made orally.\nCreation.\nA license is generally created by an express or implied agreement. The licensor must agree to the license which can be shown in writing or the licensors acquiescence in its exercise. Furthermore, unlike many other contractual agreements, a license does not require consideration, a license can be created with or without it. Moreover, whether an agreement is held to be a \"license\" and not a lease will depend on three essential characteristics of a license: (1) a clause allowing the licensor to revoke \"at will\"; (2) the retention by the licensor of absolute control over the premises; and (3) the licensor's supplying to the licensee all of the essential services required for the licensee's permitted use of the premises.\nTermination.\nUnder a pure licensing agreement, the licensor, under its terms and by common-law, can cancel the agreement at will and without cause, unless it is coupled with an interest or made irrevocable by contract. A license that has been coupled with an interest is not revocable by the licensor without exposure to liability and potential damages. In the event a license is coupled with an interest, the licensor must provide reasonable time for the licensee to remove that interest from the property prior to termination. Additionally, because a license does not confer any possessory interest in the licensee, in the event of a sale of the property, the license is terminated and cannot be enforced against the new owners of that property. Moreover, the death of either the licensee or licensor will terminate the agreement.\nRemedies.\nIf a license is revocable at will by the licensor, courts will be unable to grant specific performance in favor of the licensee. A licensee would be unsuccessful in bringing forcible entry claims or a detainer proceeding because the licensee was never granted any possessory interest. The Licensee would also not be able to recover damages for money spent unless they are able to show detrimental reliance on the license. In certain cases, however, licenses can be made irrevocable, and specific performance may be granted. Where a license is made with a set term period and valid consideration is transferred, revocation of the license prior to the terms expiration may raise breach of contract claims that could provide damages against the licensor. Furthermore, once the licensor terminates or revokes the license, notice is statutorily required prior to the commencement of any special proceeding to recover possession of the property (e.g., in NY that requirement is 10 days).\nMass licensing of software.\nMass distributed software is used by individuals on personal computers under license from the developer of that software. Such license is typically included in a more extensive end-user license agreement (EULA) entered into upon the installation of that software on a computer.\nTypically, a license is associated with a unique code, that when approved grants the end user access to the software in question.\nUnder a typical end-user license agreement, the user may install the software on a limited number of computers.\nThe enforceability of end-user license agreements is sometimes questioned.\nAs of 2020, there are various ways to license software with different kinds of licensing models, which allow software vendors to profit from their product offerings in flexible ways.\nPatent licensing.\nLike other intellectual property, patent owners may grant permission to others to engage in conduct that would otherwise be within the scope of a patent. For example, a patent owner may authorize a licensee to make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import a patented product. Such agreements are typically referred to as a patent license agreement or a covenant not to sue. These agreements can last for a specific period of time (such as five years) or for the entire life of the patent (\"i.e.,\" until the patent expires). Patent license agreements may also be exclusive (\"i.e.,\" the licensee is the only person or entity that is allowed to sell, make, use, offer to sell, or import the patented invention) or non-exclusive (\"i.e.,\" the licensee is simply one of several entities who has rights under the patent). Finally, any rights given under the agreement may be limited to a particular \"field of use\" (\"e.g.,\" a licensee may be able to practice an invention in the field of consumer electronics, but not in the field of industrial electronics).\nOften, patent owners will require a licensee to pay money in exchange for granting a patent license. Such payments are referred to as royalty payments and come primarily in two forms: lump sum or running royalty. A lump sum royalty involves an upfront, one-time payment, while a running royalty typically involves periodic payments (\"e.g.,\" quarterly or annual) based on the number of patented products sold or imported.\nTrademark and brand licensing.\nA licensor may grant permission to a licensee to distribute products under a trademark. With such a license, the licensee may use the trademark without fear of a claim of trademark infringement by the licensor.\nThe assignment of a license often depends on specific contractual terms. The most common terms are, that a license is only applicable for a particular geographic region, just for a certain period of time or merely for a stage in the value chain. Moreover, there are different types of fees within the trademark and brand licensing. The first form demands a fee independent of sales and profits, the second type of license fee is dependent on the productivity of the licensee.\nFor example, McDonald's licenses their trademark such as the \"Golden Arches\" or the \"Big Mac\", but the licenses gives McDonald's a right to impose strict quality standards to their franchisees as they can take back the right to the trademark if they do not meet McDonald's standards.\nWhen a licensor grants permission to a licensee to not only distribute, but manufacture a patented product, it is known as licensed production.\nArtwork and character licensing.\nA licensor may grant a permission to a licensee to copy and distribute copyrighted works such as \"art\" (e.g., Thomas Kinkade's painting \"Dawn in Los Gato\") and characters (e.g., Mickey Mouse). With such license, a licensee need not fear a claim of copyright infringement brought by the copyright owner.\nArtistic license is, however, not related to the aforementioned license. It is a euphemism that denotes freedom of expression, the ability to make the subject appear more engaging or attractive, by fictionalizing part of the subject.\n\"National examples of the licentiate are listed at licentiate (degree)\"\nAcademia.\nA licentiate is an academic degree that traditionally conferred the license to teach at a university or to practice a particular profession. The term survived despite the fact that nowadays a doctorate is typically needed in order to teach at a university. The term is also used for a person who holds a licentiate. In English, the degree has never been called a license. In France, the \"licence\" is the first degree awarded in Universities.\nIn Sweden, Finland, and in some other European university systems, a 'licentiate' is a postgraduate degree between the master's degree and the doctorate. The licentiate is a popular choice in those countries where a full doctoral degree would take five or more years to achieve.\nVehicle licensing.\nA vehicle license is required in most countries to legally drive a vehicle on public roads. This typically involves obtaining a driver's license, which is granted based on an individual's ability to operate specific types of vehicles. The requirements and processes for obtaining a driver's license vary from country to country and may depend on the type of vehicle one intends to drive.\nLicense classes.\nLicensing classifications differ by country but typically include categories for:\nInternational driving permits.\nFor individuals traveling abroad, an International Driving Permit (IDP) can be obtained. This is a translation of the individual's domestic driver's license and is required by some countries for foreigners to drive within their borders.\nCriminal law.\nIn the United Kingdom prisoners serving a determinate sentence (a fixed time in prison) will be released prior to the completion of their full sentence \"on licence\". The licence is the prisoner's agreement to maintain certain conditions, such as periodic reporting in to a probation officer and only living at an approved address, in exchange for their early release. If they break the conditions of the licence, they can be \"recalled\" (returned to prison).\nOffenders serving determinate sentences are released automatically at a set point in their sentence, whereas prisoners serving indeterminate sentences (e.g. life imprisonment) can only be released by the parole board.\nEconomic theory.\nPatent licensing has been studied in formal economic models in the field of industrial organization. In particular, Katz and Shapiro (1986) have explored the optimal licensing strategy of a research lab selling to firms who are competitors on the product market. It turns out that (compared to the welfare-maximizing solution) the licensor's incentives to develop innovations may be excessive, while the licensor's incentives to disseminate the innovation are typically too low. Subsequently, the seminal work of Katz and Shapiro (1986) has been extended in several directions. For example, Bhattacharya, Glazer, and Sappington (1992) have taken into account that the firms acquiring licenses must make further investments in order to develop marketable products. Schmitz (2002, 2007) has shown that asymmetric information due to adverse selection or moral hazard may lead the research lab to sell more licenses than it would do under complete information. Antelo and Sampayo (2017) have studied the optimal number of licenses in a signalling model.\nCriticism.\nThe provision of licenses and the agencies that mandate them are often criticised by American libertarians like Milton Friedman for creating an anticompetitive environment for occupations, which creates a barrier to entry for more qualified and skilled individuals who may not have the resources to obtain the necessary licences. According to Friedman, licenses and permits have become so burdensome due to legislation that favors the current establishment of wealthy occupants that they decrease the supply of such occupations, which raises prices for the average consumer. Libertarians and the anti-authoritarian left (anarcho-communists) view competing guilds and other voluntary communes as being more beneficial for disseminating the skills and education required to perform a specified career.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the shorter documents of the Council, the decree was approved by a vote of 2,321 to 4 of the assembled bishops, and promulgated by Pope Paul VI on 28 October 1965. As is customary for Church documents, the title is taken from the first words (incipit) of the decree: \"of Perfect Charity\" in Latin.\nContent.\nThe Second Vatican Council had already given an exposition of the nature of religious life in chapter 6 of the Constitution \"Lumen gentium\", and \"Perfectae Caritatis\" reflected the principles of religious life as established therein. This chapter described the essential form of religious life as a life \"consecrated by the profession of the evangelical counsels\" (n. 44). The Decree \"Perfectae Caritatis\" was published in order to \"treat of the life and discipline of those institutes whose members make profession of chastity, poverty and obedience and to provide for their needs in our time\" (\"Perfectae Caritatis\" n. 1). Containing 25 numbered paragraphs, the Decree established five general principles to guide the renewal of these institutes. Because of the broad variety of religious communities with their different histories, characteristics, customs, and missions, the Council did not give specific indications, and left to each individual community the authority to determine what needed to be changed in accord with the spirit of their founders, the needs of modern life, and the situations where they lived and worked.\nAftermath.\nOn August 6, 1966 Pope Paul VI issued \"Ecclesiae Sanctae\", an apostolic letter on the implementation of certain conciliar documents, including \"Perfectae Caritatis\".\nThe period that followed the promulgation of \"Perfectae Caritatis\" was marked by a huge amount of experimentation in religious life. Many institutes replaced their traditional habits with more modern attire, experimented with different forms of prayer and community life, and adapted obedience to a superior to a form of consultation and discussion. A great number of religious left religious life entirely, and in subsequent decades there was a large drop the number of religious vocations in the Western World. It is not clear how much of this change was due to the documents of the Second Vatican Council. Historians note that western society as a whole was going through social turmoil caused by the sexual revolution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The site where he settled near the mouth of the Chicago River around the 1780s is memorialized as a National Historic Landmark, now located in Pioneer Court.\nPoint du Sable was of African descent, but little else is known of his life before the 1770s. During his career, the areas where he settled and traded around the Great Lakes and in the Illinois Country changed hands several times between France, Britain, Spain and the United States. Described as handsome and well-educated, Point duSable married a Potawatomi Native American woman, Kitihawa, and they had two children. In 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, he was arrested by the British on suspicion of being an American Patriot sympathizer. In the early 1780s, he worked for the British lieutenant-governor of Michilimackinac on an estate at what is now St. Clair, Michigan.\nPoint du Sable is first recorded as living at the mouth of the Chicago River in a trader's journal of early 1790. By then, he had established an extensive and prosperous trading settlement in what later became the City of Chicago. He sold his Chicago River property in 1800 and moved to the river port of St. Charles, where he was licensed to run a ferry across the Missouri River. Point duSable's role in developing the Chicago River settlement was little recognized until the mid-20th century.\nIn Chicago, a school, museum, harbor, park, bridge, and road have been named in du Sable's honor.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nThere are no records of Point du Sable's life before the 1770s. Though it is known from sources during his life that he was of African descent, his birth date, place of birth, and parents are unknown. Juliette Kinzie, another early pioneer of Chicago, never met Point duSable but said in her 1856 memoir that he was \"a native of St.Domingo\" (the island of Hispaniola). This became generally accepted as his place of birth. Historian Milo Milton Quaife regarded Kinzie's account of Point duSable as \"largely fictitious and wholly unauthenticated\", later putting forward a theory that he was of African and French-Canadian origin. A historical novel published in 1953 helped to popularize the claim that Point du Sable was born in 1745 in Saint-Marc in French Saint-Domingue (which later became Haiti). If he was born outside continental North America, there are competing accounts as to whether he entered as a trader from the north through French Canada, or from the south through French Louisiana.\nIllinois Country.\nPoint du Sable married a Potawatomi woman named Kitihawa (Christianized to Catherine) on 27October 1788, in a Catholic ceremony in Cahokia in the Illinois Country, a longtime French colonial settlement on the east side of the Mississippi River. It is likely that this couple was married earlier in the 1770s in a Native American tradition. They had a son named Jean and a daughter named Susanne. Point duSable supported his family as a frontier trader (\"voyageur\" or \"coureur des bois\") and settler during a period of great upheaval for the former southern dependencies of French Canada and in the Illinois Country, where the regions changed hands several times over the course of half a century.\nIn a footnote to a poem titled \"Speech to the Western Indians\", Arent DePeyster, British commandant from 1774 to 1779 at Fort Michilimackinac (a former French fort in what was then the British province of Quebec), noted that \"Baptist Point deSaible\" was \"a handsome negro\", \"well educated\", and \"settled in Eschecagou\". When he published this poem in 1813, DePeyster presented it as a speech that he had made at the village of Arbrecroche (now Harbor Springs, Michigan) on 4July 1779. This footnote has led many scholars to assume that Point duSable had settled in Chicago by 1779. But letters written by other traders in the late 1770s suggest that Point duSable was at this time settled at the mouth of Trail Creek (\"Rivi\u00e8re duChemin\") at what is now Michigan City, Indiana.\nIn August 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, Point duSable was arrested as a suspected American Patriot at Trail Creek by British troops and imprisoned briefly at Fort Michilimackinac. An officer's report following his arrest noted that Point du Sable had many friends who vouched for his good character. The following year, Point du Sable was ordered transported to the Pinery on the St. Clair River north of Detroit. From the summer of 1780 until May 1784, Point duSable managed the Pinery, a tract of woodlands owned by British officer Lt.Patrick Sinclair, on the St. Clair River in eastern Michigan. This may have been a choice given by him from the British, offering him release from his imprisonment to manage the Pinery. Point duSable lived with his family in a cabin at the mouth of the Pine River in what is now the city of St. Clair.\nAt some time in the 1780s, after the U.S. achieved independence, Point du Sable settled on the north bank of the Chicago River close to its mouth. The earliest known record of Point duSable living in Chicago is an entry that Hugh Heward made in his journal on 10May 1790, during a journey from Detroit across Michigan and through Illinois. Heward's party stopped at Point duSable's house enroute to the Chicago portage; they swapped their canoe for a pirogue that belonged to Point duSable, and they bought bread, flour, and pork from him. Perrish Grignon, who visited Chicago in about 1794, described Point duSable as a large man and wealthy trader. Point du Sable's granddaughter, Eulalie Pelletier, was born at his Chicago River settlement in 1796.\nIn 1800 Point duSable sold his farm to John Kinzie's frontman, Jean La Lime, for 6,000 livres. The bill of sale, which was rediscovered in 1913 in an archive in Detroit, detailed all of the property Point duSable owned, as well as many of his personal effects. This included a house, two barns, a horse-drawn mill, a bakehouse, a poultry house, a dairy, and a smokehouse. The house was a log cabin filled with fine furniture and paintings.\nMissouri River and burial.\nAfter Point du Sable sold his property in Chicago, he moved to St. Charles, west of St. Louis, which at that time was still part of Spanish Louisiana. He was commissioned by the colonial governor to operate a ferry across the Missouri River. In St.Charles, he may have lived for a time with his son, and later with his granddaughter's family. Late in life, he may have sought public or charitable assistance. He died on 28 August 1818 and was buried in an unmarked grave in St.Charles Borromeo Cemetery. His entry in the parish burial register does not mention his origins, parents, or relatives; it simply describes him as \"n\u00e8gre\" (French for \"negro\").\nThe St.Charles Borromeo Cemetery was moved twice in the 19thcentury. Oral tradition and records of the Archdiocese of St. Louis suggested that Point duSable's remains were also moved. On 12October 1968, the Illinois Sesquicentennial Commission erected a granite marker at the site believed to be Point duSable's grave in the third St.Charles Borromeo Cemetery.\nIn 2002 an archaeological investigation of the grave site was initiated by the African Scientific Research Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Researchers using a combination of ground-penetrating radar, surveys, and excavation of a area did not find any evidence of any burials at the supposed grave site, leading the archaeologists to conclude that Point duSable's remains may not have been reinterred from one of the two previous cemeteries.\nTheories and legends.\nOrigins.\nThough there is little historical evidence regarding Point duSable's life before the 1770s, there are several theories and legends that give accounts of his early life. Writing in 1933, Quaife identified a French immigrant to Canada, Pierre Dandonneau, who acquired the title \"Sieur deSable\" and whose descendants were known by both the names \"Dandonneau\" and \"DuSable\". Quaife was unable to find a direct link to Point duSable, but he identified descendants of Pierre Dandonneau as living around the Great Lakes region in Detroit, Mackinac, and St.Joseph. He speculated that Point duSable's father may have been a member of this family, while his mother was likely an enslaved woman.\nIn 1951, Joseph Jeremie, a native of Haiti, published a pamphlet in which he said he was the great-grandson of Point duSable. Based on family recollections and tombstone inscriptions, he claimed that Point duSable was born in Saint-Marc in what was then Saint Domingue, studied in France, and returned to the island to deal in coffee before traveling to French Louisiana. Historian and Point duSable biographer John F. Swenson has called these claims \"elaborate, undocumented assertions... in a fanciful biography\".\nFiction.\nIn 1953, Shirley Graham drew from the work of Quaife and Jeremie in a historical novel about Point duSable. She described it as \"not accurate history nor pure fiction\", but rather \"an imaginative interpretation of all the known facts\". This book presented Point duSable as the son of the mate on a pirate ship, the \"Black Sea Gull\", and a freedwoman called Suzanne. Despite lack of evidence and the continued debate about Point duSable's early life, parentage, and birthplace, this popular story has been repeated and widely presented as being definitive.\nPeoria.\nIn 1815, a land claim that had been submitted by Nicholas Jarrot to the land commissioners at Kaskaskia, Illinois Territory, was approved. In the claim Jarrot asserted that a \"Jean Baptiste Poinstable\" had been \"head of a family at Peoria in the year 1783, and before and after that year\", and that he \"had a house built and cultivated land between the Old Fort and the new settlement in the year 1780\". This document has been taken by Quaife and other historians as evidence that Point duSable lived at Peoria on the Illinois River prior to going north to settle in Chicago. However, other records demonstrate that Point duSable was living and working under the British at the Pinery in Michigan in the early 1780s. The Kaskaskia land commissioners identified many fraudulent land claims, including two previously submitted in the name of Point duSable. Nicholas Jarrot, the claimant, was involved in many false claims, and Swenson suggests that this one was also fraudulent, made without Point duSable's knowledge. Although perhaps in conflict with some of the above information, other historical records suggest that Point duSable bought land in Peoria from J.B. Maillet on 13March 1773 and sold it to Isaac Darneille in 1783, before he became the first \"permanent\" resident of Chicago.\nDeparture from Chicago.\nPoint du Sable left Chicago in 1800. He sold his property to Jean La Lime, a trader from Quebec, and moved to the Missouri River valley, at that time part of Spanish Louisiana. The reason for his departure is unknown. By 1804, John Kinzie, another early Chicago settler, had bought the former du Sable house. Kinzie's daughter-in-law, Juliette Magill Kinzie, suggested in her 1852 memoir that \"perhaps he [du Sable] was disgusted at not being elected to a similar dignity [great chief] by the Pottowattamies\".\nIn 1874, Nehemiah Matson elaborated on this story, claiming that Point duSable was a slave from Virginia who had moved with his master to Lexington, Kentucky, in 1790. According to Matson, Point duSable became a zealous Catholic in order to convince a Jesuit missionary to declare him chief of the local Native Americans, but after they refused to accept him as their chief, he left Chicago. Quaife dismisses both of these stories as being fictional.\nIn her 1953 novel, Graham suggests that Point du Sable left Chicago because he was angered that the US government wanted him to buy the land on which he had lived and called his own for the previous two decades. The 1795 Treaty of Greenville, which ended the Northwest Indian War, and the subsequent westward migration of Native Americans away from the Chicago area might also have influenced his decision.\nLegacy and honors.\nFounder of Chicago.\nThe French came to the North American mid-continent region in the 17thcentury. Though probably not the first Europeans to visit the area, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette were the first noted in the written record to have crossed the Chicago Portage and traveled along the Chicago River, as part of their 1673 Mississippi Valley expedition. Over the following years, visits by the French continued and occasional intermittent posts were established, including those by Ren\u00e9 LaSalle, Henri de Tonti, Pierre Liette and the four-year Mission of the Guardian Angel. Point duSable's residence in the 1780s is recognized as the establishment of the first continuous settlement, which ultimately grew to become the city of Chicago. He is therefore widely regarded as the first permanent resident of Chicago and has been given the appellation \"Founder of Chicago\".\nMemorials.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Point du Sable] is not yet honored in his own house (which Chicagoans call the \"Kinzie House\") or on his own land. No street bears his name and, save for the high school, he has no monument. Cadillac is honored in Detroit, Pitt in Pittsburgh, Cleveland in Cleveland\u00a0\u2013 but the father of Chicago has no street or statue of stone to call his own.\n \"Ebony\", December 1963.\nBy the 1850s, historians of Chicago recognized Point duSable as the city's earliest non-Native permanent resident, but for a long time the city did not honor him in the same manner as other pioneers. Point du Sable was generally forgotten during the 19thcentury; instead, the Scots-Irish trader John Kinzie from Quebec, who had bought his property, was often credited for the settlement. A plaque was erected by the city in 1913 at the corner of Kinzie and Pine Streets to commemorate the Kinzie homestead. In the planning stages of the 1933\u20131934 Century of Progress International Exposition, several African-American groups campaigned for Point duSable to be honored at the fair. At the time, few Chicagoans had even heard of Point duSable, and the World's Fair organizers presented the 1803 construction of Fort Dearborn as the city's historical beginning. The campaign was partially successful, however, with a replica of Point duSable's cabin being presented as part of the \"background of the history of Chicago\".\nIn 1965, a plaza called Pioneer Court was built on the site of Point duSable's homestead as part of the construction of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of America building. The Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite was designated as a National Historic Landmark on 11 May 1976 as a site deemed to have \"exceptional value to the nation\". Pioneer Court is located at what is now 401N.Michigan Avenue in the Michigan\u2013Wacker Historic District. At this site in 2009, the City of Chicago and a private donor, Haitian-born Lesly Benodin, erected a large bronze bust of Point duSable by Chicago-born sculptor Erik Blome.\nIn October 2010, the Michigan Avenue Bridge was renamed DuSable Bridge. Previously, a small street with the alternative spelling DeSaible Street had been named after him. In 2021, Lake Shore Drive in Chicago was renamed in honor of Point du Sable.\nSeveral institutions have been named in his honor. DuSable High School opened in Bronzeville, Chicago, in 1934. The DuSable campus today houses the Daniel Hale Williams Prep School of Medicine and the Bronzeville Scholastic Institute.\nMargaret Taylor-Burroughs, a prominent African-American artist and writer, taught at the school for twenty-three years. She and her husband co-founded the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, located on Chicago's South Side. DuSable Hall, built in 1968, on the campus of Northern Illinois University is also named for him.\nDuSable Harbor is located in the heart of downtown Chicago at the foot of Randolph Street. Directly across the Chicago River from the harbor, DuSable Park is a urban park in Chicago currently awaiting redevelopment. The project was originally announced in 1987 by Mayor Harold Washington; following years of remediation of the site initial development began in early 2024. A park is also named after Point du Sable in St. Charles, his other notable place of residence. The US Postal Service honored Point duSable with the issue of a Black Heritage Series 22-cent postage stamp on 20 February 1987.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The battle, during the War of 1812, followed the evacuation of the fort ordered by the commander of the United States Army of the Northwest, William Hull. The battle lasted about 15 minutes and resulted in a complete victory for the Native Americans. After the battle, Fort Dearborn was burned down. Some of the soldiers and settlers who had been taken captive were later ransomed.\nFollowing the battle, the federal government became convinced that all Indians had to be removed from the territory and the vicinity of any settlements, as settlers continued to migrate to the area. The fort was rebuilt in 1816.\nBackground.\nFort Dearborn was constructed by United States troops under the command of Captain John Whistler in 1803. It was located on the south bank of the main stem of the Chicago River in what is now the Loop community area of downtown Chicago. At the time, the area was seen as wilderness. In the view of a later commander, Heald, it was \"so remote from the civilized part of the world.\" The fort was named in honor of Henry Dearborn, then United States Secretary of War. It had been commissioned after the Northwest Indian War of 1785\u20131795 and the signing of the Treaty of Greenville at Fort Greenville (now Greenville, Ohio) on August 3, 1795. As part of the terms of the treaty, a coalition of Native Americans and frontiersmen, known as the Western Confederacy, turned over to the United States large parts of modern-day Ohio and various other parcels of land, including centered on the mouth of the Chicago River.\nThe British Empire had ceded the Northwest Territory, comprising what is now Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and parts of Minnesota, to the United States at the Treaty of Paris in 1783. However, the area had been the subject of dispute between the Native American nations and the United States since the passage of the Northwest Ordinance in 1787. The Indian Nations followed Tenskwatawa, the Shawnee prophet and the brother of Tecumseh. Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"children of the Evil Spirit,\" the American settlers. Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion. The British saw the Native American nations as valuable allies and a buffer to their Canadian colonies and provided them arms. Resistance to American expansion in the Northwest further worsened Anglo-American relations. The confederation's raids hindered American access to potentially-valuable farmlands, mineral deposits, and fur trade areas.\nIn 1810, as a result of a long running feud, Captain Whistler and other senior officers at Fort Dearborn were removed. Whistler was replaced by Captain Nathan Heald, who had been stationed at Fort Wayne, Indiana. Heald was dissatisfied with his new posting and immediately applied for and received a leave of absence to spend the winter in Massachusetts. On his return journey to Fort Dearborn, he visited Kentucky, where he married Rebekah Wells, the daughter of Samuel Wells, and they traveled together to the fort in June 1811.\nAs the United States and Britain moved towards war, antipathy between the settlers and Native Americans in the Fort Dearborn area increased. In the summer of 1811, British emissaries tried to enlist the support of Native Americans in the region by telling them that the British would help them to resist the encroaching American settlement. On April 6, 1812, a band of Winnebago Indians murdered Liberty White, an American, and John B. Cardin, a French Canadian, at a farm called Hardscrabble, which was located on the south branch of the Chicago River, in the area now called Bridgeport. News of the murder was carried to Fort Dearborn by a soldier of the garrison, named John Kelso, and a small boy, who had managed to escape from the farm. Following the murder, some nearby settlers moved into the fort, and the rest fortified themselves in a house that had belonged to Charles Jouett, a Native American agent. Fifteen men from the civilian population were organized into a militia by Captain Heald and were armed with guns and ammunition from the fort.\nBattle.\nOn June 18, 1812, the United States declared war on the British Empire, and on July 17, British forces captured Fort Mackinac near the north coast of Lake Michigan. On July 29, General William Hull received news of the fall of Fort Mackinac and immediately sent orders to Heald to evacuate Fort Dearborn near the south coast of Lake Michigan, for fear that it could no longer be adequately supplied with provisions. In his letter to Heald, which arrived at Fort Dearborn on August 9, Hull ordered Heald to destroy all the arms and ammunition and to give the remaining goods to friendly Indians in the hope of attaining an escort to Fort Wayne. Hull also sent a copy of these orders to Fort Wayne to the southeast of Lake Michigan, with additional instructions to provide Heald with all the information, advice and assistance within their power. In the following days, the sub-Native American agent at Fort Wayne, Captain William Wells, who was the uncle of Heald's wife, Rebekah, assembled a group of about 30 Miami Native Americans. Wells, Corporal Walter K. Jordan, and the Miamis traveled to Fort Dearborn to provide an escort for the evacuees.\nWells arrived at Fort Dearborn on August 12 or 13 (sources differ), and on August 14, Heald held a council with the Potawatomi leaders to inform them of his intention to evacuate the fort. The Native Americans believed that Heald told them that he would distribute the firearms, ammunition, provisions, and whiskey among them and that if they would send a band of Potawatomis to escort them safely to Fort Wayne, he would pay them a large sum of money. However, Heald ordered all the surplus arms, ammunition, and liquor destroyed \"fearing that [the Native Americans] would make bad use of it if put in their possession.\" On August 14, a Potawatomi chief called Black Partridge warned Heald that the young men of the tribe intended to attack and that he could no longer restrain them.\nAt 9:00 am on August 15, the garrison, comprising, according to Heald's report, 54 US regulars, 12 militiamen, nine women and 18 children, left Fort Dearborn with the intention of marching to Fort Wayne. Wells led the group with some of the Miami escorts, while the rest of the Miamis were positioned at the rear. About south of Fort Dearborn, a band of Potawatomi warriors ambushed the garrison. Heald reported that, upon discovering that the Indians were preparing to ambush from behind a dune, the company marched to the top of the dune, fired off a round and charged at the Native Americans.\nThe maneuver separated the cavalry from the wagons, which allowed the overwhelming Native American force to charge into the gap, divide, and surround both groups. During the ensuing battle, some of the Native Americans charged at the wagon train that contained the women and children and the provisions. The wagons were defended by the militia, as well as Ensign George Ronan and the fort physician Van Voorhis. The officers and militia were killed, along with two of the women and most of the children. Wells disengaged from the main battle and attempted to ride to the aid of those at the wagons. In doing so, he was brought down. According to eyewitness accounts, he fought off many Native Americans before being killed, and a group of Indians immediately cut out his heart and ate it to absorb his courage.\nThe battle lasted about 15 minutes, when Heald and the surviving soldiers withdrew to an area of elevated ground on the prairie. They surrendered to the Native Americans, who took them as prisoners to their camp near Fort Dearborn. In his report, Heald detailed the American loss at 26 regulars, all 12 of the militia, two women and twelve children killed, with the other 28 regulars, seven women, and six children taken prisoner. Survivors of the massacre filed different accounts regarding the Miami warriors. Some said that they fought for the Americans, and others said they did not fight at all.\nAccounts.\nThe recollections of a number of the survivors of the battle have been published. Heald's story was recorded on September 22, 1812, by Charles Askin in his diary, Heald also wrote brief accounts of events in his journal and in an official report of the battle. Walter Jordan recorded his version of events in a letter to his wife dated October 12, 1812. Helm wrote a detailed narrative of events, but his fear of being court-martialed for his criticism of Heald made him delay publication until 1814. John Kinzie's recollections of the battle were recorded by Henry Schoolcraft in August 1820.\nThe accounts of details of the conflict are discrepant, particularly in their attribution of blame for the battle. Juliette Augusta Magill Kinzie's \"Wau-Bun: The Early Day in the Northwest\", which was first published in 1856, provides the traditional account of the conflict. However, it is based on family stories and is regarded as historically inaccurate. Nonetheless, its popular acceptance was surprisingly strong.\nThe Battle of Fort Dearborn has also been referred to as the \"Fort Dearborn Massacre\" by the defending Americans. The battle has been claimed a massacre due to the large number of Americans killed including women and children, as opposed to the relatively-smaller Potawatomi losses incurred. The conflict has also been argued to have been a measure of self-defense on the part of the Potawatomi.\nAftermath.\nAfter the battle, the Native Americans took their prisoners to their camp near Fort Dearborn and the fort was burned to the ground. The region remained empty of U.S. citizens until after the war ended. Some of the prisoners died in captivity, and others were later ransomed. The fort, however, was rebuilt in 1816.\nGeneral William Henry Harrison, who was not present at the battle, later claimed the Miami had fought against the Americans, and he used the Battle of Fort Dearborn as a pretext to attack Miami villages. Miami Chief, Pacanne, and his nephew, Jean Baptiste Richardville, accordingly ended their neutrality in the War of 1812 and allied with the British.\nHistorical perspective.\nSeen from the perspective of the War of 1812, and the larger conflict between Britain and France which precipitated it, this was a very small and brief battle, but it ultimately had larger consequences in the territory. Arguably, for the Native Americans, it was an example of \"winning the battle but losing the war\" since the US later pursued a policy of removing the tribes from the region, resulting in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which was marked at its culmination in 1835 by the last great Native American war dance in the nascent city. Thereafter, the Potawatomi and other tribes were moved further west.\nLocation and Park.\nEyewitness accounts place the battle on the lake shore somewhere between south of Fort Dearborn. Heald's official report said the battle occurred south of the fort, placing the battle at what is now the intersection of Roosevelt Road (12th Street) and Michigan Avenue. Juliette Kinzie, shortly before her death in 1870, stated that the battle had started by a large cottonwood tree, which still stood on 18th Street between Prairie Avenue and the lake. The tree was supposed to have been the last remaining of a grove of trees that had been saplings at the time of the battle.\nThe tree was blown down in a storm on May 16, 1894, and a portion of its trunk was preserved at the Chicago Historical Society. The historian Harry A. Musham points out that the testimony relating to the tree is all second hand and came from people who had settled in Chicago more than 20 years after the battle. Moreover, based on the diameter of the preserved section of trunk (about ) he estimated the age of the tree at the time that it was blown over at no more than 80 years and, therefore, he asserted that it could not have been growing at the time of the battle. Nevertheless, the site at 18th Street and Prairie Avenue has become the location traditionally associated with the battle, and on the battle's 197th anniversary in 2009, the Chicago Park District, the Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance and other community partners dedicated \"Battle of Fort Dearborn Park\" near the site at 18th Street and Calumet Avenue.\nMonuments.\nIn 1893, George Pullman had a sculpture he had commissioned from Carl Rohl-Smith erected near his house. It portrays the rescue of Margaret Helm, the stepdaughter of Chicago resident John Kinzie and wife of Lieutenant Linai Taliaferro Helm, by Potawatomi chief Black Partridge, who led her and some others to Lake Michigan and helped her escape by boat. The monument was moved to the lobby of the Chicago Historical Society in 1931. In the 1970s, however, Native American groups protested the display of the monument, and it was removed.\nIn the 1990s, the statue was reinstalled near 18th Street and Prairie Avenue, close to its original site, at the time of the revival of the Prairie Avenue Historic District. It was later removed for conservation reasons by the Office of Public Art of the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs. There are some efforts to reinstall the monument, but it is meeting resistance from the Chicago American Indian Center.\nThe battle is also memorialized with a sculpture by Henry Hering, called \"Defense\", which is located on the south western tender's house of the Michigan Avenue Bridge, which partially covers the site of Fort Dearborn. There are also memorials in Chicago to individuals who fought in the battle. William Wells is commemorated in the naming of Wells Street, a north\u2013south street and part of the original 1830 58-block plat of Chicago, while Nathan Heald is commemorated in the naming of Heald Square. Ronan Park on the city's Far North Side honors Ensign Ronan, who was the first West Point graduate to die in battle.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was constructed by U.S. troops under Captain John Whistler and named in honor of Henry Dearborn, then United States Secretary of War. The original fort was destroyed following the Battle of Fort Dearborn during the War of 1812, and a replacement Fort Dearborn was constructed on the same site in 1816 and decommissioned by 1837.\nParts of the fort were lost to the widening of the Chicago River in 1855, and a fire in 1857. The last vestiges of Fort Dearborn were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The site of the fort is now a Chicago Landmark, located in the Michigan\u2013Wacker Historic District, at the southern end of the DuSable Michigan Avenue Bridge.\nBackground.\nHistoric events.\nHuman activity in the Chicago area prior to the arrival of European explorers is mostly unknown, although it evidently served as a crossing point among many different peoples. In 1673, an expedition headed by Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette was the first recorded to have crossed the Chicago Portage and traveled along the Chicago River. Marquette returned in 1674, and camped for a few days near the mouth of the river. He moved to the portage, where he camped through the winter of 1674\u201375. Joliet and Marquette did not report any Native Americans living near the Chicago River area at that time. Archaeologists, however, have discovered numerous historic Indian village sites dating to that time elsewhere in the Chicago region.\nIn 1682, Ren\u00e9 Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had claimed a large territory (including the Chicago area), for France. Two of de La Salle's men built a stockade at the portage in the winter of 1682/1683.\nIn 1763, following defeat in the French and Indian War, the French ceded this area to Great Britain. It became a region within their Province of Quebec. Great Britain later ceded the area to the United States (at the end of the American Revolutionary War), although the Northwest Territory remained under \"de facto\" British control until about 1796.\nFollowing defeat of several Native American tribes in the Northwest Indian War of 1785\u20131795, the Treaty of Greenville was signed between the United States and several chiefs at Fort Greenville (now Greenville, Ohio), on August 3, 1795. As part of the terms of this treaty, a coalition of Native Americans and Frontiers men, known as the Western Confederacy, ceded to the United States large parts of modern-day Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois. This included \"six miles square\" centered from the mouth of the Chicago River for the establishment of a U.S. military base.\nLocal events.\nA French-Jesuit mission, the Mission of the Guardian Angel, was founded somewhere in the vicinity in 1696, but was abandoned around 1700. The Fox Wars effectively closed the area to Europeans in the first part of the 18th century. An early non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who might have had a trading-post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River around 1778.\nJean Baptiste Point du Sable, a French-speaking trader and settler of African descent, built a prosperous farm and trading post near the mouth of the Chicago River in the 1780s, at a site directly across the river from the future fort. A settlement developed there and he is viewed by some as the founder of Chicago. Antoine Ouilmette is the next recorded resident of Chicago; he claimed to have settled at the mouth of the Chicago River in July 1790.\nFirst Fort Dearborn.\nOn March 9, 1803, Henry Dearborn, the Secretary of War, wrote to Colonel Jean Hamtramck, the commandant of Detroit, instructing him to have an officer and six men survey the route from Detroit to Chicago, and to make a preliminary investigation of the situation at Chicago. Captain John Whistler was selected as commandant of the new post, and set out with six men to complete the survey. The survey completed, on July 14, 1803, a company of troops set out to make the overland journey from Detroit to Chicago. Whistler and his family made their way to Chicago on a schooner called the \"Tracy\". The troops reached their destination on August 17. The \"Tracy\" was anchored about half a mile offshore, unable to enter the Chicago River due to a sandbar at its mouth. Julia Whistler, the wife of Captain Whistler's son, Lieutenant William Whistler, later related that 2000 Indians gathered to see the \"Tracy\". The troops had completed the construction of the fort by the summer of 1804; it was a log-built fort enclosed in a double stockade, with two blockhouses (see diagram above). The fort was named \"Fort Dearborn\", after Secretary of War Henry Dearborn, who had commissioned its construction.\nA fur trader, John Kinzie, who bought the old Du Sable property, arrived in Chicago in 1804, and rapidly became the civilian leader of the small settlement that grew around the fort. In 1810, Kinzie and Whistler became embroiled in a dispute over Kinzie supplying alcohol to the Indians. In April, Whistler and other senior officers at the fort were removed; Whistler was replaced as commandant of the fort by Captain Nathan Heald.\nBattle of Fort Dearborn.\nDuring the War of 1812, General William Hull ordered the evacuation of Fort Dearborn in August 1812. Captain Heald oversaw the evacuation, but on August 15, the evacuees were ambushed along the trail by about 500 Potawatomi Indians in the Battle of Fort Dearborn. The Potawatomi captured Heald and his wife, Rebekah, and ransomed them to the British. Of the 148 soldiers, women, and children who evacuated the fort, 86 were killed in the ambush. The Potawatomi burned the fort to the ground the next day.\nSecond Fort Dearborn.\nFollowing the war, a second Fort Dearborn was built (1816). This fort consisted of a double wall of wooden palisades, officer and enlisted barracks, a garden, and other buildings. The American forces garrisoned the fort until 1823, when peace with the Indians led the garrison to be deemed redundant. The temporary abandonment lasted until 1828, when it was re-garrisoned following the outbreak of war with the Winnebago Indians. In her 1856 memoir, \"Wau Bun\", Juliette Kinzie described the fort as it appeared on her arrival in Chicago in 1831:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fort was inclosed [\"sic\"] by high pickets, with bastions at the alternate angles. Large gates opened to the north and south, and there were small portions here and there for the accommodation of the inmates.\u00a0... Beyond the parade-ground which extended south of the pickets, were the company gardens, well filled with currant-bushes and young fruit-trees. The fort stood at what might naturally be supposed to be the mouth of the river, yet it was not so, for in these days the latter took a turn, sweeping round the promontory on which the fort was built, towards the south, and joined the lake about half a mile below...\nThe fort was closed briefly before the Black Hawk War of 1832 and by 1837, the fort was being used by the Superintendent of Harbor Works. In 1837, the fort and its reserve, including part of the land that became Grant Park, was deeded to the city by the Federal Government. In 1855, part of the fort was demolished so that the south bank of the Chicago River could be dredged, straightening the bend in the river and widening it at this point by about ; and in 1857, a fire destroyed nearly all the remaining buildings in the fort. The remaining blockhouse and few surviving outbuildings were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\nLegacy and monuments.\nThe southern perimeter of Fort Dearborn was located at what is now the intersection of Wacker Drive and Michigan Avenue in the Loop community area of Chicago along the Magnificent Mile. Part of the fort outline is marked by plaques, and a line embedded in the sidewalk and road near the Michigan Avenue Bridge and Wacker Drive. A few boards from the old fort were retained and are now in the Chicago History Museum in Lincoln Park.\nFirst Presbyterian Church (Chicago), the longest continuously-operating institution in Chicago was founded in the carpentry shop of Fort Dearborn on June 26, 1833 and today is located in Woodlawn, Chicago\nOn March 5, 1899, the \"Chicago Tribune\" publicized a Chicago Historical Society replica of the original fort.\nIn 1933, at the Century of Progress Exhibition, a detailed replica of Fort Dearborn was erected as a fair exhibit. As part of the celebration, both a United States one-cent postage stamp and a souvenir sheet (containing 25 of the stamps) were issued, showing the fort. The individual stamp and sheet were reprinted when Postmaster General James A. Farley gave imperforated examples of these, and other stamps, to his friends. Because of the ensuing public outcry, millions of copies of \"Farley's Follies\" were printed and sold.\nIn 1939, the Chicago City Council added a fourth star to the city flag to represent Fort Dearborn. This star is depicted as the left-most, or first, star of the flag.\nThe site of the fort was designated a Chicago Landmark on September 15, 1971.\nAn elementary school in the Chicago Public Schools system is named after Fort Dearborn.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He won three Pulitzer Prizes: two for his poetry and one for his biography of Abraham Lincoln. During his lifetime, Sandburg was widely regarded as \"a major figure in contemporary literature\", especially for volumes of his collected verse, including \"Chicago Poems\" (1916), \"Cornhuskers\" (1918), and \"Smoke and Steel\" (1920). He enjoyed \"unrivaled appeal as a poet in his day, perhaps because the breadth of his experiences connected him with so many strands of American life\". When he died in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson observed that \"Carl Sandburg was more than the voice of America, more than the poet of its strength and genius. He was America.\"\nLife.\nCarl Sandburg was born in a three-room cottage at 313 East Third Street in Galesburg, Illinois, to Clara Mathilda (n\u00e9e Anderson) and August Sandberg, both of Swedish ancestry. He adopted the nickname \"Charles\" or \u201cCharlie\u201d in elementary school and, along with his two oldest siblings, changed the spelling of the family name to \"Sandburg\". \nAt the age of thirteen, Sandburg left school and began driving a milk wagon. Between approximately ages fourteen and seventeen or eighteen, he worked as a porter at the Union Hotel barbershop in Galesburg. He later returned to the milk route for eighteen months before working as a bricklayer and a farm laborer on the wheat plains of Kansas.\nAfter a period at Lombard College in Galesburg, Sandburg worked in various jobs, including as a hotel servant in Denver and a coal-heaver in Omaha, Nebraska. He began his writing career as a journalist for the \"Chicago Daily News\" and went on to write poetry, history, biographies, novels, children\u2019s literature, and film reviews. He also collected and edited books of ballads and folklore. Sandburg lived primarily in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan before moving to North Carolina.\nDuring the Spanish\u2013American War, Sandburg volunteered for military service and was stationed in Puerto Rico with the 6th Illinois Infantry, landing at Gu\u00e1nica on July 25, 1898, though he did not see combat. He attended the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York for two weeks but left after failing mathematics and grammar examinations. He returned to Galesburg and entered Lombard College, leaving without a degree in 1903.\nSandburg subsequently moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he worked for a newspaper and joined the Wisconsin Social Democratic Party, affiliated with the Socialist Party of America. Sandburg served as secretary to Emil Seidel, Milwaukee\u2019s socialist mayor from 1910 to 1912. Sandburg later stated that his experiences in Milwaukee were formative for his life and work.\nIn 1907, Sandburg met Lilian Steichen (1883\u20131977), sister of photographer Edward Steichen, at the Milwaukee Social Democratic Party office. They married the following year and had three daughters. Their first daughter, Margaret, was born in 1911. The family later lived in Harbert, Michigan; the Ravenswood neighborhood of Chicago; and then in Maywood, Illinois. From 1919 to 1930, they resided at 331 South York Street in Elmhurst, Illinois.\nDuring his years living in Chicago's western suburbs, Sandburg published several major works, including \"Chicago Poems\" (1916), \"Cornhuskers\" (1918), and \"Smoke and Steel\" (1920). He received a Pulitzer Prize in 1919, funded by a special grant from the Poetry Society of America, for \"Cornhuskers\". He also wrote three children\u2019s books\u2014\"Rootabaga Stories\" (1922), \"Rootabaga Pigeons\" (1923), and \"Potato Face\" (1930)\u2014as well as \"Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years\" (1926), \"The American Songbag\" (1927), and \"Good Morning, America\" (1928). The Elmhurst home was later demolished; the site is now a parking lot.\nSandburg moved to Michigan in 1930. In 1940, he won the Pulitzer Prize for History for \"\", the four-volume sequel to \"The Prairie Years\", and in 1951 received a second Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, for \"Complete Poems\". In 1945, he settled at Connemara, a estate in Flat Rock, Henderson County, North Carolina, where he lived with his wife, daughters, and grandchildren and produced a substantial portion of his later writings.\nOn February 12, 1959, during the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s birth, Sandburg delivered an address before a joint session of Congress following actor Fredric March\u2019s reading of the Gettysburg Address. Sandburg supported the civil rights movement and received the NAACP Silver Plaque Award in recognition of his contributions to civil rights.\nSandburg died of natural causes in 1967 and his body was cremated. The ashes were interred under \"Remembrance Rock\", a granite boulder located behind his birth house in Galesburg.\nCareer.\nPoetry and prose.\nMuch of Carl Sandburg's poetry, such as \"Chicago\", focused on Chicago, Illinois, where he spent time as a reporter for the \"Chicago Daily News\" and \"The Day Book\". His most famous description of the city is as \"Hog Butcher for the World/Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat/Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler,/Stormy, Husky, Brawling, City of the Big Shoulders.\"\nSandburg earned Pulitzer Prizes for his collection \"The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg\", \"Corn Huskers\", and for his biography of Abraham Lincoln (\"\"). Sandburg is also remembered by generations of children for his \"Rootabaga Stories\" and \"Rootabaga Pigeons\", a series of whimsical, sometimes melancholy stories he originally created for his own daughters. \"The Rootabaga Stories\" were born of Sandburg's desire for \"American fairy tales\" to match American childhood. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate, and so populated his stories with skyscrapers, trains, corn fairies and the \"Five Marvelous Pretzels\".\nIn 1919, Sandburg was assigned by his editor at the \"Daily News\" to do a series of reports on the working classes and tensions among whites and African Americans. The impetus for these reports were race riots that had broken out in other American cities. Ultimately, major riots broke out in Chicago too, but much of Sandburg's writing on the issues before the riots caused him to be seen as having a prophetic voice. A visiting philanthropist, Joel Spingarn, who was also an official of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, read Sandburg's columns with interest and asked to publish them, as \"The Chicago Race Riots, July, 1919\".\nLincoln works.\nSandburg's popular multivolume biography \"Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years\", 2 vols. (1926) and \"Abraham Lincoln: The War Years\", 4 vols. (1939) are collectively \"the best-selling, most widely read, and most influential book[s] about Lincoln.\" The books have been through many editions, including a one-volume edition in 1954 prepared by Sandburg.\nSandburg's Lincoln scholarship had an enormous impact on the popular view of Lincoln. The books were adapted by Robert E. Sherwood for his Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\" (1938) and David Wolper's six-part dramatization for television, \"Sandburg's Lincoln\" (1974). He recorded excerpts from the biography and some of Lincoln's speeches for Caedmon Records in New York City in May 1957. He was awarded a Grammy Award in 1959 for Best Performance \u2013 Documentary Or Spoken Word (Other Than Comedy) for his recording of Aaron Copland's \"Lincoln Portrait\" with the New York Philharmonic. Some historians suggest more Americans learned about Lincoln from Sandburg than from any other source.\nThe books garnered critical praise and attention for Sandburg, including the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for History for the four-volume \"\". But Sandburg's works on Lincoln also received substantial criticism. William E. Barton, who had published a Lincoln biography in 1925, wrote that Sandburg's book \"is not history, is not even biography\" because of its lack of original research and uncritical use of evidence, but Barton nevertheless thought it was \"real literature and a delightful and important contribution to the ever-lengthening shelf of really good books about Lincoln.\" Historian Milo Milton Quaife criticized Sandburg for not documenting his sources and questioned the accuracy of \"The Prairie Years\", noting they contain a number of factual errors. Others have complained \"The Prairie Years\" and \"The War Years\" contain too much material that is neither biography nor history, saying the books are instead \"sentimental poeticizing\" by Sandburg. Sandburg himself may have viewed his works more as an American epic than as a mere biography, a view also mirrored by other reviewers.\nFolk music.\nSandburg's 1927 anthology the \"American Songbag\" enjoyed enormous popularity, going through many editions, and Sandburg himself was perhaps the first American urban folk singer, accompanying himself on solo guitar at lectures and poetry recitals, and in recordings, long before the first or the second folk revival movements (of the 1940s and 1960s, respectively). According to the musicologist Judith Tick:\nAs a populist poet, Sandburg bestowed a powerful dignity on what the '20s called the \"American scene\" in a book he called a \"ragbag of stripes and streaks of color from nearly all ends of the earth ... rich with the diversity of the United States.\" Reviewed widely in journals ranging from the \"New Masses\" to \"Modern Music\", the \"American Songbag\" influenced a number of musicians. Pete Seeger, who calls it a \"landmark\", saw it \"almost as soon as it came out.\" The composer Elie Siegmeister took it to Paris with him in 1927, and he and his wife Hannah \"were always singing these songs. That was home. That was where we belonged.\"\nFilm.\nSandburg said he considered working on D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), but his first film work was when he signed on to work on the production of \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965) in July 1960 for a year, receiving an \"in creative association with Carl Sandburg\" credit on the film.\nLegacy.\nCommemoration.\nCarl Sandburg's boyhood home in Galesburg is now operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency as the Carl Sandburg State Historic Site. The site contains the cottage Sandburg was born in, a modern visitor center, and small garden with a large stone called Remembrance Rock, under which his and his wife's ashes are buried. Sandburg's home of 22 years in Flat Rock, Henderson County, North Carolina, is preserved by the National Park Service as the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site. Carl Sandburg College is located in Sandburg's birthplace of Galesburg, Illinois. During the Spanish-American War, Sandburg was stationed at Camp Alger in Fairfax County, Virginia and so the county has both a Sandburg Road near the spot where the camp was located and a Carl Sandburg Middle School.\nOn January 6, 1978, the 100th anniversary of his birth, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Sandburg. The spare design consists of a profile originally drawn by his friend William A. Smith in 1952, along with Sandburg's own distinctive autograph.\nThe Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) (RBML) houses the Carl Sandburg Papers. The bulk of the collection was purchased directly from Carl Sandburg and his family. In total, the RBML owns over 600 cubic feet of Sandburg's papers, including photographs, correspondence, and manuscripts.\nIn 2011, Sandburg was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.\nNamesakes.\nCarl Sandburg Village was a 1960s urban renewal project in the Near North Side, Chicago. Financed by the city, it is located between Clark and LaSalle St. between Division Street and North Ave. Solomon &amp; Cordwell, architects. In 1979, Carl Sandburg Village was converted to condominium ownership.\nNumerous schools are named for Sandburg throughout the United States, and he was present at some of these schools' dedications. (Some years after attending the 1954 dedication of Carl Sandburg High School in Orland Park, Illinois, Sandburg returned for an unannounced visit; the school's principal at first mistook him for a hobo.) Sandburg Halls, a student residence hall at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, carries a plaque commemorating Sandburg's roles as an organizer for the Social Democratic Party and as personal secretary to Emil Seidel, Milwaukee's first Socialist mayor.\nCarl Sandburg Library opened in Livonia, Michigan, in 1961. The name was recommended by the Library Commission as an example of an American author representing the best of literature of the Midwest. Carl Sandburg had taught at the University of Michigan for a time.\nGalesburg opened Sandburg Mall in 1975, named in honor of Sandburg.\nAmtrak added the \"Carl Sandburg\" train in 2006 to supplement the \"Illinois Zephyr\" on the Chicago\u2013Quincy route.\nhttps:// in Alexandria, Virginia, part of Fairfax County Public Schools, was named in honor of Sandburg in 1985.\nIn 2000, the Chicago Public Library Foundation created the Carl Sandburg Literary Award, given annually to \"an acclaimed author whose work has enhanced the public\u2019s awareness of the written word.\"\nPolitics.\nCarl Sandburg began his political involvement as an organizer for the Social Democratic Party of Wisconsin, affiliated with the Socialist Party of America, and served as secretary to Milwaukee\u2019s socialist mayor Emil Seidel from 1910 to 1912. Initially a committed socialist, he left the Socialist Party in 1917 due to disagreements with its opposition to U.S. participation in World War I, instead supporting President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s decision to enter the conflict.\nAlthough Sandburg continued to hold some socialist sympathies\u2014such as voting for Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs in the 1920 United States presidential election\u2014he later described himself as a \"radical independent\". During the 1920s, his political views moved to the right, and he developed a strong interest in Abraham Lincoln, whose life and leadership became central themes in his work. This interest culminated in his publication of \"Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years\" (1926) and \"Abraham Lincoln: The War Years\" (1939). His study of Lincoln reflected an increasing alignment with liberalism.\nIn the 1930s, Sandburg\u2019s political orientation shifted toward the Democratic Party. He supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, drawing parallels between Roosevelt\u2019s policies and Lincoln\u2019s leadership during the Civil War. Sandburg publicly expressed his support for New Deal programs such as Social Security and federal employment initiatives through his writings and public appearances.\nBy the 1950s, Sandburg endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson II in the 1952 and 1956 presidential elections, participating in campaign activities and publicly commending Stevenson\u2019s platform. In 1960, he supported John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign, speaking at rallies and expressing approval of Kennedy\u2019s New Frontier program, which he viewed as a continuation of Roosevelt\u2019s legacy.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It faces France across the Strait of Dover, the narrowest part of the English Channel at from Cap Gris Nez in France. It lies southeast of Canterbury and east of Maidstone. The town is the administrative centre of the Dover District and home of the Port of Dover.\nArchaeological finds have revealed that the area has always been a focus for peoples entering and leaving Britain. The name derives from the River Dour that flows through it.\nIn recent times the town has undergone transformations with a high-speed rail link to London, new retail in town with St James' area opened in 2018, and a revamped promenade and beachfront. This followed in 2019, with a new 500m Pier to the west of the Harbour, and new Marina unveiled as part of a \u00a3330m investment in the area. It has also been a point of destination for many illegal migrant crossings.\nThe Port of Dover provides much of the town's employment, as does tourism including to the landmark White Cliffs of Dover. There were over 368,000 tourists visiting Dover castle in the year of 2019.\nDover is classified as a Large-Port Town, due to its large volumes of port traffic and low urban population.\nHistory.\nArchaeological finds have shown that there were Stone Age people in the area, and that some Iron Age finds also exist. During the Roman period, the area became part of the Roman communications network. It was connected by road to Canterbury and Watling Street and it became \"Portus Dubris\", a fortified port. Dover has a partly preserved Roman lighthouse (the tallest surviving Roman structure in Britain) and the remains of a villa with preserved Roman wall paintings. Dover later figured in Domesday Book (1086).\nForts were built above the port and lighthouses were constructed to guide passing ships. It is one of the Cinque Ports. and has served as a bastion against various attackers: notably the French during the Napoleonic Wars and Germany during the Second World War.\nDuring the Cold War, a regional seat of government was located within the White Cliffs beneath Dover Castle. This is omitted from the strategic objects appearing on the Soviet 1:10,000 city plan of Dover that was produced in 1974. The port would have served as an embarkation point for sending reinforcements to the British Army of the Rhine in the event of a Soviet ground invasion of Europe.\nIn 1974, a discovery was made at Langdon Bay off the coast near Dover. It contained bronze axes of French design and is probably the remainder of the cargo of a sunken ship. At the same time, this find also shows that trade routes across the Channel between England and France existed already in the Bronze Age, or even earlier. In 1992, the so-called Dover boat from the Bronze Age was discovered in six metres depth underwater. This is one of the oldest finds of a seaworthy boat. Using the radiocarbon method of investigation, the boat's construction was dated to approximately 1550 BC.\nEtymology.\nFirst recorded in its Latinised form of \"Portus Dubris\", the name derives from the Brythonic word for water ( in Middle Welsh, in Modern Welsh apart from \" 'dwfrliw' \" (Watercolour) which has retained the old Welsh spelling, in Breton). The same element is present in the town's French name and the name of the river, \"Dour\", which is also evident in other English towns such as Wendover. However, the modern Modern Welsh name is an adaptation of the English name \"Dover\".\nThe current name was in use at least by the time of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" (between 1603 and 1606), in which the town and its cliffs play a prominent role.\nThe Siege of Dover (1216).\nLouis VIII of France landed his army, seeking to depose King Henry III, on Dover's mainland beach. Henry III ambushed Louis' army with approximately 400 bowmen atop The White Cliffs of Dover and his cavalry attacking the invaders on the beach. However, the French slaughtered the English cavalry and made their way up the cliffs to disperse the bowmen. Louis' army seized Dover village, forcing the English back to Canterbury. French control of Dover lasted for three months after which English troops pushed back, forcing the French to surrender and return home.\nGeography and climate.\nDover is in the south-east corner of Britain. From South Foreland, the nearest point to the European mainland, Cap Gris Nez is away across the Strait of Dover.\nThe site of its original settlement lies in the valley of the River Dour, sheltering from the prevailing south-westerly winds. This has led to the silting up of the river mouth by the action of longshore drift. The town has been forced into making artificial breakwaters to keep the port in being. These breakwaters have been extended and adapted so that the port lies almost entirely on reclaimed land.\nThe higher land on either side of the valley \u2013 the Western Heights and the eastern high point on which Dover Castle stands \u2013 has been adapted to perform the function of protection against invaders. The town has gradually extended up the river valley, encompassing several villages in doing so. Little growth is possible along the coast, since the cliffs are on the sea's edge. The railway, being tunnelled and embanked, skirts the foot of the cliffs.\nDover has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen classification \"Cfb\") similar to the rest of the United Kingdom with mild temperatures year-round and a light amount of rainfall each month. The warmest recorded temperature was , recorded at Langdon Bay on 25 July 2019, While the lowest recorded temperature was , recorded at Dover RMS on 31 January 1972. The temperature is usually between and .\nDemography.\nIn 1800, the year before Britain's first national census, Edward Hasted (1732\u20131812) reported that the town had a population of almost 10,000 people.\nAt the 2001 census, the town of Dover had 28,156 inhabitants, while the population of the whole urban area of Dover, as calculated by the Office for National Statistics, was 39,078 inhabitants.\nWith the expansion of Dover, many of the outlying ancient villages have been incorporated into the town. Originally the parishes of Dover St. Mary's and Dover St. James, since 1836 Buckland and Charlton have become part Dover, and Maxton (a hamlet to the west), River, Kearsney, Temple Ewell, and Whitfield, all to the north of the town centre, are within its conurbation.\nEconomy.\nRetail.\nThe town's main shopping streets are the High Street, Biggin Street, Market Square, Cannon Street, Pencester Road and Castle Street. The Castleton Retail Park is to the north-west of the town centre. The new St James' Retail and Leisure Park opened in 2018 and is a southern extension of the town centre; it consists of shops, restaurants, a Travelodge Hotel and a Cineworld Cinema.\nShipping.\nThe Dover Harbour Board is the responsible authority for the running of the Port of Dover. The English Channel, here at its narrowest point in the Straits of Dover, is the busiest shipping lane in the world. Ferries crossing between here and the Continent have to negotiate their way through the constant stream of shipping crossing their path. The \"Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme\" allots ships separate lanes when passing through the Strait. The Scheme is controlled by the Channel Navigation Information Service based at Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre Dover. MRCC Dover is also charged with co-ordination of civil maritime search and rescue within these waters.\nThe Port of Dover is also used by cruise ships. The old Dover Marine railway station building houses one passenger terminal, together with a car park. A second, purpose-built, terminal is located further out along the pier.\nThe ferry lines using the port are (number of daily sailings in parentheses):\nThese services have been cut in recent years:\n&lt;br&gt;\nTransport.\nRoad.\nDover's main communications artery, the A2 road replicates two former routes, connecting the town with Canterbury. The Roman road was followed for centuries until, in the late 18th century, it became a toll road. Stagecoaches were operating: one description stated that the journey took all day to reach London, from 4am to being \"in time for supper\".\nThe other main roads, travelling west and east, are the A20 to Folkestone and thence the M20 to London, and the A258 through Deal to Sandwich.\nIn December 2020, a long line of freight trucks formed due to sudden border closures with France, because of new strains of COVID-19 within the United Kingdom.\nRail.\nThe railway reached Dover from two directions: the South Eastern Railway's main line connected with Folkestone in 1844, and the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway opened its line from Canterbury in 1861. Southeastern trains run from Dover Priory to London Charing Cross, London Victoria or London St Pancras International stations in London, and Ramsgate or Sandwich in Kent. With the introduction of the high-speed service into St Pancras International via High Speed 1, rail journey times between London and Dover were reduced to 55 minutes non-stop.\nThe Chatham Main Line into Priory was electrified under British Railways in 1959 as part of Stage 1 of Kent Coast Electrification, under the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan. The line up to Ramsgate, via Deal, was subsequently electrified under stage two of Kent Coast electrification in January 1961. The line from Folkestone into Priory was electrified in June 1961.\nA tram system operated in the town from 1897 to 1936.\nWalking.\nDover has two long distance footpaths: the Saxon Shore Way and the North Downs Way. The National Trust White Cliffs can be reached by foot from the town centre, with pathways to South Foreland Lighthouse, and St Margarets Bay along the cliff top . The walking routes from Dover pass the National Trust visitor centre on the landmark chalk cliffs overlooking the English Channel with views of France visible on a clear day.\nCycling.\nTwo National Cycle Network routes begin their journey at the town. Route one goes from Dover to Canterbury.\nThis route links with National Cycle Route 2 from Dover to St Austell, Regional route 16, and Regional route 17 in Dover. It passes three castles. Firstly from Dover on the steap incline past Dover Castle. ThenSouth Foreland Lighthouse is visible from the route. Mostly traffic-free along the east coast from Kingsdown to Deal, passing Walmer Castle and Deal Castle. Follows toll road (free to cyclists) through the Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club to the town of Sandwich. In Sandwich the route links with Regional route 15.\nDover town centre is cycle friendly: There are dedicated cycle lanes along the seafront and cycle routes through the town's pedestrianised High Street area.\nFerry.\nThe Port of Dover is a 20-minute walk from Dover Priory railway station.\nThe port offers crossings to both Calais (DFDS, P&amp;O and Irish Ferries) and Dunkerque (DFDS). The Dover to Dunkirk ferry route was originally operated by ferry operator Norfolkline. This company was later acquired by the pan European operator DFDS Seaways in July 2010. The crossing time is approximately two hours. The location of Dunkirk is also more convenient for those travelling by road transport on to countries in Northern Europe including Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and further afield.\nBus.\nStagecoach in East Kent provide local bus services. Dover is on the Stagecoach Diamond network providing links to Canterbury and Deal. The Western Docks at the port of Dover are served from the town centre as well as Canterbury and Deal. Dover is the start of The Wave network to New Romney via Folkestone, Hythe and Dymchurch. There are services to Lydd via Lydd Airport, and links to Sandwich.\nNational Express runs coaches from Dover to other towns in Kent including Canterbury, Folkestone, Ashford, Kent, Maidstone, Gillingham at Hempsted Valley shopping centre and Greenhithe at Bluewater Shopping Centre for Dartford to London including Bexleyheath, Eltham, Walworth, Canary Wharf, Elephant &amp; Castle, the City of London and to Victoria Coach Station.\nRNLI.\nThe Dover lifeboat is a Severn class lifeboat based in the Western Docks.\nDover Lifeboat station is based at crosswall quay in Dover Harbour. There is a Severn-class lifeboat, which is the biggest in the fleet. It belongs to the RNLI which covers all of Great Britain. The lifeboat number is 17\u201309 and has a lot of emergencies in the Channel. The Severn class is designed to lay afloat.

Located in the Magnificent Mile district, the building was designed by Peruvian-American chief designer Bruce Graham and Bangladeshi-American structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM). When the building topped out on May 6, 1968, it was the second-tallest building in the world after the Empire State Building, in New York City, and the tallest in Chicago. It is currently the fifth-tallest building in Chicago and the fourteenth-tallest in the United States, behind the Aon Center in Chicago and ahead of the Comcast Technology Center in Philadelphia. When measured to the top of its antenna masts, it stands at .\nThe building is home to several offices and restaurants, as well as about 700 condominiums; at the time of its completion, it contained the highest residence in the world. The building was originally named for John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, a developer and original tenant of the building, which itself was named for the U.S. Founding Father John Hancock. In 2018, John Hancock Insurance, years after leaving the building, requested that its name be removed; the owner is seeking another naming rights deal.\nFrom the 95th-floor restaurant, which closed in late 2023, diners were able to look out at Chicago and Lake Michigan. The observatory (360 Chicago), which competes with the Willis Tower's Skydeck, has a 360\u00b0 view of the city, up to four states, and a distance of over . 360 Chicago is home to TILT, a moving platform that leans visitors over the edge of the skyscraper to a 30-degree angle, a full bar with local selections, Chicago's only open-air SkyWalk, and also features free interactive high-definition touchscreens in six languages. The 44th-floor sky lobby features the highest indoor swimming pool in the United States.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nThe project, which would become the world's second tallest building at opening, was conceived and owned by Jerry Wolman in late 1964. The project was financed by John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company. Construction of the tower was interrupted in 1967 due to a flaw in an innovative engineering method used to pour concrete in stages, that was discovered when the building was 20 stories high. The engineers were getting the same soil settlements for the 20 stories that had been built as what they had expected for the \"entire\" 99 stories. This forced the owner to stop development until the engineering problem could be resolved, resulting in a credit crunch. The situation is similar to the one faced during the construction of 111 West Wacker, then known as the Waterview Tower. Wolman's bankruptcy resulted in John Hancock taking over the project, which retained the original design, architect, engineer, and main contractor.\nThe building's first resident was Ray Heckla, the original building engineer, responsible for the residential floors from 44 to 92. Heckla moved his family in April 1969, before the building was completed.\nThe 1988 film \"Poltergeist III\" was set at the John Hancock Center and was filmed in early 1987.\n21st century.\nOn December 10, 2006, the non-residential portion of the building was sold by San Francisco\u2013based Shorenstein Properties for $385 million and was purchased by a joint venture of Chicago-based Golub &amp; Company and the Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds. Shorenstein Properties had bought the building in 1998 for $220 million.\nGolub defaulted on its debt and the building was acquired in 2012 by Deutsche Bank, who subsequently carved up the building. The venture of Deutsche Bank and New York\u2013based NorthStar Realty Finance paid an estimated $325 million for debt on 875 North Michigan Avenue in 2012 after Shorenstein Properties defaulted on $400 million in loans. The observation deck was sold to Paris-based Montparnasse 56 Group for between $35 million and $45 million in July 2012. That same month, Prudential Real Estate Investors acquired the retail and restaurant space for almost $142 million. In November 2012, Boston-based American Tower Corp affiliate paid $70 million for the antennas. In June 2013, a venture of Chicago-based real estate investment firm Hearn Co., New York\u2013based investment firm Mount Kellett Capital Management L.P. and San Antonio\u2013based developer Lynd Co. closed on the expected acquisition of 875 North Michigan Avenue's of office space and 710-car parking deck. The Chicago firm did not disclose a price, but sources said it was about $145 million. This was the last step in that piecemeal sale process. In May 2016, Hearn Co. announced that they were seeking buyers for the naming rights with possible signage rights for the building.\nHustle up the Hancock is an annual stair climb race up the 94 floors from the Michigan Avenue level to the observation deck. It is held on the last Sunday of February. The climb benefits Respiratory Health Association. The record time as of 2007 is 9 minutes 30 seconds.\nThe building is home to the transmitter of Univision's WGBO-DT (channel 66), while all other full-power television stations in Chicago broadcast from Willis Tower. The City Colleges of Chicago's WYCC (channel 20) transmitted from the building until November 2017, when it departed the air as part of the 2016 FCC spectrum auction.\nOn February 12, 2018, John Hancock Insurance requested that its name and logos throughout the building's interior be removed immediately; John Hancock had not had a naming-rights deal with the skyscraper's owners since 2013. The building's name was subsequently changed to its street address as 875 North Michigan Avenue. \nThe Signature Room restaurant on the 95th and 96th floors was listed for sale in April 2023 and closed that September, with ownership citing \"severe economic hardship\" that they attributed to the impact of the earlier COVID-19 pandemic. 360 CHICAGO, which operated the 94th-floor observation deck, bought the building's 95th and 96th floors in June 2024. The next year, it was announced that 875 North Michigan's observation deck would be expanded into the former Signature Room space. Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (the architectural firm that designed the building in the 1970s) was hired to redesign these two floors.\nIncidents.\nOn November 11, 1981, Veterans Day, high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate Dan Goodwin, for the purpose of calling attention to the inability to rescue people trapped in the upper floors of skyscrapers, successfully climbed the building's exterior wall. Wearing a wetsuit and using a climbing device that enabled him to ascend the I-beams on the building's side, Goodwin battled repeated attempts by the Chicago Fire Department to knock him off. Fire Commissioner William Blair ordered Chicago firemen to stop Goodwin by directing a fully engaged fire hose at him and by blasting fire axes through nearby glass from the inside. Fearing for Goodwin's life, Mayor Jane Byrne intervened and allowed him to continue to the top.\nOn December 18, 1997, comedian Chris Farley was found dead in his apartment on the 60th floor of the building.\nOn March 9, 2002, part of a scaffold fell 43 stories after being torn loose by wind gusts around crushing several cars, killing three people in two of them. The remaining part of the stage swung back-and-forth in the gusts repeatedly slamming against the building, damaging cladding panels, breaking windows, and sending pieces onto the street below. On November 21, 2015, a fire broke out in an apartment on the 50th floor of the building. The Chicago Fire Department was able to extinguish the fire after an hour and a half; five people suffered minor injuries. On February 11, 2018, a fire in a car on the seventh floor required approximately 150 firefighters to extinguish. On November 16, 2018, an express elevator cable broke. Initial reports stated that an elevator with six passengers plunged 84 stories from the 95th to 11th floor. Since express elevators are not accessible from floors within the express zone, a team of firefighters had to break through a brick wall from the parking garage to extricate the passengers, none of whom suffered injuries. Elevators to the 95th/96th floor were closed thereafter pending investigation. Subsequent investigation documented only a controlled descent from the 20th floor to the 11th floor.\nOn January 5, 2022, a piece of cladding fell from the building.\nArchitecture.\nOne of the most famous buildings of the structural expressionist style, the skyscraper's distinctive X-braced exterior shows that the structure's skin is part of its \"tubular system\". This is one of the engineering techniques which the designers used to achieve a record height; the tubular system is the structure that keeps the building upright during wind and earthquake loads. This X-bracing allows for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan. Such original features have allowed 875 North Michigan Avenue to become an architectural icon. It was pioneered by Bangladeshi-American structural civil engineer Fazlur Khan and chief architect Bruce Graham.\nThe interior was remodeled in 1995, adding to the lobby travertine, black granite, and textured limestone surfaces. The elliptical-shaped plaza outside the building serves as a public oasis with seasonal plantings and a 12-foot (3.7\u00a0m) waterfall. A band of white lights at the top of the building is visible all over Chicago at night, and changes colors for different events. For example, at Christmas time the colors are green and red. When a Chicago-area sports team goes far in the playoffs, the colors are changed to match that team's colors.\nThe building is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers. It has won various awards for its distinctive style, including the Distinguished Architects Twenty-five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects in May 1999. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the John Hancock Center was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois) and was recognized by USA Today Travel magazine, as one of AIA Illinois' selections for Illinois 25 Must See Places.\nThe building is only partially protected by a fire sprinkler system, as the residential floors do not have sprinklers. Including its antennas, the building has a height of , making it the thirty-third tallest building in the world when measured to pinnacle height.\nInterior spaces.\n44th floor sky lobby.\nThe 44th level skylobby is the floor where the building transitions from offices to residential, with offices occupying floors below and residences occupying floors above.\nSwimming pool.\nOn its 44th floor, the John Hancock Center has a resident swimming pool. The pool area has double-height ceilings. \nThe pool is the highest pool in the United States when measured by distance above ground level.\nResident/office tenant grocery store.\nOn its 44th floor, the building has a grocery store accessible only to apartment residents and office tenants. In 2007, operation of the grocery store was taken over by the local Potash chain of grocery stores. As of February 2023, Potash continues to operate the grocery store.\nUpper floors.\nExpress elevators.\nThe elevators that serve the top three public floors are credited as the fastest in both North America and the Western Hemisphere. Manufactured by Otis, the elevators travel 96 floors at a top speed of . It has been said that they would be capable of reaching the 95th floor in 38 seconds if they could run the entire trip at their top speed.\n360 Chicago Observation Deck.\nLocated on the 94th floor, 360 Chicago Observation Deck is 875 North Michigan Avenue's horizon observatory. The floor of the observatory is above the street-level below. The entrance can be found on the concourse level of 875 North Michigan Avenue, accessible from the Michigan Avenue side of the building. The observatory was previously named \"John Hancock Observatory\". It has been independently owned and operated since 2014 as an subsidiary of the Paris, France-based observation deck company Magnicity (formerly known as the \"Montparnasse 56 Group\"). After its acquisition of the observation deck, the company extensively renovated the space in 2014. \nThe observatory boasts more floor space than its direct competitor, Skydeck at the Willis Tower. The observation deck currently includes a cocktail lounge named the \"CloudBar\". After the closure of the building's 96th floor cocktail lounge, 360 CHICAGO has advertised it as being the highest cocktail lounge in the city. It was formerly named \"BAR 94\". In the summer of 2014, 360 Chicago added its TILT attraction. TILT, which requires an additional fee to experience, features a series of floor-to-ceiling windows that slowly tilt outside the building to 30\u00b0. The observation deck also features an open-air \"skydeck\" area (with mesh wire screens but no exterior glass windows).\nFor several years in the 2010s, during its winter season, the observation deck would feature the \"world's highest skating rink\", with an artificial ice rink being seasonally installed. At one point, observation deck had a mascot named Seemore Miles.\nFormer 95th floor restaurant and 96th floor cocktail lounge.\nSeparate from its observatory, 875 Michigan Avenue formerly had a restaurant space on its 95th floor and a cocktail lounge space on its 96th floor. The combined space on these floors was approximately . The original restaurant in this space was named \"The 95th restaurant\", which operated from the 1970s until 1993. Its accompanying 96th floor cocktail lounge was named \"Images\". From 1993 until 2023, the 95th floor was home to a restaurant named the \"Signature Room\", with the accompanying cocktail lounge on the 96th floor being named the \"Signature Lounge\". The name alluded to the famous signature of early American figure John Hancock. The restaurant was an upscale establishment that offered patrons scenic views. It enforced a dress code for patrons. It received numerous awards. In September 2023, the Signature Room abruptly ceased operations.\nParking garage.\nHoused within several of the lower levels of the building is a parking garage, which cars enter and depart via a spiral vehicle ramp.\nOther features.\nRetail plaza.\nThe building features a two-level outdoor plaza along its Michigan Avenue face. The plaza contains retail and dining tenants. The top level of the plaza is at street level, while the lower level is sunken below the street level.\nCurrent tenants include The Cheesecake Factory and The North Face. Past tenants have included Best Buy.\nThe plaza was originally rectangular in shape. Per the \"Chicago Tribune\", the plaza was modeled after the plaza at New York City's Rockefeller Center. The plaza's design featured a fountain pool that would be turned into an ice rink in colder weather. \nIn 1988, plans were unveiled by the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (the owners of the building at the time) to replace the plaza with a \"$20 million glass and marble three-story atrium\". One rationale cited by building's management was they claimed that access to the building's ground level was complicated by the need of pedestrians to circumnavigate around the courtyard in order to reach the street-level entrance to the building's lobby. They also cited a belief that the building's entrance was too understated for a building of its level of prominence. This atrium proposal faced backlash from local residents who felt that such an addition would mar the appearance of the landmark building. In 1989, newly-elected mayor Richard M. Daley criticized the proposed atrium and the plans were ultimately abandoned.\nIn 1994, the plaza was renovated, with the sunken portion transforming from its previous rectangular shape to an elliptical shape. In 1999, \"Chicago Tribune\" architecture critic Blair Kamin wrote that this renovation had made the plaza a more \"welcoming\" space. This renovation came after the more dramatic late-1980s renovation plans were abandoned. A further $10 million renovation for the plaza was considered by the building's owners in the mid-2010s which would have added features such as video screens and decorative prisms to the plaza.\nAntennas.\nSince its completion, the tower has been topped by two antenna structures. These antenna superstructures support a large number of broadcast antenna equipment. At the time of the tower's completion, both antenna structures were in height, and RCA had given the architects of the building an estimate that 700 feet of antenna structure would be required to accommodate all of the city's radio and television stations. In 2002, the eastern antenna tower was extended to a height of in order to enable WBBM-TV to add new digital antenna equipment at a height greater than the roof height of the Sears Tower (Willis Tower). Subsequently, the western antenna tower was reduced to a height of .\nFor a long time, the antenna towers utilized incandescent red lights and a red and white paint scheme to provide a visibility to aviation in compliance with federal regulations. However, in order to forgo the expense and effort of annually reapplying striped paint to the antenna towers, the tower instead installed red strobe lights atop the tower and eliminated the striped paint scheme, as striped paint is not required if structures are topped by such lights.\nA sizable number of television and radio stations utilize the antenna towers. Many stations maintain broadcast equipment on both the John Hancock Center and the Willis Tower's antenna structures in order to have both a primary and backup broadcasting point.\nIn November 2012, an affiliate of Boston-based American Tower paid $70 million to acquire ownership of the antennas.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40429", "revid": "800198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40429", "title": "Waltzing Matilda", "text": "Australian song\n\"Waltzing Matilda\" is a song developed in the Australian style of poetry and folk music called a bush ballad. It has been described as the country's \"unofficial national anthem\".\nThe title was Australian slang for travelling on foot, by walking (waltzing) with one's belongings in a \"matilda\" (swag) slung over one's back, a slang expression that may have originally been repurposed from a work of light verse by Charles Godfrey Leland. The song narrates the story of an itinerant worker, or \"swagman\", boiling a billy at a bush camp and capturing a stray jumbuck (sheep) to eat. When the jumbuck's owner, a squatter (grazier), and three troopers (mounted policemen) pursue the swagman for theft, he declares \"You'll never catch me alive!\" and commits suicide by drowning himself in a nearby billabong (watering hole), after which his ghost haunts the site.\nThe original lyrics were composed in 1895 by Australian poet Banjo Paterson, to a tune played by Christina MacPherson based on her memory of Thomas Bulch's march \"Craigielee\", which was in turn based on James Barr's setting for Robert Tannahill's poem \"Thou Bonnie Wood o Craigielee\".\nThe first published setting of \"Waltzing Matilda\" was Harry Nathan's on 20 December 1902. Nathan wrote a new variation of Christina MacPherson's melody and changed some of the words. Sydney tea merchant James Inglis wanted to use \"Waltzing Matilda\" as an advertising jingle for Billy Tea. In early 1903, Inglis purchased the rights to 'Waltzing Matilda' and asked Marie Cowan, the wife of one of his managers, to try her hand at turning it into an advertising jingle. Cowan made some more changes to the words and some very minor changes to Nathan's melody and gave the song a simple, brisk, harmonious accompaniment which made it very catchy. Her song, published in 1903, grew in popularity, and Cowan's arrangement remains the best-known version of \"Waltzing Matilda\".\nExtensive folklore surrounds the song and the process of its creation, to the extent that it has its own museum, the Waltzing Matilda Centre in Winton, in the Queensland outback, where Paterson wrote the lyrics. In 2012, to remind Australians of the song's significance, Winton organised the inaugural Waltzing Matilda Day to be held on 6 April, wrongly thought at the time to be the anniversary of its first performance.181\nThe song was first recorded in 1926 as performed by John Collinson and Russell Callow. In 2008, this recording of \"Waltzing Matilda\" was added to the Sounds of Australia registry in the National Film and Sound Archive, which says that there are more recordings of \"Waltzing Matilda\" than any other Australian song.\nHistory.\nWriting of the song.\nIn 1895, Andrew Barton Paterson was living in Sydney, making his living as a solicitor. During this time, Paterson also wrote poetry and worked as a freelance journalist, both of which were published under the pen name of \"The Banjo\". Banjo was the name of his favourite horse on his father's farm. Paterson's poetry became unexpectedly popular, eventually resulting in his identity being publicly revealed. At some point in 1895, Paterson took a holiday from his day job, probably in early August. He made a journey of at least 5 days to visit Sarah Riley, his fianc\u00e9e of 7 years, in Winton, central-western Queensland and to see how people lived on the enormous, remote sheep stations in the district.\nOn arriving in Winton, Banjo attended a gathering where Christina Macpherson, Sarah's friend from school days in St Kilda, Melbourne, played some music to entertain those present. One tune caught Banjo's attention. In Christina's own words, \"Mr Paterson asked me what it was \u2013 I could not tell him &amp; he then said that that he thought that he could write some lines to it. He then and there wrote the first verse.\" The rest of the song was written and rehearsed over a period of some three or four weeks in August and early September at a number of locations. Credible accounts exist of the later verses being written at Dagworth Station, a sheep station north-west of Winton in Central West Queensland, owned by the Macpherson family. Paterson and others have left accounts of the song being written at Dicks Creek, en route to Winton from Dagworth Station. The song was then sung, with piano accompaniment, in a house in Winton (owned by members of the Riley family). There is photographic evidence of the song, at an advanced stage, being sung at Oondooroo Station, again with piano accompaniment. When no piano was available, the instrument that Christina played was a small, very early model of an instrument called a volkszither or akkordzither in Germany. In America, where it became very popular, it was called an autoharp.\nOn 24 April 1894, Christina had attended the annual Warrnambool steeplechase meeting in south western Victoria. The music at the meeting was provided by the Warrnambool Garrison Artillery Band. The first item played by the band was the quick march \"Craigielee\", composed by English-born Australian Thomas Bulch, in or before 1891, using the pseudonym Godfrey Parker. \"Craigielee\" was a typical march with three strains. The first strain in the main section was based on \"Thou Bonny Wood of Craigie Lee\", composed by Glasgow musician James Barr, published in 1818 for Robert Tannahill's poem \"Thou Bonnie Wood o Craigielee\" which was written prior to 1806. Christina had a good memory for songs and, when she had the opportunity, tried to play the first strain by ear on piano. Christina's memory was not perfect. The first strain of \"Craigielee\" had the musical form AABC. Christina remembered the AAB section and put it into her tune as bars 1\u201312. For some reason she did not add the C section to her song as bars 13\u201316. To complete her tune, Christina repeated the second A section. Christina's tune had the musical form AABA. This is the musical form of \"Waltzing Matilda\" sung today.\nWhen Christina arrived at Dagworth in June 1895 she found an autoharp with three or four chord bars, which belonged to the bookkeeper, John Tait Wilson. As there was no piano at Dagworth, Christina learned to play this autoharp. Within seven weeks she was able to play the tune that she heard at Warrnambool, well enough to catch the attention of Banjo Paterson. During the rest of her stay at Dagworth she mastered it.\nAbout seven weeks after she arrived at Dagworth, Christina and her brothers went into Winton for a week or so. This coincided with the time that Banjo Paterson arrived to meet Sarah Riley. Banjo and Sarah were immediately invited to join the group returning to Dagworth Station. This was an irresistible temptation for a man venturing into the outback, the 'never-never' for the first time. During his stay, Paterson would have seen the places, heard the stories and encountered the people who inspired the lyrics of the original \"Waltzing Matilda\".\nPossible inspirations.\nIn Queensland, in 1891, the Great Shearers' Strike brought the colony close to civil war and was broken only after the Premier of Queensland, Samuel Griffith, called in the military. In July and August 1894, as the shearing season approached, the strike broke out again in protest at a wage and contract agreement proposed by the squatters. During July and August, seven shearing sheds in central Queensland were burned by striking union shearers before shearing could begin with non-union labour. Early on the morning of 2 September, a group of striking union shearers, firing rifles and pistols, set fire to the shearing shed at Dagworth. The fire killed over a hundred sheep. The shed was defended by Constable Michael Daly, Bob Macpherson and his brothers and employees. In the early afternoon of the same day, Senior Constable Austin Cafferty, in Kynuna, was informed that a man had shot himself at a striking shearers' camp in a billabong from Kynuna and about from Dagworth. When he arrived at the camp, S/C Cafferty found the body of Samuel Hoffmeister, also known as \"Frenchy\", with a bullet wound through the mouth, in an apparent suicide. Hoffmeister was a known leader of the striking unionists and suspected of being involved in the arson attack at Dagworth on the night before. Later S/C Cafferty was joined by Constable Michael Daly, who had travelled from Dagworth. Three days later, a Coronial inquest into Hoffmeister's death was held at Kynuna Station. Police Magistrate, Ernest Eglington, travelled from Winton to conduct it. Dr Welford accompanied him to carry out a post mortem. Evidence was given by shearers who were in the camp when Hoffmeister died. The coroner found that the cause of Hoffmeister's death was \"suicide\" \u2013 a single gunshot to the mouth. That finding has, in 2010, been questioned.\nBanjo Paterson was a first-class horseman and loved riding. It is likely that he would have seized any opportunity to go riding at Dagworth. Bob Macpherson (the brother of Christina) and Paterson went riding together and, in Christina's words, \"they came to a waterhole (or billabong) &amp; found the skin of a sheep which had been recently killed\u2014all that had been left by a swagman\". This incident may have inspired the second verse. Tom Ryan worked at Dagworth in 1895 and recorded an incident in which Paterson accompanied Dagworth horse breaker, Jack Lawton, when he went to the Combo to bring in a mob of horses. They brought them part of the way in and then put them against a fence running into a waterhole. Lawton then took the saddle from his horse and gave it a swim. He then stripped off and dived from a gum tree into the waterhole. Paterson followed suit. Jack then noticed that the mob of horses were walking away and would probably go back to their starting point. He jumped on his own horse without waiting to don any clothes and galloped after the mob. He was surprised, on looking around, to find his companion had again followed his example. On reaching the station that night, Paterson told him it was the best day's outing he had ever had.\nBanjo's stay at Dagworth Station was short. He would have spent at least 16 days travelling during his absence from Sydney. While claims are made that he attended Combo Waterhole, they are not confirmed by Banjo or others who were present at the time of any visit there. There is no evidence that Banjo made the round trip to the Four Mile Billabong where Hoffmeister's body was found. It is highly unlikely that he would have had time to do so during his short stay at Dagworth Station.\nChristina's manuscripts.\nPaterson returned to Sydney in early September. Sometime later, Banjo wrote to Christina and asked her to send him a copy of the music of their song. This presented Christina with a serious problem: Christina played music by ear: she did not use sheet music. Writing down music from memory is quite challenging, even for musicians who read music well. It is extremely challenging for one who does not. In Christina's own words, \"I am no musician but did my best.\" Christina managed to get hold of some 12-stave manuscript paper and wrote a first draft, writing down the notes of her song on the stave, as little open circles, at the pitch, and in the order that she remembered them. Christina would have used a piano to help her do this. She made no effort to indicate the lengths of the notes. In bar 9, Christina wrote the first 2 notes as a C. This was a mistake: they should have been B flat. Christina corrected this in a later manuscript. Christina had a very good ear, but, unfortunately, she had very limited ability to represent the time value of notes. Her full drafts have many mistakes. Some are minor and easily corrected, while some are fundamentally wrong. Christina's final drafts do not accurately represent the melody that she sang, and as written, they are unplayable. Despite this, it is possible to infer, with considerable accuracy, the melody of the tune that Christina recalled when she eventually drafted the manuscript and it established the Scottish origin of the song.\nIt is not known when Banjo wrote to Christina or where Christina was when the manuscripts were written. Christina may have still been in Queensland or she may have returned to Melbourne. Christina wrote at least 3 full drafts of the song. She kept one, now known as the Macpherson manuscript. She sent one to Banjo and gave another to W. B. Bartlam, the manager of a station adjoining Dagworth at the time. This one is now known as the Bartlam-Roulston manuscript. The Bartlam-Roulston manuscript has the correct notes at the beginning of bar 9, indicating that it was written after the Macpherson manuscript. The manuscript that she kept was passed down to her sister, Margaret (McArthur) who in turn passed it down to her daughter, Diana (Baillieu). It was made public in 1992 and was later donated it to the National Library of Australia. The Bartlams knew what their manuscript was, but no one believed them until 1971. This allowed some myths about the song to grow. Both full drafts and the first draft are held at the National Library of Australia. The manuscript sent to Paterson was lost.\nMemories and miscellanea.\nSome 40 years later, and not long before Christina died, Christina and Banjo each left different accounts of their recollection of the events surrounding the writing of \"Waltzing Matilda\". In the early 1930s, English musician Dr Thomas Wood worked his way around Australia as a music examiner and searched for Australian folk songs. He was captivated by \"Waltzing Matilda\". In 1931, the Argus newspaper reported him saying that 'Waltzing Matilda' was written on a moment's inspiration by Banjo Paterson, his sister composing the music equally spontaneously. In 1934, in his book \"Cobbers\", Wood wrote a brief, colourful, but very incomplete account of the composition of \"Waltzing Matilda\". Christina carefully drafted a letter to him to set the record straight but did not date or send it. In it, Christina stated that when the first verse was written, she had travelled to Winton with her brothers and that she had heard the music played by a band at Warrnambool. Christina then added more information from 1895 through to the song's inclusion in the \"Australasian Students Song Book\", which was published in 1911. Christina had a comprehensive memory and was proud of her role in producing the song. About the same time, for a talk on ABC radio, Paterson wrote that in 1894 the shearers staged a strike by way of expressing themselves, and Macpherson's shearing shed was burnt down, and a man was picked up dead. ... while resting for lunch or changing horses on our four-in-hand-journeys, Miss Macpherson, afterwards the wife of financial magnate, J McCall McCowan, used to play a little Scottish tune on a zither, and I put words to the tune and called it \"Waltzing Matilda\". These scanty details complement Christina's account but do not suggest that the song meant a lot to him. Paterson also attributed the playing of the music to the wrong Macpherson sister. Christina's sister Jean married McCall McCowan. Christina never married. As time passed, Banjo's memories of his trip to Dagworth faded.\nSome 30 years later again and also for a talk on ABC radio, Hugh Paterson, Banjo's son, wrote his recollection of what Banjo had told him about the role that the autoharp played in the composition of \"Waltzing Matilda\". When Christina played her tune derived from \"Bonnie Wood of Craigielea\", Banjo said, \"I told her that I thought I could write some whimsical words to match the tune's appeal to me ... We were too far out in the 'never-never' for pianos. But Miss Macpherson played it for me on an autoharp while I wrote the words that seemed to me to express its whimsicality and dreaminess.\"\nFor many years, it was believed that the song was first performed on 6 April 1895 by Sir Herbert Ramsay, 5th Bart., at the North Gregory Hotel in Winton, Queensland. The occasion was a banquet for the Premier of Queensland. This day is still celebrated as 'Waltzing Matilda Day'. In fact, Christina, Jean and Ewen Macpherson left Melbourne on the SS Wodonga on 1 June 1895 and the song was not written until probably late August. \"Waltzing Matilda\" was certainly not sung on 6 April 1895. Sir Herbert Ramsay did sing \"Waltzing Matilda\" when Bob Macpherson, Christina and Banjo visited Oondooroo Station, owned by the Ramsay family probably in the first week of September 1895. Herbert was dressed up as a swagman and his photo was taken.\nBarrister, Trevor Monti, made a study of the transcript of the Coronial inquest into the death of Samuel Hoffmeister. In February 2010, ABC News reported his opinion that the death of Hoffmeister was more akin to a gangland assassination than to suicide.\nAlternative theories.\nGiven the tumultuous events of the shearers' strike and the burning down of 8 shearing sheds in the Winton &amp; Kynuna districts in 1894, and given Paterson's socialist views, it is not difficult to see why historians look for a political allegory in the words of \"Waltzing Matilda\", penned in the districts in 1895. Ross Fitzgerald, emeritus professor in history and politics at Griffith University, argued that the defeat of the strike only a year or so before the song's creation, would have been in Paterson's mind, most likely consciously but at least \"unconsciously\", and thus was likely to have been an inspiration for the song. Fitzgerald stated, \"the two things aren't mutually exclusive\"\u2014a view shared by others, who, while not denying the significance of Paterson's relationship with Macpherson, nonetheless recognise the underlying story of the shearers' strike and Hoffmeister's death in the lyrics of the song.\nAccording to writer, Mathew Richardson, the 'swagman', at his most corporeal, is Frenchy Hoffmeister, who actually committed suicide by a billabong ... In a more general way, the swagman represents the 'free citizen, the itinerant with no vote, no award, no arbitration, standing for the union'.\nThese theories were not shared by other historians. In 2008, Australian writers and historians Peter and Sheila Forrest claimed that the widespread belief that Paterson had penned the ballad as a socialist anthem, inspired by the Great Shearers' Strike, was false and a \"misappropriation\" by political groups. The Forrests asserted that Paterson had in fact written the self-described \"ditty\" as part of his flirtation with Christina Macpherson, despite his engagement to Sarah Riley.\nThe original words of the first two lines of the first chorus of 'Waltzing Matilda' are, 'Who'll come a'waltzing Matilda my darling? Who'll come a'waltzing Matilda with me?' In 2019, in \"Waltzing Matilda \u2013 Australia's Accidental Anthem\", W. Benjamin Lindner asks two questions. \"Is 'Waltzing Matilda' a serenade and who was the 'darling' to whom Paterson posed the question, 'Who'll come a'waltzing Matilda with me?'\" Lindner gives the unequivocal answer, \"'Waltzing Matilda' is a serenade to Paterson's musical muse, Christina.\"\nGraham Seal, Professor of Folklore at Curtain University, WA, wrote that \"Waltzing Matilda\" is \u2013 \"let's be honest \u2013 a pretty silly ditty about a swaggie knocking off a sheep and throwing himself in the billabong when the squatter and the cops turn up.\"\nSeveral alternative theories for the origins of the words of \"Waltzing Matilda\" have been proposed since the time it was written. Some oral stories collected during the twentieth century claimed that Paterson had merely modified an existing bush song, but there is no evidence for this. In 1905, Paterson himself published a book of bush ballads he had collected from around Australia entitled \"Old Bush Songs\", with nothing resembling \"Waltzing Matilda\" in it. Nor do any other publications or recordings of bush ballads include anything to suggest it preceded Paterson. Meanwhile, manuscripts from the time the song originated indicate the song's origins with Paterson and Christina Macpherson, as do their own recollections and other pieces of evidence.\nHistory of the music.\nThe story of \"Waltzing Matilda\" began in West Paisley, Scotland, about south of where Glasgow airport is today. Robert Tannahill, the weaver poet, wrote a poem, \"Thou Bonnie Wood of Craigielea\", prior to 1806. It was written in the pattern chorus, verse, chorus, verse, ready to be set to music. Tannahill's friend James Barr set it to music, and it was published in 1818. Barr's song was unusually melodious: it used four 4-bar phrases in a 16-bar song. It had the musical form ABCD. In 1850, an arrangement was published in 'The Lyric Gems of Scotland', page 65, which was written in the pattern verse, chorus, verse, chorus, and it dropped the second phrase of the verse and repeated the first. It had the musical form AABC. In 1880, an arrangement by T S Gleadhill, published in 'Kyles Scottish Lyric Gems', pages 244, 245, also dropped the second phrase of the verse and repeated the first. Thomas Bulch, an English expat living in Australia, wrote a quick march arrangement for brass band, called 'Craigielee' most likely in 1891. The opening strain of 'Craigielee' was 'Bonnie Wood of Craigielea' with the musical form AABC. It is very close to the melody in the \"Lyric Gems\" and perhaps even closer to the melody in Gleadhill's \"Kyles Scottish Lyric Gems\". This was the tune that caught Christina Macpherson's attention at the races at Warrnambool, Victoria, in 1894. Christina had a good ear and, when she next sat at a piano, she tried to play the opening strain. Christina remembered the AAB phrases and transcribed them into bars 1 to 12 of her tune. For some reason, Christina did not transcribe the C phrase into bars 13 to 16 of her tune. Instead, she repeated bars 5 to 8 in bars 13 to 16. This gave Christina's tune the musical form AABA, popular American style. This is the musical form of \"Waltzing Matilda\" sung today.\nOne more change needed to be made. The tune that Christina played for Banjo was written to set the poem \"Thou Bonnie Wood of Craigielea\" to music. The words of its chorus are,\n&lt;poem&gt;\nThou bonnie wood of Craigielee,\nThou bonnie wood of Craigielee,\nNear thee I pass'd life's early day,\nAn' won my Mary's heart in thee.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe number of syllables in each line is 8, 8, 8, 7. The verses are the same.\nThe words of the original chorus of Christina's Waltzing Matilda are\n&lt;poem&gt;\nWho'll come a Waltzing Matilda my darling?\nWho'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?\nWaltzing Matilda and leading a water bag,\nWho'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe number of syllables in each line is 11, 10, 12, 10. The verses are similar.\nAs Banjo and Christina collaborated on their song, Christina had to add more notes to her initial tune. She did this by breaking up several notes in each line into shorter ones. While doing this, Christina retained the shape of the melody and the typical 2/4 type rhythm of 'Craigielee'. Typical of songs with multiple verses, the melody had to be changed slightly in some verses to fit the meter of the words. Christina and Banjo would have had some arguments, Christina wanting to preserve the tune and Banjo wanting the strict meter of the lyrics to be preserved. Despite this, the two tunes sound very similar. Many may even say that they are the same.\nThis tune did not spread very quickly: an electronic search of Australian newspapers between 1895 and 1902, using trove, reveals only two reports of 'Waltzing Matilda' being sung. On 9 October 1900, the governor of Queensland visited Winton and Mr. A. Ramsay sang 'Waltzing Matilda', \"one of Banjo Patterson's ditties composed in the Winton district.\" On 23 November 1901, the Hughenden representative of the N.Q. Herald reported that, \"'Waltzing Matilda' is all the rage here now.\" Three regional newspapers printed the words of the \"quaint trifle\", but not the tune. Some of the words had been changed and resembled the words later used by Marie Cowan.\nAlternative theories and myths.\nThere has been speculation about the similarity of \"Waltzing Matilda\" and a British song, \"The Bold Fusilier\" or \"The Gay Fusilier\" (also known as \"Marching through Rochester\", referring to Rochester in Kent and the Duke of Marlborough). Author Matthew Richardson writes that a \"direct creative link is indisputable\" between the two and that Banjo Paterson would have been familiar with \"The Bold Fusilier\" and was likely guided by the pattern and sound. The similarity is so obvious that one is clearly a copy of the other. \"The Bold Fusilier\" is dated by some to the start of the 18th century.\nIn the early 1900s only one verse and chorus of the song were known. This snippet was printed in \"The Bulletin\" magazine in Sydney, Australia on 8 October 1941.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nVerse: A gay fusilier was marching down through Rochester\nBound for the wars in the low country,\nAnd he cried as he tramped through the drear streets of Rochester,\nWho'll be a sojer for Marlboro with me?\nChorus: Who'll be a sojer, Who'll be a sojer,\nWho'll be a sojer for Marlboro with me?\nAnd he cried as he tramped through the drear streets of Rochester,\nWho'll be a sojer for Marlboro with me?\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe song sung today has the musical form AABA and is sung to the same tune as Marie Cowan's \"Waltzing Matilda\", published in Sydney, Australia, in 1903. The lyrics describe events as happening in Rochester, England, during the reign of Queen Anne, 1702 to 1714. It was widely, though not universally, accepted that the song was written at that time. English folklore authority Ralph Vaughan Williams considered that the earlier existence of the song was very doubtful because its language was not appropriate to the early eighteenth century. There is no documentary proof that \"The Bold Fusilier\" existed before 1900. The song has the musical form AABA, which suggests a much later origin. On the other hand, the origin of \"Waltzing Matilda\" can be traced from \"Thou Bonny Wood of Craigie Lee\" published in 1818. Hearsay evidence exists that \"Waltzing Matilda\" was sung by Australian soldiers in South Africa during the Boer War and that the British troops returned friendly fire by singing \"The Gay/Bold Fusilier\" as a parody.\nIn about 1970, English folk singer Peter Coe reworked the existing first verse and chorus and added another four verses. This song, a timeless comment about war, is quite popular today and has spawned other similar lyrics. Peter's song is called \"The Rochester Recruiting Sergeant\".\nIn his 1987 book, Richard Magoffin speculated that the music of \"Waltzing Matilda\" may have been sourced from an Irish Jig, \"Go to the Devil and Shake Yourself\", which was probably composed by Irishman, John Field, and which began to appear in print about 1797. In a letter to Magoffin, the City Librarian of Dublin Library said that he thought he could detect a slight resemblance in it to \"Waltzing Matilda\". This is very tenuous evidence. Magoffin also went to say that it would be nice to think that the Irish have played a part in providing Australia with her song.\nUntil the internet arrived, it was extremely difficult for researchers to access old music. Now, with YouTube and digital collections of old music, it is a quick and simple task. An audio file of \"Go to the Devil and Shake Yourself\" can be heard, and the sheet music can be viewed, in the external links, at the above references and numerous other websites. It is now obvious to anyone that there is no resemblance between it and \"Waltzing Matilda\".\nOwnership.\nOn 12 January 1903, Paterson sold the rights to \"Waltzing Matilda\" and \"some other pieces\" to Angus &amp; Robertson for \"a fiver\", five Australian pounds. A good shearer could easily make more than that in a week. Very soon after, tea trader James Inglis, owner of Inglis and Co., purchased the musical rights to 'Waltzing Matilda' from Angus and Robertson for 5 guineas (5 pounds and 5 shillings). Inglis asked Marie Cowan, who was married to his accountant, to 'rejig' the song for use as an advertising jingle for the Billy Tea company, making it nationally famous. Within two months of Paterson selling the copyright, musicians could buy a copy of Marie Cowan's altered lyrics set to a new arrangement of Christina's music for 9 pence.\nAlthough by 1996, no copyright applied to the song in Australia and many other countries, the Australian Olympic organisers had to pay royalties to an American publisher, Carl Fischer Music, following the song being played at the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta. According to some reports, the song was copyrighted by Carl Fischer Music in 1941 as an original composition. However, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reported that Carl Fischer Music had collected the royalties on behalf of Messrs Allan &amp; Co, an Australian publisher that claimed to have bought the original copyright, though Allan's claim \"remains unclear\". Arrangements such as those claimed by Richard D. Magoffin remain in copyright in America. \nCowan's melody.\nOver time and as they travel, folk songs tend to change. This happened to Banjo and Christina's 'Waltzing Matilda'. On 23 November 1901, the Hughenden representative of the N.Q. Herald reported that, \"'Waltzing Matilda' is all the rage here just now and some clever fellow has managed to fit the quaint trifle with an exceedingly catchy air\". The report contained the words, but not the tune. Some of the words had been changed. Banjo's swagman had become a \"jolly\" swagman and the second line of verse 1 was repeated as the second line of the chorus following each of the verses.\nThe first setting of 'Waltzing Matilda' that was published was Harry Nathan's, with Sydney publisher Palings' Brisbane office on 20 December 1902. This was two weeks before Paterson sold the rights to 'Waltzing Matilda' to Angus and Robertson. Nathan credited Banjo for the lyrics, with the music arranged and harmonized by Harry A. Nathan. Nathan changed some of the lyrics and wrote a new variation of the original tune. Banjo's swagman had become a \"jolly\" swagman who sang as he \"waited till his billy boiled\".\nVery soon after Paterson sold his rights on 12 January 1903, they were purchased by tea merchant James Inglis, who wanted to use 'Waltzing Matilda' as an advertising jingle for Billy Tea. By this time, Nathan's arrangement of 'Waltzing Matilda' would have been on sale at Palings Sydney shop for several weeks and Inglis would have had the opportunity to purchase it. Inglis did not find any of the existing settings satisfactory and invited Marie Cowan, the wife of one of his managers, to try her hand at it. The melody of Harry Nathan's and Marie Cowan's arrangements are so similar that one is clearly a copy of the other. Marie Cowan made some minor changes to Nathan's tune and changed a few of the lyrics. The policemen became \"troopers\" in verse 3 and the swagman cried, \"You'll never take me alive.\" in verse 4. Cowan repeated the second line of each verse in the corresponding chorus. She gave the song a simple, brisk, harmonious accompaniment which made it very catchy. Her song, published in 1903, quickly grew in popularity and Cowan's arrangement remains the best-known version of \"Waltzing Matilda\".\n&lt;score raw sound&gt;\n\\layout { indent = 0\\cm\nsopranoVoice = \\relative c\" {\n \\global\n \\dynamicUp \\autoBeamOff\n a8. a16 a8 a g4 g | f a8 f d e f4 |\n c4 f8. a16 c4 c8 c | c c c4 c8 r8\n f, g | a4 a8 a g4 g | f8 g a f d e f4 |\n c f8. a16 c4 bes8 a | g4 g8 g f4 r4 |\n c' c8. c16 c4 a | f' f8. e16 d4 c |\n c4 c8. c16 d4 c8. c16 | c4 bes8 a g r\n f g | a4 a8 a g4 g | f8 g a f d e f4 |\n c f8. a16 c4 bes8 a | g4 g8 g f4 r \\bar \"|.\"\nverse = \\lyricmode {\n Once a jol -- ly swag -- man camped by a bill -- a -- bong\n Un -- der the shade of a coo -- li -- bah tree,\n And he sang as he watched and wai -- ted till his Bil -- ly boiled,\n You'll come a -- waltz -- ing Ma -- til -- da with me.\n Waltz -- ing Ma -- til -- da, waltz -- ing Ma -- til -- da,\n You'll come a -- waltz -- ing Ma -- til -- da with me,\n And he sang as he watched and wai -- ted till his Bil -- ly boiled,\n You'll come a -- waltz -- ing Ma -- til -- da with me.\nright = \\relative c\" {\n \\global\n r8 a,\\p c f r4 &lt;e c bes&gt; | r r &lt;bes d f&gt; |\n r8 a c f r a, c f | &lt;c a' c&gt;4 &lt;c bes' c&gt; &lt;c a' c&gt;8 r8\n f8 g | r8 a, [c f] r4 &lt;e c bes g&gt;4 | r4 &lt;f c a&gt; r &lt;f d bes&gt; |\n r8 a, c f r &lt;f c a&gt;8 &lt;e c bes&gt;4 | &lt;e c bes g&gt; &lt;e c bes&gt; &lt;f c a&gt; r |\n &lt;c' a&gt; &lt;c a&gt;8. &lt;c a&gt;16 &lt;c a&gt;4 | &lt;f' a,&gt; &lt;f a,&gt;8. &lt;e c&gt;16 &lt;d bes&gt;4 &lt;c a&gt; |\n &lt;c a&gt; &lt;c a&gt;8. &lt;c a&gt;16 &lt;d bes&gt;4 &lt;c a&gt;8. &lt;c a&gt;16 | &lt;c a&gt;4 &lt;bes g&gt;8 &lt;g c&gt; r\n f g | r a, c f r4 &lt;e c bes&gt; | r &lt;f c a&gt; r &lt;f d bes&gt; |\n r8 a, c f r a, c f | &lt;e c bes g&gt;4 &lt;e c bes g&gt; &lt;f c a&gt; r \\bar \"|.\"\nleft = \\relative c {\n \\global\n &lt;f f,&gt;4\\pp r &lt;c c,&gt; r | &lt;f f,&gt; r &lt;bes, bes,&gt; r |\n &lt;f' f,&gt; r &lt;f f,&gt; r | &lt;f f,&gt; &lt;c c,&gt; &lt;f f,&gt;\n r | &lt;f f,&gt; r &lt;c c,&gt; r | &lt;f f,&gt; r bes, r |\n &lt; f' f,&gt; r &lt;f f,&gt; r8 c | &lt;c c,&gt;4 &lt;c c,&gt; &lt;f f,&gt; r |\n &lt;f f,&gt; &lt;e' c a&gt; &lt;f c a&gt; r | &lt;f, f,&gt; &lt;bes d f&gt; |\n &lt;f f,&gt; &lt;bes d f&gt; | &lt;c, c,&gt; &lt;g' bes c&gt; &lt;c, c,&gt;8 r8\n r4 | &lt;f f,&gt; r &lt;c c,&gt; r | &lt;f f,&gt; r &lt;bes, bes,&gt; r | &lt;f' f,&gt; r &lt;f f,&gt; r | &lt;c c,&gt; &lt;c c,&gt; &lt;f f,&gt; r \\bar \"|.\"\npianoPart = \\new PianoStaff \u00ab\n \\right\n\\score { \u00ab \\sopranoVoicePart \\pianoPart \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nSource.\nLyrics.\nTypical lyrics.\nThere are no official lyrics to \"Waltzing Matilda\" and slight variations can be found in different sources.

These include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVariations.\nOriginal notebook.\nThe lyrics of \"Waltzing Matilda\" have been changed since it was written. Banjo Paterson wrote the original lyrics of \"Waltzing Matilda\" in his notebook. When Paterson visited Winton and Dagworth in August 1895, he carried a foolscap size 1892 legal diary that was never used for legal work. In it he used to write the first draft of verses and chapters of books. On a page in the \"W\" section, as he composed them, Paterson penned the original words of \"Waltzing Matilda\". He did not include the date, the title or punctuation. In three places he made changes by crossing out the first words he wrote and replacing them. This notebook is now at the National Library of Australia, and it has been digitized. A transcript of the original words reads\n&lt;poem&gt;\nOh there once was a swagman camped in the billabong\nUnder the shade of a Coolibah tree\nAnd he sang as he looked at the old billy boiling\nWho'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me\nWho'll come a waltzing Matilda my darling\nWho'll come a waltzing Matilda with me\nWaltzing Matilda and leading a water bag\nWho'll come a waltzing Matilda with me\nDown came a jumbuck to drink at the water hole\nUp jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee\nAnd he sang as he put him away in the tucker bag\nYou'll come a waltzing Matilda with me\nYou'll come a waltzing Matilda my darling\nYou'll come a waltzing Matilda with me\nWaltzing Matilda and leading a water bag\nYou'll come a waltzing Matilda with me\nDown came the squatter a riding on his thorough-bred\nDown came Policemen one, two, &amp; three\nWhose is the jumbuck you've got in the tucker-bag\nYou'll come a waltzing Matilda with we\nYou'll come a waltzing Matilda my darling\nYou'll come a waltzing Matilda with we\nWaltzing Matilda and leading a water bag\nYou'll come a waltzing Matilda with we\nBut the swagman, he up and he jumped in the waterhole\nDrowning himself by the Coolibah tree\nAnd his ghost can be heard as it sings in the billabong,\nWho'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nInitially, the fourth line of verse 1 was, \"Who'll come a rovin' Australia with me\". Paterson later changed it to, \"Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me\".\nThe first line of the first chorus began as, \"Who'll come a rovin'\". Paterson crossed out \"rovin\" and changed the line to, \"Who'll come a waltzing Matilda my darling\".\nIn line 3 of the first chorus he wrote, \"Waltzing Matilda and leading a \"tucker\" bag\". Paterson crossed out \"tucker\" and wrote, \"Waltzing Matilda and leading a water bag\".\nBanjo added a little bit of humour. In verse 3, the squatter and the three policemen address the hapless swagman, \"Whose is the jumbuck you've got in the tucker bag? You'll come a waltzing Matilda with we.\" The ungrammatical (in standard Australian English), comical and poetically unusual \"we\" was intended and was repeated in the third chorus. \"We\" as the object is common in some English dialects such as Geordie but incorrect in standard Australian English. The bad English would have elicited a good giggle from those who heard it. Christina's manuscript of \"Waltzing Matilda\" also has the ungrammatical \"we\" in the last line of verse 3. As the song changed, it was quickly forgotten.\n1917 version.\nThe following version, considered to be the 'original', was published by Paterson himself in \"Saltbush Bill, J.P., and Other Verses\" in 1917, and appears as follows:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nOh! there once was a swagman camped in the Billabong,\nUnder the shade of a Coolabah tree;\nAnd he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling,\n'Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me.'\nWho'll come a-waltzing Matilda, my darling,\nWho'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?\nWaltzing Matilda and leading a water-bag\u2014\nWho'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?\nDown came a jumbuck to drink at the water-hole,\nUp jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee;\nAnd he sang as he put him away in his tucker-bag,\n'You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me!'\nDown came the Squatter a-riding his thorough-bred;\nDown came Policemen \u2013 one, two, and three.\n'Whose is the jumbuck you've got in the tucker-bag?\nYou'll come a-waltzing Matilda with we.' [\"sic\"]\nBut the swagman, he up and he jumped in the water-hole,\nDrowning himself by the Coolabah tree;\nAnd his ghost may be heard as it sings in the Billabong,\n'Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?'\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nQueensland version.\nThere is also the Queensland version of \"Waltzing Matilda\" that is popular with folk singers. Verses 1 to 4 retain almost the exact words of the original Banjo Paterson text. The chorus is the same as the first verse of the original and is repeated unchanged after each verse. The words are set to a pretty, lilting melody with the musical form ABAB. It has no resemblance to the Macpherson/Paterson tune with the musical form AABA. It is not known who composed the tune or when it was composed.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nOh there once was a swagman camped in a billabong,\nUnder the shade of the coolibah tree;\nAnd he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling,\n'Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?'\n\"Chorus:\"\nWho'll come a-waltzing Matilda my darling?\nWho'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?\nWaltzing Matilda and leading a water bag,\nWho'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?\nDown came a jumbuck to drink at the water hole,\nUp jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee;\nAnd he sang as he stowed him away in his tucker-bag,\n'You'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me.'\nDown came the squatter a-riding his thoroughbred;\nDown came policemen \u2013 one two and three.\n'Whose is the jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?\nYou'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me.'\nBut the swagman he up and he jumped in the water-hole,\nDrowning himself by the coolibah tree;\nAnd his ghost may be heard as it sings in the billabong,\n'Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?'\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nStatus.\nIn May 1988 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) chief executive, John Sturman, presented five platinum awards, \"which recognised writers who had created enduring works which have become a major part of the Australian culture\", at the annual APRA Awards ceremony as part of their celebrations for the Australian Bicentenary. One of the platinum awards was for Paterson and Cowan's version of \"Waltzing Matilda\".\nOfficial use.\nThe song has never been the officially recognised national anthem in Australia. However, from 1976 to 1984 it was one of three \"national songs\" that could be used in place of the then national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\" (except for royal or vice-regal events). The Fraser government in 1977 included \"Waltzing Matilda\" in a plebiscite to choose the \"national song\". \"Waltzing Matilda\" received 28% of the vote compared with 43% for \"Advance Australia Fair\", 19% for \"God Save the Queen\" and 10% for \"Song of Australia\". Later the Hawke government advised the declaration of \"Advance Australia Fair\" as the national anthem, without reference to an official \"national song\". Subsequent prime minister Paul Keating stated that \"['Waltzing Matilda'] has long been our unofficial national song. Not our anthem. As I've said before, one can't sing too solemnly about a jumbuck. But Waltzing Matilda is Australia's song and it always will be.\"\nAustralian passports issued from 2003 have had the lyrics of \"Waltzing Matilda\" hidden microscopically in the background pattern of most of the pages for visas and arrival/departure stamps.\nSports.\n\"Waltzing Matilda\" was used at the 1974 FIFA World Cup and, as a response to the New Zealand All Blacks haka, it has gained popularity as a sporting anthem for the Australia national rugby union team. It would have been played at award ceremonies at the Montreal Olympic Games in 1976, but Australia received no gold medals.\nMatilda the Kangaroo was the mascot at the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane, Queensland. Matilda was a cartoon kangaroo, who appeared as a high mechanical kangaroo at the opening ceremony, accompanied by Rolf Harris singing \"Waltzing Matilda\".\nThe Australian women's national soccer team is nicknamed the Matildas after this song.\nJessica Mauboy and Stan Walker recorded a version of \"Waltzing Matilda\" to promote the London 2012 Summer Olympics in Australia. It was released as a single on 3 August 2012.\nMilitary units.\nIt is used as the quick march of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and as the official song of the US 1st Marine Division, commemorating the time the unit spent in Australia during the Second World War. Part of the tune is used in the British Royal Tank Regiment's slow march, because an early British tank model was called \"Matilda\".\nAnnual Day.\n6 April has been observed as Waltzing Matilda Day annually in Australia since 2012.\nCovers and derivative works.\nIn 1995, it was reported that at least 500 artists in Australia and overseas had released recordings of \"Waltzing Matilda\", and according to Peter Burgis of the National Film and Sound Archive, it is \"one of the most recorded songs in the world\". Artists and bands who have covered the song range from rock stars to children's performers such as Burl Ives; to choirs, including the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Jimmie Rodgers had a US#41 pop hit with the song in 1959.\nOn 14 April 1981, on Space Shuttle \"Columbia\"'s first mission, country singer Slim Dusty's rendition was broadcast to Earth. A remastered version of this rendition was later certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).\nFilms.\nVersions of the song have been used as the title of, or been prominently featured in, a number of films and television programs.\n\"Waltzing Matilda\" is a 1933 Australian film directed by and starring Pat Hanna. It features a young Coral Browne.\nThe first few words of the song provided the title of \"Once a Jolly Swagman\", a 1949 British film starring Dirk Bogarde, but the film has no connection to Australia or to the story told in the song.\nAn animated short was made in 1958 for Australian television.\nErnest Gold used the song and variations of it extensively in the 1959 film \"On the Beach\".\nThe 2017 short film \"Waltzing Tilda\" features various versions of the song, including one sung by the main character.\nThe song is featured in the 2019 film \"\" despite the film being set in 1889, six years before the song was written.\nTV series.\nThe theme song of the 1980 Australian television series \"Secret Valley\" is sung to a faster version of the tune of \"Waltzing Matilda\".\nVideo games.\nIt is the theme song for Australia in the video game \"Civilization VI\".\nThe song is the basis for the side quest \"The Empty Billabong\" in \",\" which was developed by 2K Australia. The player is instructed to search for a man known only as \"the Jolly Swagman\" at his camp under a coolibah tree where they find his tuckerbag and an audiolog where the Jolly Swagman recounts events identical to the song.\nStage.\nOn the occasion of Queensland's 150-year celebrations in 2009, Opera Queensland produced the revue \"Waltzing Our Matilda\", staged at the Conservatorium Theatre and subsequently touring twelve regional centres in Queensland. The show was created by Jason and Leisa Barry-Smith and Narelle French. The story line used the fictional process of Banjo Paterson writing the poem when he visited Queensland in 1895 to present episodes of four famous Australians: bass-baritone Peter Dawson (1882\u20131961), soprano Dame Nellie Melba (1861\u20131931), Bundaberg-born tenor Donald Smith (1922\u20131998), and soprano Gladys Moncrieff, also from Bundaberg. The performers were Jason Barry-Smith as Banjo Paterson, Guy Booth as Dawson, David Kidd as Smith, Emily Burke as Melba, Zoe Traylor as Moncrieff, and Donna Balson (piano, voice). The production toured subsequently again in several years. British guitarist Brian May performed an acoustic version of the song solo during Queen + Adam Lambert's tour of Australia in 2014.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located in the traditional district of Romsdal. It is located on the Romsdal Peninsula, surrounding the Fannefjord and Moldefjord. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Molde which is also the administrative centre of M\u00f8re og Romsdal county, the commercial hub of the Romsdal region, and the seat of the Diocese of M\u00f8re. Other main population centres in the municipality include the villages of Hjelset, Kleive, Nesjestranda, Midsund, Nord-Heggdal, Eidsv\u00e5g, Raudsand, Boggestranda, Myklebostad, Eresfjord, and Eikesdalen.\nThe municipality is the 56th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Molde is the 32nd most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 32,816. The municipality's population density is and its population has increased by 5.6% over the previous 10-year period.\nMolde has a maritime, temperate climate, with cool-to-warm summers, and relatively mild winters. The city of Molde is nicknamed \"The City of Roses\". Molde is a centre for Norwegian textile and garment industry as well as a major tourist destination.\nMolde was originally the name of a farm by a natural harbour, which grew into a timber trading port in the late 16th century. Formal trading rights were introduced before 1604, and the town was incorporated as a kj\u00f8pstad through a royal charter in 1742. The town of Molde was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law) and over the years, the municipality has grown significantly in area such that the municipality is now vastly larger than the urban city of Molde.\nHistory.\nThe town of Molde was established as an urban municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). It was surrounded by the rural Bols\u00f8y Municipality. On 1 July 1915, a part of Bols\u00f8y Municipality (population: 183) was transferred into the city of Molde. On 1 January 1952, another part of Bols\u00f8y Municipality (population: 1,913) was transferred into the city of Molde.\nDuring the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the Molde (town) (population: 8,289) merged with the Sekken, Ve\u00f8ya, and Nesjestranda parts of Ve\u00f8y Municipality (population: 756), all of Bols\u00f8y Municipality (population: 7,996), and the Mordal area of Nord-Aukra Municipality (population: 77) to form a new, larger Molde Municipality.\nOn 1 January 2020, the neighbouring Midsund Municipality and Nesset Municipality merged with Molde to form a much larger Molde Municipality.\nCoat of arms.\nThe coat of arms was granted on 29 June 1742. The informal blazon is \"a water spouting whale, which drives a barrel in front of itself\" (). The arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a whale and barrel floating on the ocean waves. It also has a mural crown above the escutcheon since the municipality includes a town. The exact design of the coat of arms is not formally depicted in law, so it has varied some over the centuries. The arms symbolize a whale chasing herring into a barrel, based on an old myth that the whales (guided by God) chased the schools of herring into the fjords at certain times. It also portrays the city's founding industries of herring fisheries and timber exports. Molde was never a whaling port, but the unusually bountiful fisheries in the early 1740s alleviated the city's suffering during a major famine. The sighting of whales, usually pods of orca, was commonly held to be the start of the spring herring fisheries. The municipal flag is a white flag with the coat of arms in the centre.\nMoldesangen (lit.\u2009'The Song of Molde') is the semi-official anthem. It was written by Palle Godtfred Olaus D\u00f8rum (1818\u20131886) and composed by Karl Groos (1789\u20131861), supposedly in 1818, and is the same tune used the anthem of the German federal state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\nGeography.\nMolde Municipality includes part of the Romsdal peninsula as well as many islands including the islands of Otr\u00f8ya and Mid\u00f8ya. To the southeast, Molde Municipality stretches about inland. The town of Molde consists of a long and wide strip of urban land running east\u2013west along the north shore of the Moldefjord, an arm of the Romsdalsfjord, on the Romsdal peninsula. The city is sheltered by Bols\u00f8ya and the Molde archipelago, a chain of low-lying islands and islets, to the south, and the wood-clad hills of Moldemarka to the north. The city centre is located just west of the river Moldeelva, which runs into the city from the north, originating in the Moldevatnet lake, through the valley Moldedalen. Despite the river being minor and seasonal, it supported several sawmills in the 16th and 17th\u00a0centuries. This gave rise to the original town itself through a combination of a good harbour, proximity to the sea routes, vast timber resources, and a river capable of supporting mills. In 1909, the river housed the first hydro electric power plant capable of providing sufficient electricity for the city, and the upper reaches of the river still provide drinking water for most of the city.\nThe highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Kleneggen. Its panoramic view of some 222 partly snow-clad peaks, usually referred to as the Molde panorama, is one of Molde's main attractions, and has drawn tourists to the city since the 19th century. Molde is nicknamed the \"Town of Roses\", a name which originated during Molde's era as a tourist destination of international fame in the late 19th\u00a0century.\nNeighbouring municipalities are Aukra, Gjemnes, and Hustadvika (to the north); \u00c5lesund (to the southwest); Vestnes and Rauma (to the south); and Tingvoll and Sunndal (to the east).\nGovernment.\nMolde Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Nordm\u00f8re og Romsdal District Court and the Frostating Court of Appeal.\nMunicipal council.\nThe municipal council () of Molde Municipality is made up of 49 representatives who are elected to four-year terms.

{"id": "40435", "revid": "50617790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40435", "title": "History of Barbados", "text": "Barbados is an island country in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, situated about east of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Roughly triangular in shape, the island measures some from northwest to southeast and about from east to west at its widest point. The capital and largest town is Bridgetown, which is also the main seaport.\nBarbados was inhabited by indigenous peoples \u2013 Arawaks and Caribs \u2013 prior to the European colonisation of the Americas in the 16th century. The island was briefly claimed by the Spanish Empire who saw trees with a beard like feature (hence the name Barbados), and then by Portugal from 1532 to 1620. The island was an English and later a British colony from 1625 until 1966. Sugar cane cultivation in Barbados began in the 1640s, which saw the increasing importation of black slaves from West Africa. Several black slave codes were implemented in the late-17th century which resulted in several slave rebellion attempts, however none was successful. The Consolidated Slave Law was passed following the largest slave rebellion in Barbadian history, this was then followed by the total abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1834. Britain continued to rule the island until independence was granted in 1966 and the state became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\nFrom 1966 to 2021, Barbados was a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy, modelled on the Westminster system, with Elizabeth II, Queen of Barbados, as head of state. Barbados became a republic on November 30, 2021, under Mia Mottley, thus removing the queen as its head of state.\nBefore colonisation.\nSome evidence suggests that Barbados may have been settled in the second millennium BC, but this is limited to fragments of conch lip adzes found in association with shells that have been radiocarbon-dated to about 1630 BC.\nFully documented Amerindian settlement dates to between about 350 and 650 AD, when the Troumassoid people arrived. The arrivals were a group known as the Saladoid-Barrancoid from the mainland of South America.\nThe second wave of settlers appeared around 800 AD (the Spanish referred to these as \"Arawaks\") and a third in the mid-13th century. However, the Amerindian settlement surprisingly came to an end in the early 16th century. There's no evidence that the Kalinago (called \"Caribs\" by the Spanish) ever established a permanent settlement in Barbados, though they often visited the island in their canoes.\nColonial history.\nEarly colonial history.\nThe Portuguese were the first Europeans to discover the island. Portuguese navigator Pedro A. Campos named it \"Os Barbados\" (meaning \"bearded ones\").\nFrequent slave-raiding missions by the Spanish Empire in the early 16th century led to a massive decline in the Amerindian population so that by 1541 a Spanish writer claimed they were uninhabited. The Amerindians were either captured for use as slaves by the Spanish or fled to other, more easily defensible mountainous islands nearby.\nFrom about 1600 the English, French, and Dutch began to found colonies in the North American mainland and the smaller islands of the West Indies. Although Spanish and Portuguese sailors had visited Barbados, the first English ship touched the island on 14 May 1625, and England was the first European nation to establish a lasting settlement there from 1627, when the \"William and John\" arrived with more than 60 white settlers and six African slaves.\nEngland is commonly said to have made its initial claim to Barbados in 1625, although reportedly an earlier claim may have been made in 1620. Nonetheless, Barbados was claimed from 1625 in the name of King James I of England and Scotland. There were earlier English settlements in The Americas (1607: Jamestown, 1609: Bermuda, and 1620: Plymouth Colony), and several islands in the Leeward Islands were claimed by the English at about the same time as Barbados (1623: St Kitts, 1628: Nevis, 1632: Montserrat, 1632: Antigua). Nevertheless, the Colony of Barbados quickly grew to become the third major English settlement in the Americas due to its prime eastern location.\nEarly English settlement.\nThe settlement was established as a proprietary colony and funded by Sir William Courten, a City of London merchant who acquired the title to Barbados and several other islands. So the first colonists were actually tenants and much of the profits of their labour returned to Courten and his company.\nThe first English ship, which had arrived on 14 May 1625, was captained by John Powell. The first settlement began on 17 February 1627, near what is now Holetown (formerly Jamestown), by a group led by John Powell's younger brother, Henry, consisting of 80 settlers and 10 English labourers. The latter were young indentured labourers who according to some sources had been abducted, effectively making them slaves. About 40 Taino slaves were brought in from Guyana to help plant crops on the west coast of the island.\nCourten's title was transferred to James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, in what was called the \"Great Barbados Robbery.\" Carlisle established a separate settlement at what he called Carlisle Bay, which later became known as Bridgetown.\nCarlisle then chose as governor Henry Hawley, who established the House of Assembly in 1639, in an effort to appease the planters, who might otherwise have opposed his controversial appointment. That year, 12 years after the settlement was established, the white adult population stood at an estimated 8,700.\nIn the period 1640\u20131660, the West Indies attracted over two-thirds of the total number of English emigrants to the Americas. By 1650, there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies, as compared to 12,000 on the Chesapeake and 23,000 in New England.\nMost English arrivals were indentured. After five years of labour, they were given \"freedom dues\" of about \u00a310, usually in goods. Before the mid-1630s, they also received 5\u201310 acres of land, but after that time the island filled and there was no more free land. Around the time of Cromwell a number of rebels and criminals were also transported there.\nTimothy Meads of Warwickshire was one of the rebels sent to Barbados at that time, before he received compensation for servitude of 1000 acres of land in North Carolina in 1666. Parish registers from the 1650s show, for the white population, four times as many deaths as marriages. The death rate was very high.\nBefore this, the mainstay of the infant colony's economy was the growing export of tobacco, but tobacco prices eventually fell in the 1630s, as Chesapeake production expanded.\nEngland's civil war.\nAround the same time, fighting during the War of the Three Kingdoms and the Interregnum spilled over into Barbados and Barbadian territorial waters. The island was not involved in the war until after the execution of Charles I, when the island's government fell under the control of Royalists (ironically the Governor, Philip Bell, remained loyal to Parliament while the Barbadian House of Assembly of Barbados, under the influence of Humphrey Walrond, supported Charles II). On 7 May 1650, the General Assembly of Barbados voted to receive Lord Willoughby as governor, a move which confirmed the Cavaliers as the government of Barbados.\nWilloughby rounded up and deported many Roundheads from Barbados, confiscating their property. To try to bring the recalcitrant colony to heel, the Commonwealth Parliament passed an act on 3 October 1650 prohibiting trade between England and Barbados, and because the island also traded with the Netherlands, further navigation acts were passed prohibiting any but English vessels trading with Dutch colonies. These acts were a precursor to the First Anglo-Dutch War.\nThe Commonwealth of England sent an invasion force under the command of Sir George Ayscue, which arrived in October 1651, and blockaded the island. After some skirmishing, the Royalists in the House of Assembly, feeling the pressures of commercial isolation, led by Lord Willoughby surrendered. The conditions of the surrender were incorporated into the Charter of Barbados (Treaty of Oistins), which was signed at the Mermaid's Inn, Oistins, on 17 January 1652.\nSugar cane and slavery.\nSugar cane cultivation in Barbados began in the 1640s, after its introduction in 1637 by Pieter Blower. Initially, rum was produced but by 1642, sugar was the focus of the industry. As it developed into the main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates which replaced the small holdings of the early English settlers as the wealthy planters pushed out the poorer. Some of the displaced farmers relocated to the English colonies in North America, most notably South Carolina. To work the plantations, black Africans \u2013 primarily from West Africa \u2013 were imported as slaves in such numbers that there were three for every one planter. Increasingly after 1750 the plantations were owned by absentee landlords living in Britain and operated by hired managers. Persecuted Catholics from Ireland also worked the plantations. Life expectancy of slaves was short and replacements were purchased annually.\nThe introduction of sugar cane from Dutch Brazil in 1640 completely transformed society and the economy. Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries. One group instrumental in ensuring the early success of the industry were the Sephardic Jews, who had originally been expelled from the Iberian Peninsula, to end up in Dutch Brazil. As the effects of the new crop increased, so did the shift in the ethnic composition of Barbados and surrounding islands. The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour. At first, Dutch traders supplied the equipment, financing, and African slaves, in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe. Barbados replaced Hispaniola as the main sugar producer in the Caribbean.\nIn 1655, the population of Barbados was estimated at 43,000, of which about 20,000 were of African descent, with the remainder mainly of English descent. These English smallholders were eventually bought out and the island filled up with large African slave-worked sugar plantations. By 1660, there was near parity with 27,000 blacks and 26,000 whites. By 1666, at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out, died, or left the island. Many of the remaining whites were increasingly poor. By 1673, black slaves (33,184) outnumbered white settlers (21,309). By 1680, there were 17 slaves for every indentured servant. By 1684, the disparity grew even further to 19,568 white settlers and 46,502 black slaves. By 1696, there was an estimated 42,000 enslaved blacks, and the white population declined further to 16,888 by 1715.\nDue to the increased implementation of slave codes, which emphasised differential treatment between Africans, and the white workers and ruling planter class, the island became increasingly unattractive to poor whites. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. One early advocate of slave rights in Barbados was the visiting Quaker preacher Alice Curwen in 1677: \"For I am persuaded, that if they whom thou call'st thy Slaves, be Upright-hearted to God, the Lord God Almighty will set them Free in a way that thou knowest not; for there is none set free but in Christ Jesus, for all other Freedom will prove but a Bondage.\"\nBy 1660, Barbados generated more trade than all the other English colonies combined. This remained so until it was eventually surpassed by geographically larger islands like Jamaica in 1713. But even so, the estimated value of the Colony of Barbados in 1730\u20131731 was as much as \u00a35,500,000. Bridgetown, the capital, was one of the three largest cities in English America (the other two being Boston, Massachusetts, and Port Royal, Jamaica.) By 1700, the English West Indies produced 25,000 tons of sugar, compared to 20,000 for Brazil, 10,000 for the French islands and 4,000 for the Dutch islands. This quickly replaced tobacco, which had been the island's main export.\nAs the sugar industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early English settlers. In 1680, over half the arable land was held by 175 large planters, each of whom used at least 60 slaves. The great plantation owners had connections with the English aristocracy and great influence on Parliament. (In 1668, the West Indian sugar crop sold for \u00a3180,000 after customs of \u00a318,000. Chesapeake tobacco earned \u00a350,000 after customs of \u00a375,000).\nSo much land was devoted to sugar that most foods had to be imported from New England. The poorer whites who were moved off the island went to the English Leeward Islands, or especially to Jamaica. In 1670, the Province of South Carolina was founded, when some of the surplus population again left Barbados. Other nations receiving large numbers of Barbadians included British Guiana and Panama.\nJustin Roberts shows that enslaved persons did not spend the majority of time in restricted roles cultivating, harvesting and processing sugar cane, the island's most important cash crop. Rather, the enslaved were involved in various activities and in multiple roles: raising livestock, fertilising soil, growing provisional crops, maintaining plantation infrastructure, caregiving and other tasks. One notable soil management technique was intercropping, planting subsistence crops between the rows of cash crops, which demanded of the enslaved skilled and experienced observations of growing conditions for efficient land use.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Slaveholders often counted as \"married\" only the enslaved with mates on the estate. For example, the manager of Newton estate... recorded 20 women with co-resident husbands and 35 with mates elsewhere. Members of the latter group were labelled single, members of extended units, or mother-child units.\nBy 1750, there were about 18,000 white settlers, compared to approximately 65,000 African slaves.\nThe slave trade ceased in 1807 and slaves were emancipated in 1834.\nBussa's rebellion.\nThe British abolished the slave trade in 1807, but not the institution itself. The abolition of slavery itself would only be enacted in 1833 in most parts of the British Empire.\nIn 1816, enslaved persons rose up in what was the first of three rebellions in the British West Indies to occur in the interval between the end of the slave trade and emancipation, and the largest slave uprising in the island's history. Around 20,000 enslaved persons from over 70 plantations are thought to have been involved. The rebellion was partly fuelled by information about the growing abolitionist movement in England, and the opposition against such by local whites.\nThe rebellion largely surprised planters, who felt that their slaves were content because they were allowed weekly dances, participated in social and economic activity across the island and were generally fed and looked after. However, they had refused to reform the Barbados Slave Code since its inception, a code that denied slaves human rights and prescribed inhumane torture, mutilation or death as a means of control. This contributed to what was later termed \"Bussa's Rebellion\", named after the slave ranger Bussa, and the result of a growing sentiment that the treatment of slaves in Barbados was \"intolerable\", and who believed the political climate in Britain made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom. Bussa became the most famous of the rebellion's organisers, many of whom were either enslaved persons of some higher position or literate freedmen. One woman, Nanny Grigg, is also named as a principal organiser.\nHowever, the rebellion eventually failed. The uprising was triggered prematurely, but the slaves were already greatly outmatched. Barbados's flat terrain gave the horses of the better-armed militia the clear advantage over the rebels, with no mountains or forest for concealment. Slaves had also thought they would be supported by freed men of colour, but these instead joined efforts to quell the rebellion. Although they drove whites off the plantations, widespread killings did not take place. By the end, 120 slaves died in combat or were immediately executed and another 144 brought to trial and executed. The remaining rebels were shipped off the island.\nTowards the abolition of slavery.\nIn 1826, the Barbados legislature passed the Consolidated Slave Law, which simultaneously granted concessions to the slaves while providing reassurances to the slave owners.\nSlavery was finally abolished in the British Empire eight years later, in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by a contentious apprenticeship period that lasted four years.\nIn 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to Sir Francis Hincks requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then Colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked from Canada were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the British Parliament at Westminster.\nTowards decolonisation.\nIn 1952, the \"Barbados Advocate\" newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the House of Assembly and later as first President of the Senate, Sir Theodore Branker, Q.C.and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British Caribbean with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the West Indies Federation with Canada.\nHowever, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high income qualification required for voting. More than 70 per cent of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this, Sir Grantley Adams, founded the Barbados Progressive League in 1938, which later became known as the Barbados Labour Party (BLP).\nAdams and his party demanded more rights for the poor and for the people, and staunchly supported the monarchy. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949, governmental control was wrested from the planters, and in 1953 Adams became Premier of Barbados.\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the West Indies Federation, a federalist organisation doomed by nationalist attitudes. Grantley Adams served as its first and only \"Premier\", but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. Errol Walton Barrow, a fervent reformer, became the people's new advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) as a liberal alternative to Adams's conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians and a school meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.\nWith the Federation dissolved, Barbados reverted to its former status, that of a self-governing colony. The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with Britain in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first prime minister, with Elizabeth II as Queen of Barbados. Upon independence Barbados became a full member of the Commonwealth of Nations. A year later, Barbados's international linkages were expanded by obtaining membership of both the United Nations and the Organization of American States.\nPolitical history.\nCarrington (1982) examines politics during the American Revolution, revealing that Barbadian political leaders shared many of the grievances and goals of the American revolutionaries, but that they were unwilling to go to war over them. Nevertheless, the repeated conflicts between the island assembly and the royal governors brought important constitutional reforms which confirmed the legislature's control over most local matters and its power over the executive.\nFrom 1800 until 1885, Barbados then served as the main seat of Government for the former British colonies of the Windward Islands. During that period of around 85 years, the resident Governor of Barbados also served as the Colonial head of the Windward Islands. After the Government of Barbados officially exited from the Windward Island union in 1885, the seat was moved from Bridgetown to St. George's on the neighbouring island of Grenada, where it remained until the territory of the Windward Islands was dissolved.\nSoon after Barbados's withdrawal from the Windward Islands, Barbados became aware that Tobago was going to be amalgamated with another territory as part of a single state. In response, Barbados made an official bid to the British Government to have neighbouring Island Tobago joined with Barbados in a political union. The British government however decided that Trinidad would be a better fit and Tobago instead was made a Ward of Trinidad.\nAfrican slaves worked on plantations owned by merchants of English and Scottish descent. It was these merchants who continued to dominate Barbados politics, even after emancipation, due to a high income restriction on voting. Only the upper 30 per cent had any voice in the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that a movement for political rights was begun by the descendants of emancipated slaves, who started trade unions. Charles Duncan O'Neal, Clennell Wickham and the members of the Democratic League were some of the leaders of this movement. This was initially opposed by Sir Grantley Adams, who played an instrumental role in the bankruptcy and shutdown of \"The Herald\" newspapers, one of the movement's foremost voices. Adams would later found the Barbados Progressive League (now the Barbados Labour Party) in 1938, during the Great Depression. The Depression caused mass unemployment and strikes, and the standard of living on the island fell drastically. With the death of O\u2019Neal and the demise of the League, Adams cemented his power, but he used this to advocate for causes that had once been his rivals, including more help for the people especially the poor.\nFinally, in 1942, the income qualification was lowered. This was followed by the introduction of universal adult suffrage in 1951, and Adams was elected as Premier of Barbados in 1958. For his action and leadership, Adams would later become a National Hero.\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the West Indies Federation, an organisation doomed to failure by a number of factors, including what were often petty nationalistic prejudices and limited legislative power. Indeed, Adams's position as \"Prime Minister\" was a misnomer, as all of the Federation members were still colonies of Britain. Adams, once a political visionary and now a man whose policies seemed to some blind to the needs of his country, not only held fast to his notion of defending the monarchy but also made additional attempts to form other Federation-like entities after that union's demise. When the Federation was terminated, Barbados reverted to its former status as a self-governing colony, but efforts were made by Adams to form another federation composed of Barbados and the Leeward and Windward Islands.\nErrol Walton Barrow was to replace Grantley Adams as the advocate of populism, and it was he who would eventually lead the island into Independence in 1966. Barrow, a fervent reformer and once a member of the Barbados Labour Party, had left the party to form his own Democratic Labour Party, as the liberal alternative to the conservative BLP government under Adams. He remains a National Hero for his work in social reformation, including the institution of free education for all Barbadians. In 1961, Barrow supplanted Adams as Premier as the DLP took control of the government.\nIndependence.\nDue to several years of growing autonomy, Barbados, with Barrow at the helm, was able successfully to negotiate its independence at a constitutional conference with the United Kingdom in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state and formally joined the Commonwealth of Nations on 30 November 1966, Errol Barrow serving as its first prime minister.\nThe Barrow government sought to diversify the economy away from agriculture, seeking to boost industry and the tourism sector. Barbados was also at the forefront of regional integration efforts, spearheading the creation of CARIFTA and CARICOM. The DLP lost the 1976 Barbadian general election to the BLP under Tom Adams. Adams adopted a more conservative and strongly pro-Western stance, allowing the Americans to use Barbados as the launchpad for their invasion of Grenada in 1983. Adams died in office in 1985 and was replaced by Harold Bernard St. John; however, St. John lost the 1986 Barbadian general election, which saw the return of the DLP under Errol Barrow, who had been highly critical of the US intervention in Grenada. Barrow, too, died in office, and was replaced by Lloyd Erskine Sandiford, who remained prime minister until 1994.\nOwen Arthur of the BLP won the 1994 Barbadian general election, remaining prime minister until 2008. Arthur was a strong advocate of republicanism, though a planned referendum to replace Queen Elizabeth as Head of State in 2008 never took place. The DLP won the 2008 Barbadian general election, but the new Prime Minister David Thompson died in 2010 and was replaced by Freundel Stuart. The BLP returned to power in 2018 under Mia Mottley, who became Barbados's first female prime minister.\nTransition to republic.\nThe Government of Barbados announced on 15 September 2020 that it intended to become a republic by 30 November 2021, the 55th anniversary of its independence resulting in the replacement of the hereditary monarch of Barbados with an elected president. Barbados would then cease to be a Commonwealth realm, but could maintain membership in the Commonwealth of Nations, like Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.\nOn 20 September 2021, just over a full year after the announcement for the transition was made, the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2021 was introduced to the Parliament of Barbados. Passed on 6 October, the Bill made amendments to the Constitution of Barbados, introducing the office of the President of Barbados to replace the role of Elizabeth II, Queen of Barbados. The following week, on 12 October 2021, incumbent Governor-General of Barbados Sandra Mason was jointly nominated by the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition as candidate to be the first President of Barbados, and was subsequently elected on 20 October. Mason took office on 30 November 2021. Prince Charles, who was heir apparent to the Barbadian Crown, attended the swearing-in ceremony in Bridgetown at the invitation of the Government of Barbados.\nQueen Elizabeth II sent a message of congratulations to President Mason and the people of Barbados, saying: \"As you celebrate this momentous day, I send you and all Barbadians my warmest good wishes for your happiness, peace and prosperity in the future.\"\nA survey was taken between October 23, 2021, and November 10, 2021, by the University of the West Indies that showed 34% of respondents being in favour of transitioning to a republic, while 30% were indifferent. Notably, no overall majority was found in the survey; with 24% not indicating a preference, and the remaining 12% being opposed to the removal of Queen Elizabeth.\nIn January 2022, Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley's Labor Party received a landslide victory, winning all 30 legislative seats, in the first general election since Barbados became a republic.\nOn 20 June 2022, a Constitutional Review Commission was formed and sworn in by Jeffrey Gibson (who, at the time, was serving temporarily as Acting President of Barbados) to review the Constitution of Barbados.\nThe Commission will have an 18-month timeline to complete its work. They are expected to solicit input from members of the public in Barbados via a series of face-to-face and online events.\nConfederations and union proposals.\nA number of proposals have been mooted in the past to integrate Barbados into neighbouring countries or even the Canadian Confederation. To date all have failed, and one proposal led to deadly riots in 1876, when Governor John Pope Hennessy tried to pressure Barbadian politicians to integrate more firmly into the Windward Islands. Governor Hennessy was quickly transferred from Barbados by the British Crown. In 1884, attempts were then made by the influential Barbados Agricultural Society to have Barbados form a political association with the Canadian Confederation. From 1958 to 1962 Barbados became one of the ten states of the West Indies Federation. Lastly in the 1990s, a plan was devised by the leaders of Guyana, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago to form a political association between those three governments. Again this deal was never completed, following the loss of Sir Lloyd Erskine Sandiford in the Barbadian general elections.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

June 1075 \u2013 4 December 1137), was Holy Roman Emperor from 1133 until his death. He was appointed Duke of Saxony in 1106 and elected King of Germany in 1125 before being crowned emperor in Rome. The son of the Saxon count Gebhard of Supplinburg, his reign was troubled by the constant intriguing of the Hohenstaufens, Duke Frederick II of Swabia and Duke Conrad of Franconia. He died while returning from a successful campaign against the Norman Kingdom of Sicily.\nRise to power.\nIn 1013, a certain Saxon nobleman named \"Liutger\" was mentioned as a count in or of the Harzgau subdivision of Eastphalia. His grandson Count Gebhard, father of Emperor Lothair, possibly acquired the castle of S\u00fcpplingenburg about 1060 via his marriage with Hedwig, a daughter of the Bavarian count Frederick of Formbach and his wife Gertrud, herself a descendant of the Saxon margrave Dietrich of Haldensleben who secondly married the Billung duke Ordulf of Saxony upon Count Frederick's death.\nLittle is known of Lothair's youth. His name first appears in the contemporary records in 1088. His father Gebhard of Supplinburg joined the Saxon rebellion against the ruling Salian dynasty and died on 9 June 1075 in the Battle of Langensalza, fighting troops loyal to emperor Henry IV. Shortly after Gebhard's death Lothair was born at Unterl\u00fc\u00df. In 1107 he married Richenza, daughter of Count Henry of Northeim and Gertrude of Brunswick, heiress of the Brunonids.\nLothair's land purchases, inheritance and marriage alliances among the Saxon nobles, resulted in the acquisition of the domains of the House of Billung and the Counts of Northeim. The marriage with Richenza of the Brunonids in particular, made him the wealthiest nobleman among his fellow Saxons. He supported future emperor Henry V during his 1104 rebellion against his father Henry IV, and the ensuing disempowerment campaign, that culminated in the abdication of the emperor on December 31, 1105, and his son's coronation a few days later. For his loyalty Lothair was rewarded with the fief of title and estate of the Duchy of Saxony upon the death of duke Magnus of Billung, who had died without an heir in 1106. Emboldened by the promotion and incensed over the king's increasingly autocratic rule, such as the wanton imposition of a new tax on ducal lords, Duke Lothair joined the growing opposition party to Henry. He acted autonomously by vesting Count Adolf of Schauenburg with the newly established County of Holstein in 1111. Lothair was temporarily deposed in 1112, when Henry transferred the ducal title to Otto of Ballenstedt. He was soon reinstated when count Otto fell into disgrace and he tactically submitted himself to Henry V. In 1115 however, he took command of the rebellious Saxon forces and defeated the emperor in the Battle of Welfesholz. Henry completely lost control over the administration and the revenue of Saxony. When in 1123 Henry V vested Count Wiprecht of Groitzsch with the Margraviate of Meissen, Lothair enforced the appointment of Conrad of Wettin and ceded the March of Lusatia to Count Albert the Bear.\nReign.\nUpon Emperor Henry V's death in 1125, Archchancellor Adalbert summoned the royal electoral assembly in Mainz. On August 24 the electors declined the candidacy of the primary contender Duke Frederick of Hohenstaufen, who destroyed his chances due to his appalling overconfidence (\"ambicone cecatus\") and his refusal to accept free princely elections (\"libera electio\"). Adalbert of Mainz considered Lothair to be a suitable candidate. Although the most powerful territorial prince in Saxony, he was of advanced age (slightly over fifty years of age) and had no male heir, not the ideal prerequisites for a long dynastic line of kings. He was elected King of Germany and asserted himself against Leopold III of Austria and Charles the Good. His election was notable in that it marked a departure from the concept of hereditary succession as the electors preferred a sovereign with moderate powers after the Salian era of \"oppressio\". Somewhat naive concerning the complex power struggle between the papacy and the empire, Lothair also consented to several symbolic acts that were subsequently interpreted by the Roman Curia as signaling acceptance of papal confirmation of his position.\nDuke Vladislaus I of Bohemia died in 1125. The succession was disputed among his surviving brother Sob\u011bslav I and his Moravian cousin Otto the Black, who was supported by Vladislaus' widow Richeza of Berg. In late 1125 Lothair joined Otto's side, who had advanced large sums of money.\nA military campaign against Sob\u011bslav was launched and in February 1126 Lothair's force entered Bohemian territory and was promptly defeated at the Battle of Chlumec. Sob\u011bslav captured high-ranking nobles, like Albert the Bear and Louis I of Thuringia. However, Sob\u011bslav immediately went to meet Lothair at his camp and formally requested and received the fief of Bohemia. Peace was restored, prisoners set free and although the winner of the battle had submitted himself to the losing side, he secured full legitimacy and lasting prestige.\nDispute with the Staufers.\nHaving both Saxon and Bavarian ancestry, the Supplinburg dynasty was a political opponent of the Salian dynasty and the House of Hohenstaufen. Disputes arose with Duke Frederick II when he refused to hand over property to Lothair, which the king considered to be royal property, the Staufer on the other hand argued, that it belonged to the Salian heritage. The contentious assets had long been administered together with other Salian domestic estates, their origin was hard to determine and difficult to separate. Lothair advocated the principle that all of the assets in question had now become imperial properties due to the extinction of the Salian dynasty. The first armed engagements between Lothair and the Staufer took place as early as 1125 and increased in the years that followed. Lothair, with the approval obtained at a meeting of the princes in Regensburg, attempted to seize the crown lands, which provoked a Staufer reaction. Lothair then isolated Frederick II as he placed him under Imperial ban and withdrew the Franconian ducal fief from Conrad.\nAfter Lothair's 1127 campaign against the Staufers had collapsed at the gates of Nuremberg, the Swabians and the Franconians declared Frederick's younger brother Conrad anti-king Conrad III. Looking for support of his kingship, in 1128 Conrad went to Italy, where he was crowned King of Italy by Anselm V, Archbishop of Milan. Lothair took advantage of Conrad's absence and weak position and resumed his attacks on the Staufers and in 1129 conquered the Staufer cities Nuremberg and Speyer. Conrad, on the other hand failed to acquire the desired assistance in Italy, and having made no political progress, returned in 1130, which assured at least a partial victory for Lothair.\nLastly Lothair, in order to prevent the loss of Burgundy to a power hostile to the empire, appointed his loyal ally Conrad I, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen as Rector of the \"Principatus Burgundiaey\".\nDomestic policies in the Northeast.\nEmperor Lothair's policies and actions in the northern and eastern estates of the kingdom would have the longest-lasting impacts. As a Saxon by birth, he was certainly more focused on that region than previous and future monarchs. He already pursued active territorial policies before his royal tenure as early as 1111, when he installed count Adolf of Schauenburg in Holstein and Stormarn.\nIn an act of royal consolidation policy Lothair established the Landgraviate of Thuringia, that encompassed the remaining and predominantly non-contiguous estates of the ill-fated former Merovingian Duchy of Thuringia. The brutal conquest of the old Thuringii kingdom under king Chlothar I had left the area devastated. Subsequently the Franks desired to rule the acquisition, which proved to be only partly successful, as a long process of depopulation and recurring population replacement by Franconians, Bavarians and Christianized Slavs followed. The 1129 appointment of Herman of Winzenburg to the comital office was a failure, as he allegedly was deposed a year later on charges of breach of the peace. The sources, however provide conflicting dates. The 1131 investiture of Louis marked the beginning of smooth Ludowingian rule for more than a century.\nIn 1134 Lothair appointed the Ascanian Albert the Bear as Margrave of Brandenburg and in 1136 Conrad the Great of Wettin, already margrave of Meissen, for the office of the Margraviate of Lusatia, thereby uniting the two marches. In addition, he petitioned the pope to grant more executive rights for the Archbishoprics of Bremen and Magdeburg. King Eric II of Denmark was made an imperial prince of the emperor in 1135, and member of the Reichstag. Lothair's diplomatic missions to the warring parties of Poland and Bohemia/Hungary were successful and resulted in overdue tribute payment by the Polish Duke Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth for the 1121 established Duchy of Pomerania, which in addition to the island of R\u00fcgen was eventually secured as a fief of the Empire.\nRelations with the Papacy.\nThe 1130 papal election had resulted in another schism. A minority of the cardinals elected Innocent II before a majority of the cardinals appointed Anacletus II in a tumultuous process. Both popes claimed to have been legally elected and in a first collision Anacletus prevailed. Innocent had to leave Rome and fled to France. Nonetheless, Anacletus could only secure the support of Roger II of Sicily, Innocent was, with the help of Bernard of Clairvaux, able to secure the support of King Louis VI of France and King Henry I of England.\nBoth popes offered Lothair the imperial crown. The king was occupied with the Staufer resistance and once again it was Bernard of Clairvaux who convinced the sovereign to favor pope Innocent II. In March 1131 these three met in Li\u00e8ge, where Lothair performed the ceremonial strator service (stirrup holder) for the pope and promised help in the conflict against Anacletus and Roger II of Sicily. His request for investiture restoration was rejected, but all rights and privileges as laid out in the Concordat of Worms were confirmed. Innocent II crowned Lothair King of the Romans again on 29 March 1131.\nLothair was accompanied by a modest troop contingent as most men were garrisoned in Germany to counter Staufer aggression. He carefully avoided hostilities but attempted to besiege Milan, which, however, failed. Eventually he arrived in Rome. As Anacletus controlled St. Peter, Lothair's imperial coronation took place in the Lateran Basilica on 4 June 1133. Emperor Lothair continued to avoid explicit resistance against papal impediments on his royal office. He ignored Innocent's bull, in which he advocated imperial authority derived from him and Lothair recognized papal claims to the vast Matildine estates in Northern Italy (formerly owned by Margravine Matilda of Tuscany), although he was able to secure the territorial fiefs.\nCampaign against Sicily.\nIn the northern empire Lothair finally succeeded and defeated the Staufers in 1135 thanks to the help of Henry the Proud, who had been the Duke of Bavaria since the death of his father, Henry the Black. At the Reichstag in Bamberg in 1135 the brothers were pardoned and restored to their office and estates. Anti-king Conrad renounced his royal title, the Staufers promised to take part in the Emperor's second Italian campaign, before a ten-year constitutio pacis was declared.\nLothair, now uncontested ruler, set out in 1136 with a sizeable army. In 1136 the campaign against Roger began at the insistence of Innocent II and Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus. Two columns, one led by Lothair, the other by his son-in-law Henry the Proud arrived in Italy. On the river Tronto, Count William of Loritello did homage to Lothair and opened the gates of Termoli to him. Advancing deep into the southern part of the peninsula, the two armies met at Bari, and continued further south in 1137. Roger offered to give Apulia as a fief of the Empire to one of his sons and give another son as a hostage, terms which Lothair refused after being pressured by Innocent II.\nThe imperial troops, however, were adamant against campaigning during the hot summer and revolted. The emperor, who had hoped for the complete conquest of Sicily, instead captured Capua and Apulia from Roger and bestowed them on Roger's enemies. Innocent, however, protested, claiming that Apulia fell under papal reign. Emperor and Pope eventually jointly bequeathed the duchy to Rainulf of Alife. Lothair resided in Salerno from August to October 1137 and had copper coins (\"follari\") minted in his name.\nDeath.\nOn the return trip, he gave his son-in-law Henry of Bavaria the Margraviate of Tuscany and the Duchy of Saxony. He also gave him the imperial insignia, which depending on the point of view was interpreted as designation for the new king or not. On December 3, 1137, Lothair died on the return journey at Breitenwang. His body was boiled to prevent putrefaction, and his bones were transferred to the Collegiate Church of Saints Peter and Paul at K\u00f6nigslutter, which he had chosen as his burial site and for which he had laid the cornerstone in 1135. A month later, Pope Anaclet II's death also ended the papal schism.\nWhen his grave was opened in 1620, a sword and an imperial orb were found among other things. With the imperial cathedral Lothar has created an outstanding architectural monument. His reign was more than just an episode between Salians and Staufer and considered an era of self-confident rule over the empire, even if his political vision of the establishment of a Welf kingdom on March 7, 1138, in Koblenz was destroyed by the \u201ccoup d'\u00e9tat\u201d of the Staufers.\nIssue.\nThe S\u00fcpplingenburg dynasty was only short-lived. By his wife, Richenza of Northeim, Lothair had only one surviving child, a daughter Gertrude, born 18 April 1115. To secure Welf support for his election as king, Lothair married Gertrude to Henry X, Duke of Bavaria, on 29 May 1127. Their only son was Henry the Lion.\nAfter Lothair's death in 1137, the Hohenstaufen Conrad was elected King as Conrad III. Henry the Proud, Lothair\u2019s son-in-law and heir, refused to acknowledge the new king. In response, Conrad III deprived him of all his territories.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40440", "revid": "47450475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40440", "title": "Conrad III of Germany", "text": "King of Germany from 1138 to 1152\nConrad III (; ; 1093 or 1094 \u2013 15 February 1152) of the Hohenstaufen dynasty was from 1116 to 1120 Duke of Franconia, from 1127 to 1135 anti-king of his predecessor Lothair III, and from 1138 until his death in 1152 King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. He was the son of Duke Frederick\u00a0I of Swabia and Agnes, a daughter of Emperor Henry\u00a0IV.\nHis reign saw the start of the conflicts between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. He was involved in the failed Second Crusade with Louis VII, where he would fight and lose at Doryleum and would later fall ill and return to Constantinople. After recuperating, he went to Jerusalem but would experience a string of failed sieges. Later returning from the Crusade, he was entangled in some conflicts with Welf VI's claim to the Duchy of Bavaria. On his deathbed, he designated his nephew Frederick Barbarossa as his successor instead of his son, Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia.\nDescent.\nThe origin of the House of Hohenstaufen in the Duchy of Swabia has not been conclusively established. As the name came from the Hohenstaufen Castle (built in 1105) Conrad's great-grandfather Frederick of Staufen was a count in the Riesgau and in 1053 became Swabian Count palatine. His son Frederick of Buren probably resided near present-day W\u00e4schenbeuren and about 1050 married Countess Hildegard of Egisheim from Alsace.\nConrad's father took advantage of the conflict between King Henry IV of Germany and the Swabian duke Rudolf of Rheinfelden during the Investiture Controversy. When Rudolf had himself elected German anti-king at Forchheim in 1077, Frederick of Hohenstaufen remained loyal to the royal crown and in 1079 was vested with the Duchy of Swabia by Henry IV, including an engagement with the king's daughter Agnes. He died in 1105, leaving two sons, Conrad and his elder brother Frederick\u00a0II, who inherited the Swabian ducal title. Their mother entered into a second marriage with Babenberg margrave Leopold III of Austria.\nBiography.\nIn 1105, Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor since 1084, was overthrown by his son Henry V, Conrad's uncle. Emperor since 1111, Henry V prepared for his second campaign to Italy upon the death of Margravine Matilda of Tuscany, and in 1116 he appointed Conrad as Duke of Franconia. Conrad was marked out to act as regent for Germany, together with his elder brother, Duke Frederick\u00a0II of Swabia. At the death of Henry V in 1125, Conrad unsuccessfully supported Frederick II for the kingship of Germany. Frederick was placed under a ban and Conrad was deprived of Franconia and the Kingdom of Burgundy, of which he was rector. With the support of the imperial cities, Swabia, and the Margraviate of Austria, Conrad was elected anti-king at Nuremberg in December\u00a01127.\nConrad quickly crossed the Alps to be crowned King of Italy by Anselmo della Pusterla, Archbishop of Milan, in the village of Monza. Over the next two years, he failed to achieve anything in Italy, however, and returned to Germany in 1130, after Nuremberg and Speyer, two strong cities that supported him, fell to Lothair in\u00a01129. Conrad continued in Lothair's opposition, but he and Frederick were forced to acknowledge Lothair as emperor in\u00a01135, during which time Conrad relinquished his title as King of Italy. After this they were pardoned and could take again possession of their lands.\nAfter Lothair's death (December 1137), Conrad was elected king at Coblenz on 7 March 1138, in the presence of the papal legate Theodwin. Conrad was crowned at Aachen six days later (13 March) and was acknowledged in Bamberg by several princes of southern Germany. As Henry the Proud, son-in-law and heir of Lothair and the most powerful prince in Germany, who had been passed over in the election, refused to do the same, Conrad deprived him of all his territories, giving the Duchy of Saxony to Albert the Bear and that of Bavaria to Leopold\u00a0IV, Margrave of Austria. Henry, however, retained the loyalty of his subjects. The civil war that broke out is considered the first act of the struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines, which later extended southwards to Italy. After Henry's death (October\u00a01139), the war was continued by his son Henry the Lion, supported by the Saxons, and by his brother Welf\u00a0VI. Conrad, after a long siege, defeated the latter at Weinsberg in December 1140, and in May 1142 a peace agreement was reached in Frankfurt.\nIn the same year, Conrad entered Bohemia to reinstate his brother-in-law Vladislav\u00a0II as Duke. The attempt to do the same with another brother-in-law, the Polish prince Ladislaus the Exile, failed. Bavaria, Saxony, and the other regions of Germany were in revolt.\nIn 1146, Conrad heard Bernard of Clairvaux preach the Second Crusade at Speyer, and he agreed to join Louis\u00a0VII in a great expedition to the Holy Land. At the imperial diet in Frankfurt in March 1147 Conrad and the assembled princes entrusted Bernard of Clairvaux with the recruitment for the Wendish crusade.\nBefore leaving, he had the nobles elect and crown his son Henry Berengar king. The succession secured in the event of his death, Conrad set out. His army of 20,000 men went overland, via Hungary, causing disruptions in the Byzantine territories through which they passed. They arrived at Constantinople by September 1147, ahead of the French army.\nRather than taking the coastal road around Anatolia through Christian-held territory, by which he sent most of his noncombatants, Conrad took his army across Anatolia. On 25 October 1147, they were defeated by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Dorylaeum. Conrad and most of the knights escaped, but most of the foot soldiers were killed or captured. The remaining 2,000 men of the German army limped on to Nicaea, where many of the survivors deserted and tried to return home. Conrad and his adherents had to be escorted to Lopadium by the French, where they joined the main French army under Louis. Conrad fell seriously ill at Ephesus and was sent to recuperate in Constantinople, where his host the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus acted as his personal physician. After recovering, Conrad sailed to Acre, and from there reached Jerusalem. He participated in the ill-fated Siege of Damascus and after that failure, grew disaffected with his allies. Another attempt to attack Ascalon failed when Conrad's allies did not appear as promised, then Conrad returned to Germany, through Constantinople, where he met again with the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I to discuss the problem of two emperors, and to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily.\nIn 1150, Conrad and Henry Berengar defeated Welf\u00a0VI and his son Welf\u00a0VII at the Battle of Flochberg. Henry Berengar died later that year and the succession was thrown open. The Welfs and Hohenstaufen made peace in 1152 and the peaceful succession of one of Conrad's family was secured.\nConrad was never crowned emperor and continued to style himself \"King of the Romans\" until his death. On his deathbed, in the presence of only two witnesses, his nephew Frederick Barbarossa and the Bishop of Bamberg, he allegedly designated Frederick his successor, rather than his own surviving six-year-old son Frederick. Frederick Barbarossa, who had accompanied his uncle on the unfortunate crusade, forcefully pursued his advantage and was duly elected king in Cologne a few weeks later. The young son of the late king was given the Duchy of Swabia.\nConrad left no male heirs by his first wife, Gertrude von Komburg. In\u00a01136, he married Gertrude of Sulzbach, who was a daughter of Berengar\u00a0II of Sulzbach, and whose sister Bertha was married to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I. Gertrude was the mother of Conrad's children and the link which cemented his alliance with Byzantium.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the first chancellor of the University of Ljubljana.\nLife.\nPlemelj was born in the village of Bled near Bled Castle in Austria-Hungary (now Slovenia); he died in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia). His father, Urban, a carpenter and crofter, died when Josip was only a year old. His mother Marija, n\u00e9e Mrak, found bringing up the family alone very hard, but she was able to send her son to school in Ljubljana, where Plemelj studied from 1886 to 1894. Due to a bench thrown into Tivoli Pond by him or his friends, he could not attend the school after he finished the fourth class and had to pass the final exam privately. After leaving and obtaining the necessary examination results he went to the University of Vienna in 1894 where he had applied to Faculty of Arts to study mathematics, physics and astronomy. His professors in Vienna were von Escherich for mathematical analysis, Gegenbauer and Mertens for arithmetic and algebra, Weiss for astronomy, Stefan's student Boltzmann for physics.\nIn May 1898, Plemelj presented his doctoral thesis under Escherich's tutelage entitled \"\u00dcber lineare homogene Differentialgleichungen mit eindeutigen periodischen Koeffizienten\" (Linear Homogeneous Differential Equations with Uniform Periodical Coefficients). He continued with his study in Berlin (1899/1900) under the German mathematicians Frobenius and Fuchs and in G\u00f6ttingen (1900/1901) under Klein and Hilbert.\nIn April 1902 he became a private senior lecturer at the University of Vienna. In 1906, he was appointed assistant at the Technical University of Vienna. In 1907, he became associate professor and in 1908 full professor of mathematics at the University of Chernivtsi (Ukrainian: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0446\u0456, Russian: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0446\u044b), Ukraine. From 1912 to 1913 he was dean of this faculty. In 1917, his political views led him to be forcibly ejected by the government and resettled in Moravia. After the First World War he became a member of the University Commission under the Slovene Provincial Government and helped establish the first Slovene university at Ljubljana, and was elected its first chancellor. In the same year he was appointed professor of mathematics at the Faculty of Arts. After the Second World War he joined the Faculty of Natural Science and Technology (FNT). He retired in 1957 after having lectured in mathematics for 40 years.\nEarliest contributions.\nPlemelj had shown his great gift for mathematics early in elementary school. He mastered the whole of the high school syllabus by the beginning of the fourth year and began to tutor students for their graduation examinations. At that time he discovered alone series for sin \"x\" and cos \"x\". Actually he found a series for cyclometric function arccos \"x\" and after that he just inverted this series and then guessed a principle for coefficients. Yet he did not have a proof for that.\nPlemelj had great joy for a difficult constructional tasks from geometry. From his high school days originates an elementary problem \u2014 his later construction of regular sevenfold polygon inscribed in a circle otherwise exactly and not approximately with simple solution as an angle trisection which was yet not known in those days and which necessarily leads to the old Indian or Babylonian approximate construction. He started to occupy himself with mathematics in fourth and fifth class of high school. Beside in mathematics he was interested also in natural science and especially astronomy. He studied celestial mechanics already at high school. He liked observing the stars. His eyesight was so sharp he could see the planet Venus even in the daytime.\nResearch.\nPlemelj's main research interests were the theory of linear differential equations, integral equations, potential theory, the theory of analytic functions, and functional analysis. Plemelj encountered integral equations while still a student at G\u00f6ttingen, when the Swedish professor Erik Holmgren gave a lecture on the work of his fellow countryman Fredholm on linear integral equations of the 1st and 2nd kind. Spurred on by Hilbert, G\u00f6ttingen mathematicians attacked this new area of research and Plemelj was one of the first to publish original results on the question, applying the theory of integral equations to the study of harmonic functions in potential theory.\nHis most important work in potential theory is summarised in his 1911 book \"Potentialtheoretische Untersuchungen\" (Studies in Potential Theory), which received the Jablonowski Society award in Leipzig (1500 marks), and the Richard Lieben award from the University of Vienna (2000 crowns) for the most outstanding work in the field of pure and applied mathematics written by any kind of 'Austrian' mathematician in the previous three years.\nHis most original contribution is the elementary solution he provided for the Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem \"f\"+ = \"g\" \"f\"\u2212 about the existence of a differential equation with given monodromy group. The solution, published in his 1908 article \"Riemannian classes of functions with given monodromy group\", rests on three formulas that now carry his name, which connect the values taken by a holomorphic function at the boundary of an arc \u0393:\n formula_1\n formula_2\n formula_3\nThese formulas are variously called the Plemelj formulae, the Sokhotsky-Plemelj formulae, or sometimes (mainly in German literature) the Plemelj-Sokhotsky Formulae, after the Polish mathematician Julian Sochocki (1842\u20131927).\nBased on his methods of solving the Riemann problem he had developed the theory of singular integral equations (MSC (2000) 45-Exx) which was used above all by the Russian school at the head of Nikoloz Muskhelishvili (\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u0445\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438) (1891\u20131976).\nPlemelj contributed significantly to the theory of analytic functions in solving the problem of uniformization of algebraic functions, contributions on formulation of the theorem of analytic extension of designs and treatises in algebra and in number theory.\nIn 1912, Plemelj published a very simple proof of the special case of Fermat's Last Theorem where the exponent, \"n\", is 5. More difficult proofs of this case were first provided by Dirichlet in 1828 and Legendre in 1830.\nHis arrival in Ljubljana in 1919 was seminal for the development of mathematics in Slovenia. As a good teacher he had raised several generations of mathematicians and engineers. His most famous student is Ivan Vidav. After the Second World War Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti (Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts) (SAZU) had published his three-year course of lectures for students of mathematics: \"Teorija analiti\u010dnih funkcij\" (The Theory of Analytic Functions),\n(SAZU, Ljubljana 1953, pp XVI+516), \"Diferencialne in integralske ena\u010dbe. Teorija in uporaba\" (Differential and Integral Equations. Theory and Application).\nPlemelj found a formula for a sum of normal derivatives of one-layered potential in the internal or external region. He was pleased also with algebra and number theory, but he had published only few contributions from these fields \u2013 for example a book entitled \"Algebra in teorija \u0161tevil\" (Algebra and Number Theory; SAZU, Ljubljana 1962, pp. xiv + 278) which was published abroad as his last work \"Problemi v smislu Riemanna in Kleina\" (Problems in the Sense of Riemann and Klein; edition and translation by J. R. M. Radok, \"Interscience Tract in Pure and Applied Mathematics\", No. 16, Interscience Publishers: John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, London, Sydney 1964, pp VII+175). This work deals with questions which were of his most interests and examinations. His bibliography includes 33 units, from which 30 are scientific treatises and had been published among the others in a magazines such as: \"Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik\", \"Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften\"; in Vienna, \"Jahresbericht der deutschen Mathematikervereinigung\", \"gdnae.de\" in Verhandlungen, \"Bulletin des Sciences Mathematiques\", \"Obzornik za matematiko in fiziko\" and \"Publications mathematiques de l'Universite de Belgrade\". When French mathematician Charles \u00c9mile Picard denoted Plemelj's works as \"deux excellents memoires\", Plemelj became known in the mathematical world.\nPlemelj was a regular member of the SAZU since its foundation in 1938, corresponding member of the JAZU (Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts) in Zagreb, Croatia since 1923, corresponding member of the SANU (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in Belgrade since 1930 (1931). In 1954, he received the highest award for research in Slovenia, the Pre\u0161eren award. The same year he was elected for corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in Munich.\nIn 1963, for his 90th anniversary, University of Ljubljana granted him title of the honorary doctor. Plemelj was first teacher of mathematics at Slovene university and 1949 became first honorary member of the ZDMFAJ (Yugoslav Union of Societies of Mathematicians, Physicists, and Astronomers). He left his villa in Bled to the DMFA, where today is his memorial room.\nPlemelj did not do extra preparation for lectures; he didn't have any notes. He used to say that he thought over the lecture subject on the way from his home in Gradi\u0161\u010de to the University. Students are said to have got the impression that he was creating teaching material on the spot and that they were witnessing the formation of something new. He was writing formulae on the table beautifully although they were composited from Greek, Latin or Gothic letters. He requested the same from students. They had to write distinctly.\nPlemelj had a very refined ear for languages and created a solid base for the development of Slovene mathematical terminology. He had accustomed students for a clear and logical phraseology. For example, he would become angry if they used the word \"rabiti\" 'to use' instead of the word \"potrebovati\" 'to need'. For this reason he said: \"The engineer who does not know mathematics never \"needs\" it. But if he knows it, he \"uses\" it frequently.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40442", "revid": "47120006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40442", "title": "Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)", "text": "Early settlers in Massachusetts\nThe Pilgrims, also known as the Pilgrim Fathers, were the English settlers who travelled to North America on the ship \"Mayflower\" and established the Plymouth Colony at what now is Plymouth, Massachusetts, United States. John Smith had named this territory New Plymouth in 1620, sharing the name of the Pilgrims' final departure port of Plymouth, Devon, England. The Pilgrims' leadership came from religious congregations of Brownists or Separatists who had fled religious persecution in England for the tolerance of 17th-century Holland in the Netherlands.\nThese Separatists held many of the same Calvinist religious beliefs as Puritans, but unlike Puritans (who wanted a purified established church), Pilgrims believed that their congregations should separate from the Church of England, which led to them being labelled Separatists. After several years of living in exile in Holland, they determined to establish a new settlement in the New World and arranged with investors to fund them. In 1620, they established the Plymouth Colony, in which they erected Congregational churches. The Puritans' later establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony eventually became more powerful in the area; but the Pilgrims' story nevertheless became a central theme in the history and culture of the United States.\nHistory.\nAround 1605, congregations in Nottinghamshire, England led by John Robinson, Richard Clyfton, and John Smyth quit the Church of England to form Separatist congregations. These held Brownist beliefs\u2014that true churches were voluntary democratic congregations, not whole Christian nations\u2014as taught by Robert Browne, John Greenwood, and Henry Barrowe. As Separatists, they held that their differences with the Church of England were irreconcilable and that their worship should be independent of the trappings, traditions, and organization of a central church.\nThe Separatist movement was controversial. Under the Act of Uniformity 1559, it was illegal not to attend official Church of England services, with a fine of one shilling (\u00a30.05; about \u00a3 today) for each missed Sunday and holy day. The penalties included imprisonment and larger fines for conducting unofficial services. The Seditious Sectaries Act 1592 was specifically aimed at outlawing the Brownists. Under this policy, London Underground Church members were repeatedly imprisoned from 1566, and then Robert Browne and his followers were imprisoned in Norfolk during the 1580s. Henry Barrow, John Greenwood, and John Penry were executed for sedition in 1593. Browne had taken his followers into exile in Middelburg, and Penry urged the London Separatists to emigrate in order to escape persecution, so after his death they went to Amsterdam.\nThe Archbishop of York, Matthew Hutton, displayed some sympathy to the Puritan cause, writing to Robert Cecil, Secretary of State to James I in 1604:\nThe Puritans though they differ in Ceremonies and accidentes, yet they agree with us in substance of religion, and I thinke all or the moste parte of them love his Majestie, and the presente state, and I hope will yield to conformitie. But the Papistes are opposite and contrarie in very many substantiall pointes of religion, and cannot but wishe the Popes authoritie and popish religion to be established.\nMany Puritans had hoped that reforms and reconciliation would be possible when James came to power which would allow them independence, but the Hampton Court Conference of 1604 denied nearly all of the concessions which they had requested\u2014except for an authorized English translation of the Bible. The same year, Richard Bancroft became Archbishop of Canterbury and launched a campaign against Puritanism and the Separatists. He suspended 300 ministers and fired 80 more, which led some of them to found more Separatist churches. Robinson, Clifton, and their followers founded a Brownist church, making a covenant with God \"to walk in all his ways made known, or to be made known, unto them, according to their best endeavours, whatsoever it should cost them, the Lord assisting them\".\nArchbishop Hutton died in 1606 and Tobias Matthew was appointed as his replacement. He was one of James's chief supporters at the 1604 conference, and he promptly began a campaign to purge the archdiocese of non-conforming influences, including Puritans, Separatists, and those wishing to return to the Catholic faith. Disobedient clergy were replaced, and prominent Separatists were confronted, fined, and imprisoned. He is credited with driving people out of the country who refused to attend Anglican services.\nWilliam Brewster was a former diplomatic assistant to the Netherlands. He was living in the Scrooby manor house while serving as postmaster for the village and bailiff to the Archbishop of York. He had been impressed by Clyfton's services and had begun participating in services led by John Smyth in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. After a time, he arranged for a congregation to meet privately at the Scrooby manor house. Services were held beginning in 1606 with Clyfton as pastor, John Robinson as teacher, and Brewster as the presiding elder. Shortly after, Smyth and members of the Gainsborough group moved on to Amsterdam. Brewster was fined \u00a320 (about \u00a3 today) \"in absentia\" for his non-compliance with the church. This followed his September 1607 resignation from the postmaster position, about the time that the congregation had decided to follow the Smyth party to Amsterdam.\nScrooby member William Bradford of Austerfield kept a journal of the congregation's events which was eventually published as \"Of Plymouth Plantation\". He wrote concerning this time period:\nBut after these things they could not long continue in any peaceable condition, but were hunted &amp; persecuted on every side, so as their former afflictions were but as flea-bitings in comparison of these which now came upon them. For some were taken &amp; clapt up in prison, others had their houses besett &amp; watcht night and day, &amp; hardly escaped their hands; and the most were faine to flie &amp; leave their howses &amp; habitations, and the means of their livelehood.\nLeiden.\nThe Pilgrims moved to the Netherlands around 1607\u201308 and lived in Leiden, Holland, a city of 30,000 inhabitants. Leiden was a thriving industrial center,\nand many members were able to support themselves working at Leiden University or in the textile, printing, and brewing trades. Others were less able to bring in sufficient income, hampered by their rural backgrounds and the language barrier; for those, accommodation was constructed on an estate bought by Robinson and three partners. Bradford wrote of their years in Leiden:\nFor these &amp; other reasons they removed to Leyden, a fair &amp; bewtifull citie, and of a sweete situation, but made more famous by ye universitie wherwith it is adorned, in which of late had been so many learned man. But wanting that traffike by sea which Amerstdam injoyes, it was not so beneficiall for their outward means of living &amp; estats. But being now hear pitchet they fell to such trads &amp; imployments as they best could; valewing peace &amp; their spirituall comforte above any other riches whatsoever. And at length they came to raise a competente &amp; comforteable living, but with hard and continuall labor.\nWilliam Brewster had been teaching English at the university, and Robinson enrolled in 1615 to pursue his doctorate. There he participated in a series of debates, particularly regarding the contentious issue of Calvinism versus Arminianism (siding with the Calvinists against the Remonstrants).\nBrewster acquired typesetting equipment about 1616 in a venture financed by Thomas Brewer, and began publishing the debates through a local press.\nThe Netherlands, however, was a land whose culture and language were strange and difficult for the English congregation to understand or learn. They found the Dutch political situation to be unstable, and their children were becoming more and more Dutch as the years passed. The congregation came to believe that they faced eventual extinction if they remained there.\nDecision to leave Holland.\nBy 1617, the congregation was stable and relatively secure, but there were ongoing issues which needed to be resolved. Bradford noted that many members of the congregation were showing signs of early aging, compounding the difficulties which some had in supporting themselves. A few had spent their savings and given up and returned to England, and the leaders feared that more would follow and that the congregation would become unsustainable. The employment issues made it unattractive for others to come to Leiden, and younger members had begun leaving to find employment and adventure elsewhere. Also compelling was the possibility of missionary work in some distant land, an opportunity that rarely arose in a Protestant stronghold.\nBradford lists some of the reasons for which the Pilgrims felt that they had to leave, including the discouragements that they faced in the Netherlands and the hope of attracting others by finding \"a better, and easier place of living\", the children of the group being \"drawn away by evil examples into extravagance and dangerous courses\", and the \"great hope, for the propagating and advancing the gospel of the kingdom of Christ in those remote parts of the world.\" Edward Winslow's list was similar. In addition to the economic worries and missionary possibilities, he stressed that it was important for the people to retain their English identity, culture, and language. They also believed that the English Church in Leiden could do little to benefit the larger community there.\nAt the same time, there were many uncertainties about moving to such a place as America, as stories had come back about failed colonies. There were fears that the native people would be violent, that there would be no source of food or water, that they might be exposed to unknown diseases, and that travel by sea was always hazardous. Balancing all this was a local political situation which was in danger of becoming unstable. The truce was faltering in the Eighty Years' War, and there was fear over what the attitudes of Spain might be toward them.\nPossible destinations included Guiana on the northeast coast of South America where the Dutch had established Essequibo colony, or another site near the Virginia settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because the presence of the older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities; however, they also felt that they should not settle too near, since that might inadvertently duplicate the political environment back in England. The London Company administered a territory of considerable size in the region, and the intended settlement location was at the mouth of the Hudson River (which instead became the Dutch colony of New Netherland). This plan allayed their concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still promised the military and economic benefits of being close to an established colony.\nRobert Cushman and John Carver were sent to England to solicit a land patent. Their negotiations were delayed because of conflicts internal to the London Company, but ultimately a patent was secured in the name of John Wincob on June 9 (Old Style)/June 19 (New Style), 1619.\nThe charter was granted with the king's condition that the Leiden group's religion would not receive official recognition.\nPreparations then stalled because of the continued problems within the London Company, and competing Dutch companies approached the congregation with the possibility of settling in the Hudson River area. David Baeckelandt suggests that the Leiden group was approached by Englishman Matthew Slade, son-in-law of Petrus Placius, a cartographer for the Dutch East India Company. Slade was also a spy for the English Ambassador, and the Pilgrims' plans were therefore known both at court and among influential investors in the Virginia Company's colony at Jamestown. Negotiations were broken off with the Dutch, however, at the encouragement of English merchant Thomas Weston, who assured them that he could resolve the London Company delays. The London Company intended to claim the area explored by Hudson before the Dutch could become fully established, and the first Dutch settlers did not arrive in the area until 1624.\nWeston did come with a substantial change, telling the Leiden group that parties in England had obtained a land grant north of the existing Virginia territory to be called New England. This was only partially true; the new grant did come to pass, but not until late in 1620 when the Plymouth Council for New England received its charter. It was expected that this area could be fished profitably, and it was not under the control of the existing Virginia government.\nA second change was known only to parties in England who did not inform the larger group. New investors had been brought into the venture who wanted the terms altered so that half of the settled land and property would revert to the investors at the end of the seven-year contract. Also, there had been a provision in the original agreement that allowed each settler to have two days per week to work on personal business, but this provision was dropped from the final agreement without the knowledge of the Pilgrims.\nAmid these negotiations, William Brewster found himself involved with religious unrest emerging in Scotland. In 1618, King James had promulgated the Five Articles of Perth which were seen in Scotland as an attempt to encroach on their Presbyterian tradition. Brewster published several pamphlets that were critical of this law, and they were smuggled into Scotland by April 1619. These pamphlets were traced back to Leiden, and the English authorities unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Brewster. English ambassador Dudley Carleton became aware of the situation and began pressuring the Dutch government to extradite Brewster, and the Dutch responded by arresting Thomas Brewer the financier in September. Brewster's whereabouts remain unknown between then and the colonists' departure, but the Dutch authorities did seize the typesetting materials which he had used to print his pamphlets. Meanwhile, Brewer was sent to England for questioning, where he stonewalled government officials until well into 1620. He was ultimately convicted in England for his continued religious publication activities and sentenced in 1626 to a 14-year prison term.\nPreparations.\nNot all of the congregation were able to depart on the first trip. Many members were not able to settle their affairs within the time constraints, and the budget was limited for travel and supplies; also, the group decided that the initial settlement should be undertaken primarily by younger and stronger members. The remainder agreed to follow if and when they could. Robinson would remain in Leiden with the larger portion of the congregation, and Brewster was to lead the American congregation. The church in America would be run independently, but it was agreed that membership would automatically be granted in either congregation to members who moved between the continents.\nWith personal and business matters agreed upon, the Pilgrims procured supplies and a small ship. \"Speedwell\" was to bring some passengers from the Netherlands to England, then on to America where it would be kept for the fishing business, with a crew hired for support services during the first year. The larger ship \"Mayflower\" was leased for transport and exploration services.\nVoyage.\nThe \"Speedwell\" was originally named \"Swiftsure\". It was built in 1577 at 60 tons and was part of the English fleet that defeated the Spanish Armada. It departed Delfshaven in July 1620 with the Leiden colonists, after a canal ride from Leyden of about seven hours. It reached Southampton, Hampshire, and met with the \"Mayflower\" and the additional colonists hired by the investors. With final arrangements made, the two vessels set out on August 5 (Old Style)/August 15 (New Style).\nSoon after, the \"Speedwell\" crew reported that their ship was taking on water, so both were diverted to Dartmouth, Devon. The crew inspected \"Speedwell\" for leaks and sealed them, but their second attempt to depart got them only as far as Plymouth, Devon. The crew decided that \"Speedwell\" was untrustworthy, and her owners sold her; the ship's master and some of the crew transferred to the \"Mayflower\" for the trip. William Bradford observed that the \"Speedwell\" seemed \"overmasted\", thus putting a strain on the hull; and he expressed suspicions that crew members might have deliberately caused it, allowing them to abandon their year-long commitments. Passenger Robert Cushman wrote that the leaking was caused by a loose board.\nAtlantic crossing.\nOf the 120 combined passengers on the two ships, 102 were chosen to travel on the ship with the supplies consolidated. Of these, about half had come by way of Leiden, and about 30 of the adults were members of the congregation.\nThe reduced party finally sailed successfully on September 6 (Old Style)/September 16 (New Style), 1620.\nInitially the trip went smoothly, but under way they were met with strong winds and storms. One of these caused a main beam to crack, and the possibility was considered of turning back, even though they were more than halfway to their destination. However, they repaired the ship sufficiently to continue by using a \"great iron screw\" brought along by the colonists (probably a jack to be used for either house construction or a cider press). Passenger John Howland was washed overboard in the storm, but he caught a top-sail halyard trailing in the water and was pulled back on board.\nOne crew member and one passenger died before they reached land. A child was born at sea and named Oceanus.\nArrival in America.\nThe \"Mayflower\" passengers sighted land on November 9, 1620 after enduring miserable conditions for about 65 days, and William Brewster led them in singing Psalm 100. They confirmed that the area was Cape Cod within the New England territory recommended by Weston. They attempted to sail the ship around the cape towards the Hudson River, but they encountered shoals and difficult currents around Cape Malabar (the old French name for Monomoy Island). They decided to turn around, and the ship was anchored in Provincetown Harbor by November 11/21.\nThe Mayflower Compact.\nThe charter was incomplete for the Plymouth Council for New England when the colonists departed England (it was granted while they were in transit on November 3/13). They arrived without a patent; the older Wincob patent was from their abandoned dealings with the London Company. Some of the passengers, aware of the situation, suggested that they were free to do as they chose upon landing, without a patent in place, and to ignore the contract with the investors.\nThe Leiden congregants, therefore, drafted a brief contract known as the Mayflower Compact, promising cooperation among the settlers \"for the general good of the Colony unto which we promise all due submission and obedience.\" It organized them into what was called a \"civill body politick,\" in which issues would be decided by voting, the key ingredient of democracy. It was ratified by majority rule, with 41 adult male Pilgrims signing for the 102 passengers (74 males and 28 females). Included in the company were 13 male servants and three female servants, along with some sailors and craftsmen hired for short-term service to the colony. At this time, John Carver was chosen as the colony's first governor. It was Carver who had chartered the \"Mayflower\" and his is the first signature on the Mayflower Compact, being the most respected and affluent member of the group. The Mayflower Compact is considered to be one of the seeds of American democracy, and historians have called it the world's first written constitution.\nFirst landings.\nThorough exploration of the area was delayed for more than two weeks because the shallop or pinnace (a smaller sailing vessel) which they brought had been partially dismantled to fit aboard the \"Mayflower\" and was further damaged in transit. Small parties, however, waded to the beach to fetch firewood and attend to long-deferred personal hygiene.\nMyles Standish was an English soldier from Chorley whom the colonists had met while in Leiden, and they had asked him to join them as their military adviser. He and Christopher Jones led several exploratory trips ashore while awaiting the shallop's repair. They encountered an old European-built house and iron kettle, left behind by some ship's crew, and a few recently cultivated fields showing corn stubble.\nThey came upon an artificial mound near the dunes which they partially uncovered and found to be an Indian grave. Farther along, a similar mound was found, more recently made, and they discovered that some of the burial mounds also contained corn. The colonists took some of the corn, intending to use it as seed for planting, while they reburied the rest. William Bradford later recorded in his book \"Of Plymouth Plantation\" that, after the shallop had been repaired,\nThey also found two of the Indian's houses covered with mats, and some of their implements in them; but the people had run away and could not be seen. Without permission they took more corn, and beans of various colours. These they brought away, intending to give them full satisfaction when they should meet with any of them\u2014as about six months afterwards they did.\nAnd it is to be noted as a special providence of God, and a great mercy to this poor people, that they thus got seed to plant corn the next year, or they might have starved; for they had none, nor any likelihood of getting any, till too late for the planting season.\nBy December, most of the passengers and crew had become ill, coughing violently. Many also were suffering from the effects of scurvy. There had already been ice and snowfall, hampering exploration efforts, and nearly half of the Pilgrim passengers died during the first winter.\nFirst contact.\nExplorations resumed on December 6/16. The shallop party headed south along the cape, consisting of seven colonists from Leiden, three from London, and seven crew; they chose to land at the area inhabited by the Nauset people (the area around Brewster, Chatham, Eastham, Harwich, and Orleans) where they saw some people on the shore who fled when they approached. Inland they found more mounds, one containing acorns which they exhumed, and more graves, which they decided not to disturb. They remained ashore overnight and heard cries near the encampment. The following morning, they were attacked by Indians who shot at them with arrows. The colonists retrieved their firearms and shot back, then chased them into the woods but did not find them. There was no more contact with them for several months.\nThe Indians were already familiar with the English, who had intermittently visited the area for fishing and trade before \"Mayflower\" arrived. In the Cape Cod area, relations were poor following a visit several years earlier by Thomas Hunt. Hunt kidnapped 20 people from Patuxet (the site of Plymouth Colony) and another seven from Nausett, and he attempted to sell them as slaves in Europe. One of the Patuxet men was Squanto, who became an ally of the Plymouth Colony. He had escaped slavery and made his way to England, where he became fluent in English. He ultimately returned to America, only to discover that his entire village had died from plague.\nSettlement.\nContinuing westward, the shallop's mast and rudder were broken by storms and the sail was lost. They rowed for safety, encountering the harbor formed by Duxbury and Plymouth barrier beaches. They remained at this spot for two days to recuperate and repair equipment. They named it Clark's Island for a \"Mayflower\" mate who first set foot on it.\nThey resumed exploration on Monday, December 11/21 when the party crossed over to the mainland and surveyed the area that ultimately became the settlement. The anniversary of this survey is observed in Massachusetts as Forefathers' Day and is traditionally associated with the Plymouth Rock landing tradition. This land was especially suited to winter building because it had already been cleared, and the tall hills provided a good defensive position.\nThe cleared village was known as Patuxet to the Wampanoag people and was abandoned about three years earlier following a plague that killed all of its residents. The \"Indian fever\" involved hemorrhaging and is assumed to have been fulminating smallpox. The outbreak had been severe enough that the colonists discovered unburied skeletons in the dwellings.\nThe exploratory party returned to the \"Mayflower\", which was anchored away, having been brought to the harbor on December 16/26. The Pilgrims evaluated the nearby sites and selected a hill in Plymouth (so named on earlier charts) on December 19/29.\nThe Pilgrims began construction immediately, with the first common house nearly completed by January 9/19, 20 feet square and built for general use. At this point, each single man was ordered to join himself to one of the 19 families in order to eliminate the need to build any more houses than absolutely necessary. Each extended family was assigned a plot one-half rod wide and three rods long for each household member, then each family built its own dwelling. They brought supplies ashore, and the settlement was mostly complete by early February.\nWhen the first house was finished, it immediately became a hospital for the ill Pilgrims. Thirty-one of the company were dead by the end of February, with deaths still rising. Coles Hill became the first cemetery, on a prominence above the beach, and they allowed grass to overgrow the graves for fear that the Indians would discover how weakened the settlement had actually become.\nBetween the landing and March, only 47 colonists had survived the diseases that they contracted on the ship. During the worst of the sickness, only six or seven of the group were able to feed and care for the rest. In this time, half the \"Mayflower\" crew also died.\nWilliam Bradford became governor in 1621 upon the death of John Carver. On March 22, 1621, the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony signed a peace treaty with Massasoit of the Wampanoags. Bradford surrendered the patent of Plymouth Colony to the freemen in 1640, minus a small reserve of three tracts of land. He served as governor for 11 consecutive years, and was elected to various other terms before his death in 1657.\nThe colony contained Bristol County, Plymouth County, and Barnstable County, Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Bay Colony was reorganized and issued a new charter as the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, and Plymouth ended its history as a separate colony.\nEtymology.\nBradford's history.\nThe first use of the word \"pilgrims\" for the \"Mayflower\" passengers appeared in William Bradford's 1651 \"Of Plymouth Plantation\". In recounting his group's July 1620 departure from Leiden, he used the imagery of Hebrews 11 (https://) about Old Testament \"strangers and pilgrims\" who had the opportunity to return to their old country but instead longed for a better, heavenly country.\nSo they lefte goodly &amp; pleasante citie, which had been ther resting place, nere 12 years; but they knew they were pilgrimes, &amp; looked not much on these things; but lift up their eyes to ye heavens, their dearest cuntrie, and quieted their spirits.\nThere is no record of the term \"Pilgrims\" being used to describe Plymouth's founders for 150 years after Bradford wrote this passage, except when quoting him. The \"Mayflower's\" story was retold by historians Nathaniel Morton (in 1669) and Cotton Mather (in 1702), and both paraphrased Bradford's passage and used his word \"pilgrims\". At Plymouth's Forefathers' Day observance in 1793, Rev. Chandler Robbins recited this passage.\nPopular use.\nThe name \"Pilgrims\" was probably not in popular use before about 1798, even though Plymouth celebrated Forefathers' Day several times between 1769 and 1798 and used a variety of terms to honor Plymouth's founders. The term \"Pilgrims\" was not mentioned, other than in Robbins' 1793 recitation.\nThe first documented use of the term that was not simply quoting Bradford was at a December 22, 1798, celebration of Forefathers' Day in Boston. A song composed for the occasion used the word \"Pilgrims\", and the participants drank a toast to \"The Pilgrims of Leyden\".\nThe term was used prominently during Plymouth's next Forefather's Day celebration in 1800, and was used in Forefathers' Day observances thereafter.\nBy the 1820s, the term \"Pilgrims\" was becoming more common. Daniel Webster repeatedly referred to \"the Pilgrims\" in his December 22, 1820, address for Plymouth's bicentennial which was widely read. Harriet Vaughan Cheney used it in her 1824 novel \"A Peep at the Pilgrims in Sixteen Thirty-Six\", and the term also gained popularity with the 1825 publication of Felicia Hemans's classic poem \"The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "40444", "revid": "25511559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40444", "title": "Monterey, California", "text": "Monterey ( ; ) is a city situated on the southern edge of Monterey Bay, on the Central Coast of California. Located in Monterey County, the city occupies a land area of and recorded a population of 30,218 in the 2020 census.\nThe city was founded by the Spanish in 1774, when Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 and Jun\u00edpero Serra established the Presidio of Monterey and the Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo. Monterey was elevated to capital of the Province of the Californias in 1777, servings as the administrative and military headquarters of both Alta California and Baja California, as well as its only official port of entry. Following the Mexican War of Independence, Monterey continued as the capital of the Mexican Department of the Californias.\nDuring the United States conquest of California, part of the Mexican-American War, Monterey was seized by the American military in the Battle of Monterey in 1846. Following its capture, Monterey continued to serve as the capital of the American interim government of California until 1849, during which it hosted the California's 1st Constitutional Convention. In the late 19th century, Monterey and its surrounding area began to attract communities of artists, writers, and other creatives, leading to the creation of an art colony.\nToday, Monterey is a popular tourist destination on the Central Coast, hosting notable attractions such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Cannery Row, Fisherman's Wharf, California Roots Music and Arts Festival, and the annual Monterey Jazz Festival. The city is also an important hub for the military and higher education, home to the Defense Language Institute, the Naval Postgraduate School, the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey and California State University, Monterey Bay.\nHistory.\nOhlone period.\nLong before the arrival of Spanish explorers, the Rumsen Ohlone tribe, one of seven linguistically distinct Ohlone groups in California, inhabited the area now known as Monterey. Ohlone villages in the area included Ichxenta (Point Lobos), Calendaruc, Wacharon (Moss Landing), and Rumsien (Carmel-by-the-Sea), among others. They subsisted by hunting, fishing and gathering food on and around the biologically rich Monterey Peninsula.\nResearchers have found a number of shell middens in the area and, based on the archaeological evidence, concluded the Ohlone's primary marine food consisted of various types of mussels and abalone. A number of midden sites have been located along about of rocky coast on the Monterey Peninsula from the current site of Fishermans' Wharf in Monterey to Carmel.\nSpanish period.\nThe city is named after Monterey Bay. The bay's name was given by Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno in 1602. He anchored in what is now Monterey harbor on December 16, and named it \"Puerto de Monterrey\", in honor of the Conde de Monterrey, then the viceroy of New Spain. Monterrey is an alternate spelling of Monterrei, a municipality in the Galicia region of Spain from which the viceroy and his father (the Fourth Count of Monterrei) originated. Some variants of the city's name are recorded as Monte Rey and Monterey. Monterey Bay had been described earlier by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo as La Bahia de los Pinos (Bay of the Pines). Despite the explorations of Cabrillo and Vizcaino, and despite Spain's frequent trading voyages between Asia and Mexico, the Spanish did not make Monterey Bay into a settled permanent harbor before the 18th century. Monterey Harbor was too exposed to rough ocean currents and winds. Nonetheless, Monterey was known as a location with tall pines for repairing masts. In 1745, the King's appointee to the Manila (Philippines) audiencia, Pedro Calderon Henriquez, began lobbying to build a shipyard staffed by Filipino artisans in Monterey, with the goal of using the ships to defend the commercial route from piracy. \nDespite Monterey's limited use as a maritime port, the encroachments of other Europeans near California in the 18th century prompted the Spanish monarchy to try to better secure the region. As a result, it commissioned the Portola exploration and Alta California mission system. In 1769, the first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol\u00e1 expedition, traveled north from San Diego. They sought Vizca\u00edno's Port of Monterey, which he had described as \"a fine harbor sheltered from all winds\" 167 years earlier. The explorers failed to recognize the place when they came to it on October 1, 1769. The party continued north as far as San Francisco Bay before turning back. On the return journey, they camped near one of Monterey's lagoons on November 27, still not convinced they had found the place Vizca\u00edno had described. Franciscan missionary Juan Cresp\u00ed noted in his diary, \"We halted in sight of the Point of Pines (recognized, as was said, in the beginning of October) and camped near a small lagoon which has rather muddy water, but abounds in pasture and firewood.\" \nGaspar de Portol\u00e1 returned by land to Monterey the next year, having concluded that he must have been at Vizca\u00edno's Port of Monterey after all. The land party was met at Monterey by Jun\u00edpero Serra, who traveled by sea. Portol\u00e1 erected the Presidio of Monterey to defend the port and, on June 3, 1770, Serra founded the Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo inside the presidio enclosure. Portol\u00e1 returned to Mexico, replaced in Monterey by Captain Pedro Fages, who had been third in command on the exploratory expeditions. Fages became the second governor of Alta California, serving from 1770 to 1774.\nSerra's missionary aims soon came into conflict with Fages and the soldiers, so he relocated and built a new mission in Carmel the next year to gain greater independence from Fages. The existing wood and adobe church remained in service to the nearby soldiers and became the Royal Presidio Chapel.\nMonterey became the capital of the \"Province of Both Californias\" in 1777, and the chapel was renamed the Royal Presidio Chapel. The original church was destroyed by fire in 1789 and replaced by the present sandstone structure. It was completed in 1794 by Indian labor. In 1840, the chapel was rededicated to the patronage of Saint Charles Borromeo. The cathedral is the oldest continuously operating parish and the oldest stone building in California. It is also the oldest (and smallest) serving cathedral along with St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is the only existing presidio chapel in California and the only surviving building from the original Monterey Presidio.\nThe city was originally the only port of entry for all taxable goods in California. All shipments into California by sea were required to go through the Custom House, the oldest governmental building in the state and California's Historic Landmark Number One. Built in three phases, the Spanish began construction of the Custom House in 1814, the Mexican government completed the center section in 1827, and the United States government finished the lower end in 1846.\nArgentine raid and occupation.\nOn November 24, 1818, Argentine corsair Hippolyte Bouchard landed approximately from the Presidio of Monterey, using a hidden tidal creek to conceal his approach. Operating under a letter of marque from the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata, Bouchard carried out the expedition as part of Argentina\u2019s broader efforts to disrupt Spanish colonial control during the South American wars of independence.\nThe Spanish garrison offered minimal resistance, and after roughly an hour of combat, Bouchard\u2019s forces succeeded in capturing the fort. The Argentine flag was then raised over Monterey, marking a symbolic assertion of Argentine presence on the Pacific coast of North America. Although the Spanish flag had long flown there as part of colonial rule, this event marked the first time an independent foreign nation had occupied and hoisted its flag in California preceding both the Mexican and United States flags.\nBouchard\u2019s forces occupied Monterey for six days. During the occupation, they seized livestock and supplies, and set fire to several strategic buildings, including the fort, the artillery headquarters, the governor\u2019s residence, and various Spanish colonial homes. Despite the destruction of infrastructure, the civilian population was not harmed. After achieving their objectives, the Argentines withdrew and continued their privateering campaign along the Pacific coast.\nMexican period.\nMexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, but the civil and religious institutions of Alta California remained much the same until the 1830s, when the secularization of the missions converted most of the mission pasture lands into private land grant ranchos. In 1834, the San Carlos Cemetery was officially opened and interred many of the early local families. Agust\u00edn V. Zamorano established the first print shop in California, when he brought a printing press to Monterey, in the summer of 1834.\nDuring the Mexican period, the city was determined the site of District Court of the Territory of Alta California (\"Juzgado de Distrito del Territorio de la Alta California\"), since 1834, when Luis del Castillo Negrete, the appointed district judge (Juez de Distrito), took possession of the court; until 1836, when due to the rebellion led by Juan Bautista Alvarado, the judge left the city for the territory of Baja California, which \"de facto\" disqualified that instance and would close definitively until 1841, with a decree by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. Subsequently, in 1842, the Superior Court (\"Superior Tribunal de Justicia del Departamento de las Californias\") was installed, which had a short life, as it stopped functioning in 1845.\nMonterey was the site of the Battle of Monterey on July 7, 1846, during the Mexican\u2013American War. It was on this date that John D. Sloat, Commodore in the United States Navy, raised the U.S. flag over the Monterey Custom House and claimed California for the United States.\nIn addition, many historic \"firsts\" occurred in Monterey. These include First theater in California, brick house, publicly funded school, public building, public library, and printing press (which printed \"The Californian\", California's first newspaper.) Larkin House, one of Monterey State Historic Park's National Historic Landmarks, built in the Mexican period by Thomas Oliver Larkin, is an early example of Monterey Colonial architecture. The Old Custom House, the historic district and the Royal Presidio Chapel are also National Historic Landmarks. The Cooper-Molera Adobe is a National Trust Historic Site.\nAmerican period.\nColton Hall, built in 1849 by Walter Colton, originally served as both a public school and a government meeting place. It hosted the 1849 Constitutional Convention, where American and Californio delegates drafted the first Constitution of California, in both English and Spanish.\nMonterey hosted California's first constitutional convention in 1849, which composed the documents necessary to apply to the United States for statehood. Today Colton Hall houses a small museum, while adjacent buildings serve as the seat of local government, and the Monterey post office (opened in 1849).\nPioneer Francis Doud built Doud House in the 1860s, situated at the present-day 117 Van Buren Street. The house is one of the earliest and most well-preserved examples of an early wood frame residences in Monterey. Monterey was incorporated in 1890.\nThomas Albert Work built several of the buildings in Monterey, including the three-story Del Mar hotel in 1895, at the corner of Sixteenth, and in 1900, bought into the First National Bank in Monterey, acquiring it in 1906. He was president of the bank for more than 20 years.\nMonterey had long been famous for the abundant fishery in Monterey Bay. That changed in the 1950s when the local fishery business collapsed due to overfishing. A few of the old fishermen's cabins from the early 20th century have been preserved as they originally stood along Cannery Row.\nThe city has a noteworthy history as a center for California painters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Such painters as Arthur Frank Mathews, Armin Hansen, Xavier Martinez, Rowena Meeks Abdy and Percy Gray lived or visited to pursue painting in the style of either En plein air or Tonalism.\nMany noted authors have also lived in and around Monterey, including Robert Louis Stevenson, John Steinbeck, Ed Ricketts, Robinson Jeffers, Robert A. Heinlein, and Henry Miller.\nMore recently, Monterey has been recognized for its significant involvement in post-secondary learning of languages other than English and its major role in delivering translation and interpretation services around the world. In November 1995, California Governor Pete Wilson proclaimed Monterey \"the Language Capital of the World\".\nOn June 7, 2021, the macOS Monterey operating system was presented at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC2021) and named after the Monterey region.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (29.49%) is water. Sand deposits in the northern coastal area comprise the sole known mineral resources. The city has several distinct districts, such as New Monterey, Del Monte, and Cannery Row.\nLocal soil is Quaternary Alluvium. Common soil series include the Baywood fine sand on the east side, Narlon loamy sand on the west side, Sheridan coarse sandy loam on hilly terrain, and the pale Tangair sand on hills supporting closed-cone pine habitat. The city is in a moderate to high seismic risk zone, the principal threat being the active San Andreas Fault approximately to the east. The Monterey Bay fault, which tracks to the north, is also active, as is the Palo Colorado fault to the south. Also nearby, minor but potentially active, are the Berwick Canyon, Seaside, Tularcitos and Chupines faults.\nMonterey Bay's maximum credible tsunami for a 100-year interval has been calculated as a wave high. The considerable undeveloped area in the northwest part of the city has a high potential for landslides and erosion.\nThe city is adjacent to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a federally protected ocean area extending along the coast. Sometimes this sanctuary is confused with the local bay which is also termed Monterey Bay.\nSoquel Canyon State Marine Conservation Area, Portuguese Ledge State Marine Conservation Area, Pacific Grove Marine Gardens State Marine Conservation Area, Lovers Point State Marine Reserve, Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area and Asilomar State Marine Reserve are marine protected areas established by the state of California in Monterey Bay. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.\nThe California sea otter, a threatened subspecies, inhabits the local Monterey Bay marine environment, and a field station of The Marine Mammal Center is located in Monterey to support sea rescue operations in this section of the California coast. The rare San Joaquin kit fox is found in Monterey's oak-forest and chaparral habitats. The chaparral, found mainly on the city's drier eastern slopes, hosts such plants as manzanita, chamise and ceanothus. Additional species of interest (that is, potential candidates for endangered species status) are the Salinas kangaroo rat and the silver-sided legless lizard.\nThere is a variety of natural habitat in Monterey: littoral zone and sand dunes; closed-cone pine forest; and Monterey Cypress. There are no dairy farms in the city of Monterey; the semi-hard cheese known as Monterey Jack originated in nearby Carmel Valley, California, and is named after businessman and land speculator David Jacks.\nThe closed-cone pine habitat is dominated by Monterey pine, Knobcone pine and Bishop pine, and contains the rare Monterey manzanita. In the early 20th century the botanist Willis Linn Jepson characterized Monterey Peninsula's forests as the \"most important silva ever\", and encouraged Samuel F.B. Morse (a century younger than the inventor Samuel F. B. Morse) of the Del Monte Properties Company to explore the possibilities of preserving the unique forest communities. The dune area is no less important, as it hosts endangered species such as the vascular plants Seaside birds beak, Hickman's potentilla and Eastwood's Ericameria. Rare plants also inhabit the chaparral: Hickman's onion, Yadon's piperia (\"Piperia yadonii\") and Sandmat manzanita. Other rare plants in Monterey include Hutchinson's delphinium, Tidestrom lupine, Gardner's yampah and Knotweed, the latter perhaps already extinct.\nMonterey's noise pollution has been mapped to define the principal sources of noise and to ascertain the areas of the population exposed to significant levels. Principal sources are the Monterey Regional Airport, State Route 1 and major arterial streets such as Munras Avenue, Fremont Street, Del Monte Boulevard, and Camino Aguajito. While most of Monterey is a quiet residential city, a moderate number of people in the northern part of the city are exposed to aircraft noise at levels in excess of 60\u00a0dB on the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) scale. The most intense source is State Route 1: all residents exposed to levels greater than 65 CNEL\u2014about 1,600 people\u2014live near State Route 1 or one of the principal arterial streets.\nClimate.\nMonterey's climate is regulated by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, resulting in a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Csb\") although with temperatures resembling an oceanic climate. The city's average high temperatures range from in December to in September. Average annual precipitation is , with most occurring between October and April; little to no precipitation falls during the summer. There is an average of 72.1 days with measurable precipitation annually. Average temperatures in Monterey are similar to average temperatures found in other parts of the world with oceanic climates, including Puerto Williams, Chile, Ushuaia, Argentina, much of New Zealand, the Atlantic coast of Spain, southeastern Alaska and the western coast of Norway.\nSummers in Monterey are often cool and foggy. The cold surface waters cause even summer nights to be unusually cool for the latitude; this is in distinct contrast to the much warmer summer days and nights of the U.S. east coast. The extreme moderation of summer temperatures is further underlined by the fact that Monterey is geographically situated at a similar latitude within California as Death Valley\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009one of the hottest areas in the world. \nDuring winter, snow occasionally falls in the higher elevations of the Santa Lucia Mountains and Gabilan Mountains that overlook Monterey, but snow in Monterey itself is extremely rare. A few unusual events in January 1962, February 1976, and December 1997 brought a light coating of snow to Monterey. In March 2006, a total of fell in Monterey, including on March 10, 2006. The snowfall on January 21, 1962, of , is remembered for delaying the Bing Crosby golf tournament in nearby Pebble Beach.\nThe record lowest temperature was on December 24, 1998, and January 13, 2007. Annually, there are an average of 1.3 days with highs that reach or exceed and an average of 1.5 days with lows at or below the freezing mark.\nCombining the records for Monterey and Monterey WFO, the wettest \"rain year\" on record has been from July 1997 to June 1998 with of precipitation, and the driest from July 2013 to June 2014 with . The most precipitation in one month was in February 1998. The record maximum 24-hour precipitation was on December 11, 2014.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe headquarters of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey in California is in Monterey, and one of the relatively few Oratorian communities in the United States is located in the city. The city is adjacent to the historic Catholic Carmel Mission.\n2020.\nThe 2020 United States census reported that Monterey had a population of 30,218 people, with 12,399 households. The racial makeup of Monterey was 67.4% White, 3.2% African American, 1.0% Native American, 7.9% Asian, 0.7% Pacific Islander, 7.3% from other races, and 12.4% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 18.6% of the population. The most commonly reported ancestries were English (14.8%), German (14.1%), Irish (13.6%), Mexican (11.9%), Italian (8.8%), and Scottish (4.3%).\nOf the population, 85.6% of the population lived in households, 13.1% lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 1.3% were institutionalized.\nThere were 12,912 households, out of which 38.1% were married-couple households, 7.8% were cohabiting couple households, 31.3% had a female householder with no partner present, and 22.7% had a male householder with no partner present. Children under 18 years old lived in 19.1% of households. 38.1% of households were one person, and 14.8% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.09. There were 6,284 families (50.7% of all households).\nThe age distribution was 12.8% under the age of 18, 16.0% aged 18 to 24, 30.4% aged 25 to 44, 20.9% aged 45 to 64, and 19.9% who were 65years of age or older. The median age was 36.7years. For every 100 females, there were 103.2 males.\nIn 2023, the US Census Bureau estimated that the median household income was $104,110, and the per capita income was $62,541. About 8.0% of families and 10.5% of the population were below the poverty line.\n2010.\nThe 2010 United States census reported that Monterey had a population of 27,810. The population density was .

Additional military facilities in Monterey include the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, and the United States Naval Research Laboratory \u2013 Monterey.\nArts and culture.\nAttractions.\nMonterey is well known for the abundance and diversity of its marine life, which includes sea lions, sea otters, harbor seals, bat rays, kelp forests, pelicans and dolphins and several species of whales. Only a few miles offshore is the Monterey Canyon, the largest and deepest (at ) underwater canyon off the Pacific coast of North America, which grants scientists access to the deep sea within hours. The cornucopia of marine life makes Monterey a popular destination for scuba divers of all abilities ranging from novice to expert. Scuba classes are held at San Carlos State Beach, which has been a favorite with divers since the 1960s. The Monterey Bay Aquarium on Cannery Row is one of the largest aquariums in North America, and several marine science laboratories, including Hopkins Marine Station are located in the area.\nMonterey is home to several museums and more than thirty carefully preserved historic buildings. Most of these buildings are adobes built in the mid-1800s. Some are museums and open to the public, including the Cooper Molera Adobe, Robert Louis Stevenson House, Casa Serrano, The Perry House, The Customs House, Colton Hall, Mayo Hayes O'Donnell Library and The First Brick House. Many others are only open during Monterey's annual adobe tour. The Monterey Museum of Art specializes in Early California Impressionist painting, photography, and contemporary art. Other youth-oriented art attractions include MY Museum, a children's museum, and YAC, an arts organization for teens.\nWhat may be the only whalebone sidewalk still in existence in the United States lies in front of the Old Whaling Station, left by New England whalers while California was still part of New Spain.\nCannery Row is a historic industrial district west of downtown Monterey. Several companies operated large sardine canneries and packing houses from the 1920s until the 1950s when the sardines were overfished and the industry collapsed. The neighborhood was a minor tourist attraction until the late 1980s when the Monterey Bay Aquarium bought the former Hovden Cannery and built their aquarium around it. The Aquarium revitalized the neighborhood and it is now the number one tourist destination on the Monterey Peninsula. It is home to more than 600 species of plants and animals. Several of the canneries burnt down in the 1970s and some of their empty foundations are still visible along the oceanfront. A free heritage trolley transports visitors between downtown Monterey and the Aquarium during the summer.\nOnce called Ocean View Boulevard, the street was renamed Cannery Row in 1953 in honor of writer John Steinbeck, who had written a well-known novel of the same name. It has now become a tourist attraction with numerous establishments located in former cannery buildings, including Cannery Row Antique Mall which is located in the most historically intact cannery building open to the public. Other historical buildings in this district include Wing Chong Market, The American Tin Cannery which is a shopping mall, Doc Rickett's lab, next door to the aquarium and only open to the public a few times a year, and some of the water tanks written about by Steinbeck. A few privately owned and operated fishing companies still exist on Cannery Row, housed on piers located a short distance from the historic district frequented by tourists. Cannery Row is now considered the historic cannery district from Foam St. to the ocean.\nThe Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado House is California Historical Landmark number #348. The adobe house was seriously damaged in January 2023 during the 2022\u20132023 California floods.\nLake El Estero is a popular Monterey park. Recreation opportunities include paddleboats, the Dennis the Menace Park (named after the comics character Dennis the Menace), and a skate park designed by local skaters. Birders are especially fond of this park due to its easy accessibility and the diversity of birdlife it attracts.\nArts.\nMonterey is the home of the Monterey Museum of Art, its annex museum La Mirada and the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum. There are several commercial galleries in the historic district of Cannery Row, New Monterey and Customs House Plaza.\nMusic.\nThe Monterey Jazz Festival began in 1958, presenting such artists as Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, and Billie Holiday, and now claims to be \"the longest running jazz festival in the world\" (the Newport Jazz Festival was established in 1954, but has changed venues since its founding).\nIn June 1967 the city was the venue of the Monterey Pop Festival. Formally known as the Monterey International Pop Music Festival, the three-day concert event was held June 16 to 18, 1967, at the Monterey County Fairgrounds. It was the first widely promoted and heavily attended rock festival, attracting an estimated 200,000 total attendees with 55,000 to 90,000 people present at the event's peak at midnight on Sunday. It was notable as hosting the first major American appearances by Jimi Hendrix and The Who, as well as the first major public performances of Janis Joplin and Otis Redding.\nThe Monterey Pop Festival embodied the themes of San Francisco as a focal point for the counterculture and is generally regarded as one of the beginnings of the \"Summer of Love\" in 1967. It also became the template for future music festivals, notably the Woodstock Festival two years later.\nIn 1986, the Monterey Blues Festival was created and ran continuously for over two decades. It filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and was resurrected in 2017 as the Monterey International Blues Festival.\nLiterature.\nSteinbeck's friends included some of the city's more colorful characters, among them Ed Ricketts, a marine biologist, and Bruce Ariss, artist and theater enthusiast who designed and built the Wharf Theater.\nAfter Ricketts's death, the new owner of his lab and a group of friends assembled each Wednesday at the lab for drinks and jazz music. While visiting with the group, San Francisco disc jockey Jimmy Lyons suggested holding a jazz celebration in Monterey, which eventually became the Monterey Jazz Festival.\nIn 1879, Robert Louis Stevenson spent a short time in Monterey at the French Hotel while writing \"The Amateur Emigrant\", \"The Old Pacific Capital\", and \"Vendetta of the West\". The former hotel, now known as the Stevenson House, stands at 530 Houston Street and features items that belonged to the writer.\nTheater.\nThe building in which the first paid public dramatic entertainment in California occurred is in Monterey and is called, appropriately, \"California's First Theater\". In 1847, a sailor, Jack Swan, began construction on an adobe building at the corner of Pacific Street and Scott Avenue, near the Pacific House and Fisherman's Wharf. Between 1847 and 1848 several detachments of soldiers were stationed in Monterey and some of the sailors approached Swan with a proposition to lease a section of his building for use as a theater and money-making venture\u2014a proposal Swan accepted. The enterprise collected $500 on its first performance, a considerable sum at that time. The primary mediums presented were melodramas and Olios (a form of musical revue and audience sing-along). In the spring of 1848, the play \"Putnam, the Iron Son of '76\", was presented. After the California Gold Rush of 1849, much of the population, including Swan, traveled to northern California in search of riches. As a result, by the end that year, the company disbanded. In 1896, Swan died and the building was abandoned until 1906 when it was purchased by the California Historic Landmarks League, who deeded it to the State of California. In 1937, the building was leased to Denny-Watrous Management, which revived the tradition of melodrama at the now historic building. A resident company was created, the Troupers of the Gold Coast, which maintained the tradition for over 50 years, closing for renovation in 1999. It is now permanently closed.\nThe Wharf Theater opened on Fisherman's Wharf on May 18, 1950, with a production of \"Happy Birthday\", featuring a set designed by Bruce Ariss. The theater also produced one of Ariss's plays and was successful enough to draw the attention of MGM, which brought Ariss to Hollywood to work for several years. The theater was destroyed by fire on December 31, 1959. The company reopened in 1960 in a new location on Alvarado Street (formerly \"The Monterey Theater\") which in 1963 was renamed \"The Old Monterey Opera House\". It continued until the mid-1960s when it fell to urban renewal. In the early 1970s, discussions began about rebuilding back on the wharf itself, and theater plans began to take shape. Ariss and Angelo Di Girolamo began construction on The New Wharf Theater in 1975. The New Wharf Theater opened its doors on December 3, 1976, with a community theater production of \"Guys and Dolls\", directed by Monterey Peninsula College Drama Department chairman, Morgan Stock. At the northwest end of old Fisherman's Wharf, the theater is now known as the Bruce Ariss Wharf Theater.\nIn 2005, the Golden State Theatre, a former movie palace on Alvarado Street, was refurbished to produce live theatrical events. The Forest Theater Guild produced several plays at the Golden State, including \"Aida\", \"Grease\", \"Zoot Suit\", and \"Fiddler on the Roof\". The theater's new owners, Eric and Lori Lochtefeld, have produced several musicals in the theater in conjunction with Broadway By the Bay.\nSports.\nThe Monterey Amberjacks are a professional baseball team that competes in the independent Pecos League which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball. They play their home games at Sollecito Ballpark.\nMonterey Bay FC plays in the USL Championship, the second tier of professional soccer in the US, and plays its home matches at Cardinale Stadium in Seaside, California.\nThe Monterey Peninsula Soccer League is an adult amateur soccer league featuring teams from Monterey and the surrounding region.\nThe PURE Insurance Championship is a gold championship held in Monterey and neighboring Pebble Beach.\nGovernment.\nMonterey is governed by a mayor and four city council members. As of 2025, the mayor is Tyller Williamson and the city council members are Kim Barber, Gino Garcia, Jean Rasch, and Ed Smith.\nThe City of Monterey provides base maintenance support services for the Presidio of Monterey and the Naval Postgraduate School, including streets, parks, and building maintenance. Additional support services include traffic engineering, inspections, construction engineering and project management. This innovative partnership has become known as the \"Monterey Model\" and is now being adopted by communities across the country. This service reduces maintenance costs by millions of dollars and supports a continued military presence in Monterey.\nThe city government's Recreation and Community Services department runs the Monterey Sports Center.\nCounty, state, and federal representatives.\nMonterey is represented on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors by Supervisor Mary Adams.\nIn the California State Legislature, Monterey is in the senatorial district, represented by Democrat John Laird, and the Assembly district, represented by Democrat Dawn Addis.\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Monterey is part of California's congressional district, represented by Democrat Jimmy Panetta.\nMedia.\nLocal radio stations include KPIG-FM 107.5, KAZU-FM \u2013 90.3 KDON-FM \u2013 102.5, KCDU-FM \u2013 101.7, KWAV-FM \u2013 96.9, KDFG-FM \u2013 103.9, KMBY \u2013 1240 AM, KRML 94.7 FM jazz, and 1610-AM the city information station. Television service for the community comes from the Monterey-Salinas-Santa Cruz designated market area (DMA). Local newspapers include the \"Monterey County Herald\" and the \"Monterey County Weekly\".\nInfrastructure.\nThe city is served by a United States Postal Service post office located on Hartnell Street. The post office opened in 1849 and is said to be the first post office west of the Rockies.\nTransportation.\nThe city is serviced by CA 1, also known as the Cabrillo Highway, as it runs along the coastline of the rest of Monterey Bay to the north and Big Sur to the south. CA 68, also known as the Monterey-Salinas Highway, connects the city to US 101 at Salinas and to Pacific Grove.\nLocal bus service is provided by Monterey-Salinas Transit.\nMonterey Regional Airport connects the city to the large metropolitan areas in California, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada.\nMonterey train station was served until 1971, when Amtrak took over intercity train service and the \"Del Monte\" was discontinued.\nEducation.\nSeveral institutions of higher education in the area: the Defense Language Institute, located on the Presidio of Monterey, California; the Naval Postgraduate School, on the site of a former resort hotel; the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (a graduate school of Middlebury College); and Monterey Peninsula College, part of the California Community Colleges system. The federal institutions (the Defense Language Institute (DLI) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)) are important employers in and strongly associated with the city.\nCalifornia State University, Monterey Bay and the Monterey College of Law are located at the site of the former Fort Ord in neighboring Seaside. CSU Monterey Bay has developed several programs in marine and watershed sciences.\nThe Monterey Peninsula Unified School District operates a high school, a middle school and three elementary schools. Private schools include Santa Catalina School (girls, co-ed elementary and middle school) and Trinity Christian High School (co-ed).\nSister cities.\nMonterey is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

George Washington was unanimously elected for the first of his two terms as president and John Adams became the first vice president. This was the only U.S. presidential election that spanned two calendar years without a contingent election and the first national presidential election in American history.\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, which were ratified in 1781, the United States had no head of state. The executive function of government remained with the legislative similar to countries that use a parliamentary system. Federal power, strictly limited, was reserved to the Congress of the Confederation whose \"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\" was also chair of the Committee of the States which aimed to fulfill a function similar to that of the modern Cabinet.\nThe Constitution created the offices of President and Vice President, fully separating these offices from Congress. The Constitution established an Electoral College, based on each state's congressional representation, in which each elector would cast two votes for two candidates, a procedure modified in 1804 by the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment. States had varying methods for choosing presidential electors. In five states, the state legislature chose electors. The other six chose electors through some form involving a popular vote, though in only two states did the choice depend directly on a statewide vote.\nThe enormously popular Washington was distinguished as the former Commander of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. After he agreed to come out of retirement, he was elected with ease unanimously; Washington did not select a running mate as that concept was not yet developed.\nNo formal political parties existed, though an informally organized consistent difference of opinion had already manifested between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. Thus, the contest for the vice-presidency was open. Thomas Jefferson predicted that a popular Northern leader such as Governor John Hancock of Massachusetts or John Adams, a former minister to Great Britain who had represented Massachusetts in Congress, would be elected vice president. Anti-Federalist leaders such as Patrick Henry, who did not run, and George Clinton, who had opposed ratification of the Constitution, also represented potential choices.\nAll 69 electors present cast one vote for Washington, making his election unanimous. Adams won 34 electoral votes and the vice presidency. The remaining 35 electoral votes were split among 10 candidates, including John Jay, who finished third with nine electoral votes. Three states were ineligible to participate in the election: New York's legislature did not choose electors on time, and North Carolina and Rhode Island had not ratified the constitution yet. Washington was inaugurated in New York City on April 30, 1789, 57 days after the First Congress convened.\nCandidates.\nThough no organized political parties yet existed, political opinion loosely divided between those who had more stridently and enthusiastically endorsed ratification of the Constitution, called Federalists or Cosmopolitans, and Anti-Federalists or Localists who had only more reluctantly, skeptically, or conditionally supported, or who had outright opposed ratification. Both factions supported Washington for president. Limited, primitive political campaigning occurred in states and localities where swaying public opinion might matter. For example, in Maryland, a state with a statewide popular vote, unofficial parties campaigned locally, advertising.\nGeneral election.\nNo nomination process existed at the time of planning, and thus, the framers of the Constitution presumed that Washington would be elected unopposed. For example, Alexander Hamilton spoke for national opinion when in a letter to Washington attempting to persuade him to leave retirement on his farm in Mount Vernon to serve as the first president, he wrote that \"...the point of light in which you stand at home and abroad will make an infinite difference in the respectability in which the government will begin its operations in the alternative of your being or not being the head of state.\"\nAnother uncertainty was the choice for the vice presidency, which contained no definite job description beyond being the president's designated successor and presiding over the Senate. The Constitution stipulated that the position would be awarded to the runner-up in the presidential election. Because Washington was from Virginia, then the largest state, many assumed that electors would choose a vice president from a northern state. In an August 1788 letter, U.S. Minister to France Thomas Jefferson wrote that he considered John Adams and John Hancock, both from Massachusetts, to be the top contenders. Jefferson suggested John Jay, John Rutledge, and Virginian James Madison as other possible candidates. Adams received 34 electoral votes, one short of a majority \u2013 because the Constitution did not require an outright majority in the Electoral College prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to elect a runner-up as vice president, Adams was elected to that post.\nThe outgoing Congress of the Confederation announced the procedure for the election on September 13, 1788, stipulating that all electors must be chosen on the first Wednesday in January (January 7, 1789), and that the electors must assemble to cast their votes for president and vice president on the first Wednesday in February (February 4). However, the states differed in their interpretations of this procedure and of the relevant portions of the new Constitution. New Hampshire and Massachusetts held a popular vote for their presidential electors alongside the elections for their representatives in the new Congress, on December 15 and December 18, respectively. In these two states, the legislatures ultimately chose the electors based on the voting results on the appointed day, January 7. In Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the electors were chosen directly by the popular vote on January 7. In Connecticut, Georgia, and South Carolina, the electors were appointed by the legislature alone on January 7, while in New Jersey the governor and council selected them on that day. The legislature in New York was unable to agree on a method for choosing the electors before January 7, and so the state could not appoint any electors.\nVoter turnout comprised a low single-digit percentage of the adult population. Though all states allowed some rudimentary form of popular vote, only six ratifying states allowed any form of popular vote specifically for presidential electors. In most states only white men, and in many only those who owned property, could vote. Free black men could vote in four Northern states, and women could vote in New Jersey until 1804. In some states, there was a nominal religious test for voting. For example, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the Congregational Church was established, supported by taxes. Voting was hampered by poor communications and infrastructure and the labor demands imposed by farming. Two months passed after the election before the votes were counted and Washington was notified that he had been elected president. Washington spent eight days traveling from Virginia to New York for the inauguration. Congress took twenty-eight days to assemble.\nAs the electors were selected, politics intruded, and the process was not free of rumors and intrigue. For example, Hamilton aimed to ensure that Adams did not inadvertently tie Washington in the electoral vote. Also, Federalists spread rumors that Anti-Federalists plotted to elect Richard Henry Lee or Patrick Henry president, with George Clinton as vice president. However, Clinton received only three electoral votes.\nResults.\nPopular vote.\nSource: \"United States Presidential Elections, 1788-1860: The Official Results\" by Michael J.

Several respected sources, including the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress and the Political Graveyard, show this individual to be James Armstrong of Pennsylvania. However, primary sources, such as the Senate Journal, list only Armstrong's name, not his state. Skeptics observe that Armstrong received his single vote from a Georgia elector. They find this improbable because Armstrong of Pennsylvania was not nationally famous\u2014his public service to that date consisted of being a medical officer during the American Revolution and, at most, a single year as a Pennsylvania judge.\"\nResults by state.\nPopular vote.\nElections in this period were vastly different from modern day presidential elections. The actual presidential candidates were rarely mentioned on tickets and voters were voting for particular electors who were pledged to a particular candidate. There was sometimes confusion as to who the particular elector was actually pledged to. Results are reported as the highest result for an elector for any given faction. For example, if three federalist electors received 100, 50, and 25 votes, federalist electors would be recorded as having 100 votes. Confusion surrounding the way results are reported may lead to discrepancies between the sum of all state results and national results.\nIn Maryland, the state was effectively split into two districts: the western shore and the eastern shore. Five electors were chosen from the western shore and three from the eastern shore. All electors, however, were elected at-large by all Maryland voters.\nIn Delaware, no candidate received the majority of votes, throwing the election to the legislature, who chose the five best-performing elector candidates.\nVirginian electors John Pride and Patrick Henry had previously voted against ratification of the Constitution. John Roane was one of three Clinton Electors.\nThe vote totals of Virginia and Delaware appear to be incomplete. In several states candidates of unknown affiliation received votes.\nElectoral vote.\nSixty-nine electors voted out of a possible 91: Two electors from Maryland and two from Virginia did not vote, the New York State Legislature was deadlocked and the state's 8 electors were not appointed (see below), and North Carolina and Rhode Island with 7 and 3 electoral votes respectively had not yet ratified the Constitution. As per the terms of the unamended constitution, each elector was permitted two votes for president, with a majority of \"the whole number of electors appointed\" necessary to elect a president. Of the 69 participating electors, each cast one vote for Washington, who was elected president. Of the remaining candidates, only Adams, Jay, and Hancock received votes from more than one state; with 34 votes, Adams finished second behind only Washington, and by virtue of which fact was elected vice president.\nSource: \nFailure of New York to appoint electors.\nControl of the bicameral New York State Legislature was divided following ratification of the federal constitution, and lawmakers could not reach an agreement to appoint electors for the forthcoming presidential contest. Federalists, backed by the great landed families and the city commercial interests, were the largest faction in the Senate, the smaller of the two chambers for which roughly a quarter of the state's free white male population was eligible to vote; but in the House of Representatives, with its larger membership and electorate, Anti-federalists representing the middling interests held the majority. The fight to ratify the United States Constitution was still fresh in the memories of the legislators, and the Anti-Federalists were resentful for having been forced by events to accept the constitution without amendments. Bills to govern the selection of electors were proposed in each house and rejected by the other, leading to an impasse. The deadlock still stood on January 7, 1789, the last day for electors to be chosen by the states, and New York thus failed to appoint the eight electors allocated to it by the constitution.\nElectoral college selection.\nThe Constitution, in Article II, Section 1, provided that the state legislatures should decide the manner in which their Electors were chosen. State legislatures chose different methods:\n! Method of choosing electors\n! State(s)\n(a) \"New York's legislature did not choose electors on time.\"\n(b) \"One electoral district failed to choose an elector.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Incumbent President George Washington was elected to a second term by a unanimous vote in the electoral college, while John Adams was reelected as vice president. Washington was essentially unopposed, but Adams faced a competitive re-election against Governor George Clinton of New York.\nElectoral rules of the time required each presidential elector to cast two votes without distinguishing which was for president and which for vice president. The recipient of the most votes would then become president, and the runner-up vice president. The Democratic-Republican Party, which had organized in opposition to the policies of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, supported Clinton for the position of vice president. Adams, meanwhile, was backed by the Federalist Party in his bid for another term. Neither party had fully organized, and partisan divisions had not yet solidified.\nWashington received 132 electoral votes, one from each elector. Adams won 77 electoral votes, enough to win re-election. Clinton finished in third place with 50 electoral votes, taking his home state of New York as well as three Southern states. Two other candidates won the five remaining electoral votes. This election was the first in which each of the original 13 states appointed electors, as did the newly added states of Kentucky and Vermont.\nCandidates.\nIn 1792, presidential elections were still conducted according to the original method established under the U.S. Constitution. Under this system, each elector cast two votes: the candidate who received the greatest number of votes (so long as they won a majority) became president, while the runner-up became vice president. The Twelfth Amendment would eventually replace this system, requiring electors to cast one vote for president and one vote for vice president, but this change did not take effect until 1804. Because of this, it is difficult to use modern-day terminology to describe the relationship among the candidates in this election.\nWashington is generally held by historians to have run unopposed. Indeed, the incumbent president enjoyed bipartisan support and received one vote from every elector. The choice for vice president was more divisive. The Federalist Party threw its support behind the incumbent vice president, John Adams of Massachusetts, while the Democratic-Republican Party backed the candidacy of New York Governor George Clinton. Because few doubted that Washington would receive the greatest number of votes, Adams and Clinton were effectively competing for the vice presidency; under the letter of the law, however, they were technically candidates for president competing against Washington.\nDemocratic-Republican nomination.\nBorn out of the Anti-Federalist faction that had opposed the Constitution in 1788, the Democratic-Republican Party was the main opposition to the agenda of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. They had no chance of unseating Washington, but hoped to win the vice presidency by defeating the incumbent, Adams. Many Democratic-Republicans would have preferred to nominate Thomas Jefferson, their ideological leader and Washington's Secretary of State. However, this would have cost them the state of Virginia, as electors were not permitted to vote for two candidates from their home state and Washington was also a Virginian. Clinton, the Governor of New York and a former anti-Federalist leader, became the party's nominee after he won the backing of Jefferson and James Madison. Clinton was from an electorally important swing state, and he convinced party leaders that he would be a stronger candidate than another New Yorker, Senator Aaron Burr. A group of Democratic-Republican leaders met in Philadelphia in October 1792 and selected Clinton as the party's vice presidential candidate.\nCampaign.\nBy 1792, a party division had emerged between Federalists led by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who desired a stronger federal government with a leading role in the economy, and the Democratic-Republicans led by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Representative James Madison of Virginia, who favored states' rights and opposed Hamilton's economic program. Madison was at first a Federalist until he opposed the establishment of Hamilton's First Bank of the United States in 1791. He formed the Democratic-Republican Party along with Anti-Federalist Thomas Jefferson in 1792.\nThe elections of 1792 were the first ones in the United States to be contested on anything resembling a partisan basis. In most states, the congressional elections were recognized in some sense as a \"struggle between the Treasury department and the republican interest,\" to use the words of Jefferson strategist John Beckley. In New York, the race for governor was fought along these lines. The candidates were Chief Justice John Jay, a Hamiltonian, and incumbent George Clinton, the party's vice presidential nominee.\nAlthough Washington had been considering retiring, both sides encouraged him to remain in office to bridge factional differences. Washington was supported by practically all sides throughout his presidency and gained more popularity with the passage of the Bill of Rights. However, the Democratic-Republicans and the Federalists contested the vice-presidency, with incumbent John Adams as the Federalist nominee and George Clinton as the Democratic-Republican nominee. Federalists attacked Clinton for his past association with the anti-Federalists. Adams easily secured re-election.\nResults.\nWashington was re-elected unanimously, receiving one vote from each of the 132 participating electors. Adams received votes from 77 electors and Clinton 50; the four electors from Kentucky voted for Thomas Jefferson, and one South Carolina elector voted for Aaron Burr. The distribution of the electoral vote between the four runners-up showed a high degree of party discipline, with only two electors voting contrary to the majority in their state. Adams received the support of New England, South Carolina, and the Mid-Atlantic states (excepting New York), while Clinton carried New York and most of the South. Adams as the second-place finisher was elected vice president, serving until his election to the presidency in 1797; each of his three rivals would go on to serve as vice president in turn, Jefferson from 1797 to 1801 (when he alike succeeded to the presidency), Burr from 1801 to 1805, and Clinton from 1805 until his death in 1812.\nNine of the 15 states eligible to choose representatives to the electoral college did so by a vote of the state legislature; the remaining six employed some form of popular vote. Of these, complete returns from Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania survive; surviving returns from Virginia are incomplete, and popular vote records from Kentucky are not known to exist. Of the states with complete returns, only Pennsylvania saw real partisan competition; a Federalist electoral slate pledged to Washington and Adams was selected, although one elector voted for Washington and Clinton. At the time, party organizations were still in their infancy, and the partisan allegiance of the candidates was not always evident: it is therefore difficult to say whether the Pennsylvania vote for Clinton was an instance of a faithless elector, or an elector voting as pledged.\nElectoral vote.\n(a) \"Only 6 of the 15 states chose electors by any form of popular vote, while pre-Twelfth Amendment electoral vote rules obscure the intentions of the voters, and those states that did choose electors by popular vote restricted the vote via property requirements.\"&lt;br&gt;\n(b) \"Two electors from Maryland and one elector from Vermont did not cast votes.\"\nPopular vote.\nSource (Popular Vote): \"A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787-1825\"\n(a) \"Only 6 of the 15 states chose electors by any form of popular vote.\"&lt;br&gt;\n(b) \"Pre-Twelfth Amendment electoral vote rules obscure the intentions of the voters\"&lt;br&gt;\n(c) \"Those states that did choose electors by popular vote had widely varying restrictions on suffrage via property requirements.\"&lt;br&gt;\n(d) \"Returns for several states are incomplete.\"\nPopular vote by state.\nElections in this period were vastly different from modern day presidential elections. The actual presidential candidates were rarely mentioned on tickets and voters were voting for particular electors who were pledged to a particular candidate. There was sometimes confusion as to who the particular elector was actually pledged to. Results are reported as the highest result for an elector for any given faction. For example, if three Federalist electors received 100, 50, and 25 votes, Federalist electors would be recorded as having 100 votes. Confusion surrounding the way results are reported may lead to discrepancies between the sum of all state results and national results.\nIn Massachusetts, the best performing elector candidate for the Eastern District, Thomas Rice, was not selected by the Massachusetts General Court to be an elector. Rice was a Federalist and his returns have been included into the state total below instead of the second best performing elector candidate.\nThe totals for Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Virginia appear to be incomplete. In several states candidates of unknown affiliation received votes.\nElectoral votes by state.\nThe states chose 135 electors, out of whom 132 cast ballots. (Two electors from Maryland and one from Vermont were absent and did not vote.) As per the terms of the unamended constitution, each elector was permitted two votes for president, with a majority of \"the whole number of electors appointed\" necessary to elect a president. Each of the participating electors cast one vote for Washington, who was elected president. The electors were split on their second choice: Adams received 77 votes to Clinton's 50, enough to secure a second-place finish behind Washington and the vice presidency.\nSource: \"A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787-1825\"\nElectoral college selection.\nThe Constitution, in Article II, Section 1, provided that the state legislatures should decide the manner in which their Electors were chosen.

It was the first contested American presidential election, the first presidential election in which political parties played a dominant role, and the only presidential election in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing tickets. Incumbent vice president John Adams of the Federalist Party defeated former secretary of state Thomas Jefferson of the Democratic-Republican Party.\nWith incumbent president George Washington having refused a third term in office, the 1796 election became the first U.S. presidential election in which political parties competed for the presidency. The Federalists coalesced behind Adams and the Democratic-Republicans supported Jefferson, but each party ran multiple candidates. Under the electoral rules in place prior to the Twelfth Amendment, the members of the Electoral College each cast two votes, with no distinction made between electoral votes for president and electoral votes for vice president. The individual with the votes of a majority of electors became president, and the runner-up became vice president. If there was a tie for first place or no person won a majority, the House of Representatives would hold a contingent election. Also, if there were a tie for second place, the vice presidency, the Senate would hold a contingent election to break the tie.\nThe campaign was a bitter one, with Federalists attempting to identify the Democratic-Republicans with the violence of the French Revolution and the Democratic-Republicans accusing the Federalists of favoring monarchism and aristocracy. Republicans sought to associate Adams with the policies developed by fellow Federalist Alexander Hamilton during the Washington administration, which they declaimed were too much in favor of Great Britain and a centralized national government. In foreign policy, Republicans denounced the Federalists over the Jay Treaty, which had established a temporary peace with Great Britain. Federalists attacked Jefferson's moral character, alleging he was an atheist and that he had been a coward during the American Revolutionary War. Adams's supporters also accused Jefferson of being too pro-France; the accusation was underscored when the French ambassador embarrassed the Republicans by publicly backing Jefferson and attacking the Federalists right before the election. Despite the hostility between their respective camps, neither Adams nor Jefferson actively campaigned for the presidency.\nAdams was elected president with 71 electoral votes, one more than was needed for a majority. He won by sweeping the electoral votes of New England and winning votes from several other swing states, especially the states of the Mid-Atlantic region. Jefferson received 68 electoral votes and was elected vice president. Former governor Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina, a Federalist, finished with 59 electoral votes, while Senator Aaron Burr, a Democratic-Republican from New York, won 30 electoral votes. The remaining 48 electoral votes were dispersed among nine other candidates. Several electors cast one vote for a Federalist candidate and one for a Democratic-Republican. The election marked the formation of the First Party System, and established a rivalry between Federalist New England and the Democratic-Republican South, with the middle states holding the balance of power (New York and Maryland were the crucial swing states, and between them only voted for a loser once between 1789 and 1820).\nCandidates.\nWith Washington retiring after two terms, both parties sought the presidency for the first time. Before the ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, each elector was to vote for two persons but was not able to indicate which vote was for president and which for vice president. Instead, the recipient of the most electoral votes would become president and the runner-up vice president. As a result, both parties ran multiple candidates for president, in hopes of keeping one of their opponents from being the runner-up. These candidates were the equivalent of modern-day running mates, but under the law, they were all candidates for president. Thus, both Adams and Jefferson were technically opposed by several members of their own parties. The plan was for one of the electors to cast a vote for the main party nominee (Adams or Jefferson) and a candidate besides the primary running mate, thus ensuring that the main nominee would have one more vote than his running mate.\nFederalist candidates.\nThe Federalists' nominee was John Adams of Massachusetts, the incumbent vice president and a leading voice during the Revolutionary period. Most Federalist leaders viewed Adams, who had twice been elected vice president, as Washington's natural heir. Adams's main running mate was Thomas Pinckney, a former governor of South Carolina who had negotiated the Treaty of San Lorenzo with Spain. Pinckney agreed to run after the first choice of many party leaders, former governor Patrick Henry of Virginia, declined. Alexander Hamilton, who competed with Adams for leadership of the party, worked behind the scenes to elect Pinckney over Adams by convincing Jefferson electors from South Carolina to cast their second votes for Pinckney. Hamilton did prefer Adams to Jefferson, and urged Federalist electors to cast their votes for Adams and Pinckney.\nDemocratic-Republican candidates.\nThe Democratic-Republicans united behind former secretary of state Thomas Jefferson, who had co-founded the party with James Madison and others in opposition to Hamilton's policies. Congressional Democratic-Republicans sought to also unite behind one vice-presidential nominee. With Jefferson's popularity strongest in the South, many party leaders wanted a Northern candidate as Jefferson's running mate. Popular choices included Senator Pierce Butler of South Carolina and three New Yorkers: Senator Aaron Burr, Chancellor Robert R. Livingston, and former governor George Clinton. A group of Democratic-Republican leaders met in June 1796 and agreed to support Jefferson for president and Burr for vice president.\nResults.\nTennessee was admitted into the United States after the 1792 election, increasing the Electoral College to 138 electors.\nUnder the system in place before the 1804 ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, electors were to cast votes for two persons for president; the runner-up in the presidential race was elected vice president. If no candidate won votes from a majority of the Electoral College, the House of Representatives would hold a contingent election to select the winner. Each party intended to manipulate the results by having some of their electors cast one vote for the intended presidential candidate and one vote for someone besides the intended vice-presidential candidate, leaving their vice-presidential candidate a few votes shy of their presidential candidate. But all electoral votes were cast on the same day, and communications between states were extremely slow at that time, making it very difficult to coordinate which electors were to manipulate their vote for vice president. Additionally, there were rumors that Hamilton had coerced southern electors pledged to Jefferson to give their second vote to Pinckney in hope of electing him president instead of Adams.\nCampaigning centered in the swing states of New York and Pennsylvania. Adams and Jefferson won a combined 139 electoral votes from the 138 members of the Electoral College. The Federalists swept every state north of the Mason\u2013Dixon line except Pennsylvania, though one Pennsylvania elector voted for Adams. The Democratic-Republicans won the votes of most Southern electors, but the electors of Maryland and Delaware gave a majority of their votes to Federalist candidates, while North Carolina and Virginia each gave Adams one electoral vote.\nNationwide, most electors voted for Adams and a second Federalist or for Jefferson and a second Democratic-Republican, but there were several exceptions to this. One elector in Maryland voted for both Adams and Jefferson, and two electors cast votes for Washington, who had not campaigned and was not formally affiliated with either party. Pinckney won the second votes from most of the electors who voted for Adams, but 21 electors from New England and Maryland cast their second votes for other candidates, including Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth. Those who voted for Jefferson were significantly less united in their second choice, though Burr won a plurality of the Jefferson electors. All eight electors in Pinckney's home state of South Carolina, as well as at least one Pennsylvania elector, cast their ballots for Jefferson and Pinckney. In North Carolina, Jefferson won 11 votes, but the remaining 13 were spread among six different candidates from both parties. In Virginia, most electors voted for Jefferson and Governor Samuel Adams of Massachusetts.\nThe result was that Adams received 71 electoral votes, one more than required to be elected president. If any two of the three Adams electors in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina had voted with the rest of their states, it would have flipped the election. Jefferson received 68 votes, nine more than Pinckney, and was elected vice president. Burr finished in a distant fourth place with 30 votes. Nine other candidates received the remaining 48 electoral votes. If Pinckney had won the second votes of all of the New England electors who voted for Adams, he would have been elected president over Adams and Jefferson.\nSource (Popular Vote): Source (Popular Vote): A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787-1825Source (Electoral Vote): \n(a) \"Votes for Federalist electors have been assigned to John Adams and votes for Democratic-Republican electors have been assigned to Thomas Jefferson.\"(b) \"Only 9 of the 16 states used any form of popular vote.\"(c) \"Those states that did choose electors by popular vote had widely varying restrictions on suffrage via property requirements.\"\nElectoral votes by state.\nAs per the terms of the unamended constitution, each elector was permitted two votes for president, with a majority of \"the whole number of electors appointed\" necessary to elect a president.

With both parties' electors divided on their choice of a vice president, Jefferson finished second in the electoral vote ahead of Adams' intended running mate, Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina, making him vice president-elect.\nSource: \"A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787-1825\"\nPopular vote by state.\nCompiling reliable popular vote statistics for elections of the First Party System poses a challenge to historians. Election procedures of the late 18th century differed greatly from those of later campaigns: rather than vote for a presidential candidate, voters chose from candidates running to represent their state in the electoral college. Candidates for elector did not always advertise a party preference or even for whom they intended to vote; in some districts, candidates from the same party were in direct competition, while in others, inconsistent support for all candidates of a party led states to split their electoral votes. These conditions make it difficult or impossible to determine voter intent in some cases. Moreover, some states' returns have not survived to the present day, meaning that national popular vote totals in this article are necessarily incomplete.\nThe table below calculates each state's popular vote by comparing the vote for the most popular Adams elector to that for the most popular Jefferson elector.\nIn Massachusetts, the best performing elector candidates for the First Western and Second Middle Districts, Simon Larned and James Winthrop respectively, were not selected by the Massachusetts General Court to be electors. Larned was a Democratic-Republican and Winthrop was a former Anti-Federalist.\nThe totals for Massachusetts and Virginia appear to be incomplete. In several states candidates of unknown affiliation received votes.\nSources: \"A New Nation Votes\"; Dubin, p.\u00a06-8.\nClose states.\nStates where the margin of victory was under 1% (15 electoral votes):\nStates where the margin of victory was under 5% (11 electoral votes):\nConsequences.\nThe following four years were the only time that the president and vice president were from different parties. John Quincy Adams and John C. Calhoun were later elected president and vice-president as political opponents, but they were both Democratic-Republicans, and while Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's second vice-president, was a Democrat, Lincoln ran on a combined National Union Party ticket in 1864, not as a strict Republican.\nOn January 6, 1797, Representative William L. Smith of South Carolina presented a resolution on the floor of the House of Representatives for an amendment to the Constitution by which the presidential electors would designate which candidate would be president and which vice president. No action was taken on his proposal, setting the stage for the deadlocked election of 1800.\nThis is also the first of only two elections so far in the life of the Republic which elected a presidential term of only 1,460 days rather than 1,461 days (the second was in 1896). This is because of the Gregorian calendar rule that years ending in \u201c00\u201d but not divisible by 400, are not leap years.\nForeign influence.\nThe French foreign minister, Charles Delacroix, wrote that France \"must raise up the [American] people and at the same time conceal the lever by which we do so... I propose... to send orders and instructions to our minister plenipotentiary at Philadelphia to use all means in his power to bring about a successful revolution, and [George] Washington's replacement.\" The French minister (ambassador) to the United States, Pierre Adet, openly supported the Democratic-Republican Party and its presidential nominee, Thomas Jefferson, while attacking the Federalist Party and its presidential nominee, John Adams.\nThe foreign intrigue France perpetrated was unsuccessful, as Adams won the election with an electoral vote count of 71\u201368. A significant factor in thwarting the French efforts was George Washington's Farewell Address, which condemned foreign meddling in America.\nElectoral college selection.\nThe Constitution, in Article II, Section 1, provided that the state legislatures should decide the manner in which their Electors were chosen.

In what is sometimes called the \"Revolution of 1800\", the Democratic-Republican Party candidate, Vice President Thomas Jefferson, defeated the Federalist Party candidate and incumbent, President John Adams in the second peaceful transfer of power in the history of the United States, creating a political realignment that ushered in a generation of Democratic-Republican leadership. This was the first presidential election in U.S. history to be a rematch, the first election where an incumbent president lost re-election, leading to the first time in modern history where a national government changed hands peaceably following a free election.\nAdams had narrowly defeated Jefferson in the 1796 election. Under the rules of the electoral system in place before the 1804 ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, each member of the Electoral College cast two votes, with no distinction made between electoral votes for president and electoral votes for vice president. As Jefferson received the second-most votes in 1796, he was elected vice president. In 1800, unlike in 1796, both parties formally nominated tickets. The Democratic-Republicans nominated a ticket consisting of Jefferson and Aaron Burr, while the Federalists nominated a ticket consisting of Adams and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Each party formed a plan by which one of their respective electors would vote for a third candidate or abstain so that its preferred presidential candidate (Adams for the Federalists and Jefferson for the Democratic-Republicans) would win one more vote than the party's other nominee.\nThe chief political issues revolved around the fallout from the French Revolution and the Quasi-War. The Federalists favored a strong central government and close relations with Great Britain. The Democratic-Republicans favored decentralization to the state governments, and the party attacked the taxes the Federalists imposed. The Democratic-Republicans also denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts, which the Federalists had passed to make it harder for immigrants to become citizens and to restrict statements critical of the federal government. The Democratic-Republicans were well organized at the state and local levels, while the Federalists were disorganized and suffered a bitter split between their two major leaders, Adams and Alexander Hamilton. According to historian John Ferling, the jockeying for electoral votes, regional divisions, and the propaganda smear campaigns created by both parties made the election recognizably modern.\nAt the end of a long and bitter campaign, Jefferson and Burr each won 73 electoral votes, Adams won 65, and Pinckney won 64. The Federalists swept New England, the Democratic-Republicans dominated the South, and the parties split the Mid-Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The Democratic-Republicans' assumption that one or more electors in Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, Georgia, Kentucky, or Tennessee would vote for Jefferson and not Burr resulted in a tie, known as the Burr dilemma. It necessitated a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Under the terms laid out in the Constitution, the outgoing House of Representatives chose between Jefferson and Burr. Burr was accused of campaigning for the presidency himself in the contingent election despite being a member of Jefferson's party. Each state delegation cast one vote, and a victory in the contingent election required one candidate to win a majority of the state delegations. Neither Burr nor Jefferson was able to win on the first 35 ballots of the contingent election, as most Federalist representatives backed Burr and all Democratic-Republican representatives backed Jefferson. Hamilton favored Jefferson over Burr, and he convinced several Federalists to switch their support to Jefferson, giving Jefferson a victory on the 36th ballot. Jefferson became the second consecutive incumbent vice president to be elected president. This is one of two presidential elections (along with the 1824 election) that have been decided in the House.\nCandidates.\nBoth parties used congressional nominating caucuses to formally nominate tickets for the first time. The Federalists nominated a ticket consisting of incumbent President John Adams of Massachusetts and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina. Pinckney had fought in the American Revolutionary War and later served as the minister to France. The Democratic-Republicans nominated a ticket consisting of Vice President Thomas Jefferson of Virginia and former Senator Aaron Burr of New York. Jefferson had been the runner-up in the previous election and had co-founded the party with James Madison and others, while Burr was popular in the electorally important state of New York.\nGeneral election.\nCampaign.\nWhile the 1800 election was a re-match of the 1796 election, it ushered in a new type of American politics, a two-party republic and acrimonious campaigning behind the scenes and through the press. On top of this, the election pitted the \"larger than life\" Adams and Jefferson, who were formerly close allies turned political enemies.\nThe campaign was bitter and characterized by slander and personal attacks on both sides. Federalists spread rumors that the Democratic-Republicans were radical atheists who would ruin the country (based on the Democratic-Republican support for the French Revolution). In 1798, George Washington had complained \"that you could as soon scrub the blackamoor white, as to change the principles of a professed Democrat; and that he will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the Government of this Country\". Meanwhile, the Democratic-Republicans accused Federalists of subverting republican principles with the Alien and Sedition Acts. They also accused Federalists of favoring Britain in its war with France in order to promote aristocratic, anti-democratic values.\nIdeology played a central role with a Jeffersonian \"left\" supporting the French Revolution, versus a Federalist \"right\" opposing it. According to historian Peter R. Henriques, \"Federalists tilted to the right; Republicans, to the left.\" He quotes a Federalist editor who summarized the Federalist rhetoric: You who are for French notions of government; for the tempestuous sea of anarchy and misrule; for arming the poor against the rich; for fraternizing with the foes of God and man; go to the left and support the leaders, or dupes of the anti-federal junto. But you that are sober, industrious, thriving, and happy, give your votes for those men who mean to preserve the union of the states, the purity and vigor of our excellent constitution, the sacred majesty of the laws, and the holy ordinances of religion.\nAdams versus Hamilton.\nAdams was attacked by both the opposition Democratic-Republicans and a group of so-called \"High Federalists\" aligned with Alexander Hamilton. The Democratic-Republicans felt that the Adams foreign policy was too favorable toward Britain; feared that the new army called up for the Quasi-War would oppress the people; opposed new taxes to pay for war; and attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts as violations of states' rights and the Constitution. \"High Federalists\" considered Adams too moderate and would have preferred the leadership of Alexander Hamilton instead.\nHamilton had apparently grown impatient with Adams and wanted a new president who was more receptive to his goals. During Washington's presidency, Hamilton had been able to influence the federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion (which threatened the government's power to tax citizens). When Washington announced that he would not seek a third term, the Federalists and Adams regarded himself as next-in-line.\nHamilton appears to have hoped in 1796 that his influence within an Adams administration would be as great as or greater than in Washington's. By 1800, Hamilton had come to realize that Adams was too independent and thought the Federalist vice presidential candidate, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, more suited to serving Hamilton's interests. In his third sabotage attempt toward Adams, Hamilton quietly schemed to elect Pinckney to the presidency. Given Pinckney's lack of political experience, he would have been expected to be open to Hamilton's influence. However, Hamilton's plan backfired and hurt the Federalist party, particularly after one of his letters, a scathing criticism of Adams that was fifty-four pages long, fell into the hands of a Democratic-Republican and soon after became public. It embarrassed Adams and damaged Hamilton's efforts on behalf of Pinckney, not to mention speeding Hamilton's own political decline.\nThe contemporarily unorthodox public campaigning methods employed in 1800 were first employed by Jefferson's running mate and campaign manager, Aaron Burr, who is credited by some historians with inventing the modern electioneering process. Yet, throughout this entire process, the candidates themselves were conspicuously missing from the campaigning, at least publicly, due to fears that they may otherwise be tagged as \"demagogues\". Even a visit John Adams made to Washington was made into a public point of contention.\nSelection method changes.\nPartisans on both sides sought any advantage they could find. In several states, this included changing the process of selecting electors to ensure the desired result. In Georgia, Democratic-Republican legislators replaced the popular vote with selection by the state legislature. In Virginia, the Democratic-Republican-controlled legislature switched from electoral districts to a general ticket, a winner-take-all system. Federalist legislators also switched methods, switching from districts and general tickets to legislature votes in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively.\nIn Pennsylvania, the General Assembly was split, with the Democratic-Republican-dominated House wishing to retain the general ticket and the Federalist-controlled Senate wishing to return to the district system, hoping to win at least some electoral votes. Eventually, this deadlock was broken by a last-minute compromise between the chambers that gave the Democratic-Republican eight electors and the Federalists seven.\nIn New York, the rejection to change the selection method backfired on the Federalists. In March 1800, two months before the assembly elections, the Democratic-Republicans attempted to pass a bill that would switch from a legislature vote to electoral districts, hoping they would secure at least a third of the state's seats. The Federalists defeated the measure, believing that they would win control of both chambers and award all of the state's electoral votes to the Federalist nominees. However, in the April state elections, Aaron Burr's effective mobilization of the vote in New York City led to a reversal of the Federalist majority in the state legislature, providing crucial support for the Democratic-Republican ticket.\nIn response to the Federalist defeat, Hamilton attempted to get Governor John Jay to call a special session of the outgoing Federalist-dominated New York legislature. Hamilton's plan was for the outgoing assembly to pass legislation that would establish the popular election of electors through electoral districts, a strategy almost certain to secure nine or ten of the twelve elector slots for the Federalists. Jay refused to participate in such an underhanded scheme.\nThe Federalist legislature in Connecticut did not change the method of voting but instead passed a \"stand up\" election law, mandating that all votes be cast publicly and orally, an intimidating procedure that ordinarily favored those in power.\nVoting.\nBecause each state could choose its own day to elect its electors in 1800, before Election Day on December 3, when electors \"meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves\" in accordance with the Constitution, the voting lasted from October to December. As election day neared, the election was too close to call. The last state to vote, South Carolina, chose its electors on December 2, and would become key to determining the election. The state elections in mid-October had produced an assembly that was about evenly divided between committed Federalists and Republicans, with 16 unaffiliated representatives who were all strongly pro-Jefferson. Many of the elected Jeffersonians were also supporters of Pinckney, the revered native son of the state. If South Carolina's electors gave their votes to Jefferson and Pinckney, then Pinckney would place an electoral vote behind Jefferson, becoming the vice president.\nHowever, Pinckney stayed loyal to the instructions of his party's caucus and was adamant that any elector who voted for him must also vote for Adams. With uncommitted legislators not willing to desert Jefferson and Pinckney unwilling to abandon Adams, the uncommitted legislators eventually reluctantly agreed to support Burr.\nUnder the United States Constitution as it then stood, each elector cast two votes, and the candidate with a majority of the votes was elected president, with the vice presidency going to the runner-up. The Federalists therefore arranged for one of their Rhode Island electors to vote for John Jay instead of Charles Pinckney to prevent the election from resulting in a tie. A letter to Jefferson from Peter Freneau assured him that a member of the Republican delegation from South Carolina would vote for George Clinton instead of Aaron Burr and a report from Georgia indicated that two of its electors would deny Burr their votes. However, this information proved faulty. Thus, all of the Democratic-Republican electors cast their votes for both Jefferson and Burr, 73 in all for each of them. According to a provision of the United States Constitution, a tie in a case of this type had to be resolved by the House of Representatives, with each state casting one vote. Although the congressional election of 1800 turned over majority control of the House of Representatives to the Democratic-Republicans by 68 seats to 38, the presidential election had to be decided by the outgoing House that had been elected in the congressional election of 1798 (at that time, the new presidential and congressional terms all started on March 4 of the year after a national election). In the outgoing House, the Federalists retained a majority of 60 seats to 46.\nDisputes.\nDefective certificate.\nWhen the electoral ballots were opened and counted on February 11, 1801, the certificate of election from Georgia was different than the others. Georgia had sent the original oral ballot. In 2004, David Fontana and Bruce Ackerman asserted that Georgia's certificate did not take the constitutionally mandated form of a \"List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each\". They claimed that Vice President Jefferson, who was presiding over the counting of electoral votes in his role as President of the Senate, immediately counted the votes from Georgia as votes for Jefferson and Burr, though they observed that \"no objections were raised\". If the Georgia ballots had been rejected based on these supposed irregularities, Jefferson and Burr would have been left with 69 votes each, or one short of the 70 votes required for a majority, meaning a contingent election would have been required between the top five finishers (Jefferson, Burr, incumbent president John Adams, Charles C. Pinckney, and John Jay) in the House of Representatives. With these votes, the total number of votes for Jefferson and Burr was 73, which gave them a majority of the total, but they were tied.\nHolly Brewer, a legal historian, argued that the counting of the Georgia ballot did not support Ackerman and Fontana's theory. Brewer contends that the ballot did in fact comply with constitutional requirements, since it contained a list of all four electoral college votes for both Jefferson and Burr respectively (and only them); the constitutionally required certification language was contained on the outside of the envelope; and the ballot was not understood to be irregular under the election practices of the day. Brewer's arguments helped to influence Vice President Pence's decision to reject the theory that he had such powers, via Judge J. Michael Luttig.\nResults.\nJefferson and Burr carried every state that had supported the Democratic-Republicans in 1796, made gains in Maryland, and picked up Burr's home state of New York. In the six states choosing electors by some form of popular vote, they won a landslide over Adams and Pinckney, polling 15,846 more votes than the Federalist ticket. Adams made gains in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, but these votes were not enough to offset the Democratic-Republican gains elsewhere. Of the 155 counties and independent cities making returns, Jefferson and Burr won in 115 (74.19%), whereas the Adams ticket carried 40 (25.81%). This was the last time that Vermont voted for the Federalists and the last time a Federalist won electoral votes from Pennsylvania. This was the first of two elections contested between people who would at some point serve as Vice President, the other being 1968.\nSource (Popular Vote): \"A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787\u20131825\"Source (Electoral Vote): \n(a) \"Votes for Federalist electors have been assigned to John Adams and votes for Democratic-Republican electors have been assigned to Thomas Jefferson.\"(b) \"Only 6 of the 16 states chose electors by any form of popular vote.\"(c) \"Those states that did choose electors by popular vote had widely varying restrictions on suffrage via property requirements.\"(d) \"Eight votes were cast for electors pledged to both Adams and Jefferson; 2 votes were cast for electors of unknown affiliation.\"\nElectoral College vote by state.\nSource: \nResults by state.\nOf the 16 states that took part in the 1800 election, six (Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia) used some kind of popular vote. In Rhode Island and Virginia, voters elected their state's entire Electoral College delegation at large; Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee all used some variation of single-member districts. In the rest, electors were chosen by the state legislature. Not until the 1836 presidential election would all states have direct popular selection of electors (except South Carolina, which had its state legislature vote for electors until 1868). Popular vote records for several states are incomplete, and the returns from Kentucky and Tennessee appear to have been lost; states did not print or issue electoral ballots, and most were issued by newspapers that supported a particular party or candidate. Newspapers are also the main source of voting records in the early 19th century, and frontier states such as Tennessee had few in operation, without any known surviving examples. Below are the surviving popular vote figures as published in \"A New Nation Votes.\"\nDistrict results.\nKentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee chose each of their electors from specially-drawn single-member districts, the results from which are as follows.\nClose states and districts.\nStates and districts where the margin of victory was under 1%:\nStates and districts where the margin of victory was under 5%:\nStates and districts where the margin of victory was under 10%:\n1801 contingent election.\nIn February 1801, the members of the House of Representatives balloted as states to determine whether Jefferson or Burr would become president. There were sixteen states, each with one vote; an absolute majority of nine was required for victory. It was the outgoing House of Representatives, controlled by the Federalist Party, that was charged with electing the new president. Jefferson was the great enemy of the Federalists, and a faction of Federalist representatives tried to block him and elect Burr. Most Federalists voted for Burr, giving Burr six of the eight states controlled by Federalists. The seven delegations controlled by Democratic-Republicans all voted for Jefferson, and Georgia's sole Federalist representative also voted for him, giving him eight states. The Vermont delegation was evenly split and cast a blank ballot. The remaining state, Maryland, had five Federalist representatives to three Democratic-Republicans; one of its Federalist representatives voted for Jefferson, forcing that state delegation also to cast a blank ballot.\nPublicly, Burr remained quiet between mid-December 1800 and mid-February 1801, when the electoral votes were counted. Behind the scenes, he faced mounting pressure from within the party to step aside if he and Jefferson should tie in electoral votes. However, there was confusion as to whether or not Burr could simply concede the presidency to Jefferson and become vice-president, or whether he would have been forced to withdraw entirely and allow one of the Federalist candidates to become vice-president, as the Constitution was unclear on the matter. Regardless, he refused to disavow the presidency, writing in December 1800 to Representative Samuel Smith (R-MD) that he would not \"engage to resign\" if chosen president, adding that the question was \"unnecessary, unreasonable and impertinent\". Rumors circulated that Representative James A. Bayard (F-DE) had\u2014purportedly in Burr's name\u2014approached Smith and Edward Livingston (R-NY) with offers of political appointments if they voted for Burr.\nTrue or not, House Democratic-Republicans, who from the start of the 1800 campaign viewed Jefferson as their candidate for president and Burr for vice president, faced two abhorrent possible outcomes when the House met to vote: the Federalists could engineer a victory for Burr; or the Federalists could refuse to break the deadlock, leaving Federalist Secretary of State John Marshall as Acting President. Neither came to pass, however, chiefly due to Hamilton's energetic opposition to Burr. Hamilton embarked on a frenzied letter-writing campaign to get Federalist Representatives to switch votes. He urged the Federalists to support Jefferson because he was \"by far not so dangerous a man\" as Burr; in short, he would much rather have someone with wrong principles than someone devoid of any.\nFrom February 11 to 17, the House cast a total of 35 ballots; each time eight state delegations voted for Jefferson, one short of the necessary majority of nine.\nOn February 17, on the 36th ballot, Bayard changed his vote from Burr to no selection, joined by his allies in Maryland and Vermont. This changed the Maryland and Vermont votes from no selection to Jefferson, giving him the votes of 10 states and the presidency. The four representatives present from South Carolina, all Federalists, also changed their 3\u20131 selection of Burr to four abstentions.\nDue to the experiences of this and the previous election, sentiment for a new way of selecting the president and vice president rose significantly, resulting in the Twelfth Amendment.\nResults.\n(a) The votes of the representatives is typical and may have fluctuated from ballot to ballot, but the result for each state did not change.\n(b) Even though Georgia had two representatives apportioned, one seat was vacant due to the death of James Jones.\n(c) Even though South Carolina had six representatives apportioned, Thomas Sumter was absent due to illness, and Abraham Nott departed for South Carolina between the first and final ballots.\nElectoral College selection.\nThe Constitution, in Article II, Section 1, provided that the state legislatures should decide the manner in which their electors were chosen. Different state legislatures chose different methods:\n! Method of choosing electors\n! State(s)\nState is divided into two electoral districts and half the electors are chosen from each district.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 2015 musical \"Hamilton\" by Lin Manuel Miranda, the contest between Jefferson and Burr is recounted in \"The Election of 1800\". The song focuses on Alexander Hamilton's role in deciding the outcome of the 1801 contingent election. The musical simplifies the complicated multiple elections somewhat, portraying Adams's unpopularity as making the real choice between Jefferson and Burr. Historians wrote that Adams did not lose that badly in the original election, with the musical inflating the size of Jefferson's victory. It implies Hamilton's support for Jefferson over Burr was the catalyst for the Burr\u2013Hamilton duel; in fact, while that helped sour relations between Burr and Hamilton, the duel was ultimately provoked by Hamilton's statements about Burr in the 1804 New York gubernatorial election.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nInline references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40455", "revid": "51063410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40455", "title": "Monterrey", "text": "Monterrey (; ; is the capital and largest city of the northeastern Mexican state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. The city anchors the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second-largest metropolitan area in Mexico, after Greater Mexico City with a population of 5,341,171 people as of 2020 and it is also the second-most productive metropolitan area in Mexico with a GDP (PPP) of US$140 billion in 2015. According to the 2020 census, Monterrey itself has a population of 1,142,194.\nLocated at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental, Monterrey is a major business and industrial hub in Mexico and Latin America.\nMonterrey is considered one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study ranked the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda as the city with the best quality of life in the country. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.\nThe uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey began with its founding by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. Following the Mexican War of Independence, the city grew into a key business hub. The city experienced great industrial growth following the establishment of the Monterrey Foundry in 1900. It holds prominent positions in industries such as steel, cement, glass, auto parts, and brewing. The city's economic success has been partly attributed to its proximity to the United States-Mexico border and strong economic ties with the United States.\nEtymology.\nThe city is named after Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, who was viceroy of New Spain from 1595 to 1603. His family originated in Monterrei, Galicia, Spain.\nHistory.\nPrehispanic history.\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous nomad groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: \"Azalapas\", \"Huachichiles\", \"Coahuiltecos\" and \"Borrados\".\nFoundation.\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580, he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000\u00a0kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded the \"Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey\" (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called \"Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia\", where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now.\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\nAfter Mexican Independence (19th century).\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center. Many of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\nThe brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890.\n20th century.\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the \"Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey\".\nA steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nMonterrey experienced a host of strikes against poor working conditions and the creation of unions during this period. The working class of Monterrey were subject to long hours, little pay, and dangerous working conditions, as were most other urban areas on the cusp of the Industrial Revolution. This led to several strikes and unionization. What makes Monterrey unique was the culture of solidarity shared by the working class. This culture of solidarity meant that workers from different companies would support one another in strikes and unionization. Regardless of how an individual company treated their employees, some would go on strike in support of others. This created tension between the employers and the employees to the point of violence and government intervention through the Mexican Revolution and into the 1940s.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the previously dry Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing over 100 deaths and economic damage.\n21st century.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.\nIn 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex which was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.\nIn August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\nIn summer 2022, the area experienced a severe drought, and city water service was cut off for several weeks to some areas, and in others limited to six hours a day. The city has three reservoirs. Cerro Prieto Reservoir dropped to 1% of its capacity and La Boca Reservoir dropped to 8%. El Cuchillo Reservoir remained at 30%, but limited aqueduct capacity led the government to announce in September 2022 a second aqueduct to connect it to Monterrey, with expected completion in July 2023. Heavy rains replenished reservoirs in early September. Controversy erupted over local bottling companies continuing to use well water to export beer and soft drinks during the crisis, though industry uses only 4% of water in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, while residents use 25% and agriculture uses 71%. In late September, the governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n declared the crisis over, but asked residents to voluntarily use no more than 100 liters per day.\nGeography.\nThe city of Monterrey is above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated literally from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King Mountain\", and folk etymology claims that this refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it (actually, the city was named after the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey). The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west. Their combined metropolitan population is over 4,080,329 people.\nMonterrey lies north of the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. A small hill, the Cerro del Topo, and the smaller Topo Chico are in the suburbs of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the Cerro de las Mitras (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their mitres.\nCerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. Cerro de la Loma Larga\u2014South of the Santa Catarina river\u2014separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. At the summit of the Cerro del Obispado, north of the river, is the historic Bishopric Palace, site of one of the most important battles of the Mexican\u2013American War.\nNatural areas.\nThe mountains surrounding Monterrey are home to many canyons, trails, and roads that cross deserts and forests, offering suitable trails for the general public. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountains to the south of the city are part of the Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey, which is part of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of Biosphere Reserves, a designation it received in 2006.\nKey locations within Cumbres de Monterrey includes:\nClimate.\nMonterrey has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \n\"BSh\"), not having enough precipitation for a humid subtropical climate. Being inland at a modest elevation, it is one of the warmest major cities in Mexico. Summers are generally hot, spring and fall temperate, and winters mild, with temperatures rarely below freezing. The average high in August is and the average low is . The average January high is and the average low in January is . Rainfall is scarce in winter, but more frequent during May through September.\nMonterrey frequently experiences extreme weather changes; for example, it sometimes reaches in January and February, the coldest months. The most extreme weather changes in summer occur with rainfall, which can reduce temperatures significantly, and the temporary absence of the \"northern winds\" in winter, which can lead to abnormally high temperatures. Seasons are not well defined; the warm season may start in February and may last until September. In April and May 2011 temperatures reached or higher, causing fires and extreme heat. Snow is a very rare event, although an accumulation of in 8\u00a0hours occurred in January 1967. The most recent snowfall was in February 2021. Sleet and ice events occurred in January 2007, December 2009, January and February 2010, and February 2011, caused by temperatures around .\nFrom June 30 to July 2, 2010, Monterrey was hit by the worst natural disaster in the city's history when Hurricane Alex delivered more than of rain in 72\u00a0hours, with areas reaching up to of rain during that same period, destroying homes, avenues, highways and infrastructure, and leaving up to 200,000 families without water for a week or more. The amount of water that fell was equivalent to the average precipitation for a year. This was about 3\u20134 times as much rain as Hurricane Gilbert produced in the city on September 15, 1988. The death toll of Hurricane Alex was estimated to be around 20.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the national INEGI population census of 2010, of the total population of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, 87.3% lived in the Monterrey metropolitan area.\nThe Monterrey metropolitan area is the second most populous in Mexico, with more than 5 million inhabitants. It comprises the municipalities of Monterrey, Apodaca, Escobedo, Garc\u00eda, Guadalupe, Santiago, Ju\u00e1rez, San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, Santa Catarina and Salinas Victoria.\nEducation.\nMonterrey has an estimated 3.7% illiteracy rate. In 2005, of an estimated 983,359 inhabitants above 6 years of age, 36,689 were illiterate. In 2005, the city had 72 public libraries, with 298,207 books available, serving an estimated 478,047 readers.\nThe Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n (Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, UANL) is the third-largest Mexican university and is ranked by the Reader's Digest-AC Nielsen Survey 2005 as the top public university in northeast Mexico. Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria (University City), covers approximately . The UANL system comprises 26 colleges (faculties), 22 graduate divisions, 29 high schools, 1 center of bilingual education and 3 technical high schools. Its medical school is considered one of the most advanced in Latin America.\nMonterrey is also the headquarters of the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies), which ranked No. 291 at the 2013 QS World University Rankings in Engineering and Information Technology, No. 201 in Social Sciences and No. 279 overall. It also holds a \"QS Stars Rated for Excellence\" of 5 stars.\nThe Universidad Regiomontana was founded in 1969 with the support of local leading multinational corporations such as Cemex, Alfa, Femsa, Gamesa, Protexa and CYDSA. It is a private educational institution offering university-preparatory school, undergraduate and graduate programs, having agreements with more than 350 universities across the globe (such as the recent expanded agreement with Texas A&amp;M International University). It is member of GATE (Global Alliance for Transnational Education) and FIMPES (Federaci\u00f3n de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educaci\u00f3n Superior) and its administration holds an ISO 9001 Certification. The university is nationally recognized, so its degree equivalency is comparable to that of a regionally accredited university in the United States. The university is dedicated to educating students in an atmosphere of freedom and humanism, and providing students hands-on experience in their field of study. Its urban campus further stimulates the city's vibrant economy and attracts working professionals who complement and enrich the academic experience.\nThe Universidad de Monterrey was founded by the religious congregations of the Sisters of Immaculate Mary of Guadalupe, the nuns of the Sacred Heart and the Marist and La Salle brothers, all of them supported by an association of Catholic citizens.\nHealth.\nMonterrey generally has a very highly ranked medical infrastructure with some internationally acclaimed hospitals,\nincluding three with Joint Commission accreditation.\nThe Joint Commission is a private healthcare accreditation group. There are both public and private hospitals. The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) has two major regional hospitals in the city, the Specialties Regional Hospital # 33, the cardiac centre (Hospital #34), and the Gynecology and Obstetrics Regional Hospital, serving also the northeastern states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Several smaller IMSS hospitals can be found such as the Traumatology and Orthopedics Hospital and the General Hospital # 25. State government owns the Metropolitan Hospital, located in the suburb of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and the Hospital of the Children and Mother Care in Guadalupe suburb.\nThe Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n runs the public University Hospital, with a high-level shock-trauma unit and a specialized clinic for child cancer treatment. It is recognized as the best public hospital in the northeast of Mexico and the UANL School of Medicine as one of the best in the country. On the other hand, the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey runs the Hospital San Jos\u00e9-Tec de Monterrey private hospital.\nMonterrey has healthcare standards above the average for Mexico. It has several hospitals, including Hospital Cima (formerly Santa Engracia) of the International Hospital Corporation. Its convenient location, low prices and quality of medical care have made of Monterrey a very popular medical tourism destination for United States patients.\nGovernance.\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected \"Presidente Municipal\" (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adri\u00e1n de la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (\"Cabildo de Monterrey\") is an organ integrated by the mayor, the \"Regidores\" and the \"S\u00edndicos\". The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The \"Regidores\" represent the community and collectively define city policies. The \"S\u00edndicos\" are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.\nThe political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens' Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\nPublic safety.\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and it was one of the two safest in 2006. However since 2008 the city has experienced violence related to turf battles between rival drug cartels. The year marked the most violent period in the city's history. Although drug dealers remain a major concern, military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel leaders have weakened the cartels trying to establish themselves. Despite these challenges, the city is considered safe for travel during both the day and at night, with the violence that does occur being cartel against rival cartel.\nMonterrey has two police departments: the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the \"Polic\u00eda Regia\"), which is under the municipal government, and State Public Safety which oversees more remote areas. The \"Polic\u00eda Regia\" is responsible for protecting the downtown and main areas of the city, while State Public Safety is focused on the outskirts. Following the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nMonterrey is connected with the United States\u2013Mexico border, the sea and inland Mexico through different roads, including the Carretera Nacional (also known as the Pan-American Highway) that runs from Nuevo Laredo to Mexico City and south, and the Carretera Interoce\u00e1nica connecting Matamoros with the port of Mazatl\u00e1n on the Pacific; it is also crossed by highways 40, 45, and 57. The divided highway Monterrey-Saltillo-Matehuala-Mexico City is the main land corridor to interior Mexico.\nThere are several between-cities bus lines at the bus station downtown. There are arrivals and departures into deeper Mexico, to the U.S. border and into the United States. Monterrey is also connected by at least three important railroad freight lines: Nuevo Laredo-Mexico City, Monterrey-Tampico, and Monterrey-Pacific (Mazatl\u00e1n).\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Monterrey, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 85 min. 25% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 min, while 29.% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 9.5\u00a0km, while 25% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.\nThe city has a rapid transit system called Metrorrey, which currently has 3 lines. and a BRT called Ecov\u00eda.\nThe city is served by two international airports: Monterrey International Airport (served by major international carriers and moving more than 6.5 million passengers in 2007) and Del Norte International Airport, a primarily private airport.\nMonterrey is linked through frequent non-stop flights to many Mexican cities and to United States hubs (Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston-Intercontinental, JFK/New York, and Las Vegas). Monterrey is the second most important city for the operating routes of Aerom\u00e9xico.\nFour airlines have their operational bases and headquarters in Monterrey: Volaris, Aerom\u00e9xico Connect, VivaAerobus and Magnicharters. Regarding ground transportation from Monterrey International Airport, taxi services link the airport with the city and charge around US$20 for a one-way ride to the city. From this airport, there is a bus shuttle to nearby Saltillo. Inter-city bus services run daily into the interior, as well as north to the US border and points beyond. A public transportation bus line operated by the Nuevo Leon State Government called the \"Ruta Express\" (Express Route) also operates from the airport to the Metrorrey Line 1's Y Griega metro station.\nEconomy.\nMonterrey is a major industrial center in northern Mexico, with a GDP (PPP) of US$140 billion and a GDP (PPP) per capita of US$31,900 in 2015. The city was rated by \"Fortune\" magazine in 1999 as the best city in Latin America for business and is currently ranked third best by the Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda magazine.\nThe city has prominent positions in sectors such as steel, cement, glass, auto parts, and brewing. The city's economic wealth has been attributed in part to its proximity to the United States-Mexico border and economic links to the United States.\nIndustrialization was accelerated in the mid-19th century by the \"Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora de Fierro y Acero Monterrey\", a steel-processing company. Today, Monterrey is home to transnational conglomerates such as Cemex (the world's third largest cement company), FEMSA (Coca-Cola Latin America, largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the world), Alfa (petrochemicals, food, telecommunications and auto parts), Axtel (telecommunications), Vitro (glass), Selther (leading mattress and rest systems firm in Latin America), Gruma (food), and Banorte (financial services). The FEMSA corporation owned a large brewery, the Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery (Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma) that produces the brands Sol, Tecate, Indio, Dos Equis and Carta Blanca among others, in the beginning of the year Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery was sold to Dutch-based company Heineken. By the end of the same year, there were more than 13,000 manufacturing companies, 55,000 retail stores, and more than 52,000 service firms in Monterrey.\nThe metals sector, dominated by iron and steel, accounted for 6 percent of manufacturing GNP in 1994. Mexico's steel industry is centered in Monterrey, where the country's first steel mills opened in 1903. Steel processing plants in Monterrey, privatized in 1986, accounted for about half of Mexico's total steel output in the early 1990s. The region also has metal reclamation industry, like Zinc Nacional, which processes hazardous waste electric arc furnace dust to extract useful metals for resale. In 2022, Monterrey receives almost half of all metallic hazardous waste the US exported.\nMonterrey was ranked 94th worldwide and fifth in Latin America in terms of Quality of Life according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting (2006), and was ranked second in 2005 and fourth in 2006, according to Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda.\nSome of the shopping malls in the city include Paseo San Pedro, Paseo La Fe, Plaza Fiesta San Agust\u00edn, Galer\u00edas Monterrey, and Galer\u00edas Valle Oriente.\nIn March 2023, Tesla announced that it would build a new gigafactory\u2014Gigafactory Mexico\u2014near Monterrey. The factory will be a ~US$10 billion dollar investment, and will employ thousands of workers when fully operational, as well as employ many thousands of workers during construction.\nCulture.\nThe 2007 Universal Forum of Cultures was an international cultural event held in Monterrey from September 20 to December 8, 2007.\nCuisine.\nThe most traditional dish from Monterrey is \"cabrito\", kid goat cooked on embers. Other local dishes and customs that perhaps date back to the Crypto-Judaism of Monterrey's founding families are the \"semita\" (bread without leavening), the capirotada dessert (a mix of cooked bread, cheese, raisins, peanuts, and crystallized sugarcane juice), and the relative absence of pork dishes. Another famous local dish is \"machacado con huevo\".\n\"Carne asada\" on weekends remains a tradition among Monterrey families. It is usually served with grilled onions, baked potatoes and sausages or chopped as tacos. Locally brewed beer and cola are an almost mandatory part of the weekly ritual. \"Glorias\" and \"obleas\", made from goat milk, are both traditional Nuevo Le\u00f3n desserts.\nMonterrey has a wide gastronomic variety due to its climate geography, climate, texture, a mixture of ethnics groups, and their influences, a series of unique dishes have been created through more than 400 years of history.\nChinatown.\nAfter the USMCA was ratified, an industrial Chinatown with signs in both Spanish and Chinese formed in Monterrey to take advantage of tariff free trade with the United States given its proximity to Texas.\nContemporary music.\nSince the 1960s, Monterrey has been known for \"Norte\u00f1o\" music. Monterrey has witnessed the birth of several bands that have become internationally acclaimed. Their genres vary considerably. Bands include Plastilina Mosh, Control Machete, Kinky, El Gran Silencio, Celso Pina, Jumbo, Division Minuscula, 3Ball MTY, and The Warning. The song \"Los Oxidados\" by Plastilina Mosh opened the 2005 movie \"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith\".\nMedia.\nMonterrey is an important producer and broadcaster of media and entertainment in Mexico. Grupo Multimedios operates 4 television channels in the city, and XHAW-TDT is the flagship of the near-national network Canal 6, which also airs as a cable network in the United States. National broadcasting networks Televisa and Azteca have local stations for all of their major channels, along with the non-commercial broadcasters such as Once and Canal 22 networks. The state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n and UANL also maintain television stations.\nGrupo Reforma, one of the most widely read news sources in Mexico originated in the city with the newspaper El Norte. Milenio Diario de Monterrey, published by Grupo Multimedios, is another newspaper of high distribution, daily printing local editions in the most important Mexican cities. Other local newspapers include \"El Porvenir\", \"El Horizonte\", and \"ABC\". Northern Mexico's weekly business newspaper \"Biznews\" is also headquartered in Monterrey.\nMonterrey also has several radio stations broadcasting news, music, entertainment, and culture for the city. The main radio broadcasting groups are Multimedios Radio, Grupo Radio Alegr\u00eda and Nucleo Radio Monterrey.\nSports.\nThe city hosted 8 matches during the 1986 FIFA World Cup and will host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The FINA World Junior Swimming Championships were held in Monterrey in the summer of 2008 at the University of Nuevo Leon (UANL), after the completion of a world-class and FINA-approved Aquatic Center. Also the city wanted to bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but the Mexican Olympic Committee refused to support it. Backed by a young people's movement, students of the universities of Monterrey formed the Monterrey 2014 Foundation with the purpose of hosting the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. In 2009, the Mexican Olympic Committee gave the bid to Guadalajara which later on withdrew the bid late January 2010. Monterrey was bidding for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. Again, in February 2012, the Mexican Olympic Committee chose Guadalajara as a candidate for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, but was eliminated by the International Olympic Committee to advance to the final round. Since then, the Foundation Monterrey Olympic City A.C., the new name of this group of young citizens, are working on a project bid for the 2023 Summer Youth Olympics and then apply for the 2028 Summer Olympics.\nMonterrey has two football teams in the Mexican league. The C.F. Monterrey, commonly known as the \"Rayados del Monterrey\", uses the Estadio BBVA Bancomer, a facility sponsored by BBVA Bancomer and other important businesses. The Tigres UANL, owned by CEMEX, host matches at Estadio Universitario, on the main campus of the UANL. Both teams are related to the city on the derby, called Cl\u00e1sico Regiomontano. During the match, most of the city watches in bars, clubs, and family homes. It was proposed to build a stadium for both teams, the \"Estadio Internacional Monterrey\", but both teams rejected the idea. The project is still being promoted, but the UANL Tigres have yet to finish their stadium contract and the \"Rayados\" just inaugurated a new stadium of their own. Club de F\u00fatbol Monterrey recently opened a new stadium with a capacity of 50,000. It was scheduled to be finished by 2014, named \"Estadio de F\u00fatbol Monterrey\", but was inaugurated on August 2, 2015, in a match with Benfica. Rayados won, 3\u20130. Before the inauguration, the name was changed to Estadio BBVA Bancomer. It will remain the club's property for 50 years before becoming government property.\nIn addition, two professional indoor soccer teams were hosted in the past, the Monterrey La Raza, members of the Continental Indoor Soccer League and World Indoor Soccer League and the Monterrey Fury, members of the Major Indoor Soccer League. The city was awarded another franchise to begin play in the fall of 2007 in the MISL.\nBaseball has a long history in the city, where it became the most popular sport during the early 20th century. Monterrey has been champion of the Little League World Series three times (1957, 1958 and 1997), and has been host of Major League Baseball games. The Sultanes de Monterrey are a Mexican League baseball team in the Northern Division. They have won the national title several times. The team was formed May 20, 1939, as Carta Blanca (a local beer brand, owned by Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery which owned the team). The team was also known as the gray ghosts. Soon, they became one of the most important teams in the league, winning its first championship in 1943. The Sultanes play in the Estadio de B\u00e9isbol Monterrey, the largest baseball stadium in Mexico. In 2003, the city unsuccessfully attempted to buy (and relocate to Monterrey) the Montreal Expos franchise of Major League Baseball.\nThere are two professional basketball teams: Fuerza Regia that plays in the national league, Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, and the Monterrey Venom that plays in the minor league American Basketball Association. Fuerza Regia used to play at the Monterrey Arena and now is doing this at Gimnasio Nuevo Le\u00f3n while the Monterrey Poison plays at the gymnasium of the ITESM. The city has hosted the Champ Car race in Fundidora Park from 2001 to 2005 and hosted the A1 Grand Prix of Nations in February 2006.\nIn 2004, Monterrey hosted the World Karate Federation Senior World Championships. In April 2004, Monterrey's Arena Monterrey became the first city to host WWE in Mexico. In 2007, Monterrey hosted the Women's WTBA World Tenpin Bowling Championships. The city has two college American football teams, the \"Aut\u00e9nticos Tigres UANL\" and the \"Borregos Salvajes\" (ITESM) that play in the National College League (ONEFA). There is also a local children's league called AFAIM. People can also find golf, fishing, camping, and extreme-sports outdoors near the city (bungee jumping at Cola de Caballo, rock-climbing, hiking, mountain bike). In particular there is international-level rock-climbing places like la Huasteca, Potrero Chico and many other canyons.\nStarting 2009 the Monterrey Open has been held at Monterrey. It is a professional women's tennis tournament affiliated with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), and is part of the International tournaments on the WTA Tour. The Monterrey Open was also a golf tournament on the U.S.-based second tier professional Nike Tour, later named the Nationwide Tour and the Korn Ferry Tour, from 1993 to 2001. It was played at the Club Campestre in San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, a suburb of Monterrey. In 2010, Monterrey hosted the International Ice Hockey Federation World U18 Championship at the Monterrey Ice Complex. Centauros Rugby Club Monterrey was founded in 2010 and is affiliated with the FMRU (Federacion Mexicana de Rugby).\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nMonterrey is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On 7 December 1965, the document was promulgated by Pope Paul VI, after an approval vote of 2,390 to 4 among the assembled bishops. The title means \"Order of Priests\" in Latin. As is customary for such documents in the Catholic Church, it is taken from the first line of the decree (its incipit).\nHistory.\nAgitation among the Council Fathers for a separate and distinct conciliar decree on the priesthood began in the second session of the council (1963), in the course of the discussions about the drafts concerning the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (\"Lumen gentium\"). \"Presbyterorum ordinis\" has come to be one of the defining documents on the role and duties of the priesthood in the modern era.\nReception.\nThe period that followed the promulgation of \"Presbyterorum ordinis\" was marked by a severe drop in the number of priestly vocations in the Western World. Church leaders argued age-old secularization was to blame and that it was not directly related to the documents of the council. Historians also pointed to the damage caused in 1968, by the sexual revolution, and the strong backlash over \"Humanae vitae\". Yet, other authors asserted the drop in vocations was at least partly deliberate as part of an attempt to de-clericalize the Church and allow for a more pluralistic clergy. In 1995, according to the Congregation for the Clergy, in recent years, \"despite various persistent difficulties, there is a positive quantitative and qualitative recovery which makes one hope for a priestly second spring.\" \nThere was a related exodus from the priesthood, which began under Paul VI and continued during the papacy of John Paul II. In 2007, \"La Civilta Cattolica\" reported 69,063 priests left the ministry between 1964 and 2004; 11,213 later returned.\nIn November 2015 Pope Francis addressed a conference sponsored by the Congregation for the Clergy marking the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Vatican II decree \"Presbyterorum ordinis\". He told delegates attending the conference, \"The good that priests can do comes primarily from their proximity to\u00a0\u2013 and a tender love for\u00a0\u2013 their people. They are not philanthropists or functionaries, but fathers and brothers. ...Even priests have a biography, and are not 'mushrooms' which sprout up suddenly at the Cathedral on their day of ordination.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Wells Drive. Dedicated in 1927 and donated to the city by philanthropist Kate S. Buckingham, it is one of the largest fountains in the world. Built in a rococo wedding cake style and inspired by the Latona Fountain at the Palace of Versailles, its design allegorically represents nearby Lake Michigan. The fountain operates generally from mid-April to mid-October, with regular water-jet displays and evening colored-light shows. During the winter, the fountain is decorated with festival lights.\nHistory.\nThe fountain area has been called Chicago's front door, since it is located in the center of Grant Park, the city's front yard near the intersection of Columbus Drive and Ida B. Wells Drive. The fountain itself represents Lake Michigan, with four sets of sea horses (two per set) symbolizing the four states\u2014Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana\u2014that border the lake. The fountain was designed by beaux arts architect Edward H. Bennett. The statues were created by the French sculptor Marcel F. Loyau. The design of the fountain was inspired by the \"Bassin de Latone\" and modeled after Latona Fountain at Versailles.\nThe fountain was donated to the city by Kate Sturges Buckingham in memory of her brother, Clarence Buckingham, and was constructed at a cost of $750,000. The fountain's official name is the \"Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain\". Kate Buckingham also established the Buckingham Fountain Endowment Fund with an initial investment of $300,000 to pay for maintenance. Buckingham Fountain was dedicated on August 26, 1927.\nIn August 2016, in a partnership with the City of Chicago, the Chicago Parks District and Everywhere Wireless, the Buckingham Fountain viewing area joined many Chicago beaches and the Museum Campus in providing free Wi-Fi to visitors.\nOperation.\nMany tourists and Chicagoans visit the fountain each year. The fountain operates from 8:00\u00a0a.m. to 11:00\u00a0p.m. daily, typically from early May through mid-October, depending on weather. Water shows occur every hour on-the-hour and last 20 minutes. During shows, the center jet shoots up vertically to , and after dusk shows are choreographed with lights and music. The last show begins at 10:00\u00a0p.m. nightly.\nThe fountain is constructed of Georgia pink marble and contains of water. During a display, more than are pushed through its 193 jets. The bottom pool of the fountain is in diameter, the lower basin is , the middle basin is and the upper basin is . The lip of the upper basin is above the water in the lower basin.\nThe fountain's pumps are controlled by a Honeywell computer which was previously located in Atlanta, Georgia, until the 1994 renovation when it was moved to the pump house of the fountain. The fountain's security system is monitored from Arlington Heights (a Chicago suburb).\nRenovations.\nIn 1994, the fountain received a $2.8 million restoration to its three smallest basins which developed leaks due to Chicago's harsh winters.\nThe latest renovation project on Buckingham Fountain began in September 2008. This three-phase project modernized aging internal systems in the fountain and restored deteriorated features. Funding was a combination from the Buckingham endowment, city and park district funds and a grant from the Lollapalooza music festival which is held annually near the fountain.\nPhase I was dedicated April 3, 2009. This phase included permeable pavers to surround the fountain. This replaced the crushed stone that was used since the fountain was constructed. The pavers make a safer and smoother surface and complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\nPhase II was planned to begin in the winter of 2009. This phase included the demolition of the fountain table, installation of extensive underdrainage system, new landscaping, site lighting, signs, site furnishings, sewer system, selective demolition within or adjacent to the fountain's outer basin, repairs of some existing cast-in-place concrete elements and installation of new cast-in-place elements. Work was not completed due to lack of funds and the Chicago Park District has not announced when it expects to finish this phase.\nPhase III updates have not been designed and won't begin until Phase II is completed. This phase will include the restoration of Buckingham Fountain and fountain table, the construction of a new equipment room with selective demolition, structural construction and repair, masonry restoration and repair, mechanical and electrical work, bronze restoration and repair and installation of site improvements and amenities.\nIn popular culture.\nEntertainment.\nBuckingham Fountain was featured in the title sequences of TV shows \"Married... with Children\" and \"Crime Story\". \nThe fountain was the starting point for the television show \"The Amazing Race 6\" in 2004 and was featured in a task 13 years later on \"The Amazing Race 29\".\nBuckingham Fountain features in the 1949 film noir film Undertow, as the protagonist's meeting place. \nConfusion with Route 66.\nBuckingham Fountain is often incorrectly identified as the eastern terminus of historic U.S. Route 66 (the road west to Southern California), but, although near, it was not the end point of that historic route. The original eastern terminus was nearby at the intersection of Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago. In a later alignment, the terminus was moved east several blocks through Grant Park to the intersection with Lake Shore Drive after the latter was designated as U.S. Route 41. It remained there until the eastern terminus of Interstate 55 was completed at Lake Shore Drive, and then that also became the eastern terminus of Route 66 until I-55 completely replaced the route in Illinois and U.S. 66 was decommissioned (in 1985). Nevertheless, many people still associate Buckingham Fountain with the start of Route 66, even though it had not been built yet when the route opened on November 11, 1926 \u2014 whereas the Fountain of the Great Lakes in the South Garden of the Art Institute of Chicago, which has been near the intersection of Jackson and Michigan since 1913, actually preceded Route 66 by 13 years and Buckingham Fountain by 14 years. Because Jackson is now a one way street going \"east\", the historic commemorative signs for Route 66 now show \"End\" at Jackson near Michigan, but \"Begin\" is moved one block north to Adams Street (in front of the Art Institute), which is a one-way going \"west\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40462", "revid": "1320300287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40462", "title": "Daniel Burnham", "text": "American architect and urban designer (1846\u2013 1912)\nDaniel Hudson Burnham (September 4, 1846 \u2013 June 1, 1912) was an American architect and urban designer. A proponent of the \"Beaux-Arts\" movement, he may have been \"the most successful power broker the American architectural profession has ever produced.\"\nA successful Chicago architect, he was selected as Director of Works for the 1892\u201393 World's Columbian Exposition, colloquially referred to as \"The White City\". He had prominent roles in the creation of master plans for the development of a number of cities, including the Plan of Chicago, and plans for Manila, Baguio and downtown Washington, D.C. He also designed several famous buildings, including a number of notable skyscrapers in Chicago, the Flatiron Building of triangular shape in New York City, Washington Union Station in Washington D.C., London's Selfridges department store, and San Francisco's Merchants Exchange.\nAlthough best known for his skyscrapers, city planning, and for the White City, almost one third of Burnham's total output \u2013 \u2013 consisted of buildings for shopping.\nEarly life.\nBurnham was born in Henderson, New York, the son of Elizabeth Keith (Weeks) and Edwin Arnold Burnham. He was raised in the teachings of the Swedenborgian, also called \"The New Church\" which ingrained in him the strong belief that man should strive to be of service to others. At the age of eight, Burnham moved to Chicago and his father established there a wholesale drug business which became a success.\nBurnham was not a good student, but he was good at drawing. He moved to the eastern part of the country at the age of 18 to be taught by private tutors in order to pass the admissions examinations for Harvard and Yale, failing both apparently because of a bad case of test anxiety. In 1867, when he was 21 he returned to Chicago and took an apprenticeship as a draftsman under William LeBaron Jenney of the architectural firm Loring &amp; Jenney. Architecture seemed to be the calling he was looking for, and he told his parents that he wanted to become \"the greatest architect in the city or country\".\nNevertheless, the young Burnham still had a streak of wanderlust in him, and in 1869 he left his apprenticeship to go to Nevada with friends to try mining gold, at which he failed. He then ran for the Nevada state legislature and failed to be elected. Broke, he returned again to Chicago and took a position with the architect L. G. Laurean. When the Great Chicago Fire hit the city in October 1871, it seemed as if there would be endless work for architects, but Burnham chose to strike out again, becoming first a salesman of plate glass windows, then a druggist. He failed at the first and quit the second. He later remarked on \"a family tendency to get tired of doing the same thing for very long\".\nCareer.\nAt age 26, Burnham moved on to the Chicago offices of Carter, Drake and Wight where he met future business partner John Wellborn Root, who was 21 and four years younger than Burnham. The two became friends and then opened an architectural office together in 1873. Unlike his previous ventures, Burnham stuck to this one. Burnham and Root went on to become a very successful firm. Their first major commission came from John B. Sherman, the superintendent of the massive Union Stock Yards in Chicago, which provided the livelihood \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 for one-fifth of the city's population. Sherman hired the firm to build for him a mansion on Prairie Avenue at Twenty-first Street among the mansions of Chicago's other merchant barons. Root made the initial design. Burnham refined it and supervised the construction. It was on the construction site that he met Sherman's daughter, Margaret, whom Burnham married in 1876 after a short courtship. Sherman commissioned other projects from Burnham and Root, including the Stone Gate, an entry portal to the stockyards which became a Chicago landmark.\nIn 1881, the firm was commissioned to build the Montauk Building, the tallest building in Chicago at the time. To solve the problem of the city's water-saturated sandy soil and bedrock below the surface, Root came up with a plan to dig down to a \"hardpan\" layer of clay on which was laid a thick pad of concrete overlaid with steel rails placed at right-angles to form a lattice \"grill\", which was then filled with Portland cement. This \"floating foundation\" was, in effect, artificially-created bedrock on which the building could be constructed. The completed building was so tall compared to existing buildings that it defied easy description, and the name \"skyscraper\" was coined to describe it. Thomas Talmadge, an architect and architectural critic said of the building, \"What Chartres was to the Gothic cathedral, the Montauk Block was to the high commercial building.\"\nBurnham and Root went on to build more of the first American skyscrapers, such as the Masonic Temple Building in Chicago. Measuring 21 stories and 302 feet, the temple held claims as the tallest building of its time, but was torn down in 1939.\nThe talents of the two partners were complementary. Both men were artists and gifted architects, but Root had a knack for conceiving elegant designs and was able to see almost at once the totality of the necessary structure. Burnham, on the other hand, excelled at bringing in clients and supervising the building of Root's designs. They each appreciated the value of the other to the firm. Burnham also took steps to ensure their employees were happy: he installed a gym in the office, gave fencing lessons and let employees play handball at lunch time. Root, a pianist and organist, gave piano recitals in the office on a rented piano. Paul Starrett, who joined the office in 1888 said \"The office was full of a rush of work, but the spirit of the place was delightfully free and easy and human in comparison to other offices I had worked in.\"\nAlthough the firm was extremely successful, there were several notable setbacks. One of their designs, the Grannis Block in which their office was located, burned down in 1885 necessitating a move to the top floor of The Rookery, another of their designs. Then, in 1888, a Kansas City, Missouri, hotel they had designed collapsed during construction, killing one man and injuring several others. At the coroner's inquest, the building's design came in for criticism. The negative publicity shook and depressed Burnham. Then in a further setback, Burnham and Root also failed to win the commission for design of the giant Auditorium Building, which went instead to their rivals, Adler &amp; Sullivan.\nOn January 15, 1891, while the firm was deep in meetings for the design of \nthe World's Columbian Exposition, Root died after a three-day course of pneumonia. As Root had been only 41 years old, his death stunned both Burnham and Chicago society. After Root's death, the firm of Burnham and Root, which had had tremendous success producing modern buildings as part of the Chicago School of architecture, was renamed D.H. Burnham &amp; Company. After that the firm continued its successes and Burnham extended his reach into city design.\nWorld's Columbian Exposition.\nBurnham and Root had accepted responsibility to oversee the design and construction of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago's then-desolate Jackson Park on the south lakefront. The largest world's fair to that date (1893), it celebrated the 400-year anniversary of Christopher Columbus's famous voyage. After Root's sudden and unexpected death, a team of distinguished American architects and landscape architects, including Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Richard M. Hunt, George B. Post, and Henry Van Brunt radically changed Root's modern and colorful style to a Classical Revival style. Only the pavilion by Louis Sullivan was designed in a non-Classical style. To ensure the project's success, Burnham moved his personal residence into a wooden headquarters, called \"the shanty\" on the burgeoning fairgrounds to improve his ability to oversee construction. The construction of the fair faced huge financial and logistical hurdles, including a worldwide financial panic and an extremely tight timeframe, to open on time.\nConsidered the first example of a comprehensive planning document in the nation, the fairground featured grand boulevards, classical building facades, and lush gardens. Often called the \"White City,\" it popularized neoclassical architecture in a monumental, yet rational Beaux-Arts style. As a result of the fair's popularity, architects across the U.S. were said to be inundated with requests by clients to incorporate similar elements into their designs.\nThe control of the fair's design and construction was a matter of dispute between various entities, particularly the National Commission which was headed by George R. Davis, who served as Director-General of the fair. It was also headed by the Exposition Company which consisted of the city's leading merchants, led by Lyman Gage which had raised the money needed to build the fair, and Burnham as Director of Works. In addition the large number of committees made it difficult for construction to move forward at the pace needed to meet the opening day deadline. After a major accident which destroyed one of the fair's premiere buildings, Burnham moved to take tighter control of construction, distributing a memo to all the fair's department heads which read \"I have assumed personal control of the active work within the grounds of the World's Columbian Exposition... Henceforward, and until further notice, you will report to and receive orders from me exclusively.\"\nAfter the fair opened, Olmsted, who designed the fairgrounds, said of Burnham that \"too high an estimate cannot be placed on the industry, skill and tact with which this result was secured by the master of us all.\" Burnham himself rejected the suggestion that Root had been largely responsible for the fair's design, writing afterwards:\nWhat was done up to the time of his death was the faintest suggestion of a plan... The impression concerning his part has been gradually built up by a few people, close friends of his and mostly women, who naturally after the Fair proved beautiful desired to more broadly identify his memory with it.\nPost-fair architecture.\nNevertheless, Burnham's reputation was considerably enhanced by the success and beauty of the fair. Harvard and Yale both presented him honorary master's degrees ameliorating his having failed their entrance exams in his youth. The common perception while Root was alive was that he was the architectural artist and Burnham had run the business side of the firm; Root's death, while devastating to Burnham personally, allowed him to develop as an architect in a way he might not have, had Root lived on.\nIn 1901, Burnham designed the Flatiron Building in New York City, a trailblazing structure that utilized an internal steel skeleton to provide structural integrity; the exterior masonry walls were not load-bearing. This allowed the building to rise to 22 stories. The design was that of a vertical Renaissance palazzo with Beaux-Arts styling, divided like a classical column, into base, shaft and capital.\nOther Burnham post-fair designs included the Land Title Building (1897) in Philadelphia, the first major building in that city not designed by local architects, and known as \"the finest example of early skyscraper design\" there, John Wanamaker's Department Store (1902\u20131911) in Philadelphia, now Macy's, which is built around a central court, Wanamaker's Annex (1904, addition: 1907\u20131910), in New York City, a 19-story full-block building which contains as much floorspace as the Empire State Building, the neo-classical Gimbels Department Store (1908\u20131912) also in New York, now the Manhattan Mall, with a completely new facade, the stunningly Art Deco Mount Wilson Observatory in the hills above Pasadena, California, and Filene's Department Store (1912) in Boston, the last major building designed by Burnham.\nThe Philippines.\nIn 1904, Burnham accepted a commission from Philippines Governor-General William Howard Taft. He had the opportunity to redesign Manila and plan a summer capital to be constructed in Baguio. Due to the Philippines status as a territory, Burnham was able to pursue his vision without having to win local approval. Altogether the project took six months to design, with only six weeks spent in the Philippines. After his plans were approved by William Cameron Forbes, Commissioner of Commerce and Police in the Philippines, Burnham was allowed to choose the principal architect, William E. Parsons. Burnham then departed to keep tabs on the project from the mainland. Burnham's plans emphasized improved sanitation, a cohesive aesthetic (Mission Revival), and visual reminders of government authority. In Manila, wide boulevards radiated out from the capital building. In Baguio, government structures loomed from the cliffs above the town. Burnham Park located in center downtown Baguio was built. The land for the Baguio project, in total, was seized from local Igorots with approval of the Philippine Supreme Court. In Manila, neighborhoods ravaged by the war for independence were left untouched while a luxury hotel, casino, and boat clubs were designed for visiting mainland dignitaries.\nCity planning and the \"Plan of Chicago\".\nInitiated in 1906 and published in 1909, Burnham and his co-author Edward H. Bennett prepared a \"Plan of Chicago\" which laid out plans for the future of the city. It was the first comprehensive plan for the controlled growth of an American city and an outgrowth of the City Beautiful movement. The plan included ambitious proposals for the lakefront and river. It also asserted that every citizen should be within walking distance of a park. Sponsored by the Commercial Club of Chicago, Burnham donated his services in hopes of furthering his own cause.\nBuilding off plans and conceptual designs from the World's Fair for the south lakefront, Burnham envisioned Chicago as a \"Paris on the Prairie\". French-inspired public works constructions, fountains and boulevards radiating from a central, domed municipal palace became Chicago's new backdrop. Though only parts of the plan were actually implemented, it set the standard for urban design, anticipating the future need to control urban growth and continuing to influence the development of Chicago long after Burnham's death.\nPlans in additional cities.\nBurnham's city planning projects did not stop at Chicago. Burnham had previously contributed to plans for cities such as Cleveland (the 1903 Group Plan), San Francisco (1905), Manila (1905), and Baguio in the Philippines, details of which appear in the 1909 \"Plan of Chicago\" publication. His plans for the redesign of San Francisco were delivered to the Board of Supervisors in September 1905, but in the haste to rebuild the city after the 1906 earthquake and fires Burnham's plans were ultimately ignored. In the Philippines, Burnham's plan for Manila never materialized due to the outbreak of World War II and the relocation of the capital to another city after the war. Some components of the plan, however, did come into fruition including the shore road which became Dewey Boulevard (now known as Roxas Boulevard) and the various neoclassical government buildings around Luneta Park, which very much resemble a miniature version of Washington, D.C., in their arrangement.\nIn Washington, D.C., Burnham did much to shape the 1901 McMillan Plan which led to the completion of the overall design of the National Mall. The Senate Park Commission, or McMillan Commission established by Michigan Senator James McMillan, brought together Burnham and three of his colleagues from the World's Columbian Exposition: architect Charles Follen McKim, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Going well beyond Pierre L'Enfant's original vision for the city, the plan provided for the extension of the Mall beyond the Washington Monument to a new Lincoln Memorial and a \"pantheon\" that eventually materialized as the Jefferson Memorial. This plan involved significant reclamation of land from swamp and the Potomac River and the relocation of an existing railroad station, which was replaced by Burnham's design for Washington Union Station. As a result of his service on the McMillan Commission, in 1910 Burnham was appointed a member and first chairman of the United States Commission of Fine Arts helping to ensure implementation of the McMillan Plan's vision. Burnham served on the commission until his death in 1912.\nInfluence.\nIn his career after the fair, Burnham became one of the country's most prominent advocates for the Beaux-Arts movement as well as the revival of Neo-classical architecture which began with the fair. Much of Burnham's work was based on the classical style of Greece and Rome. In his 1924 autobiography, Louis Sullivan, one of the leading architects of the Chicago School, but one who had a difficult relationship with Burnham over an extended period of time, criticized Burnham for what Sullivan viewed as his lack of original expression and dependence on classicism. Sullivan went on to claim that \"the damage wrought by the World's Fair will last for half a century from its date, if not longer\" \u2013 a sentiment edged with bitterness, as corporate America of the early 20th century had demonstrated a strong preference for Burnham's architectural style over Sullivan's.\nBurnham is famously quoted as saying, \"Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's blood and probably will not themselves be realized.\" This slogan has been taken to capture the essence of Burnham's spirit.\nA man of influence, Burnham was considered the pre-eminent architect in America at the start of the 20th century. He held many positions during his lifetime, including the presidency of the American Institute of Architects. Other notable architects began their careers under his aegis, such as Joseph W. McCarthy. Several of his descendants have worked as influential architects and planners in the United States, including his son, Daniel Burnham Jr., and grandchildren Burnham Kelly and Margaret Burnham Geddes.\nPersonal life.\nBurnham married Margaret Sherman, the daughter of his first major client, John B. Sherman, on January 20, 1876. They first met on the construction site of her father's house. Her father had a house built for the couple to live in. During their courtship, there was a scandal in which Burnham's older brother was accused of having forged checks. Burnham immediately went to John Sherman and offered to break the engagement as a matter of honor but Sherman rejected the offer, saying \"There is a black sheep in every family.\" However, Sherman remained wary of his son-in-law, who he thought drank too much.\nBurnham and Margaret remained married for the rest of his life. They had five children\u2014two daughters and three sons\u2014including Daniel Burnham Jr., born in February 1886, who became an architect and urban planner like his father. He worked in his father's firm until 1917, and served as the Director of Public Works for the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair, known as the \"Century of Progress\".\nThe Burnham family lived in Chicago until 1886, when he purchased a 16-room farmhouse and estate on Lake Michigan in the suburb of Evanston, Illinois. Burnham had become wary of Chicago which he felt was becoming dirtier and more dangerous as its population increased. Burnham explained to his mother, whom he did not tell of the move in advance, \"I did it, because I can no longer bear to have my children on the streets of Chicago...\" When Burnham moved into \"the shanty\" in Jackson Park to better supervise construction of the fair, his wife, Margaret and their children remained in Evanston.\nBeliefs.\nBurnham was an early environmentalist, writing: \"Up to our time, strict economy in the use of natural resources has not been practiced, but it must be henceforth unless we are immoral enough to impair conditions in which our children are to live,\" although he also believed the automobile would be a positive environmental factor, with the end of horse-based transportation bringing \"a real step in civilization... With no smoke, no gases, no litter of horses, your air and streets will be clean and pure. This means, does it not, that the health and spirits of men will be better?\" Like many men of his time, he also showed an interest in the supernatural, saying \"If I were able to take the time, I believe that I could prove the continuation of life beyond the grave, reasoning from the necessity, philosophically speaking, of a belief in an absolute and universal power.\"\nDeath.\nWhen Burnham was in his fifties, his health began to decline. He developed colitis and in 1909 was diagnosed with diabetes, which affected his circulatory system and led to an infection in his foot which was to continue for the remainder of his life.\nOn April 14, 1912, Burnham and his wife were aboard the RMS\" Olympic\" of the White Star Line, traveling to Europe to tour Heidelberg, Germany. When he attempted to send a telegram to his friend Frank Millet who was traveling the opposite direction, from Europe to the United States, on the RMS\" Titanic\", he learned that the ship had sunk in an accident and Millet did not survive. Burnham died only 47 days later from colitis complicated by his diabetes and food poisoning from a meal eaten in Heidelberg.\nAt the time of his death, D.H. Burnham and Co. was the world's largest architectural firm. Even legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright, although strongly critical of Burnham's Beaux Arts European influences, still admired him as a man and eulogized him, saying: \"[Burnham] made masterful use of the methods and men of his time...[As] an enthusiastic promoter of great construction enterprises...his powerful personality was supreme.\" The successor firm to Burnham's practice was Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White, which continued in some form until 2006. Burnham was interred at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.\nMemorials.\nTributes to Burnham include Burnham Park and Daniel Burnham Court in Chicago, Burnham Park in Baguio in the Philippines, Daniel Burnham Court in San Francisco (formerly Hemlock Street between Van Ness Avenue and Franklin Street), the annual \"Daniel Burnham Award for a Comprehensive Plan\" (run by the American Planning Association), and the \"Burnham Memorial Competition\" which was held in 2009 to create a memorial to Burnham and his Plan of Chicago. Collections of Burnham's personal and professional papers, photographs, and other archival materials are held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn addition, the Reliance Building in Chicago which was designed by Burnham and Root, is now the Hotel Burnham, although Root was the primary architect before his death in 1891.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40465", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40465", "title": "Halophyte", "text": "Salt-tolerant plant\nA halophyte is a salt-tolerant plant that grows in soil or waters of high salinity, coming into contact with saline water through its roots or by salt spray, such as in saline semi-deserts, mangrove swamps, marshes and sloughs, and seashores. The word derives from Ancient Greek \u1f05\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 (halas) 'salt' and \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd (phyton) 'plant'. Halophytes have different anatomy, physiology and biochemistry than glycophytes. An example of a halophyte is the salt marsh grass \"Spartina alterniflora\" (smooth cordgrass). Relatively few plant species are halophytes\u2014perhaps only 2% of all plant species. Information about many of the earth's halophytes can be found in the https:// database.\nThe large majority of plant species are glycophytes, which are not salt-tolerant and are damaged fairly easily by high salinity.\nClassification.\nHalophytes can be classified in many ways. According to Stocker (1933), it is mainly of 3 kinds by habitat, viz.\nAgain, according to Iversen (1936), these plants are classified with respect to the salinity of the soil on which they grow.\nFor comparison, seawater has a salinity of about 3.5%. See water salinity for other reference levels.\nHabitats of halophytes.\nMajor habitats where halophytes flourish include mangrove swamps, sand and cliff shorelines in the tropics, salt deserts and semi-deserts, the Sargasso Sea, mudflats and salt marshes, kelp forests and beds, salt lakes and salt steppes of the Pannonian region, wash fringes, isolated inland saline grasslands, and in places where people have brought about salination.\nSalt tolerance.\nTrue halophytes do not just tolerate saline water, but show optimal growth in saline water.\nOne quantitative measure of salt tolerance (halotolerance) is the total dissolved solids in irrigation water that a plant can tolerate. Seawater typically contains 40\u00a0grams per litre (g/L) of dissolved salts (mostly sodium chloride). Beans and rice can tolerate about 1\u20133 g/L, and are considered glycophytes (as are most crop plants). At the other extreme, \"Salicornia bigelovii\" (dwarf glasswort) grows well at 70 g/L of dissolved solids, and is a promising halophyte for use as a crop. Plants such as barley (\"Hordeum vulgare\") and the date palm (\"Phoenix dactylifera\") can tolerate about 5 g/L, and can be considered as marginal halophytes.\nAdaptation to saline environments by halophytes may take the form of salt tolerance or salt avoidance. Plants that avoid the effects of high salt even though they live in a saline environment may be referred to as facultative halophytes rather than 'true', or obligatory, halophytes.\nFor example, a short-lived plant species that completes its reproductive life cycle during periods (such as a rainy season) when the salt concentration is low would be avoiding salt rather than tolerating it. Or a plant species may maintain a 'normal' internal salt concentration by excreting excess salts through its leaves, by way of salt glands, or by concentrating salts in salt bladders in leaves that later die and drop off.\nIn an effort to improve agricultural production in regions where crops are exposed to salinity, research is focused on improving understanding of the various mechanisms whereby plants respond to salinity stress, so that more robust crop halophytes may be developed. Adaptive responses to salinity stress have been identified at molecular, cellular, metabolic, and physiological levels.\nExamples.\nSome halophytes are:\nUses.\nBiofuel.\nSome halophytes are being studied for use as \"3rd-generation\" biofuel precursors. Halophytes such as \"Salicornia bigelovii\" can be grown in harsh environments and typically do not compete with food crops for resources, making them promising sources of biodiesel or bioalcohol.\nPhytoremediation.\nHalophytes like \"Suaeda salsa\" can store salt ions and rare-earth elements absorbed from soils in their tissues. Halophytes can therefore be used in Phytoremediation measures to adjust salinity levels of surrounding soils. These measures aim to allow glycophytes to survive in previously uninhabitable areas through an environmentally safe, and cost effective process.\u00a0A higher concentration of halophyte plants in one area leads to higher salt uptake and lower soil salinity levels.\nDifferent species of halophytes have different absorption capabilities. Three different halophyte species (\"Atriplex patula, Atriplex hortensis,\" and \"Atriplex canescans)\" have been found to rehabilitate soils contaminated with road salt over varying lengths of time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born around 1030. On his seal from his last years, he was named \"Andrei Vsevolodu\" in Greek, implying that his baptismal name was Andrew.\nTo back up an armistice signed with the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos in 1046, his father married Vsevolod to a Byzantine princess, who according to tradition was named Anastasia or Maria. That the couple's son Vladimir Monomakh bore the family name of the Byzantine emperor suggests she was a member of his close family, but no contemporary evidence attests to a specific relationship and accounts of the Emperor give him no such daughter.\nUpon his father's death in 1054, he received in appanage the towns of Pereyaslav, Rostov, Suzdal, and the township of Beloozero which would remain in possession of his descendants until the end of Middle Ages. Together with his elder brothers Iziaslav and Sviatoslav he formed a sort of princely triumvirate which jointly waged war on the steppe nomads, Polovtsy, and compiled the \"Russkaya Pravda\", the first law code of the state. In 1055, Vsevolod launched an expedition against the Turks who had in the previous years expelled the Pechenegs from the Pontic steppes. He also made peace with the Cumans who appeared for the first time in Europe in the same year. The Cumans invaded his principality in 1061 and routed Vsevolod in a battle. Vsevolod persuaded his brother, Iziaslav, and their distant cousin, Vseslav, to join him and they together attacked the Torks in 1060.\nIn 1067, Vsevolod's Greek wife died and he soon married a Kypchak princess, Anna Polovetskaya. They had a son, Rostislav, who drowned after the Battle of the Stugna River, and daughters, one becoming a nun and another, Eupraxia of Kiev, marrying Emperor Henry IV.\nThe Cumans again invaded Kievan Rus' in 1068. The three brothers united their forces against them, but the Cumans routed them on the Alta River. After their defeat, Vsevolod withdrew to Pereyaslav. However, its citizens rose up in open rebellion, dethroned Iziaslav, and liberated and proclaimed Vseslav their grand prince. Vsevolod and Sviatoslav made no attempt to expel the usurper from Kiev.\nVsevolod supported Sviatoslav against Iziaslav. They forced their brother to flee from Kiev in 1073. Feodosy, the saintly \"hegumen\" or head of the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev remained loyal to Iziaslav, and refused lunch with Sviatoslav and Vsevolod.\nAfter Sviatoslav's death in 1076, Vsevolod enthroned himself in Kiev for a few months before fleeing in early 1077. Once he was back in Kiev, Iziaslav granted Sviatoslav's former principality to Vsevolod, but Sviatoslav's sons considered the Principality of Chernigov as their own patrimony or \"otchina\". Oleg Sviatoslavich made an alliance with the Cumans and invaded Chernigov. Iziaslav came to Vsevolod's rescue and they forced Oleg to retreat, but Iziaslav was murdered in the battle.\nReign.\nAfter Iziaslav's death, Vsevolod, as their father's only surviving son, took the Kievan throne, thus uniting the three core principalities\u2014Kiev, Chernigov and Pereyaslavl\u2014in Kievan Rus'. He appointed his eldest son, Vladimir Monomach, to administer Chernigov.\nThe \"Primary Chronicle\" writes that the \"people no longer had access to the Prince's justice, judges became corrupt and venal\". Vsevolod followed his young councilors' advice instead of that of his old retainers in his last years.\nVsevolod spoke five foreign languages, according to Vladimir Monomach's \"Autobiography\". Historian George Vernadsky believes that these probably included Greek and Cuman, because of the nationality of his two wives, and that he likely spoke Latin, Norse, and Ossetian. He lost most of his battles; his eldest son, Vladimir Monomakh, a grand and famous warrior, did most of the fighting for his father. The last years of his reign were clouded by grave illness, and Vladimir Monomakh presided over the government.\nChildren.\nVsevolod and his first wife Anastasia, a relative of Constantine IX Monomachos, had children:\nVsevolod and his second wife Anna Polovetskaya had children:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40469", "revid": "35971249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40469", "title": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "text": "Capital city of Minnesota, United States\nSaint Paul (often abbreviated St. Paul) is the capital city of the U.S. state of Minnesota and the county seat of Ramsey County. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 311,527, making it Minnesota's second-most populous city and the 63rd-most populous in the United States. Saint Paul and neighboring Minneapolis form the core of the Twin Cities metropolitan area, the third most populous in the Midwest with around 3.7 million residents.\nThe Minnesota State Capitol and the state government offices sit on a hill next to downtown Saint Paul overlooking a bend in the Mississippi River. Local cultural offerings include the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts, and the Minnesota History Center. Three of the region's professional sports teams play in Saint Paul: the Minnesota Wild and Frost (at the Grand Casino Arena) and Minnesota United FC (at Allianz Field). The minor-league baseball team the St. Paul Saints play at CHS Field, from their major-league affiliate the Minnesota Twins in downtown Minneapolis.\nThe Legislative Assembly of the Minnesota Territory established the Town of Saint Paul as its capital near existing Dakota Sioux settlements in November 1849. Named after a log chapel established by Lucien Galtier, it remained a town until 1854. The city rose to prominence as the headquarters of 19th-century industrialist James J. Hill's railroad empire, with his transcontinental Great Northern Railway then one of the nation's most dominant. Saint Paul has a mayor\u2013council government. The mayor is Melvin Carter III, who was first elected in 2018.\nHistory.\nBurial mounds in present-day Indian Mounds Park suggest the area was inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about 2,000 years ago. From the early 17th century to 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a band of the Dakota people, lived near the mounds at the village of Kaposia and consider the area encompassing present-day Saint Paul Bd\u00f3te, the site of creation for their people. The Dakota called the area ('white cliffs') for its exposed white sandstone cliffs on the river's eastern side. The Imniza-Ska were full of caves that were useful to the Dakota. The explorer Jonathan Carver documented the historic Wakan Tipi in the bluff below the burial mounds in 1767. In the Menominee language Saint Paul was called , which means 'ribbon, silk or satin village', suggesting its role in trade throughout the region after the introduction of European goods.\nAfter the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, U.S. Army Lieutenant Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately of land from the indigenous Dakota in 1805 to establish a fort. A military reservation was intended for the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers on both sides of the Mississippi up to Saint Anthony Falls. All of what is now the Highland Park neighborhood was included in this. Pike planned a second military reservation at the confluence of the St. Croix and Mississippi rivers. In 1819, Fort Snelling was built at the Minnesota and Mississippi confluence. The 1837 Treaty with the Sioux ceded all tribal lands east of the Mississippi to the U.S. government. Chief Little Crow III moved his village, Kaposia, from south of Mounds Park across the river a few miles onto Dakota land. Fur traders, explorers, and settlers came to the area for the fort's security. Many were French-Canadians who predated American pioneers by some time. A whiskey trade flourished among the squatters and the fort's commander evicted them all from the fort's reservation. Fur trader turned bootlegger \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant, who set up business just outside the reservation, particularly irritated the commander. By the early 1840s, a community had developed nearby that locals called \"Pig's Eye\" () or \"Pig's Eye Landing\" after Parrant's popular tavern. In 1842, a raiding party of Ojibwe attacked the Kaposia encampment south of Saint Paul. A battle ensued where a creek drained into wetlands two miles south of Wakan Tipi. The creek was thereafter called Battle Creek and is today parkland. In the 1840s-70s the M\u00e9tis brought their oxen and Red River Carts down Kellogg Street to Lambert's landing to send buffalo hides to market from the Red River of the North. Saint Paul was the southern terminus of the Red River Trails. \nIn 1841, Catholic missionary Lucien Galtier was sent to minister to the French Canadians at Mendota. He had a chapel he named for St. Paul built on the bluff above the riverboat landing downriver from Fort Snelling. Galtier informed the settlers that they were to adopt the chapel's name for the settlement and cease the use of \"Pig's Eye\". In 1847, New York educator Harriet Bishop moved to the settlement and opened the city's first school. The Minnesota Territory was created in 1849 with Saint Paul as the capital. The U.S. Army made the territory's first improved road, Point Douglas Fort Ripley Military Road, in 1850. It passed through what became Saint Paul neighborhoods. In 1857, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter, but Joe Rolette, a territorial legislator, stole the text of the bill and went into hiding, preventing the move.\nThe year 1858 saw more than 1,000 steamboats service Saint Paul, making it a gateway for settlers to the Minnesota frontier or Dakota Territory. Geography was a primary reason the city became a transportation hub. The location was the last good point to land riverboats coming upriver due to the river valley's topography. For a time, Saint Paul was called \"The Last City of the East\". Fort Snelling was important to Saint Paul from the start. Direct access from Saint Paul did not happen until the 7th bridge was built in 1880. Before that, there was a cable ferry crossing dating to at latest the 1840s. Once streetcars appeared, a new bridge to Saint Paul was built in 1904. Until the town built its first jail the fort's brig served Saint Paul. Industrialist James J. Hill founded his railroad empire in Saint Paul. The Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific Railway were both headquartered in Saint Paul until they merged with the Burlington Northern. Today they are part of the BNSF Railway.\nOn August 20, 1904, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged hundreds of downtown buildings, causing $1.78 million ($ million today) in damages and ripping spans from the High Bridge. During the 1960s, in conjunction with urban renewal, Saint Paul razed neighborhoods west of downtown for the creation of the interstate freeway system. From 1959 to 1961, the Rondo neighborhood was demolished for the construction of Interstate 94. The loss of that African American enclave brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities. The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community.\nDowntown Saint Paul had skyscraper-building booms beginning in the 1970s. Because the city center is directly beneath the flight path into the airport across the river there is a height restriction for all construction. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is the location of the Hmong Archives.\nGeography.\nSaint Paul's history and growth as a landing port are tied to water. The city's defining physical characteristic, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that served the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.\nThe Mississippi River forms a municipal boundary on part of the city's west, southwest, and southeast sides. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, lies to the west. Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, Roseville, and Maplewood are north, with Maplewood lying to the east. The cities of West Saint Paul and South Saint Paul are to the south, as are Lilydale, Mendota, and Mendota Heights, across the river from the city. The city's largest lakes are Pig's Eye Lake, which is part of the Mississippi, Lake Phalen, and Lake Como. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.\nThe Parks and Recreation department is responsible for 160 parks and 41 recreation centers. The city ranked #2 in park access and quality, after only Minneapolis, in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the top 100 park systems across the United States according to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.\nNeighborhoods.\nSaint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into 17 Planning Districts, created in 1979 to allow neighborhoods to participate in governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The planning districts mostly represent traditional neighborhoods and combinations of smaller neighborhoods within the city.\nThe city's 17 Planning Districts are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nSaint Paul has a humid continental climate typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and humid. On the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (\"Dfa\"). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.\nDue to its northerly location and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Saint Paul is sometimes subjected to cold Arctic air masses, especially during late December, January, and February. The average annual temperature of gives the Minneapolis\u2212Saint Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S.\nSaint Paul is expected to be affected by climate change. More extreme heat waves are expected, as is increased precipitation in the spring and summer, which could cause river and flash flooding. Vector-borne transmission of such diseases as West Nile virus, Lyme disease, and human anaplasmosis may increase due to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the census of 2020, the population was 311,527.

Male full-time workers had a median income of $50,186 versus $45,541 for female workers. The per capita income was $32,779. About 13.2% of families and 17.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.0% of those under age 18 and 10.1% of those age 65 or over. Of the population age 25 and over, 87.6% were high school graduates or higher and 41.3% had a bachelor's degree or higher.\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 285,068 people, 111,001 households, and 59,689 families residing in the city.

The racial makeup of the city was 60.1% White, 15.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 15.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 4.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 9.6% of the population.\nThere were 111,001 households, of which 30.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.1% were married couples living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 46.2% were non-families. 35.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 3.33.\nThe median age in the city was 30.9 years. 25.1% of residents were under the age of 18; 13.9% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 29.6% were from 25 to 44; 22.6% were from 45 to 64; and 9% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.9% male and 51.1% female.\nEthnic history.\nThe earliest known inhabitants of the St. Paul area, from about 400 AD, were members of the Hopewell tradition, who buried their dead in mounds on the river bluffs (now Indian Mounds Park). The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century, who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe later occupied the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.\nBy 1800, French-Canadian explorers came through the region and attracted fur traders. Fort Snelling and Pig's Eye Tavern also brought the first Yankees from New England and English, Irish, and Scottish immigrants, who had enlisted in the army and settled nearby after discharge. These early settlers and entrepreneurs built houses on the heights north of the river. The first wave of immigration came with the Irish, who settled at Connemara Patch along the Mississippi, named for their home, Connemara, Ireland. The Irish became prolific in politics, city governance, and public safety, much to the chagrin of the Germans and French, who had grown into the majority. In 1850, the first of many groups of Swedish immigrants passed through St. Paul on their way to farming communities in northern and western regions of the territory. A large group settled in Swede Hollow, which later became home to Poles, Italians, and Mexicans. The last Swedish presence moved up St. Paul's East Side along Payne Avenue in the 1950s.\nOf people who specified European ancestry in the 2005\u201307 American Community Survey of St. Paul, 26.4% were German, 13.8% Irish, 8.4% Norwegian, 7.0% Swedish, and 6.2% English. There is also a visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 4.2% of the population.\nBy the 1980s, the Thomas-Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: \"Froschburg\"), became home to Vietnamese and other Southeast Asian people who had left their war-torn countries. A settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came soon after, and by 2000, St. Paul had the largest urban Hmong contingent in the nation.\nHmong Americans make up 11% of St. Paul's population as of 2021, and Saint Paul, as well as the Twin Cities area in general, is considered the center of Hmong culture in America. Hmongs are most concentrated in the neighborhoods of Frogtown, Payne-Phalen, Dayton's Bluff, the North End, and the Greater East Side, which are considered ethnic enclaves for Hmong Minnesotans, with a large number of businesses, organizations, and events catering to the Hmong population, such as the Hmongtown Marketplace in Frogtown.\nOther large Southeast Asian populations live in Saint Paul, particularly Burmese Americans of the Karen and Karenni ethnic group, who immigrated to the U.S. as refugees in the 2000s and 2010s due to internal conflict and discrimination in Myanmar. Minnesota is believed to have the largest population of Karen Americans, with a population of 12,000 in 2017, who are mostly concentrated in Saint Paul. Burmese and Karen residents of Saint Paul make up 5.2% of the population in 2021, and are most concentrated in the neighborhoods of the North End, Payne-Phalen, and Frogtown.\nMexican immigrants have settled in St. Paul since the 1930s; although Mexican populations exist throughout Saint Paul, by far the largest concentration of Mexican Americans is on St. Paul's West Side, where Mexicans form a plurality of the population; Mexico opened a foreign consulate there in 2005. Saint Paul also has a large population of Central Americans, particularly Salvadorans, throughout eastern St. Paul and the West Side.\nSt. Paul has become home to a large number of Somalis and Ethiopians since the 1990s, largely as refugees fleeing conflict in their home regions. Somali and Ethiopian populations are largest in the neighborhoods of Summit-University and Frogtown, where there are many businesses and organizations for Somali and Ethiopian populations.\nAfrican Americans in St. Paul initially entered through servitude to officers at Fort Snelling, marking a crucial point in their history. Despite the absence of legal slavery in Minnesota, Army officers were permitted to bring their enslaved individuals into the region. Today, African Americans are one of the largest groups among Saint Paul's population; African Americans make up approximately 14% of Saint Paul's population, the second-largest background group, before Hmongs and after German-Americans. The city's African American residents are concentrated in its central and eastern neighborhoods.\nMost St. Paul residents claiming religious affiliation are Christian, split between the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. The Roman Catholic presence comes from Irish, German, Scottish, and French Canadian settlers, later bolstered by Hispanic immigrants. There are Jewish synagogues such as Mount Zion Temple and significant populations of Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists. The city has been dubbed \"paganistan\" due to its large Wiccan population.\nEconomy.\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul\u2013Bloomington area employs 1,570,700 people in the private sector as of July 2008, 82.43% of whom work in private service providing-related jobs.\nMajor corporations headquartered in Saint Paul include Ecolab, a chemical and cleaning product company that the \"Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal\" named in 2008 as the eighth-best place to work in the Twin Cites for companies with 1,000 full-time Minnesota employees, and Securian Financial Group Inc.\nThe 3M Company moved to St. Paul in 1910. It built an art deco headquarters at 900 Bush Avenue that still stands. Headquarters operations moved to the suburban Maplewood campus in 1964. 3M manufacturing continued for a couple more decades until all St. Paul operations ceased.\nThe city was home to the Ford Motor Company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant, which opened in 1924 and closed at the end of 2011. The plant was in Highland Park on the Mississippi River, adjacent to Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River, which generates hydroelectric power. The site is being redeveloped into a mixed-used area called Highland Bridge which, when complete, will include 3,800 housing units, most opening in 2023.\nSaint Paul has financed city development with tax increment financing (TIF). In 2018, it had 55 TIF districts. Projects that have benefited from TIF funding include the St. Paul Saints stadium, and the affordable housing along the Twin Cities Metro Green Line.\nHousing.\nIn November 2021, Saint Paul became the only Midwestern city to regulate rent increases when voters passed a rent control ordinance as part of a larger effort to curb rising housing costs. The law limited annual rent increases to 3% and prohibited higher increases after a tenant vacated a unit. This resulted in an 80% reduction in requests for new housing permits, while in Minneapolis, permits were up 70%. Saint Paul's rent control initiative has since been significantly rolled back. In September 2022, the Saint Paul City Council amended the law to allow higher vacancy increases and exempt units built in the preceding or following 20 years from the increase cap. Since then, according to Zillow estimates, St. Paul's rents have grown at a pace similar to Minneapolis's, since the ordinance gives landlords several options to raise rents by more than 3%.\nAs of the 2020 U.S. census, Saint Paul had about 134,080 housing units and 126,409 households, with an average of 2.3 persons per household. The median value of owner-occupied homes was approximately $293,500, and tenure is nearly evenly split between owner- and renter-occupied units.\nCulture.\nEvery January, Saint Paul hosts the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, a tradition that began in 1886 when a New York reporter called Saint Paul \"another Siberia\". The organizers had a model in the Montreal Winter Carnival the year before. Architect A. C. Hutchinson designed the Montreal ice castle and was hired to design St. Paul's first. The event has now been held 135 times with an attendance of 350,000. It includes an ice sculpting competition, a snow sculpting competition, a medallion treasure hunt, food, activities, and an ice palace when it can be arranged. The Como Zoo and Conservatory and adjoining Japanese Garden are popular year-round. The historic Landmark Center in downtown Saint Paul hosts cultural and arts organizations. The city's recreation sites include Indian Mounds Park, Battle Creek Regional Park, Harriet Island Regional Park, Highland Park, the Wabasha Street Caves, Lake Como, Lake Phalen, and Rice Park, as well as several areas abutting the Mississippi River. The Irish Fair of Minnesota is held annually at the Harriet Island Pavilion area. The country's largest Hmong American sports festival, the Freedom Festival, is held the first weekend of July at McMurray Field near Como Park.\nThe city is associated with the Minnesota State Fair in neighboring Falcon Heights just west of Como Park. The fair dates to before statehood. With the competing interests of Minneapolis and St. Paul, it was held on \"neutral ground\" between both. That area refused to become part of St. Paul or Roseville and became Falcon Heights in the 1950s. The University of Minnesota Saint Paul Campus is actually in Falcon Heights.\nFort Snelling is often identified as being in St. Paul but is actually its own unorganized territory. The eastern part of Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory (MSP included) has a St. Paul mailing address. The western side has a Minneapolis ZIP code.\nSaint Paul is the birthplace of cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, who lived in Merriam Park from infancy until 1960. Schulz's \"Peanuts\" inspired giant, decorated sculptures around the city, a Chamber of Commerce promotion in the late 1990s. Other notable residents include writer F. Scott Fitzgerald and playwright August Wilson, who premiered many of the ten plays in his Pittsburgh Cycle at the local Penumbra Theater.\nThe Ordway Center for the Performing Arts hosts theater productions and the Minnesota Opera is a founding tenant. RiverCentre, attached to Grand Casino Arena, serves as the city's convention center. The city has contributed to the music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues. Great jazz musicians have passed through the influential Artists' Quarter, first established in the 1970s in Whittier, Minneapolis, and moved to downtown Saint Paul in 1994. Artists' Quarter also hosts the Soapboxing Poetry Slam, home of the 2009 National Poetry Slam Champions. At The Black Dog, in Lowertown, many French or European jazz musicians (Evan Parker, Tony Hymas, Beno\u00eet Delbecq, Fran\u00e7ois Corneloup) have met Twin Cities musicians and started new groups touring in Europe. Groups and performers such as Fantastic Merlins, Dean Magraw/Davu Seru, Merciless Ghosts, and Willie Murphy are regulars. The Turf Club in Midway has been a music scene landmark since the 1940s. Saint Paul is also the home base of the internationally acclaimed Rose Ensemble. As an Irish stronghold, the city boasts popular Irish pubs with live music, such as Shamrocks, The Dubliner, and until its closure in 2019, O'Gara's. The internationally acclaimed Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the nation's only full-time professional chamber orchestra. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat on the Mississippi River began in 1958 with Minnesota's first centennial celebration.\nSaint Paul has a number of museums, including the University of Minnesota's Goldstein Museum of Design, the Minnesota Children's Museum, the Schubert Club Museum of Musical Instruments, the Minnesota Museum of American Art, the Traces Center for History and Culture, the Minnesota History Center, the Alexander Ramsey House, the James J. Hill House, the Minnesota Transportation Museum, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and the Twin City Model Railroad Museum.\nSports.\nThe Saint Paul division of Parks and Recreation runs over 1,500 organized sports teams.\nSaint Paul hosts a number of professional, semi-professional, and amateur sports teams. The Minnesota Wild play their home games at downtown Saint Paul's Grand Casino Arena, which opened in 2000. The Wild brought the NHL back to Minnesota for the first time since 1993, when the Minnesota North Stars left the state for Dallas, Texas. The World Hockey Association's Minnesota Fighting Saints played in Saint Paul from 1972 to 1977. Citing the history of hockey in the Twin Cities and teams at all levels, \"Sports Illustrated\" called Saint Paul the new Hockeytown U.S.A. in 2007.\nThe Grand Casino Arena, a multipurpose entertainment and sports venue, can host concerts and accommodate nearly all sporting events. It occupies the site of the demolished Saint Paul Civic Center. The Grand Casino Arena hosts the Minnesota high school boys hockey tournament, the Minnesota high school girls' volleyball tournament, and concerts throughout the year. In 2004, it was named the best overall sports venue in the US by ESPN.\nThe St. Paul Saints are the city's Minor League Baseball team, which plays in the International League as an affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. There have been several different teams called the Saints over the years. Founded in 1884, they were shut down in 1961 after the Minnesota Twins moved to Bloomington. The Saints were brought back in 1993 as an independent baseball team in the Northern League, moving to the American Association in 2006. They joined affiliated baseball in 2021. Their home games are played at the open-air CHS Field in downtown's Lowertown Historic District. Four noted Major League All-Star baseball players are natives of Saint Paul: Hall of Fame outfielder Dave Winfield, Hall of Fame infielder Paul Molitor, Hall of Fame pitcher Jack Morris, and Hall of Fame catcher and first baseman Joe Mauer, all of whom played for the Minnesota Twins during their careers. The all-black St. Paul Colored Gophers played four seasons in Saint Paul from 1907 to 1911.\nThe St. Paul Twin Stars of the National Premier Soccer League play their home games at Macalester Stadium. St. Paul's first curling club was founded in 1888. The current club, the St. Paul Curling Club, was founded in 1912 and is the largest curling club in the United States. Minnesota Roller Derby is a flat-track roller derby league based in the Roy Wilkins Auditorium, made up of women and gender expansive athletes. Minnesota's oldest athletic organization, the Minnesota Boat Club, resides in the Mississippi River on Raspberry Island. Saint Paul is also home to Circus Juventas, the largest circus arts school in North America.\nOn March 25, 2015, Major League Soccer announced that it had awarded its 23rd MLS franchise to Minnesota United FC, a team from the lower-level North American Soccer League. Bill McGuire and his ownership group, which includes Jim Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves, former Minnesota Wild investor Glen Nelson, and his daughter Wendy Carlson Nelson of the Carlson hospitality company, had intended to build a privately financed soccer-specific stadium in Downtown Minneapolis near the Minneapolis Farmer's Market. But their plan was met with heavy opposition from former Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said her city was suffering from \"stadium fatigue\" after building three stadiums for the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Golden Gophers, within a six-year span. On July 1, 2015, after failing to reach an agreement with the city of Minneapolis, McGuire and his partners turned their focus to Saint Paul.\nOn October 23, 2015, Bill McGuire of Minnesota United FC and former Saint Paul Mayor Chris Coleman announced that a privately financed soccer-specific stadium would be built on the vacant Metro Transit bus barn site in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood near the intersection of Snelling Avenue and University Avenue. It is midway between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis. The stadium, Allianz Field, opened in April 2019 and seats 19,400. The team began playing in the MLS in 2017.\nThe Minnesota Whitecaps began play in the Western Women's Hockey League in 2004 before going independent in 2010 when that league folded. In 2018, the Whitecaps joined the Premier Hockey Federation (then the National Women's Hockey League) as its fifth franchise. The team won the Isobel Cup in its first season in the new league. In the summer of 2023, the PHF ceased operations as part of the launch of a new, unified professional women's league, the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL). Minnesota Frost was awarded one of the six charter franchises in the new league, and it was announced that the new team would play its home games at the Grand Casino Arena.\nThe Timberwolves, Twins, Vikings, and Lynx all play in Minneapolis.\nGovernment and politics.\nSaint Paul has a variant of the strong mayor\u2013council form of government. The mayor is the chief executive and chief administrative officer of the city and the seven-member city council is its legislative body. The mayor is elected by the entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different geographic wards of approximately equal population. The first female councilor, Elizabeth DeCourcy, was elected in 1956. Municipal elections in Saint Paul use ranked choice voting. Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms.\nThe current mayor is Melvin Carter (DFL), Saint Paul's first African-American mayor. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952. As of 2024, following the 2023 elections, all seven city councilors are women, making Saint Paul potentially the largest city in American history with an all-female legislative body.\nThe city is also the county seat of Ramsey County, named for Alexander Ramsey, the state's first governor. The county once spanned much of the present-day metropolitan area and was originally to be named Saint Paul County after the city. Today it is geographically the smallest county and the most densely populated. Ramsey is the only home rule county in Minnesota; the seven-member Board of Commissioners appoints a county manager whose office is in the combination city hall/county courthouse along with the Minnesota Second Judicial Courts. The nearby Law Enforcement Center houses the Ramsey County Sheriff's office.\nState and federal.\nSaint Paul is the capital of Minnesota. The city hosts the capitol building, designed by Saint Paul resident Cass Gilbert, and the House and Senate office buildings. The Minnesota Governor's Residence, which is used for some state functions, is on Summit Avenue. The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (affiliated with the Democratic Party) is headquartered in Saint Paul. Numerous state departments and services are also headquartered in Saint Paul, such as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\nThe city is split into four Minnesota Senate districts (64, 65, 66 and 67) and eight Minnesota House of Representatives districts (64A, 64B, 65A, 65B, 66A, 66B, 67A and 67B), all of which are held by Democrats.\nSaint Paul is the heart of Minnesota's 4th congressional district, represented by Democrat Betty McCollum. The district has been in DFL hands without interruption since 1949. Minnesota is represented in the U.S. Senate by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, a former Hennepin County Attorney, and Democrat Tina Smith, a former lieutenant governor of Minnesota.\nEducation.\nSaint Paul is second in the United States in the number of higher education institutions per capita, behind Boston. Higher education institutions that call Saint Paul home include three public and eight private colleges and universities and five post-secondary institutions. Well-known colleges and universities include the Saint Catherine University, Concordia University, Hamline University, Macalester College, and the University of St. Thomas. Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system members Metropolitan State University, Saint Paul College, and Minnesota State's MinnPoly Institute (colocated in Saint Paul College's basement) are based in Saint Paul, as is Mitchell Hamline School of Law.\nThe Saint Paul Public Schools district is the state's largest school district and serves approximately 39,000 students. The district is extremely diverse with students from families speaking 90 different languages, although only five languages are used for most school communication: English, Spanish, Hmong, Karen, and Somali. The district runs 82 different schools, including 52 elementary schools, 12 middle schools, seven high schools, ten alternative schools, and one special education school, employing over 6,500 teachers and staff. The school district also oversees community education programs for pre-K and adult learners, including Early Childhood Family Education, GED Diploma, language programs, and various learning opportunities for community members of all ages. In 2006, Saint Paul Public Schools celebrated its 150th anniversary. Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute.\nA variety of K-12 private, parochial, and public charter schools are also represented in the city. In 1992, Saint Paul became the first city in the US to sponsor and open a charter school, now found in most states across the nation. Saint Paul is home to 21 charter schools and 38 private schools. The Saint Paul Public Library system includes a central library, twelve branch locations, and a bookmobile.\nMedia.\nSaint Paul residents can receive 10 broadcast television stations, five of which broadcast from Saint Paul. One newspaper, the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\", and several monthly or semimonthly neighborhood papers serve the city. Several media outlets based in Minneapolis also serve the Saint Paul community, including the \"Star Tribune\".\nSaint Paul is home to two national broadcast companies. Hubbard Broadcasting is headquartered on the line between Saint Paul and Minneapolis on University Avenue.\nMinnesota Public Radio (MPR) is a three-format system that broadcasts on nearly 40 stations around the Midwest. It delivers local news and information, classical, and The Current (which plays a wide variety of music). The station has 110,000 regional members and more than 1 million listeners each week throughout the Upper Midwest, the largest audience of any regional public radio network. Its parent company, American Public Media Group, creates and distributes programming that reaches millions listeners, most notably \"Marketplace\", hosted by Kai Ryssdal.\nTransportation.\nInterstate and roadways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nResidents use Interstate 35E running north\u2013south and Interstate 94 running east\u2013west. Trunk highways include U.S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 280, and Minnesota State Highway 5. Saint Paul has several unique roads, such as Ayd Mill Road, Phalen Boulevard, and Shepard Road/Warner Road, that diagonally follow particular geographic features in the city. Biking is also gaining popularity, due to the creation of more paved bike lanes that connect to other bike routes throughout the metropolitan area. Downtown Saint Paul has a five-mile (8\u00a0km) enclosed skyway system over 25 city blocks. The Avenue of the Saints connects Saint Paul with St. Louis, Missouri.\nThe layout of city streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura appeared on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", and remarked that the streets were designed by \"drunken Irishmen\". He later apologized, though people had been complaining about the fractured grid system for more than a century by that point. Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.\nMass transit.\nMetro Transit provides bus service and light rail in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area. The METRO Green Line is an light rail line that connects downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis with 14 stations in Saint Paul. The Green Line runs west along University Avenue, through the University of Minnesota campus, until it links up and then shares stations with the METRO Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis. Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014. The Green Line averaged 42,500 rides per weekday in 2018. Planning is underway for the Riverview Corridor, a rail line that will connect downtown Saint Paul to the airport and Mall of America.\nThe METRO A Line opened in 2016 as Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul's first arterial bus rapid transit line. The A Line connects the Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. Future METRO lines are planned that will serve Saint Paul with the B Line and E Line Line running primarily on arterial streets, and the Gold Line and Purple Line running primarily in their own right of way.\nRailroad.\nAmtrak's \"Empire Builder\" between Chicago and Seattle or Portland stops twice daily in each direction at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Depot. Ridership on the train increased about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. A Minnesota Department of Transportation study found that increased daily service to Chicago should be economically viable, especially if it originates in Saint Paul and does not experience delays from the rest of the western route of the \"Empire Builder\". Based on that proposition, a new Amtrak line, the \"Borealis\", began service on May 21, 2024, running the segment of the \"Empire Builder\" route between Saint Paul and Chicago, with several stops along the way, including one in Milwaukee.\nSaint Paul is the site of the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. BNSF operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards around the city.\nAirports.\nHolman Airfield is across the river from downtown St. Paul. Lamprey Lake was there until the Army Corps of Engineers filled it with dredgings starting in the early 1920s. Northwest Airlines began initial operations from Holman in 1926. During WWII Northwest had a contract to install upgraded radar systems in B-24s, employing 5,000 at the airfield. After WWII, Holman Airfield competed with the Speedway Field for the Twin Cities' growing aviation industry and lost out in the end. Today, Holman is a reliever airport run by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. It is home to Minnesota's Air National Guard and a flight training school and is tailored to local corporate aviation. There are three runways, with the Holman Field Administration Building and Riverside Hangar on the National Register of Historic Places. The original Northwest Airlines building's historical importance was realized only after demolition commenced.\nFor the most part, Saint Paul's aviation needs are served by the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), which sits on in the Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory bordering the city to the southwest. MSP serves 17 commercial passenger airlines and is the hub of Delta Air Lines and Sun Country Airlines.\nSister cities.\nSaint Paul's sister cities are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedal of Honor recipients:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "40471", "revid": "50052465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40471", "title": "Thessaloniki", "text": "Second-largest city in Greece\nThessaloniki (; ; also known by various spellings and names) is a city in northern Greece. The nation's second-largest, with slightly over one million inhabitants in its metropolitan area, it is the capital of the geographic region of Macedonia, the administrative region of Central Macedonia and the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace. It is also known in Greek as , literally \"the co-capital\", a reference to its historical status as the \"co-reigning\" city () of the Byzantine Empire alongside Constantinople.\nThessaloniki is located on the Thermaic Gulf, at the northwest corner of the Aegean Sea. It is bounded on the west by the delta of the Axios. The municipality of Thessaloniki, the historical centre, had a population of 319,045 in 2021, while the Thessaloniki metropolitan area had 1,006,112 inhabitants and the greater region had 1,092,919. It is Greece's second major economic, industrial, commercial and political centre, and a major transportation hub for Greece and southeastern Europe, notably through the Port of Thessaloniki. The city is renowned for its festivals, events and vibrant cultural life in general. Events such as the Thessaloniki International Fair and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival are held annually. Thessaloniki was the 2014 European Youth Capital. The city's main university, Aristotle University, is the largest in Greece and the Balkans.\nThe city was founded in 315\u00a0BC by Cassander of Macedon, who named it after his wife Thessalonike, daughter of Philip II of Macedon and sister of Alexander the Great. It was built 40\u00a0km southeast of Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedonia. An important metropolis by the Roman period, Thessaloniki was the second largest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1430 and remained an important seaport and multi-ethnic metropolis during the nearly five centuries of Turkish rule, with churches, mosques, and synagogues co-existing side by side. From the 16th to the 20th century it was the only Jewish-majority city in Europe. It passed from the Ottoman Empire to the Kingdom of Greece on 8 November 1912. Thessaloniki exhibits Byzantine architecture, including numerous Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments, a World Heritage Site, and several Roman, Ottoman and Sephardic Jewish structures.\nIn 2013, \"National Geographic Magazine\" included Thessaloniki in its top tourist destinations worldwide, while in 2014 \"Financial Times\" FDI magazine (Foreign Direct Investments) declared Thessaloniki as the best mid-sized European city of the future for human capital and lifestyle.&lt;ref name=\"European Cities and Regions of the Future 2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nNames and etymology.\nThe original name of the city was . It was named after the princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half-sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means \"Thessalian victory\", from Thessalos, and 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352\u00a0BC).\nMinor variants are also found, including , , , and .\nThe name is first attested in Greek in the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), and is common in folk songs, but it must have originated earlier, as al-Idrisi called it \"Salunik\" already in the 12th century. It is the basis for the city's name in other languages: (\"Solun\u016d\") in Old Church Slavonic, () in Judeo-Spanish (\u05e9\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05d9 prior to the 19th century) () in Hebrew, \"Selanik\" in Albanian, (\"Sel\u00e2nik\") in Ottoman Turkish and in modern Turkish, in Italian, \"Solun\" or in the local and neighboring South Slavic languages, (\"Salon\u00edki\") in Russian, in Aromanian and in Megleno-Romanian.\nIn English, the city can be called Thessaloniki, Salonika, Thessalonica, Salonica, Thessalonika, Saloniki, Thessalonike, or Thessalonice. In printed texts, the most common name and spelling until the early 20th century was Thessalonica (), matching the Latin name; through most of rest of the 20th century, it was Salonika (). By about 1985, the most common single name became Thessaloniki. The forms with the Latin ending \"-a\" taken together remain more common than those with the phonetic Greek ending \"-i\" and much more common than the ancient transliteration \"-e\".\nThessaloniki was revived as the city's official name in 1912, when it joined the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars. In local speech, the city's name is typically pronounced with a dark and deep \"L\", characteristic of the accent of the modern Macedonian dialect of Greek. The name is often abbreviated as .\nHistory.\nFrom classical antiquity to the Roman Empire.\nThe city was founded around 315\u00a0BC by the King Cassander of Macedon, on or near the site of the ancient town of Therma and 26 other local villages. He named it after his wife Thessalonike, a half-sister of Alexander the Great and princess of Macedonia as daughter of Philip II. Under the kingdom of Macedonia the city retained its own autonomy and parliament and evolved to become the most important city in Macedonia. Nonetheless, Pella remained the capital of Macedon until its fall.\nTwenty years after the fall of the Kingdom of Macedonia, in 148 BC, Thessalonica was made the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia. Thessalonica became a free city of the Roman Republic under Mark Antony in 41\u00a0BC. It grew to be an important trade hub located on the \"Via Egnatia\", the road connecting Dyrrhachium with Byzantium, which facilitated trade between Thessaloniki and great centres of commerce such as Rome and Byzantium. Thessaloniki also lies at the southern end of the main north\u2013south route through the Balkans along the valleys of the Morava and Axios river valleys, thereby linking the Balkans with the rest of Greece. The city became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia.\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about 50 AD, Thessaloniki was also one of the early centres of Christianity; while on his second missionary journey, Paul the Apostle visited this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church. Later, Paul wrote letters to the new church at Thessaloniki, with two letters to the church under his name appearing in the Biblical canon as First and Second Thessalonians. Some scholars hold that the First Epistle to the Thessalonians is the first written book of the New Testament.\nIn 306 AD, Thessaloniki acquired a patron saint, St. Demetrius, a Christian whom Galerius is said to have put to death. Most scholars agree with Hippolyte Delehaye's theory that Demetrius was not a Thessaloniki native, but his veneration was transferred to Thessaloniki when it replaced Sirmium as the main military base in the Balkans. A basilical church dedicated to St. Demetrius, Hagios Demetrios, was first built in the fifth century AD and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided into the tetrarchy, Thessaloniki became the administrative capital of one of the four portions of the Empire under Galerius Maximianus Caesar, where Galerius commissioned an imperial palace, a new hippodrome, a triumphal arch and a mausoleum, among other structures.\nThessaloniki remained the administrative center of the Diocese of Macedonia.\nIn 379, when the Roman Prefecture of Illyricum was divided between the East and West Roman Empires, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum. The following year, the Edict of Thessalonica made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. In 390, troops under the Roman Emperor Theodosius I led a massacre against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the detention of a favorite charioteer. By the time of the Fall of Rome in 476, Thessaloniki was the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire.\nByzantine era and Middle Ages.\nFrom the first years of the Byzantine Empire, Thessaloniki was considered the second city in the Empire after Constantinople, both in terms of wealth and size, with a population of 150,000 in the mid-12th century. The city held this status until its transfer to Venetian control in 1423. In the 14th century, the city's population exceeded 100,000 to 150,000, making it larger than London at the time.\nDuring the sixth and seventh centuries, the area around Thessaloniki was invaded by Avars and Slavs, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the city several times, as narrated in the \"Miracles of Saint Demetrius\". The written sources stipulate that many Slavs settled in the hinterland of Thessaloniki which became known as 'Macedonian Sclavinia'. In the ninth century, the Byzantine missionaries Cyril and Methodius, both natives of the city, created the first literary language of the Slavs, the Old Church Slavonic, most likely based on the Slavic dialect used in the hinterland of their hometown.\nA naval attack led by Byzantine converts to Islam (including Leo of Tripoli) in 904 resulted in the sack of the city.\nThe economic expansion of the city continued through the 12th century as the rule of the Komnenoi emperors expanded Byzantine control to the north. Thessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade and incorporated the city and its surrounding territories in the Kingdom of Thessalonica \u2014 which then became the largest vassal of the Latin Empire. In 1224, the Kingdom of Thessalonica was overrun by the Despotate of Epirus, a remnant of the former Byzantine Empire, under Theodore Komnenos Doukas who crowned himself Emperor, and the city became the capital of the short-lived Empire of Thessalonica. Following his defeat at Klokotnitsa however in 1230, the Empire of Thessalonica became a vassal state of the Second Bulgarian Empire until it was recovered again in 1246, this time by the Nicaean Empire.\nIn 1342, the city saw the rise of the Commune of the Zealots, an anti-aristocratic party formed of sailors and the poor, which is nowadays described as social-revolutionary. The city was practically independent of the rest of the Empire, as it had its own government, a form of republic. The zealot movement was overthrown in 1350 and the city was reunited with the rest of the Empire.\nThe capture of Gallipoli by the Ottomans in 1354 kicked off a rapid Turkish expansion in the southern Balkans, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. By 1369, the Ottomans were able to conquer Adrianople (modern Edirne), which became their new capital until 1453. Thessalonica, ruled by Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391\u20131425) itself surrendered after a lengthy siege in 1383\u20131387, along with most of eastern and central Macedonia, to the forces of Sultan Murad I. Initially, the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the \"kharaj\" poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.\nThessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son S\u00fcleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios. Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415.\nThessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity after 1403, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa \u00c7elebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa \u00c7elebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383\u20131387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.\nIn 1423, Despot Andronikos Palaiologos ceded it to the Republic of Venice with the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were besieging the city. The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on 29 March 1430.\nOttoman period.\nWhen Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki and sacked it in 1430, contemporary reports estimated that about one-fifth of the city's population was enslaved. Ottoman artillery was used to secure the city's capture and bypass its double walls. Upon the conquest of Thessaloniki, some of its inhabitants escaped, including intellectuals such as Theodorus Gaza \"Thessalonicensis\" and Andronicus Callistus. However, the change of sovereignty from the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman one did not affect the city's prestige as a major imperial city and trading hub. Thessaloniki and Smyrna, although smaller in size than Constantinople, were the Ottoman Empire's most important trading hubs. Thessaloniki's importance was mostly in the field of shipping, but also in manufacturing, while most of the city's tradespeople were Jewish.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's population of Ottoman Muslims (including those of Turkish origin, as well as Albanian Muslim, Bulgarian Muslim, especially the Pomaks and Greek Muslim of convert origin) and Muslim Roma like the Sepe\u010dides Romani grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Sel\u00e2nik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Christian Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote community.\nSoon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of Christians had grown to 7,986, the Muslims to 8,575, and the Jews to 3,770. In 1519, according to Ottoman archives, the population of Thessaloniki numbered 1,374 Muslim households and 282 bachelors, for a total of 6,870, 1,078 Christian households and 355 bachelors, for a total of about 6,635, and 3,143 Hebrew households with 530 bachelors, for a total of 15,715, 54% of the city's population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regime's invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the Christian population from dominating the city. The city became both the largest Jewish city in the world and the only Jewish majority city in the world in the 16th century. As a result, Thessaloniki attracted persecuted Jews from all over the world.\nThessaloniki was the capital of the Sanjak of Selanik within the wider Rumeli Eyalet (Balkans) until 1826, and subsequently the capital of Selanik Eyalet (after 1867, the Selanik Vilayet). This consisted of the sanjaks of Selanik, Serres and Drama between 1826 and 1912.\nWith the break out of the Greek War of Independence in the spring of 1821, the governor Yusuf Bey imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the insurrection to the villages of Chalkidiki, he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The mulla of Thessaloniki, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: \"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Suba\u015f\u0131, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad.\" It would take until the end of the century for the city's Greek community to recover.\nThessaloniki was also a Janissary stronghold where novice Janissaries were trained. In June 1826, regular Ottoman soldiers attacked and destroyed the Janissary base in Thessaloniki while also killing over 10,000 Janissaries, an event known as The Auspicious Incident in Ottoman history. In 1870\u20131917, driven by economic growth, the city's population expanded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917.\nThe last few decades of Ottoman control over the city were an era of revival, particularly in terms of the city's infrastructure. It was at that time that the Ottoman administration of the city acquired an \"official\" face with the creation of the Government House while a number of new public buildings were built in the eclectic style in order to project the European face both of Thessaloniki and the Ottoman Empire. The city walls were torn down between 1869 and 1889, efforts for a planned expansion of the city are evident as early as 1879, the first tram service started in 1888 and the city streets were illuminated with electric lamp posts in 1908. In 1888, the Oriental Railway connected Thessaloniki to Central Europe via rail through Belgrade and to Monastir in 1893, while the Thessaloniki\u2013Istanbul Junction Railway connected it to Constantinople in 1896.\nMustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder of the modern republic of Turkey, was born in Thessaloniki (then known as Sel\u00e2nik in Ottoman Turkish) in 1881. His birthplace on \u0130slahhane Caddesi (now 17 Apostolou Street) is now the Atat\u00fcrk Museum and forms part of the Turkish consulate complex.\n20th century and beyond.\nIn the early 20th century, Thessaloniki was in the centre of radical activities by various groups; the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, founded in 1897, and the Greek Macedonian Committee, founded in 1903. In 1903, a Bulgarian anarchist group known as the Boatmen of Thessaloniki planted bombs in several buildings in Thessaloniki, including the Ottoman Bank, with some assistance from the IMRO. The Greek consulate in Ottoman Thessaloniki (now the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle) served as the centre of operations for the Greek guerillas.\nDuring this period, and since the 16th century, Thessaloniki's Jewish element was the most dominant; it was the only city in Europe where the Jews were a majority of the total population. The city was ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan. In 1890, its population had risen to 118,000, 47% of which were Jews, followed by Turks (22%), Greeks (14%), Bulgarians (8%), Roma (2%), and others (7%). By 1913, the ethnic composition of the city had changed so that the population stood at 157,889, with Jews at 39%, followed again by Turks (29%), Greeks (25%), Bulgarians (4%), Roma (2%), and others at 1%. Many varied religions were practiced and many languages spoken, including Judeo-Spanish, a dialect of Spanish spoken by the city's Jews.\nThessaloniki was also the centre of activities of the Young Turks, a political reform movement, whose goal was to replace the Ottoman Empire's absolute monarchy with a constitutional government. The Young Turks started out as an underground movement, until finally in 1908, they started the Young Turk Revolution from the city of Thessaloniki, which led to them gaining control over the Ottoman Empire and put an end to the Ottoman sultan's power. Eleftherias (Liberty) Square, where the Young Turks gathered at the outbreak of the revolution, is named after the event. Turkey's first president Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, who was born and raised in Thessaloniki, was a member of the Young Turks in his soldier days and also partook in the Young Turk Revolution.\nBalkan Wars and the end of Ottoman rule.\nAs the First Balkan War broke out, Greece declared war on the Ottoman Empire and expanded its borders. When Eleftherios Venizelos, Prime Minister at the time, was asked if the Greek army should move towards Thessaloniki or Monastir (now Bitola, Republic of North Macedonia), Venizelos replied \"\" (\"Thessaloniki, at all costs!\"). With the outnumbered Ottoman Army fighting a rearguard action against well-prepared Greek forces at Yenidje, Bulgarian troops advancing close by, and the Ottoman naval base at Thessaloniki blockaded by the Greek Navy, General Hasan Tahsin Pasha soon realised that it had become untenable to defend the city. The sinking of the Ottoman ironclad \"Feth-i B\u00fclend\" in Thessaloniki harbour on 31 October [O.S. 18 October] 1912, although militarily negligible, further damaged Ottoman morale.\nAs both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessaloniki, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. Ultimately it was decided to hand over the city to the Greeks, in part because there was a perception on the Ottoman side that the Greek troops would be more lenient towards its residents. Negotiations between the Greek and Turkish delegations were concluded at the village of Top\u00e7in on the outskirts of the city. On 8 November 1912 (26 October Old Style), the feast day of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius, the Greek Army accepted the peaceful and unconditional surrender of the 25,000-strong Ottoman garrison at Thessaloniki, bringing almost five centuries of Ottoman rule to an end. The Bulgarian army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Greece and Hasan Tahsin Pasha, commander of the city's defences, told the Bulgarian officials that \"I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered\".\nAfter the Second Balkan War, Thessaloniki and the rest of the Greek portion of Macedonia were officially annexed to Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913. On 18 March 1913 George I of Greece was assassinated in the city by Alexandros Schinas.\nWorld War I, the Great Fire, and population exchange.\nIn 1915, during World War I, a large Allied expeditionary force established a base at Thessaloniki for operations against pro-German Bulgaria. This culminated in the establishment of the Macedonian Front, also known as the Salonika front, and a temporary hospital run by the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service being set up in a disused factory. In 1916, pro-Venizelist Greek army officers and civilians, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, creating a pro-Allied temporary government by the name of the \"Provisional Government of National Defence\" that controlled the \"New Lands\" (lands that were gained by Greece in the Balkan Wars, most of Northern Greece including Greek Macedonia, the North Aegean as well as the island of Crete); the official government of the King in Athens, called in historiography as the \"State of Athens\", controlled \"Old Greece\" which was traditionally monarchist. The State of Thessaloniki was disestablished with the unification of the two opposing Greek governments under Venizelos, following the abdication of King Constantine in 1917.\nOn 30 December 1915 an Austrian air raid on Thessaloniki alarmed many town civilians and killed at least one person, and in response the Allied troops based there arrested the German, Austrian, Bulgarian and Turkish vice-consuls and their families and dependents and put them on a battleship, and billeted troops in their consulate buildings in Thessaloniki.\nMost of the old centre of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, which was started accidentally by an unattended kitchen fire on 18 August 1917. The fire swept through the centre of the city, leaving 72,000 people homeless; according to the Pallis Report, most of them were Jewish (50,000). Many businesses were destroyed, as a result, 70% of the population were unemployed. Two churches and many synagogues and mosques were lost. More than one quarter of the total population of approximately 271,157 became homeless. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton Thomas Mawson, and headed by French architect Ernest H\u00e9brard. Property values fell from 6.5\u00a0million Greek drachmas to 750,000.\nAfter the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War and during the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, a population exchange took place between Greece and Turkey. Over 160,000 ethnic Greeks deported from the former Ottoman Empire \u2013 particularly Greeks from Asia Minor and East Thrace were resettled in the city, changing its demographics. Additionally many of the city's Muslims, including Ottoman Greek Muslims, were deported to Turkey, ranging at about 20,000 people. This made the Greek element dominant, while the Jewish population was reduced to a minority for the first time since the 16th century.\nThis was part of an overall process of modern Hellenization, which affected nearly all minorities within Greece, turning the region into a hotspot of ethnic nationalism.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II Thessaloniki was heavily bombarded by Fascist Italy (with 232 people dead, 871 wounded and over 800 buildings damaged or destroyed in November 1940 alone), and, the Italians having failed in their invasion of Greece, it fell to the forces of Nazi Germany on 8 April 1941 and went under German occupation. The Nazis soon forced the Jewish residents into a ghetto near the railroads and on 15 March 1943 began the deportation of the city's Jews to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. Most were immediately murdered in the gas chambers. Of the 45,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz, only 4% survived.\nSpeaking in the Reichstag, Hitler claimed that the intention of his Balkan campaign was to prevent the Allies from establishing \"a new Macedonian front\", as they had during WWI. The importance of Thessaloniki to Nazi Germany can be demonstrated by the fact that, initially, Hitler had planned to incorporate it directly into Nazi Germany and not have it controlled by a puppet state such as the Hellenic State or an ally of Germany (Thessaloniki had been promised to Yugoslavia as a reward for joining the Axis on 25 March 1941).\nAs it was the first major city in Greece to fall to the occupying forces, the first Greek resistance group was formed in Thessaloniki (under the name , , \"Freedom\") as well as the first anti-Nazi newspaper in an occupied territory anywhere in Europe, also by the name \"Eleftheria\". Thessaloniki was also home to a military camp-converted-concentration camp, known in German as \"Konzentrationslager Pavlo Mela\" (Pavlos Melas Concentration Camp), where members of the resistance and other anti-fascists were held either to be killed or sent to other concentration camps. In September 1943, the Germans established the Dulag 410 transit camp for Italian Military Internees in the city. On 30 October 1944, after battles with the retreating German army and the Security Battalions of Poulos, forces of ELAS entered Thessaloniki as liberators headed by Markos Vafiadis (who did not obey orders from ELAS leadership in Athens to not enter the city). Pro-EAM celebrations and demonstrations followed in the city. In the 1946 monarchy referendum, the majority of the locals voted in favor of a republic, contrary to the rest of Greece.\nPost-war: contemporary Thessaloniki.\nAfter the war, Thessaloniki was rebuilt with large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its architectural treasures still remain, adding value to the city as a tourist destination, while several early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988. In 1997, Thessaloniki was celebrated as the European Capital of Culture, sponsoring events across the city and the region. Agency established to oversee the cultural activities of that year 1997 was still in existence by 2010. In 2004, the city hosted a number of the football events as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics.\nToday, Thessaloniki has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in Southeastern Europe, with its port, the Port of Thessaloniki being one of the largest in the Aegean and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. On 26 October 2012 the city celebrated its centennial since its incorporation into Greece. The city also forms one of the largest student centers in Southeastern Europe, is host to the largest student population in Greece and was the European Youth Capital in 2014. Infrastructure improvements came in the 2020s with the upgrade and expansion of Thessaloniki Airport in 2021 and the opening of Thessaloniki Metro in 2024.\nGeography.\nThessaloniki is located 502 kilometres (312\u00a0mi) north of Athens.\nThessaloniki's urban area spreads over 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) from Oraiokastro in the north to Thermi in the south in the direction of Chalkidiki.\nGeology.\nThessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing mountain ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.\nSince medieval times, Thessaloniki has been hit by strong earthquakes, notably in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995. On 19\u201320 June 1978, the city suffered a series of powerful earthquakes, registering 5.5 and 6.5 on the Richter scale. The tremors caused considerable damage to a number of buildings and ancient monuments, but the city withstood the catastrophe without any major problems. One apartment building in central Thessaloniki collapsed during the second earthquake, killing many and raising the final death toll to 51.\nClimate.\nThessaloniki's climate is transitional, lying on the periphery of multiple climate zones. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the city generally has a cold semi-arid climate (\"BSk\") while a hot semi-arid climate (\"BSh\") is found in the center. Mediterranean (\"Csa\") and humid subtropical (\"Cfa\") influences are also found in the city's climate. Like in Athens the Pindus mountain range greatly contributes to the generally dry climate of the area by substantially drying the westerly winds. In fact, the Thessaloniki International Fair station of the National Observatory of Athens is the northernmost station in the world with a hot semi-arid climate (\"BSh\").\nWinters are somewhat dry, with occasional morning frost. Snowfalls occur more or less every winter, but the snow cover does not last for more than a few days. During the coldest winters, temperatures can drop to . The record minimum temperature in Thessaloniki was . On average, Thessaloniki experiences frost (sub-zero temperature) 32 days a year, though that's less common near the city centre, owing to the urban heat island effect which characterizes the city and is more pronounced during the winter months. Foggy days occur sparsely, roughly 17 days a year, mainly in the autumn and winter months. The coldest month of the year in downtown Thessaloniki is January, with an average 24-hour temperature of . The city is also quite windy in the winter months, with January and February having an average wind speed of about .\nThessaloniki's summers are hot and moderately dry. Maximum temperatures usually rise above , but they rarely exceed ; while the average number of days the temperature is above is 32. Generally, the sea breeze blowing from the Thermaic gulf helps moderate the city's temperatures. The maximum recorded temperature in the city was . Rain occasionally falls in the summer, mainly during thunderstorms, while heat waves occur sporadically, though few of them are intense. The hottest months of the year in downtown Thessaloniki are July and August, with an average 24-hour temperature of around .\nIn 2021, Greece was taken to task by the European Commission for failing to curb consistently high air pollution levels in Thessaloniki.\nGovernment.\nAccording to the Kallikratis reform, as of 1 January 2011 the Thessaloniki Urban Area () which makes up the \"City of Thessaloniki\", is made up of six self-governing municipalities () and one municipal unit (). The municipalities that are included in the Thessaloniki Urban Area are those of Thessaloniki (the city centre and largest in population size), Kalamaria, Neapoli-Sykies, Pavlos Melas, Kordelio-Evosmos, Ampelokipoi-Menemeni, and the municipal units of Pylaia and Panorama, part of the municipality of Pylaia-Chortiatis. Prior to the Kallikratis reform, the Thessaloniki Urban Area was made up of twice as many municipalities, considerably smaller in size, which created bureaucratic problems.\nThessaloniki Municipality.\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki () is the second most populous in Greece, after Athens, with a resident population of 317,778 (in 2021) and an area of . The municipality forms the core of the Thessaloniki Urban Area, with its central district (the city centre), referred to as the \"Kentro\", meaning 'centre' or 'downtown'.\nThe city's first mayor, Osman Sait Bey, was appointed when the institution of mayor was inaugurated under the Ottoman Empire in 1912. The incumbent mayor is Stelios Angeloudis. In 2011, the municipality of Thessaloniki had a budget of \u20ac464.33\u00a0million while the budget of 2012 stands at \u20ac409.00\u00a0million.\nOther.\nThessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece. It is an influential city for the northern parts of the country and is the capital of the region of Central Macedonia and the Thessaloniki regional unit. The Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace is also based in Thessaloniki, since the city is the \"de facto\" capital of the Greek region of Macedonia.\nIt is customary every year for the Prime Minister of Greece to announce his administration's policies on a number of issues, such as the economy, at the opening night of the Thessaloniki International Fair. In 2010, during the first months of the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the entire cabinet of Greece met in Thessaloniki to discuss the country's future.\nIn the Hellenic Parliament, the Thessaloniki urban area constitutes a 17-seat constituency. As of the June 2023 Greek legislative election the largest party in Thessaloniki is the New Democracy with 35.28% of the vote, followed by Syriza (17.52%). The table below summarizes the results of the latest elections.\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nArchitecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and the Levant. Merchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city centre. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include Vitaliano Poselli, Pietro Arrigoni, Xenophon Paionidis, Salvatore Poselli, , Eli Modiano, Mosh\u00e9 Jacques, , Frederic Charnot, Ernst Ziller, , , Dimitris Andronikos, Levi Ernst, Angelos Siagas, Alexandros Tzonis and more, using mainly the styles of Eclecticism, Art Nouveau and Neobaroque.\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the White Tower, which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.\nThe expansion of Eleftherias Square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-centre to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours. It destroyed the city's historic centre and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved the way for modern development featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares.\nCity centre.\nAfter the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including Thomas Mawson and Ernest Hebrard, a French architect, chose the Byzantine era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessaloniki's city centre. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a street grid that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today. It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.\nAlso called the \"historic centre\", it is divided into several districts, including Dimokratias Square (Democracy Sq. known also as \"Vardaris\") \"Ladadika\" (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), \"Kapani\" (where the city's central Modiano market is located), \"Diagonios\", \"Navarinou\", \"Rotonda\", \"Agia Sofia\" and \"Hippodromio\", which are all located around Thessaloniki's most central point, Aristotelous Square.\nVarious commercial stoas around Aristotelous are named from the city's past and historic personalities of the city, like stoa Hirsch, stoa Carasso/Ermou, Pelosov, Colombou, Levi, Modiano, Morpurgo, Mordoch, Simcha, Kastoria, Malakopi, Olympios, Emboron, Rogoti, Vyzantio, Tatti, Agiou Mina, Karipi etc.\nThe western portion of the city centre is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its central international railway station and the port, while its eastern side hosts the city's two universities, the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre, the city's main stadium, its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parks and gardens, namely those of the \"\u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0398\" and \"Pedion tou Areos\".\nAno Poli.\nAno Poli (also called \"Old Town\" and literally the \"Upper Town\") is the heritage-listed district north of Thessaloniki's city centre that was not engulfed by the great fire of 1917 and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site through the ministerial actions of Melina Merkouri, during the 1980s. It consists of Thessaloniki's most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone-paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old Greek and Ottoman architecture. It is the favourite area of Thessaloniki's poets, intellectuals and bohemians.\nAno Poli is also the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion, a large portion of the city's remaining walls, and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. With the capture of Thessaloniki by the Ottomans in 1430, after a lengthy siege of the city from 1422 to 1430, the Ottomans settled in Ano Poli. This geographical choice was attributed to the higher level of Ano Poli, which was convenient to control the rest of the population remotely, and the microclimate of the area, which favoured better living conditions in terms of hygiene compared to the areas of the centre.\nToday, the area provides access to the \"Seich Sou\" Forest National Park and features panoramic views of the whole city and the Thermaic Gulf. On clear days Mount Olympus, at about away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.\nOther districts of Thessaloniki Municipality.\nIn the Municipality of Thessaloniki, in addition to the historic centre and the Upper Town, are included the following districts: Xirokrini, Dikastiria (Courts), Ichthioskala, Palaios Stathmos, Lachanokipoi, Behtsinari, Panagia Faneromeni, Doxa, Saranta Ekklisies, Evangelistria, Triandria, Agia Triada-Faliro, Ippokrateio, Charilaou, Analipsi, Depot and Toumba.\nIn the area of the Old Railway Station (Palaios Stathmos) began the construction of the Holocaust Museum of Greece. In this area are located the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki, the Water Supply Museum and large entertainment venues of the city, such as \"Milos\", \"Fix\", \"Vilka\" (which are housed in converted old factories). The Thessaloniki railway station is located on Monastiriou street.\nOther extended and densely built-up residential areas are Charilaou and Toumba, which is divided into \"Ano Toumpa\" and \"Kato Toumpa\". Toumba was named after the homonymous hill of Toumba, where extensive archaeological research takes place. It was created by refugees after the 1922 Asia Minor disaster and the population exchange (1923\u201324). On \"Exochon\" avenue (\"Rue des Campagnes\", today Vasilissis Olgas and Vasileos Georgiou Avenues), was up until the 1920s home to the city's most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the Thermaic Gulf, from the 19th-century holiday villas which defined the area.\nThessaloniki urban area.\nOther districts of the wider urban area of Thessaloniki are Ampelokipi, Eleftherio \u2013 Kordelio, Menemeni, Evosmos, Ilioupoli, Stavroupoli, Nikopoli, Neapoli, Polichni, Paeglos, Meteora, Agios Pavlos, Kalamaria, Pylaia and the Sykies.\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki is home to \"Moni Lazariston\", located in Stavroupoli, which today forms one of the most important cultural centres for the city, including MOMus\u2013Museum of Modern Art\u2013Costakis Collection and two theatres of the National Theatre of Northern Greece.\nIn northwestern Thessaloniki many cultural premises exist, such as the open-air Theater \"Manos Katrakis\" in Sykies, the Museum of Refugee Hellenism in Neapolis, the municipal theatre and the open-air theatre in Neapoli and the New Cultural Centre of Menemeni (Ellis Alexiou Street). The Stavroupolis Botanical Garden on Perikleous Street includes 1,000 species of plants and is a oasis of greenery. The Environmental Education Centre in Kordelio was designed in 1997 and is one of a few public buildings of bioclimatic design in Thessaloniki.\nNorthwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Miki Theodoraki and 26is Octovriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city centre. The area is home to the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL), the Thessaloniki railway station, and the Zeitenlik Allied memorial military cemetery.\nMonuments have also been erected in honour of the fighters of the Greek Resistance, as in these areas the Resistance was very active: the monument of Greek National Resistance in Sykies, the monument of Greek National Resistance in Stavroupolis, the Statue of the struggling Mother in Eptalofos Square and the monument of the young Greeks who were executed by the Nazis on 11 May 1944 in Xirokrini. In Eptalofos, on 15 May 1941, one month after the occupation of the country, the first resistance organization in Greece, \"Eleftheria\", was founded, with its newspaper and the first illegal printing house in the city of Thessaloniki.\nToday southeastern Thessaloniki has in some way become an extension of the city centre, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasileos Georgiou, Vasilissis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it, enclosing an area traditionally called (\",\" D\u00e9p\u00f4t), from the name of the old tram station, owned by a French company.\nThe municipality of Kalamaria is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and was firstly, inhabited mainly by Greek refugees from Asia Minor and East Thrace after 1922. There are built the Northern Greece Naval Command and the old royal palace (called Palataki), located on the most westerly point of Mikro Emvolo cape.\nPaleochristian and Byzantine monuments (UNESCO).\nBecause of Thessaloniki's importance during the early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several Paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia. The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire, when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.\nBy the eighth century, the city had become an important administrative centre of the Byzantine Empire, and handled much of the Empire's Balkan affairs. During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now part of Thessaloniki's UNESCO World Heritage Site, such as the Church of Saint Catherine, the Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki, the Church of the Acheiropoietos, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon. When the Ottoman Empire took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into mosques, but have survived to this day. Travellers such as Paul Lucas and Abdulmejid I document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of Ottoman control of the city.\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios burned down during the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, as did many other city monuments, but it was rebuilt. During World War II, the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged. Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more monuments listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments. They have been listed since 1988.\nUrban sculpture.\nThere are around 150 statues or busts in the city. Probably the most famous one is the equestrian statue of Alexander the Great on the promenade, placed in 1973 and created by sculptor Evangelos Moustakas. An equestrian statue of Constantine I, by sculptor , is located in Demokratias Square. Other notable statues include that of Eleftherios Venizelos by sculptor , Pavlos Melas by Natalia Mela, the statue of Emmanouel Pappas by Memos Makris, Chrysostomos of Smyrna by Athanasios Apartis, Aristotle on Aristotelous Square and such as various creations by George Zongolopoulos, Philip II of Macedon opposite the White Tower.\nThessaloniki 2012 Programme.\nWith the 100th anniversary of the 1912 incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece, the government announced a large-scale redevelopment programme for the city of Thessaloniki, which aims in addressing the current environmental and spatial problems that the city faces. More specifically, the programme will drastically change the physiognomy of the city by relocating the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre and grounds of the Thessaloniki International Fair outside the city centre and turning the current location into a large metropolitan park, redeveloping the coastal front of the city, relocating the city's numerous military camps and using the grounds and facilities to create large parklands and cultural centres; and the complete redevelopment of the harbour and the \"Lachanokipoi\" and \"Dendropotamos\" districts (behind and near the Port of Thessaloniki) into a commercial business district, with possible highrise developments.\nThe plan also envisions the creation of new wide avenues in the outskirts of the city and the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre. Furthermore, the program includes plans to expand the jurisdiction of \"Seich Sou\" Forest National Park and the improvement of accessibility to and from the Old Town. The ministry has said that the project will take an estimated 15 years to be completed, in 2025.\nPart of the plan has been implemented with extensive pedestrianisations within the city centre by the municipality of Thessaloniki and the revitalisation the eastern urban waterfront/promenade, (, new promenade), with a modern and vibrant design. Its first section opened in 2008, having been awarded as the best public project in Greece of the last five years by the Hellenic Institute of Architecture.\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki's budget for the reconstruction of important areas of the city and the completion of the waterfront, opened in January 2014, was estimated at million ( million) for the year 2011 alone.\nEconomy.\nThessaloniki rose to economic prominence as a major economic hub in the Balkans during the years of the Roman Empire. The Pax Romana and the city's strategic position allowed for the facilitation of trade between Rome and Byzantium (later Constantinople and now Istanbul) through Thessaloniki by means of the Via Egnatia. The Via Egnatia also functioned as an important line of communication between the Roman Empire and the nations of Asia, particularly in relation to the Silk Road.\nWith the partition of the Roman Empire into East (Byzantine) and West, Thessaloniki became the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire after New Rome (Constantinople) in terms of economic might. Under the Empire, Thessaloniki was the largest port in the Balkans. As the city passed from Byzantium to the Republic of Venice in 1423, it was subsequently conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule the city retained its position as the most important trading hub in the Balkans. Manufacturing, shipping and trade were the most important components of the city's economy during the Ottoman period, and the majority of the city's trade at the time was controlled by ethnic Greeks. Plus, the Jewish community was also an important factor in the trade sector.\nHistorically important industries for the economy of Thessaloniki included tobacco (in 1946 35% of all tobacco companies in Greece were headquartered in the city, and 44% in 1979) and banking (in Ottoman years Thessaloniki was a major centre for investment from western Europe, with the Banque de Salonique having a capital of 20\u00a0million French francs in 1909).\nServices.\nThe service sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total labour force of Thessaloniki. Of those working in services, 20% were employed in trade; 13% in education and healthcare; 7.1% in real estate; 6.3% in transport, communications and storage; 6.1% in the finance industry and service-providing organizations; 5.7% in public administration and insurance services; and 5.4% in hotels and restaurants.\nThe city's port, the Port of Thessaloniki, is one of the largest ports in the Aegean and as a free port, it functions as a major gateway to the Balkan hinterland. In 2010, more than 15.8\u00a0million tons of products went through the city's port, making it the second-largest port in Greece after Aghioi Theodoroi, surpassing Piraeus. At 273,282 TEUs, it is also Greece's second-largest container port after Piraeus. As a result, the city is a major transportation hub for the whole of south-eastern Europe, carrying, among other things, trade to and from the neighbouring countries.\nIn recent years Thessaloniki has begun to turn into a major port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean. The Greek ministry of tourism considers Thessaloniki to be Greece's second most important commercial port, and companies such as Royal Caribbean International have expressed interest in adding the Port of Thessaloniki to their destinations. A total of 30 cruise ships are expected to arrive at Thessaloniki in 2011.\nCompanies.\nRecent history.\nAfter WWII and the Greek Civil War, heavy industrialization of the city's suburbs began in the mid-1950s.\nDuring the 1980s, a spate of factory shutdowns occurred, mostly of automobile manufacturers, such as Agricola, AutoDiana, EBIAM, Motoemil, Pantelemidis-TITAN and C.AR. Since the 1990s, companies took advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations than in other countries, and among the largest companies to shut down factories were Goodyear, AVEZ pasta industry (one of the first industrial factories in northern Greece, built in 1926), Philkeram Johnson, AGNO dairy and VIAMIL.\nHowever, Thessaloniki still remains a major business hub in the Balkans and Greece, with a number of important Greek companies headquartered in the city, such as the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO), Namco, Astra Airlines, Ellinair, Pyramis and MLS Multimedia, which introduced the first Greek-built smartphone in 2012.\nIndustry.\nIn early 1960s, with the collaboration of Standard Oil and ESSO-Pappas, a large industrial zone was created, containing refineries, oil refinery and steel production (owned by Hellenic Steel Co.). The zone attracted also a series of different factories during the next decades.\nTitan Cement has also facilities outside the city, on the road to Serres, such as the AGET Heracles, a member of the Lafarge group, and Alumil SA.\nMultinational companies such as Air Liquide, Cyanamid, Nestl\u00e9, Pfizer, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company and Vivartia have also industrial facilities in the suburbs of the city.\nFoodstuff.\nFoodstuff or drink companies headquartered in the city include the Macedonian Milk Industry (Mevgal), Allatini, Barbastathis, Hellenic Sugar Industry, Haitoglou Bros, Mythos Brewery, Malamatina, while the Goody's chain started from the city.\nThe American Farm School also is an important contributor to local food production.\nMacroeconomic indicators.\nIn 2011, the regional unit of Thessaloniki had a Gross Domestic Product of \u20ac18.293\u00a0billion (ranked second amongst the country's regional units), comparable to Bahrain or Cyprus, and a per capita of \u20ac15,900 (ranked 16th). In Purchasing Power Parity, the same indicators are \u20ac19,851\u00a0billion (2nd) and \u20ac17,200 (15th) respectively. In terms of comparison with the European Union average, Thessaloniki's GDP per capita indicator stands at 63% the EU average and 69% in PPP \u2013 this is comparable to the German state of Brandenburg. Overall, Thessaloniki accounts for 8.9% of the total economy of Greece. Between 1995 and 2008 Thessaloniki's GDP saw an average growth rate of 4.1% per annum (ranging from +14.5% in 1996 to \u221211.1% in 2005) while in 2011 the economy contracted by \u22127.8%.\nDemographics.\nHistorical ethnic statistics.\nThe tables below show the ethnic statistics of Thessaloniki during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.\nPopulation growth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki is the most populous in the Thessaloniki Urban Area. Its population has increased in the latest census and the metropolitan area's population rose to over one million. The city forms the base of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area, with latest census in 2021 giving it a population of 1,091,424.\nJews of Thessaloniki.\nThe Jewish population in Greece is the oldest in mainland Europe (see Romaniotes). When Paul the Apostle came to Thessaloniki, he taught in the area of what today is called \"Upper City\". Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest centre in Europe of the Sephardic Jews, who nicknamed the city \"la madre de Israel\" (Israel's mother) and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\". It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking Romaniote community. During the Ottoman era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community was half of the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece in 1913. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of Sabbatai Zevi, had converted to Islam, becoming a sect known as the \"D\u00f6nmeh\" (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade. Many Jewish inhabitants of Thessaloniki spoke Judeo-Spanish, the Romance language of the Sephardic Jews.\nFrom the second half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish community had a new revival. Many French and especially Italian Jews (from Livorno and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environments for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialised Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian-Jewish Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, brickmaking and processing plants for tobacco. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the Allatini. Benrubis founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.\nAfter the Balkan Wars, Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece in 1913. At first, the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-Venizelist and pro-royalist/conservative. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 during World War I burned much of the centre of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out. Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.\nAfter the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 and the bilateral population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same civil rights as other Greek citizens. In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay. During the Metaxas regime, the stance towards Jews improved even more.\nWorld War II brought disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the Resistance helped save some of the Jewish residents. By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to Misha Glenny, such Greek Jews had largely not encountered \"anti-Semitism as in its North European form.\"\nIn 1943, the Nazis began brutal actions against the historic Jewish population in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a ghetto near the railroad lines and beginning deportation to concentration and labor camps. They deported and exterminated approximately 94% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the Holocaust. The Thessaloniki Holocaust memorial in Eleftherias (\"Freedom\") Square was built in 1997 in memory of all the Jewish people from Thessaloniki murdered in the Holocaust. The site was chosen because it was the place where Jewish residents were rounded up before embarking on trains for concentration camps. Today, a community of around 1,200 remains in the city. Communities of descendants of Thessaloniki Jews\u00a0\u2013 both Sephardic and Romaniote\u00a0\u2013 live in other areas, mainly the United States and Israel. Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker recorded a song about the Jewish people of Thessaloniki, called \"Wait for me, Thessaloniki\".\nOthers.\nSince the late 19th century, many merchants from Western Europe (mainly from France and Italy) were established in the city. They had an important role in the social and economic life of the city and introduced new industrial techniques. Their main district was what is known today as the \"Frankish district\" (near Ladadika), where the Catholic church designed by Vitaliano Poselli is also situated. A part of them left after the incorporation of the city into the Greek kingdom, while others, who were of Jewish faith, were exterminated by the Nazis.\nThe Bulgarian community of the city increased during the late 19th century. The community had a Men's High School, a Girl's High School, a trade union and a gymnastics society. A large part of them were Catholics, as a result of actions by the Lazarists society, which had its base in the city.\nAnother group is the Armenian community which dates back to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. During the 20th century, after the Armenian genocide and the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322), many fled to Greece including Thessaloniki. There is also an Armenian cemetery and an Armenian church at the centre of the city.\nCulture.\nLeisure and entertainment.\nThessaloniki is regarded not only as the cultural and entertainment capital of northern Greece but also the cultural capital of the country as a whole. The city's main theaters, run by the National Theatre of Northern Greece () which was established in 1961, include the \"Theater of the Society of Macedonian Studies\", where the National Theater is based, the \"Royal Theater\" () - the first base of the National Theater - \"Moni Lazariston\", and the \"Earth Theater\" and \"Forest Theater\", both amphitheatrical open-air theatres overlooking the city.\nThe title of the European Capital of Culture in 1997 saw the birth of the city's first opera and today forms an independent section of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. The opera is based at the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, one of the largest concert halls in Greece. Recently a second building was also constructed and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Thessaloniki is also the seat of two symphony orchestras, the \"Thessaloniki State Symphony Orchestra\" and the \"Symphony Orchestra of the Municipality of Thessaloniki\".\n\"Olympion Theater\", the site of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival and the \"Plateia Assos Odeon multiplex\" are the two major cinemas in downtown Thessaloniki. The city also has a number of multiplex cinemas in major shopping malls in the suburbs, most notably in Mediterranean Cosmos, the largest retail and entertainment development in the Balkans.\nThessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Avenue, Mitropoleos Ave and Proxenou Koromila Street are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets. The city is also home to one of Greece's most famous and prestigious hotels, Makedonia Palace 5-star hotel, the Hyatt Regency Casino Thessaloniki and hotel (the biggest casino in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe) and Waterland, the largest water park in southeastern Europe.\nThe city has long been known in Greece for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafes and bars per capita of any city in Europe; and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Lonely Planet listed Thessaloniki among the world's \"ultimate party cities\". Restaurant and bar areas include the Ladadika area near the port, Nikis Avenue on the waterfront, the alleyways between Agias Sofias Square and Aristotelous Square, the waterfront of Kalamari\u00e0 neighbourhood, and the Eptapirgio neighbourhood overlooking the city.\nParks and recreation.\nAlthough Thessaloniki is not renowned for its parks and greenery throughout its urban area, where green spaces are few, it has several large open spaces around its waterfront, namely the central city gardens of \"Palios Zoologikos Kipos\" (which is recently being redeveloped to also include rock climbing facilities, a new skatepark and paintball range), the park of \"Pedion tou Areos\", which also holds the city's annual floral expo; and the parks of the Renowned \"Nea Paralia\" (Restructured waterfront) spanning for along the coast, beginning from the White Tower to the concert hall.\nThe \"Nea Paralia\" parks are used throughout the year for a variety of events, while they open up to the Thessaloniki waterfront, which is lined with several caf\u00e9s and bars; and during summer is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as \"volta\" or \"\u201ckaf\u00e8s\u201d\" and is embedded into the culture of the city). Having undergone an extensive revitalization, the city's waterfront today features a total of \"12 thematic gardens/parks.\"\nThessaloniki's proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of Chalkidiki often allow its residents to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe; however, the city is also right next to the \"S\u00e9ih Su\" national park, just away from Thessaloniki's city centre; and offers residents and visitors alike, quiet viewpoints towards the city, mountain bike trails and landscaped hiking paths. The city's zoo, which is operated by the municipality of Thessaloniki, is also located nearby the national park.\nOther recreation spaces throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area include the \"Fragma Thermis\", a landscaped parkland near Thermi and the Delta wetlands west of the city centre; while urban beaches of Per\u00e9a, Nea Mihaniona and Ayia Triada, continuously awarded with the Blue Flag beach award, are located along the coastline of Thessaloniki's southeastern suburbs of Thermaikos gulf, about away from the city centre.\nMuseums and galleries.\nBecause of the city's rich and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history. Two of the city's most famous museums include the National Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the Byzantine Culture Museum of Thessaloniki.\nThe Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, situated in Manolis Andronikos Street\u2013ad honorem of the famous archaeologist that excavated Royal Palaces of the Macedonian Kingdom specifically King Phillip II's tomb, was established in 1962 and houses some of the most important ancient Macedonian artifacts, including an extensive collection of golden artwork from the royal palaces of Aigai and Pella. It also houses exhibits from Macedon's prehistoric past, dating from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nThe Museum of Byzantine Culture is one of the city's most famous museums, showcasing the city's glorious Byzantine past. The museum was also awarded Council of Europe's museum prize in 2005. The museum of the White Tower of Thessaloniki houses a series of galleries relating to the city's past, from the creation of the White Tower until recent years.\nOne of the most modern museums in the city is the Thessaloniki Science Centre and Technology Museum (\"NOESIS\") and is one of the most high-tech museums in Greece and southeastern Europe. It features the largest planetarium in Greece, a cosmotheatre with the country's largest flat screen, an amphitheater, a motion simulator with 3D projection and 6-axis movement and exhibition spaces. Other industrial and technological museums in the city include the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki, which houses an original Orient Express train, the War Museum of Thessaloniki and others. The city also has a number of educational and sports museums, including the Thessaloniki History Centre and the Thessaloniki Olympic Museum.\nThe Atat\u00fcrk Museum in Thessaloniki is the historic house where Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder of modern-day Turkey, was born. The house is now part of the Turkish consulate complex, but admission to the museum is free. The museum contains historic information about Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and his life, especially while he was in Thessaloniki. Other ethnological museums of the sort include the Historical Museum of the Balkan Wars, the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, containing information about the anti-Ottoman rebellions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018. It is set to open in 2026.\nThe city also has a number of important art galleries. Such include the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, housing exhibitions from a number of well-known Greek and foreign artists. The Teloglion Foundation of Art is part of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and includes an extensive collection of works by important artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, including works by prominent Greeks and native Thessalonians. The Thessaloniki Museum of Photography also houses a number of important exhibitions, and is located within the old port of Thessaloniki.\nArchaeological sites.\nThessaloniki is home to a number of prominent archaeological sites. Apart from its recognized UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Thessaloniki features a large two-terraced Roman forum featuring two-storey stoas, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city. The forum also features a small theater, which was also used for gladiatorial games. Although the initial complex was not built in Roman times, it was largely refurbished in the second century. It is believed that the forum and the theater continued to be used until at least the sixth century.\nAnother important archaeological site is the imperial palace complex which Roman emperor Galerius, located at Navarinou Square, commissioned when he made Thessaloniki the capital of his portion of the Roman Empire. The large octagonal portion of the complex, most of which survives to this day, is believed to have been an imperial throne room. Various mosaics from the palatial complex have also survived. Some historians believe that the complex must have been in use as an imperial residence until the 11th century.\npx; overflow: hidden;\"&gt;\npx; left: -px; width: px\"&gt;\nA 4th-century Roman column with a female figure in relief, perhaps the personification of Thessalonica.\nNot far from the palace itself is the Arch of Galerius, known colloquially as the \"Kamara\". The arch was built to commemorate the emperor's campaigns against the Persians. The original structure featured three arches; however, only two full arches and part of the third survive to this day. Many of the arches' marble parts survive as well, although it is mostly the brick interior that can be seen today.\nOther monuments of the city's past, such as \"Las Incantadas\", a Caryatid portico from the ancient forum, have been removed or destroyed over the years. Las Incantadas in particular are on display at the Louvre. Thanks to a private donation of \u20ac180,000, it was announced on 6 December 2011 that a replica of Las Incantadas would be commissioned and later put on display in Thessaloniki.\nThe construction of the Thessaloniki Metro inadvertently started the largest archaeological dig not only of the city, but of Northern Greece; the dig spans and has unearthed 300,000 individual artefacts from as early as the Roman Empire and as late as the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Ancient Thessaloniki's Decumanus Maximus was also found and of the marble-paved and column-lined road were unearthed along with shops, other buildings, and plumbing, prompting one scholar to describe the discovery as \"the Byzantine Pompeii\". Some of the artefacts will be put on display inside the metro stations, while will feature the world's first open archaeological site located within a metro station.\nFestivals.\nThessaloniki is home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Fair is the most important event to be hosted in the city annually, by means of economic development. It was first established in 1926 and takes place every year at the \"Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre\". The event attracts major political attention and it is customary for the Prime Minister of Greece to outline his administration's policies for the next year during the event. Over 250,000 visitors attended the exposition in 2010. The new Art Thessaloniki, is starting first time 29.10. \u2013 1 November 2015 as an international contemporary art fair.\nThe Thessaloniki International Film Festival is established as one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe, with a number of notable filmmakers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Faye Dunaway, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and Fatih Ak\u0131n taking part, and was established in 1960. The Documentary Festival, founded in 1999, has focused on documentaries that explore global social and cultural developments, with many of the films presented being candidates for FIPRESCI and Audience Awards.\nThe Dimitria festival, founded in 1966 and named after the city's patron saint of St. Demetrius, has focused on a wide range of events including music, theatre, dance, local happenings, and exhibitions. The DMC DJ Championship has been hosted at the International Trade Fair of Thessaloniki, has become a worldwide event for aspiring DJs and turntablists. The International Festival of Photography has taken place every February to mid-April. Exhibitions for the event are sited in museums, heritage landmarks, galleries, bookshops and caf\u00e9s. Thessaloniki also holds an annual International Book Fair.\nBetween 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008, the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival, Greece's most important music festival, at Alexandreio Melathron.\nIn 2012, the city hosted its first pride parade, \"Thessaloniki Pride\", which took place between 22 and 23 June. It has been held every year ever since, however in 2013 transgender people participating in the parade became victims of police brutality. The issue was soon settled by the government. The city's Greek Orthodox Church leadership has consistently rallied against the event, but mayor Boutaris sided with \"Thessaloniki Pride\", with Thessaloniki also hosting EuroPride in 2024. Since 1998, the city host Thessaloniki International G.L.A.D. Film Festival, the first LGBT film festival in Greece.\nSports.\nThe main stadium of the city is the Kaftanzoglio National Stadium (also home ground of Iraklis F.C.) constructed by donating funds of Thessalonian Jurist, Diplomat and Filanthropist Lysimachos Kaftantzoglou, while other main stadiums of the city include the football Toumba Stadium and Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium home grounds of PAOK FC and Aris F.C., respectively, all of whom are founding members of the Greek league.\nBeing the largest \"multi-sport\" stadium in the city and in Greece until the construction of the Olympic Stadium \u201c \"Sp\u00ecros Louis\" \u201d in Athens, Kaftanzoglio Stadium regularly plays host to athletics events; such as the European Athletics Association event \"Olympic Meeting Thessaloniki\" every year; it has hosted the National Greek Cup in 2009 and has been used for athletics at the Mediterranean Games and for the European Cup in athletics. In 2004, the stadium served as an official Athens 2004 venue, while in 2009 the city and the stadium hosted the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.\nThessaloniki's major indoor arenas include the state-owned Alexandreio Melathron officially known as Nick Gallis Hall commemorating Nikos (Nick) Gallis the greatest Greek basketball player and by many accredited of making basketball commonly famous, P.A.O.K. Sports Arena in the Urban area of Kalamari\u00e0, home of the omonymous basketball team and venue of numerous music concerts, events and festivals, as well the YMCA (Youth Men's Christian Association) indoor hall. Other sporting clubs in the city include Apollon FC based in Kalamaria, Agrotikos Asteras F.C. based in Evosmos and YMCA. Thessaloniki has a rich sporting history with its teams winning the first ever panhellenic football championship (Aris FC), basketball (Iraklis BC), and water polo (AC Aris) tournaments.\nDuring recent years, PAOK FC has emerged as the strongest football club of the city, winning also the Greek championship without a defeat (2018\u201319 season), as well as 2023\u201324 season\nThe city played a major role in the development of basketball in Greece. The local YMCA was the first to introduce the sport to the country, while Iraklis B.C. won the first ever Greek championship. From 1982 to 1993 Aris B.C. dominated the league, regularly finishing in first place. In that period Aris won a total of 9 championships, 7 cups and one European Cup Winners' Cup. The city also hosted the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which Greece came third. In volleyball, Iraklis has emerged since 2000 as one of the most successful teams in Greece and Europe \u2013 see 2005\u201306 CEV Champions League. In October 2007, Thessaloniki also played host to the first Southeastern European Games.\nThe city is also the finish point of the annual Alexander The Great Marathon, which starts at Pella, in recognition of its Ancient Macedonian heritage.\nThere are also aquatic and athletic complexes such as \"Ethniko\" and \"Poseidonio\".\nMedia.\nThessaloniki is home to the ERT3 TV-channel and Radio Macedonia, both services of public owned\u2013Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) operating in the city and broadcasting all over Greece. The municipality of Thessaloniki also owns and operates three radio stations, namely FM100, FM101 and FM100.6; and TV100, a television network which was also the first non-state-owned TV station in Greece and opened in 1988. Several private TV-networks also broadcast out from Thessaloniki, with Makedonia TV being the most popular.\nThe city's main newspapers and some of the most circulated in Greece, include \"Makedonia\", which was also the first newspaper published in Thessaloniki in 1911 and \"Aggelioforos\". A large number of radio stations also broadcast from Thessaloniki as the city is known for its music contributions.\nNotable Thessalonians.\nThroughout its history, Thessaloniki has been home to a number of well-known figures and people.\nCuisine.\nBecause Thessaloniki remained under Ottoman rule for about 100 years longer than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki, something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions. Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most tavernas serving traditional meze and other such culinary delights.\nBougatsa, a breakfast pastry, which can be either sweet with Patisserie cr\u00e9me or savory, is very popular throughout the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well. Another popular snack is \"koulouri\".\nNotable sweets of the city are \"Trigona Panor\u00e0matos\", \"Rox\u00e1kia\", \"\" and \"Armenonville\". A stereotypical Thessalonian coffee drink is Frapp\u00e9 coffee. Frapp\u00e9 was invented in the Thessaloniki International Fair in 1957 and has since spread throughout Greece and Cyprus to become a hallmark of the Greek coffee culture. Rather than Frapp\u00e9, Thessalonians tend to enjoy drinking \"Freddo Espresso\", a special Greek variation of Espresso coffee; specifically, after being extracted from the coffee machine, espresso is put into a shaker full of ice and eventually sugar (if preferred such) and afterwards it is frothed with an electric frother. Finally, it is served with ice and straw in a tall glass. Coffee is an inseparable part of Thessalonians, marking a quick break from work, a socialising opportunity among friends, family and couples as well as a chance to study, meet new people and relax.\n\"Kapani\" or \"Agora Vlal\u00ec\" is the oldest central market in Thessaloniki, with shops selling fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, drinks, olives, sweets, nuts, spices and Modiano Market is located nearby.\nTourism.\nA tourism boom took place in the 2010s, during the years of mayor Boutaris, especially from the neighboring countries, Austria, Israel and Turkey. In 2010, overnight stays of foreign tourists in the city were around 250,000. In 2018, overnight stays of foreign tourists were estimated to reach 3,000,000 people. Thessaloniki is known as \"the city that never sleeps\" and a \"party capital\" due to its thriving nightlife, young atmosphere and famous 24-hour culture.\nMusic.\nThe city is viewed as a romantic one in Greece, and as such Thessaloniki is commonly featured in Greek songs. There are a number of famous songs that go by the name 'Thessaloniki' (rebetiko, la\u00efko etc.) or include the name in their title.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, the city became a centre of the Rebetiko music, partly because of the Metaxas censorship, which was stricter in Athens. Vassilis Tsitsanis wrote some of his best songs in Thessaloniki.\nThe city is the birthplace of significant composers in the Greek music scene, such as Manolis Chiotis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis and Dionysis Savvopoulos. It is also notable for its rock music scene and its many rock groups; some became famous such as Xylina Spathia, Trypes or the pop rock group Onirama.\nBetween 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008, the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 Greece was represented by Koza Mostra and Agathonas Iakovidis, both from Thessaloniki.\nIt should be highlighted that due to many Asia Minor and Pontian refugees from the genocide of 1923, Thessaloniki is the birthplace of many known traditional singers, such as Chrysanthos Theodoridis and lyra musician \"Patriarch of Lyra\" .\nIn popular culture.\nIn May 1936, a massive strike by tobacco workers led to general anarchy in the city and Ioannis Metaxas (future dictator, then PM) ordered its repression. The events and the deaths of the protesters inspired poet Yiannis Ritsos to write the \"Epitafios\".\nOn 22 May 1963, Grigoris Lambrakis MD, physician-doctor, pacifist and MP, was assassinated by two far-right extremists driving a three-wheeled vehicle. The event led to the political crisis as it is presumed that State Gendarmerie, Army and Government members were indirectly coinvolved, even though never officially demonstrated. Costa Gavras directed \"Z\" (1969) based on it, two years after the military junta had seized power in Greece. For his notable juridical, incorruptible and unprejudiced work regarding Lambrakis\u2019 case, First Instance Judge Christos Sartzetakis (Thessaloniki 1929\u20132022) was proposed and elected at the constitutionally highest political rank, becoming President of The Hellenic Republic.\nNotable films set or shot in Thessaloniki, among others, include:\nEducation.\nThessaloniki is a major centre of education for Greece. Three of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia and the International Hellenic University\u2013ex Intermediate Technical Educating Institution \u201cAlexandros\u201d. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by arithmetic enrolled students, which numbered more than 80,000 students of all degrees, classes and levels in 2010, and also a member of the Utrecht Network. For the academic year \"2009\u20132010\", Aristotle University was ranked as one of the 150 best universities in the world for \"arts and humanities\" and among the 250 best universities in the world overall by the Times QS World University Rankings, making it one of the top 2% of best universities worldwide. Leiden ranks Aristotle University as one of the top 100 European universities, at number 97, and the best university in Greece. Since 2010, Thessaloniki is also home to the Open University of Thessaloniki, which is funded by Aristotle University, the University of Macedonia and the municipality of Thessaloniki.\nNumerous public and private vocational institutes () provide professional non-accademica training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum and titles, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. As of 2006[ [update]] the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000.\nTransport.\nTram.\nTram was the main, oldest and most popular public urban mean of Thessalonians in the past. It was in operation from 1893 to 1957, when it was disestablished by the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis. The Belgian \"Compagnie de Tramways et d' \u00c9clairage \u00c9lectrique de Salonique\" operated it from 1912 until 1940, when the company was purchased by the Hellenic State. The operating base and tram station was in the district of D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nBefore the economic crisis of 2009, there were various proposals for new tram lines.\nBus.\nThessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (\"OASTH\") operates public transport buses in Thessaloniki. It was founded in 1957 and operates a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area. International and regional bus links are provided by KTEL at its \u201cMacedonia\u201d Extraurban Bus Terminal, located to the west of the city centre.\nMetro.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe creation of a metro system for Thessaloniki goes back as far as 1918, when Thomas Hayton Mawson and Ernest H\u00e9brard proposed the creation of a Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway. In 1968, a circular metro line was proposed, and in 1987 the first serious proposal was presented and construction briefly started in 1988, before stalling and finally being abandoned due to lack of funding. Both the 1918 and 1988 proposals ran almost the identical route to the current Line 1.\nConstruction of Thessaloniki metro began in 2006 and is classified as a megaproject: it has a budget of \u20ac1.57 billion ($ billion). Line 1 began operation on 30 November 2024, while Line 2 is currently under construction and will enter into service in late 2025. Line 1 is long and includes 13 stations, while Line 2 is long and includes a further five stations, while also crossing 11 of the 13 Line 1 stations. Important archaeological discoveries have been made during construction, and some of the system's stations house archaeological exhibitions. One station in particular, that of , houses the only archaeological site within a metro station in the world.\nLine 2 is to be expanded further to the northwestern suburbs of the city, towards Evosmos and Stavroupoli, and to the east, towards the Airport. The northwestern extension is a priority, as the airport is served by bus to the terminus of Line 1.\nIt is now expected that 320,000 people per day and 116 million people per year will use the Thessaloniki metro.\nCommuter/suburban rail (Proastiakos).\nCommuter intraregional rail services have recently been established between Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa (the service is known in Greek as the \"Proastiakos\", meaning \"Suburban Railway\"). The service is operated using Siemens Desiro EMU trains on a modernised electrified double track and stops at 11 restructured rail stations, covering the journey in 1 hour and 33 minutes. Furthermore, an additional line has also been established, with the use of regional trains, connecting Thessaloniki to Edessa and Florina.\nThessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\".\nInternational and domestic air traffic to and from the city of Thessaloniki is served by the \"Makedonia\" International Airport of Thessaloniki . The short length of the airport's two runways means that it does not, yet, support intercontinental flights; however, a major extension of one of its runways into the Thermaic Gulf is currently under construction. Following the completion of the runway works, the airport will be able to serve intercontinental flights and cater for larger aircraft in the future. After long delays, the new runway of the airport was completed in spring 2019. Construction of a second new terminal began in September 2018. New T2 has been finished in February 2021, three months ahead of schedule.\nRailways.\nThe Thessaloniki railway station features a central hall with a shopping centre within a 1960s era building. The station has staffed ticketing services, a large climate-controlled waiting room, caf\u00e9 bar, fast-food restaurants, kiosk and luggage lockers. On the platforms, cover seating is available and the station is alongside a bus terminal. The station is connected by bus and the Metro with much of the urban area of Thessaloniki, including other major transport centres such as the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL), the port and Macedonia International Airport.\nRegional train services within Greece (operated by TrainOSE, the Hellenic Railways Organization's train operating company), link the city with other main urban parts of the country's territory, indicatively Athens, Larissa, Kater\u00ecni, Edessa, V\u00e9ria, Florina, Serres, Alexandroupoli, Orestiada, Drama, X\u00e0nthi, Meteora and more. Once there were abundant international links serving different European and Balkan cities and also remarkable trains such as Orient Express, Acropolis Express, Hellas Express, Eurocity ecc. namely; Sofia, Belgrade, Skopje, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest, Istanbul and most importantly diverse German cities.\nDue to the Greek economic crisis, all international train links from the city were suspended in February 2011. Until then, the city was a major railway hub for the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Daily through trains to Sofia (via Serres) and Belgrade (via Gevgelija) were restarted in May 2014 but stopped again due to COVID-19 restrictions. Nevertheless, Thessaloniki remains a key passenger and merchant railway hub with the biggest marshalling yard in the country and still one of the biggest in Balkans.\nPort.\nThe Port of Thessaloniki connects the city with seasonal ferries to the Sporades, other north Aegean islands and Turkish Minor Asia's ports like Izmir/Smyrni, with its passenger terminal being one of the largest in the Aegean Sea basin; having handled around 162,731 passengers in 2007. Meanwhile, ongoing actions have been going on for more connections and the port is recently being upgraded, as Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major tourist port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean. It also consists the second largest port of Greece by merchant traffic volume being only behind Piraeus Port, the largest domestic port.\nMotorways.\nThessaloniki lies on the crossroads of the A1/E75, A2/E90 and A25 motorways; which connect the city with other parts of the country, as well as the neighbouring countries of North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.\nThe city itself is bypassed by the C-shaped Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road (\"Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos\", ), which all of the above motorways connect onto it. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the A1/A2 motorways in \"Lachanagora\" District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of \"Seich Sou\" and through to the southeast suburb/borough of Kalamaria. The ring road ends at a large junction with the A24 motorway, which then continues south to Chalkidiki, passing through Thessaloniki's outer southeast suburbs.\nThe speed limit on this motorway is ; it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link; handling more than 120,000 vehicles daily, instead of the 30,000 vehicles that it was originally designed to handle in 1975.\nAn outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (, \"outer ring road\") carries all traffic that completely bypasses the city. It is part of A2 motorway.\nFuture plans.\nDespite the large effort that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to handle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in the western side of the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, for the construction of a new elevated motorway section above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, decongesting the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A24 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (\u0395\u039f67); which will make it an 8 lane highway.\nAdditional long-term plans include the extension of the planned outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (, \"outer ring road\") to circle around the entire Thessaloniki metropolitan area, crossing over the Thermaic Gulf from the east, to join with the A1/E75 motorway. Preliminary plans have been announced which include a bridge over the gulf, as part of the southern bypass of the city; to cater for the large number of travellers from Macedonia and the rest of Greece heading to the airport, and to the increasingly popular tourist region of Chalkidiki.\nThessaloniki is also planned to be the southern terminus of the trans-European Via Carpathia motorway.\nInternational relations.\nConsulates\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nThessaloniki is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther cooperation.\nThessaloniki also cooperates with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40472", "revid": "44217690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40472", "title": "Baker v. Vermont", "text": "Vermont Supreme Court case\nBaker v. Vermont, 744 A.2d 864 (Vt. 1999), was a lawsuit decided by Vermont Supreme Court on December 20, 1999. It was one of the first judicial affirmations of the right of same-sex couples to treatment equivalent to that afforded different-sex couples. The decision held that the state's prohibition on same-sex marriage denied rights granted by the Vermont Constitution. The court ordered the Vermont legislature to either allow same-sex marriages or implement an alternative legal mechanism according similar rights to same-sex couples.\nBackground.\nFollowing their initial success in Hawaii in 1996 that was later undone by a popular referendum in 1998, advocates for same-sex marriage selected Vermont for their lawsuit on the basis of the state's record of establishing rights for gays and lesbians as well as the difficulty of amending its constitution.\nVermont enacted hate crimes legislation in 1990, one of the first states to do so. From the time the legislation that became the Hate Crimes Act was introduced in 1989, it included sexual orientation. Most of the testimony and statistics that supported the legislation related to the gay and lesbian community and one incident of anti-gay violence helped secure its passage. It added \"sexual orientation\" to its anti-discrimination statute, the Human Rights Law, in 1992. In 1993, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled unanimously in the case \"In re B.L.V.B.\" that a woman could adopt her lesbian partner's natural children. The statute provided that an adoption terminates the rights of natural parents, unless the person adopting is the \"spouse\" of the child's natural parent. The Court decided that the statute did not intend to restrict adoption to legal spouses only, that safeguarding the child was its \"general intent and spirit\", and that adoption by a second woman was therefore permissible. In 1995, in the course of reforming the state's adoption statute, a Senate committee first removed language allowing unmarried couples, whatever their sex, to adopt, but after months of work the legislature passed a version that made same-sex couples eligible to adopt.\nTrial court.\nOn July 22, 1997, three same-sex couples, who had been denied marriage licenses in the towns of Milton and Shelburne and the city of South Burlington, sued those jurisdictions and the state. They were Stan Baker and Peter Harrigan, Holly Puterbaugh and Lois Farnham, and Nina Beck and Stacy Jolles. Two of the couples had raised children together. The couples sued their respective localities and the state of Vermont, requesting a declaratory judgment that the denial of licenses violated Vermont's marriage statutes and the state Constitution. The plaintiffs were represented by Mary Bonauto, an attorney with Boston-based Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, and two Vermont attorneys, Susan Murray and Beth Robinson.\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that no relief could be legally granted for the plaintiffs' grievances. On December 19 at the trial court in Chittenden County, Superior Court Judge Linda Levitt granted the defendants' motion, ruling that the marriage statutes could not be construed to allow same-sex marriages and that the statutes were constitutional because they served the public interest by promoting \"the link between procreation and child rearing\". She disagreed with the defendants' contention that \"history and tradition\" justify the state's interest in preserving marriage. The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Vermont Supreme Court.\nOn November 3, 1998, voters in Alaska and Hawaii approved referendums in opposition to same-sex marriage. Two weeks later, on the eve of oral arguments in \"Baker\" before the Vermont Supreme Court, Tracey Conaty of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said \"Right now Vermont, in many ways, is our biggest hope\". Discussing the interplay between the courts and public opinion, Greg Johnson, a professor at Vermont Law School, said: \"The reason we have some hope here in Vermont is not just because the jurisprudence is good but the body politic is markedly different than in Alaska and Hawaii\".\nVermont Supreme Court.\nThe Vermont Supreme Court received amicus briefs from the Vermont Human Rights Commission, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Vermont Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights, Parents and Friends of Lesbian and Gay Men, Vermont Organization for Weddings of the Same-Gender, Vermont NOW, Vermont Psychiatric Association, Take It To the People, New Journey, the American Center for Law and Justice, Specialty Research Associates, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, Agudath Israel of America, the Christian Legal Society, and a number of U.S. states, groups of professors of law, and individuals. It heard oral arguments on November 18, 1998.\nOral Argument.\nAttorney Beth Robinson represented the plaintiffs at the State Supreme Court. She argued that the statutes could be read to provide same-sex couples the right to marry. They also argued that in the absence of such an interpretation of the statutes, the Vermont Constitution's Common Benefits Clause (Chapter I, Article 7), which guarantees all citizens equal benefit and protection of the law, guarantees same-sex couples' right to the substantial benefits and protections of marriage. They questioned the lower court's justification for limiting marital status to male-female couples\u2014linking marital status to procreation and child rearing, noting that Vermont law recognized same-sex couples' right to adopt children and to parent children conceived by natural and artificial means. They questioned how the state could explicitly allow same-sex partners to parent, but deny them and their adopted children the benefits and security of marriage. The justices questioned whether the state's position constituted gender discrimination and whether modern science was undermining the idea that only male-female couples could procreate. The state nevertheless maintained that this was a question of social policy within the purview of the legislature in \"furthering the link between procreation and child rearing.\". When a justice asked if the state saw marriage as a fundamental right, the attorney for the state answered \"Yes, but it's a fundamental right between a man and a woman.\"\nOpinion of the Court.\nOn December 20, 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that the denial of marriage benefits to same-sex partners was a violation of the state constitution. In the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy and joined by two other judges, the court held that the state must guarantee the same protections and benefits to same-sex couples that it does to male-female spouses, and added that the legislature should, in a \"reasonable period of time\", find a way to provide same-sex couples with those benefits. Justices John Dooley and Denise R. Johnson each wrote separate opinions concurring that the exclusion of same-sex couples to the state's marriage rights was unconstitutional, but with different rationales.\nMajority opinion.\nThe majority opinion was authored by Chief Justice Jeffrey Amestoy and joined by justices James Morse and Marilyn Skoglund. In it, the court dismissed the plaintiff's contention that the denial of same-sex unions violated Vermont marriage statutes. The court held that while the statutes did not explicitly limit marriage to male-female pairs, both the common dictionary definition of marriage and the legislative intent when the relevant statutes were enacted in 1945 favored the interpretation of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The court also interpreted the terms \"bride\" and \"groom\" as being gender-specific.\nWith respect to the State Constitution's Common Benefit Clause, the court noted that it was an original component of the 1777 Vermont Constitution, predating the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution's 14th Amendment by several decades. The Court further noted that Vermont is free to provide rights to its citizens not granted by the U.S. Constitution, and that the application of the Common Benefit Clause has historically been significantly different from the federal courts' application of the Equal Protection Clause. While the federal Equal Protection Clause is typically invoked only under very limited circumstances, the Common Benefit Clause has been read to require that \"statutory exclusions from publicly conferred benefits and protections must be 'premised on an appropriate and overriding public interest.'\"\nThe court found that the state's marriage policy did not serve such an \"overriding public interest\", rejecting the argument that same-sex marriages would do harm by weakening the link between marriage and child rearing and finding no administrative or pragmatic difficulty with extending the rights of marriage to same-sex couples. The court also noted the state's endorsement of parenting by gays and lesbians in a series of actions, including 1996 legislation promoting same-sex adoption. It also dismissed the argument that legal recognition of same-sex marriage would not conform to the practices of other states, pointing out that Vermont already allowed for certain marriage contracts not recognized by other states (including first-cousin marriages), and that such concerns had not prevented the passage of laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt. The court dismissed the defendant's remaining arguments, such as those concerning the \"stability\" of same-sex couples, as too nebulous or speculative to justify a policy with respect to all same-sex couples and equally applicable to some male-female partnerships.\nThe court declined to grant the plaintiffs' request for a marriage license, though it allowed that \"some future case may attempt to establish that notwithstanding equal benefits and protections under Vermont law\u2014the denial of a marriage license operates per se to deny constitutionally protected rights\". Instead, the court directed the State to implement a system to grant same-sex couples statutory rights and privileges equivalent to those enjoyed by male-female couples. This system could be implemented by modifying the marriage statutes to allow for same-sex marriages or by creating a parallel status under another name.\nConcurrences and dissent.\nJustice John Dooley wrote a concurrence in which he agreed with the majority opinion in that the denial of marriage benefits to same-sex couples violated the State's Common Benefits Clause, he did not agree with the majority's reliance on federal precedent, which does not hold binding on the Vermont state courts. He accused the majority on relying on the Supreme Court case \"Bowers v. Hardwick\", which held that sodomy laws can be constitutionally criminalized, and not applying a suspect classification to sexual orientation in accordance to Vermont court jurisprudence developments.\nJustice Denise R. Johnson concurred with the majority's holding that the marriage statutes defining marriage between opposite couples violated the state constitution, but dissented from the remedy. Johnson wrote that she believed that the state was required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, not just offer the same benefits by a different name. She argued the marriage statutes were a violation of sex classification. She wrote, \"I would grant the requested relief and enjoin defendants from denying plaintiffs a marriage license based solely on the sex of the applicants.\"\nLater developments.\nIn 2000, the Legislature responded to the \"Baker\" decision by instituting civil unions for same-sex couples after an acrimonious and deeply polarizing debate. The legislation, which took effect on July 1, also defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman, an explicit statement previously not found in Vermont's marriage licensing statute. In response to the court's decision in \"Baker\" and the legislature's enactment of civil unions, opponents of the legal recognition of same-sex unions formed an opposition organization called Take Back Vermont.\nIn the elections that fall, six incumbent legislators who supported civil unions lost in the September primaries, five Republicans and one Democrat. In November another 11 civil union supporters lost their seats in the legislature. Exit polls showed voters were evenly split on the question of civil unions.\nWhen GLAD filed a lawsuit seeking same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts, Bonauto tried to avoid winning a decision like \"Baker\" by emphasizing the status of marriage rather than its particular legal benefits and obligations. She said: \"We spent more time in Massachusetts talking about how marriage is a basic civil and human right. It cannot be splintered into state and federal protections. We talked about what marriage is in our culture.\"\nNew Jersey's highest court ruled unanimously in \"Lewis v. Harris\" on October 25, 2006, that excluding same-sex couples from marriage violated the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection. When the justices determined 4 to 3 that the appropriate remedy should be left to the legislature because \"such change must come from the crucible of the democratic process\", the \"New York Times\" said New Jersey \"could be considered the new Vermont\".\nVermont legalized same-sex marriage effective September 1, 2009. Civil unions entered into prior to September 1 continued to be recognized as civil unions unless the couple married.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1855, it was the first college in the Southern United States to be coeducational and racially integrated. It admitted non-White students from as early as 1866 until 1904, and again after 1954.\nThe college participates in federal work-study and work college programs that cover the remaining tuition fees after subtracting the total sum a student receives from Pell Grant, other grants, and scholarships. Most of the college's students come from southern Appalachia but students come from more than 40 states in the United States and 70 other countries. Approximately half of them identify as people of color.\nBerea offers bachelor's degrees in 33 majors. It incorporates a mandatory work-study program in which students do a minimum of 10 hours per week of work for the college.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1855 by the abolitionist and Augusta College graduate John Gregg Fee (1816\u20131901), Berea College admitted both black and white students in a fully integrated curriculum, making it the first non-segregated, coeducational college in the South and one of a handful of institutions of higher learning to admit both male and female students in the mid-19th century. The college began as a one-room schoolhouse that also served as a church on Sundays on land that was granted to Fee by politician and abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay. Fee named the new community after the biblical Berea. Although the school's first articles of incorporation were adopted in 1859, slavery supporters forced Fee and the teachers out of the area that year.\nFee spent the Civil War years raising funds for the school, trying to provide for his family in Cincinnati, and working at Camp Nelson. He returned afterward to continue his work at Berea. He spent nearly 18 months working mostly at Camp Nelson, where he helped provide facilities for the freedmen and their families, as well as teaching and preaching. He helped get funds for barracks, a hospital, a school, and a church.\nIn 1866, Berea's first full year after the war, it had 187 students, 96 Black and 91 white. It began with preparatory classes to ready students for study at the college level. In 1869, the first college students were admitted, and the first bachelor's degrees were awarded in 1873. Almost all the South's private and state colleges were racially segregated. Berea was the main exception until a new state law in 1904 forced its segregation. The college challenged the law in state court and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Berea College v. Kentucky\". When the challenge failed, the college had to become an all-white school, but it raised funds to establish the Lincoln Institute in 1912 in Simpsonville, Kentucky, to educate Black students. In 1950, when the Day Law was amended to allow integration of schools at the college level, Berea resumed its integrated policies.\nIn 1911, the college restricted students to eating at college-owned facilities. A local businessman sued but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that the college's restriction was legal (Gott v. Berea College).\nIn 1925, advertiser Bruce Barton, a future congressman, sent a letter to 24 wealthy men in America to raise funds for the college. Every letter was returned with a minimum of $1,000 in donation. During World War II, Berea was one of 131 colleges nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a navy commission.\nUntil 1968, Berea provided pre-college education in addition to a college-level curriculum. That year, the elementary and secondary schools (Foundation School) were discontinued in favor of focusing on undergraduate college education.\nPresidents.\nPresidents of the college have included:\nAcademics.\nBerea College offers 33 majors and 39 minors from which its 1,600 students can choose. Students who wish to pursue a field of study that cannot be met through an established major may propose an independent major, provided they meet the criteria in the college catalog's definition of a major. The student must secure independent major advisers (primary and secondary). Its most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:\nTo ensure every student has access to fully experience a liberal arts education, the college provides significant funding to assist students in studying abroad. Berea students are also eligible for the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, which provides funding for a year of study abroad after graduation.\nAll students are required to attend the college on a full-time basis. They are also required to attend at least seven convocation events each semester and receive academic credit. The convocations are designed as a supplement to the curriculum by encouraging educational experience and cultural enrichment. Topics range across academic fields and include lectures, symposia, concerts, and the performing arts. These events are free to Berea College students and open to the public.\nRankings and outcomes.\nIn 2024, \"Washington Monthly\" ranked Berea College first in the U.S. among national liberal arts colleges based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. The New York Times also ranked Berea first in its 2023 College Access Index based on economic diversity. The 2025 annual ranking of \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" categorizes Berea as \"more selective\" and rates it 40th overall, first in \"Service Learning,\" second for \"Most Innovative Schools,\" tied for 9th in \"Best Undergraduate Teaching\", and fifth in \"Top Performers in Social Mobility\" among U.S. liberal colleges. \"Kiplinger's Personal Finance\" placed Berea 35th in its 2019 ranking of 149 best-value U.S. liberal arts colleges.\nAccording to 2022 data from College Scorecard, Berea College graduates earn a median salary of $40,000 ten years after their entry into the institution. Mathematics majors earn around $18,000, biology $29,000, psychology $35,000, and nursing $57,000. 51% of Berea graduates earn higher than a typical high school graduate of the corresponding area.\nScholarships and work program.\nBerea College provides all students with full-tuition scholarships and many receive support for room and board as well. Berea College charges no tuition beyond the total amount a student receives in Pell Grant and other grants and scholarships. Every admitted student at Berea College is granted the equivalent of a four-year, full-tuition scholarship that covers the remaining tuition fees after deducting any grants and scholarships the student may have received. Admission to the college is granted only to students who need financial assistance (as determined by the FAFSA); in general, applications are accepted only from those whose family income falls within the bottom 40% of U.S. households. About 75% of the college's incoming class is drawn from the Appalachian region of the South and some adjoining areas, and about 8% are international students. Generally, no more than one student is admitted from a given country in a single year (with the exception of countries in distress such as Liberia). This policy ensures that 70 or more nationalities are usually represented in the student body of Berea College. All international students are admitted on full scholarships with the same regard for financial need as U.S. students.\nIn order to support its extensive scholarship program, Berea College has one of the largest financial reserves of any American college when measured on a per-student basis. The endowment was $1.6 billion as of June 30, 2021. The base of Berea College's finances is dependent on substantial contributions from alumni and from individuals, foundations, and corporations that support the mission of the college. A solid investment strategy increased the endowment from $150 million (~$ in 2024) in 1985 to its current amount.\nIn 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted an excise tax of 1.4% of endowment incomes that exceed net assets of at least $500,000 per student. Due to the size of Berea's endowment and number of full-time enrolled students, this tax bill would have reduced the number of students it could serve. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided an exemption for colleges and universities with fewer than 500 tuition-paying students, making Berea College exempt as it provides tuition-free education to all students.\nAs a work college, Berea has a student work program in which all students work on campus 10 or more hours per week. Berea is one of nine federally recognized work colleges in the United States and one of two in Kentucky (Alice Lloyd College being the other) to have mandatory work study programs. Employment opportunities range from busing tables at the Boone Tavern Hotel, a historic business owned by the college, to leading campus tours for visitors and prospective students, or making brooms, ceramics and woven items in Student Craft. Other job duties include janitorial labor, building management, resident assistant, teaching assistant, food service, gardening and grounds keeping, information technology, woodworking, and secretarial work. Berea College has helped make the https:// a center for quality arts and crafts.\nAs of 2022, students are paid an hourly wage from $5.60 to $8.60 by the college, based on the WLS (\"Work, Learning, and Service\") level attached to individual labor positions. The college regularly increases student pay on a yearly basis, but it has never been equivalent to the federal minimum wage in the school's history. Because of the scheduling demands of both an academic requirement and a labor requirement, students are not allowed to work at off-campus jobs.\nFolk dance.\nBerea is widely known as a folk dance hub, teaching square, contra, English, and other kinds of movement. The college offers community folk dances most weekends. The campus has ten dance groups (including Middle Eastern, Swing, Latino, African, and hip hop), a minor in dance, and 25 dance classes.\nPhysical education instructor Oscar Gunkler brought folk dance to Berea in the 1920s. The Berea College Country Dancers were founded in 1938 by Frank Smith. Berea's annual Christmas Country Dance School was started the same year by Smith and May Gadd, the first director of the Country Dance and Song Society.\nBerea's Country Dancers go on tour each semester and danced at the White House in 1963. Dance programs were established as part of the college's Health and Human Performance Department in 1995 by Susan Spalding. International dance caller and writer Bob Dalsemer is one of many who got his start at a Berea dance.\nChristian identity.\nBerea was founded by Protestant Christians. It maintains a Christian identity separate from any particular denomination. The college's motto, \"God has made of one blood all peoples of the earth\", is from Acts . In an effort to be sensitive to the diverse preferences and experiences of students and faculty, courses are designed to be taught with respect for each student's spiritual journey, regardless of religious identification.\nLibrary collections.\nThe Hutchins Library maintains an extensive collection of books, archives, and music pertaining to Southern Appalachian history and culture. The Southern Appalachian Archives contain organizational records, personal papers, oral histories, and photographs, including the papers of the Council of the Southern Mountains (1912\u20131989) and the Appalachian Volunteers (1963\u20131970).\nStudent life.\nSince 2002, all students at Berea have received laptops that they keep upon graduation. Students are not required to pay for the computers, but do provide a small fee to support the technological infrastructure. Students must have a special permit to have a car on campus. Such permits are rarely granted to first- or second-year students.\nSince 1875, Berea College celebrates Mountain Day, a holiday set aside to enjoy being together in nature. Students take off from classes for a sunrise hike to the top of the Pinnacle Mountain and engage in games, performances, food, and other festivities. Another unique holiday to Berea College is Labor Day, where the campus takes a break from classes to recognize and celebrate the value of student work. Established in 1921, it has expanded to help students find labor placements for the following academic year and soon-to-be graduates prepare for life after college.\nAthletics.\nThe Berea athletic teams are called the Mountaineers. The college is a member of Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and joined the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference (HCAC) in July 2024 after two years in the Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS). They were also a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). The Mountaineers previously competed in the USA South Athletic Conference (USA South) from 2017\u201318 to 2021\u201322; as an NCAA D-III Independent from 2014\u201315 to 2016\u201317; and in the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC; now currently known as the River States Conference (RSC) since the 2016\u201317 school year) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1916\u201317 to 2013\u201314.\nBerea competes in 14 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.\nMove to NCAA Division III.\nOn February 20, 2012, the NCAA announced it had granted Berea permission to begin a one-year period exploring membership in its Division III, non-scholarship athletic program.\nOn May 4, 2016, the USA South announced that Berea would join the league effective in the 2017\u201318 school year.\nJoining the CCS.\nThe USA South announced in February 2022 that it would split into two leagues the following July, with eight of its then 19 members, including Berea, establishing the new Collegiate Conference of the South.\nMove to the HCAC.\nOn June 1, 2023, Berea and the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference announced that the Mountaineers would join that league after the 2023\u201324 school year.\nMen's basketball.\nOn February 4, 1954, Irvine Shanks played for Berea against Wilmington College, breaking the color barrier in college basketball in Kentucky.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Incumbent Democratic-Republican president Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina. It was the first presidential election conducted following the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reformed procedures for electing presidents and vice presidents.\nJefferson was renominated by his party's congressional nominating caucus without opposition, and the party nominated Governor George Clinton of New York to replace Aaron Burr as Jefferson's running mate. With former president John Adams in retirement, the Federalists turned to Pinckney, a former ambassador and Revolutionary War hero who had been Adams's running mate in the 1800 election.\nThough Jefferson had only narrowly defeated Adams in 1800, he was widely popular due to the Louisiana Purchase and a strong economy. He carried almost every state, including most states in the Federalist stronghold of New England.\nBackground.\nAlthough the 1800 presidential election was a close one, Jefferson steadily gained popularity during his term. American trade boomed due to the temporary suspension of hostilities during the French Revolutionary Wars in Europe, and the Louisiana Purchase was heralded as a great achievement.\nNominations.\nDemocratic-Republican Party nomination.\nThe congressional nominating caucus of the Democratic-Republican Party was held in February 1804, with 108 members of the United States Congress in attendance and Senator Stephen R. Bradley as its chair. Jefferson was renominated by acclamation while Vice President Aaron Burr was not considered for renomination. The caucus selected to give the vice-presidential nomination to Governor George Clinton whose main opponent was Senator John Breckinridge. A thirteen-member committee was selected to manage Jefferson's presidential campaign.\nFederalist Party nomination.\nThe Federalists did not hold a nominating caucus, but Federalist congressional leaders informally agreed to nominate a ticket consisting of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina and former Senator Rufus King of New York. Pinckney's public service during and after the American Revolutionary War had won him national stature, and Federalists hoped that Pinckney would win some Southern votes away from Jefferson, who had dominated the Southern vote in the previous election.\nGeneral election.\nFederalist leader Alexander Hamilton's death in July 1804 following the Burr\u2013Hamilton duel destroyed whatever hope the Federalists had of defeating the popular Jefferson. Leaderless and disorganized, the Federalists failed to attract much support outside of New England. The Federalists attacked the Louisiana Purchase as unconstitutional, criticized Jefferson's gunboat navy, and alleged that Jefferson had fathered children with his slave, Sally Hemings, but the party failed to galvanize opposition to Jefferson. Jefferson's policies of expansionism and reduced government spending were widely popular. Jefferson was aided by an effective Democratic-Republican party organization, which had continued to develop since 1800, especially in the Federalist stronghold of New England.\nJefferson's victory was overwhelming, and he even won four of the five New England states. Pinckney won only two states, Connecticut and Delaware. This was the first election where the Democratic-Republicans won in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.\nAs of 2024, Jefferson was the first of eight presidential nominees to win a significant number of electoral votes in at least three elections, the others being Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, William Jennings Bryan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Donald Trump. Of these, Jackson, Cleveland, and Roosevelt also won the popular vote in at least three elections. Jefferson, Cleveland, Roosevelt, and Trump were also their respective party's nominees for three consecutive elections.

The Democratic-Republican candidate James Madison defeated Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney decisively.\nMadison had served as Secretary of State since President Thomas Jefferson took office in 1801. Jefferson, who had declined to run for a third term, threw his strong support behind Madison, a fellow Virginian. Sitting Vice President George Clinton and former Ambassador James Monroe both challenged Madison for leadership of the party, but Madison won his party's nomination and Clinton was renominated as vice president. The Federalists chose to re-nominate Pinckney, a former ambassador who had served as the party's 1804 nominee, again alongside Rufus King.\nDespite the unpopularity of the Embargo Act of 1807, Madison won the vast majority of electoral votes outside of the Federalist stronghold of New England. Clinton received six electoral votes for president from his home state of New York. This election was the first of two instances in American history in which a new president was selected but the incumbent vice president won re-election, the other being in 1828.\nNominations.\nDemocratic-Republican Party nomination.\nCaucus.\nSenator Stephen R. Bradley, who had chaired the congressional nominating caucus during the 1804 presidential election, made a call for the 1808 caucus to the 146 Democratic-Republican members of the United States Congress and Federalist allies. The caucus was attended by 89 to 94 members of Congress.\nThe caucus was held in January 1808. With the support of outgoing President Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State James Madison won the presidential nomination over opposing candidates James Monroe and Vice President George Clinton. The caucus voted to give the vice presidential nomination to Clinton over his main opponent John Langdon, although Clinton's supporters believed Clinton would receive the Federalist Party's presidential nomination. The Federalists instead nominated Charles Cotesworth Pinckney that September. A committee of fifteen members was selected to manage Madison's campaign.\nSeventeen Democratic-Republicans in Congress opposed Madison's selection and the caucus system whose authority to select presidential and vice-presidential candidates was disputed. Clinton also opposed the caucus system. Monroe, who was supported by dissident and majority leader John Randolph, was nominated by a group of Virginia Democratic-Republicans (Old Republicans), and although he did not actively try to defeat Madison, he also refused to withdraw from the race. Clinton was also supported by a group of New York Democratic-Republicans for president even as he remained the party's official vice presidential candidate.\nFederalist Party nomination.\nThe Federalist caucus met in September 1808 and re-nominated the party's 1804 ticket, which consisted of General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina and former Senator Rufus King of New York. This was the only time in American history that a defeated major party renominated its losing ticket for a second time.\nGeneral election.\nCampaign.\nThe election was marked by opposition to Jefferson's Embargo Act of 1807, a halt to trade with Europe that disproportionately hurt New England merchants and was perceived as favoring France over Britain. Nonetheless, Jefferson was still very popular with Americans generally and Pinckney was soundly defeated by Madison, though not as badly as in 1804. Pinckney received few electoral votes outside of New England.\nResults.\nPinckney retained the electoral votes of the two states that he carried in 1804 (Connecticut and Delaware), and he also picked up New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and three electoral districts in North Carolina besides the two electoral districts in Maryland that he carried earlier. Except for the North Carolina districts, all of the improvement was in New England.\nMonroe won a portion of the popular vote in Virginia and North Carolina, while the New York legislature split its electoral votes between Madison and Clinton.\nSource (Popular Vote): \"A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787-1825\"\nSource (Electoral Vote): \n(a) \"Only 10 of the 17 states chose electors by popular vote.\"&lt;br&gt;\n(b) \"Those states that did choose electors by popular vote had widely varying restrictions on suffrage via property requirements.\"&lt;br&gt;\n(c) \"One Elector from Kentucky did not vote.\"\nPopular vote by state.\nThe popular vote totals used are the elector from each party with the highest total of votes.

{"id": "40476", "revid": "42186636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40476", "title": "1812 United States presidential election", "text": "Presidential elections were held in the United States from October 30 to December 2, 1812. In the shadow of the War of 1812, incumbent Democratic-Republican President James Madison narrowly defeated DeWitt Clinton, the lieutenant governor of New York and mayor of New York City, who drew support from dissident Democratic-Republicans in the North as well as Federalists. It was the first presidential election to be held during a major war involving the United States. As no significant British incursions into American territory had occurred by that time, and Britain's war strategy was largely defensive, the election proceeded without disruption.\nNorthern Democratic-Republicans had long been dissatisfied by the Southern dominance of their party, and DeWitt Clinton's uncle, Vice President George Clinton, had unsuccessfully challenged Madison for the party's 1808 presidential nomination. While the May 1812 Democratic-Republican congressional nominating caucus re-nominated Madison, the party's New York caucus, also held in May, nominated Clinton for president. After the United States declared war on the United Kingdom in June 1812, Clinton sought to create a coalition of anti-war Democratic-Republicans and Federalists. With Clinton in the race, the Federalist Party declined to formally put forth a nominee, hoping its members would vote for Clinton, but they did not formally endorse him, fearing that an explicit endorsement of Clinton would hurt the party's fortunes in other races. Federalist Jared Ingersoll of Pennsylvania became Clinton's de facto running mate. A dissident faction of the Federalist Party attempted to nominate former vice presidential candidate Rufus King over Clinton, but only succeeded in doing so in Virginia.\nDespite Clinton's success at attracting Federalist support, Madison was re-elected with 50.4 percent of the popular vote to his opponent's 47.6%, making the 1812 election the closest election up to that point in the popular vote (there was no popular vote in half the states). Clinton won the Federalist bastion of New England as well as three Mid-Atlantic states, but Madison dominated the South and took Pennsylvania. This was the narrowest popular vote margin for a victorious re-elected president until 2004.\nBackground.\nResidual military conflict resulting from the Napoleonic Wars in Europe had been steadily worsening throughout James Madison's first term, with the British Empire and the French Empire both ignoring the neutrality rights of the United States at sea by seizing American ships and looking for supposed British deserters in a practice known as impressment. The British provided additional provocations by impressing American seamen, maintaining forts within United States territory in the Northwest, and supporting Native Americans at war with the United States in both the Northwest and Southwest.\nMeanwhile, expansionists in the south and west of the United States coveted British Canada and Spanish Florida and wanted to use British provocations as a pretext to seize both areas. The pressure steadily built, with the result that the United States declared war on the United Kingdom on June 12, 1812. This occurred after Madison had been nominated by the Democratic-Republicans, but before the Federalists had made their nomination. He won the nomination with 128 votes.\nNominations.\nDemocratic-Republican Party nomination.\nDemocratic-Republican candidates:\nMany Democratic-Republicans in the northern states were unhappy over the perceived dominance of the presidency by the state of Virginia (three of the last four presidents had been Virginians), and they wished instead to nominate one of their own rather than re-nominate President Madison. Initially, these hopes were pinned upon Vice President George Clinton, but his poor health and advanced age of 72 eliminated his chances. Even before Clinton's death on April 20, 1812, his nephew New York Lieutenant Governor DeWitt Clinton was considered the preferred candidate to move against Madison by the northern Democratic-Republicans.\nHoping to forestall a serious movement against President James Madison and a division of the Democratic-Republican Party, some proposed making DeWitt Clinton the nominee for the vice presidency, taking over the same office his uncle now held. DeWitt Clinton was not opposed to the offer, but preferred to wait until after the conclusion of the New York caucus, which would not be held until after the congressional caucus had met, to finalize his decision. Early caucuses were held in the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania, both of which pledged their support to Madison.\nEighty-three of the one hundred thirty-eight of the Democratic-Republican members of the United States Congress attended the nominating caucus in May 1812. The delegations from New York and New England had less representation due to the New York members supporting DeWitt Clinton's attempt to gain the support of the Federalists and the New England members opposing Madison's foreign policy. Eighty-two of the delegates voted to give the presidential nomination to Madison while John Langdon won the vice-presidential nomination against Elbridge Gerry by a vote of sixty-four to sixteen. However, Langdon declined the nomination citing his age and it was instead given to Gerry after another vote was held with seventy-four delegates voting for him.\nWhen the New York caucus did meet on May 29, it was dominated by anti-war Democratic-Republicans, and nominated DeWitt Clinton for the presidency almost unanimously. Clinton's now open candidacy was opposed by many who, while not friends of James Madison, feared that Clinton was now apt to tear the Democratic-Republican party asunder. The matter of how to conduct his campaign also became a major problem for Clinton, especially with regards to the war with the British after June 12. Many of Clinton's supporters were war-hawks who advocated extreme measures to force the British into negotiations favorable to the United States, while Clinton knew he would have to appeal to Federalists to win, and they were almost wholly opposed to the war.\nFederalist nomination.\nFederalist candidates:\nBefore Clinton entered the race as an alternative to President Madison, Chief Justice John Marshall was a favorite for the Federalist presidential nomination, a relatively popular figure who could carry much of the Northeast while potentially taking Virginia and North Carolina as well. But with Clinton in the race, the Federalists would no longer be able to count on the electoral votes of New York, possibly throwing the election into the House of Representatives, dominated by Democratic-Republicans, where Madison would almost certainly be elected.\nIn the face of these facts, the Federalist party considered endorsing Clinton's candidacy for a time, but at their caucus in September it was decided that the party simply would not field a presidential candidate that year and did not endorse Clinton. Though there was much support among the Federalists for Clinton, it was felt that openly endorsing him as the party's choice for president would damage his chances in states where the Federalists remained unpopular and drive away Democratic-Republicans who would normally be supportive of his candidacy. A Federalist caucus in Pennsylvania chose to nominate Jared Ingersoll, the Attorney General of the state, as Clinton's vice presidential running-mate, a move Clinton decided to support considering the importance of Pennsylvania's electors.\nStraight-Federalist nomination.\nWhile many Federalists were supportive of DeWitt Clinton's candidacy, others were not so keen, skeptical of Clinton's positions regarding the war and other matters. Rufus King, a former diplomat and Representative, had led an effort at the September Caucus to nominate a Federalist ticket for the election that year, though he was ultimately unsuccessful. Still, some wished to enter King's name into the race under the Federalist label, and while very little came of it, it caused problems for the Clinton campaign in two states.\nIn the case of Virginia, Clinton was rejected entirely by the state Federalist Party, which instead chose to nominate Rufus King for president and William Richardson Davie for vice president. The ticket would acquire about 27% of the vote in the state. In New York, with the Federalists having gained control of the state legislature that summer, it was planned that the Federalists would nominate a slate pledged to Rufus King now that they had the majority. However, a coalition of Democratic-Republicans and Federalists would defeat the motion and succeed in nominating a slate pledged to Clinton.\nGeneral election.\nCampaign.\nThe war heavily overshadowed the campaign. Clinton continued his regional campaigning, adopting an anti-war stance in the Northeast (which was most harmed by the war), and a pro-war stance in the South and West. The election ultimately hinged on New York and Pennsylvania, and while Clinton took his home state, he failed to take Pennsylvania and thus lost the election. Though Clinton lost, the election was the best showing for the Federalists since that of Adams, as the party made gains in Congress and kept the presidential election reasonably close. Clintonite Democratic-Republicans in many states refused to work with their Federalist counterparts (notably in Pennsylvania) and Clinton was generally regarded by most as the Federalist candidate, though he was not formally nominated by them.\nResults.\nMadison was the first of just four presidents in United States history to win re-election with a lower percentage of the electoral vote than in their prior elections, as Madison won 69.3% of the electoral vote in 1808, but only won 58.7% of the electoral vote in 1812. The other three were Woodrow Wilson in 1916, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944 and Barack Obama in 2012. Additionally, Madison was the first of only five presidents to win re-election with a smaller percentage of the popular vote than in prior elections, although in 1812, only 6 of the 18 states chose electors by popular vote. The other four are Andrew Jackson in 1832, Grover Cleveland in 1892, Franklin Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944, and Barack Obama in 2012.\nThis was the closest re-election for an incumbent president until the 2004 election. \nJames Madison was 5 ft 4 in (163 cm), and DeWitt Clinton stood 6 ft 0 in (183 cm). In no other US presidential election has the height difference between candidates (8 inches or 20 cm) been so great where the winner was the shorter candidate.\nSource (Popular Vote): \"United States Presidential Elections, 1788-1860: The Official Results\" by Michael J. Dubin&lt;br&gt;\nSource (Popular Vote): A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787\u20131825\nSource (Electoral Vote): \n(a) \"Only 9 of the 18 states chose electors by popular vote.\"&lt;br&gt;\n(b) \"Those states that did choose electors by popular vote had widely varying restrictions on suffrage via property requirements.\"&lt;br&gt;\n(c) \"One elector from Ohio did not vote.\"\nPopular vote by state.\nElections in this period were vastly different from modern day presidential elections. The actual presidential candidates were rarely mentioned on tickets and voters were voting for particular electors who were pledged to a particular candidate. There was sometimes confusion as to who the particular elector was actually pledged to. Results are reported as the highest result for an elector for any given candidate. For example, if three Madison electors received 100, 50, and 25 votes, Madison would be recorded as having 100 votes. Confusion surrounding the way results are reported may lead to discrepancies between the sum of all state results and national results.\nReturns below are from A New Nation Votes. The vote totals of Kentucky appear to be incomplete, and those of Tennessee appear to be lost.\nElectoral college selection.\n! Method of choosing electors\n! State(s)\nIn New Jersey, Federalists had just taken over the state legislature and decided to change the method of choosing electors from a general election to appointment by state legislature. Some towns, possibly too far away to get the news, or in open defiance of the switch, held elections anyway. These were not counted nor reported by the newspapers. In the unofficial elections, Madison received 1,672 votes while Clinton only received 2, suggesting these were protest votes (New Jersey was far more competitive than this at the time).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "40479", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40479", "title": "Minardi", "text": "Italian racing team\nMinardi was an Italian automobile racing team and constructor founded in Faenza in 1979 by Giancarlo Minardi. It competed in the Formula One World Championship from 1985 until 2005 with little success, nevertheless acquiring a loyal following of fans. In 2001, to save the team from folding, Minardi sold it to Australian businessman Paul Stoddart, who ran the team for five years before selling it on to Red Bull GmbH in 2005 who renamed it Scuderia Toro Rosso. Initially called \"M\" (short for Minardi) then a number, from 2001, all of Minardi chassis were called \"PS\", the PS being the initials of team owner, Paul Stoddart.\nDuring its time in F1, the team scored a total of 38 championship points; 16 of these were earned by the team's first driver, Pierluigi Martini. Martini also recorded the team's only front row start, qualifying 2nd at the 1990 United States Grand Prix, and he led a lap during the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix, the only time a Minardi led a lap. The team never achieved a podium finish, only managing three 4th-place finishes: Martini twice in 1991 and Christian Fittipaldi in 1993.\nIn the 21 seasons, Minardi entered 37 drivers. Thirteen had Italian nationality (nine of whom raced during the time the team was owned by Giancarlo Minardi), the others came with 13 different nationalities (discounting Doornbos racing under a Monaco license in 2005). Martini holds the record for more starts with the team with 103 Grands Prix, followed by Gianni Morbidelli and Marc Gen\u00e9 with 33 starts.\nBefore Minardi's demise, the team was particularly well-liked within Formula One circles for its friendliness, accessibility, and lack of corporate culture. On the track, their cars were regarded by many as well-designed for their tiny budget, their low position recognised as a result of a lack of funds (and engine power) rather than a poor car. They also resisted employing pay-drivers more than most other financially constrained teams. Former Minardi drivers include double World Champion Fernando Alonso, Grand Prix winners Alessandro Nannini, Giancarlo Fisichella, Jarno Trulli and Mark Webber; CART IndyCar World Series double champion Alessandro Zanardi and race winners Justin Wilson and Christian Fittipaldi; and 24 Hours of Le Mans overall winners Michele Alboreto, Pierluigi Martini, and Marc Gen\u00e9.\nHistory.\nThe Minardi family has a longstanding involvement in motorsport. Giancarlo Minardi's grandfather had a Fiat dealership in Faenza since 1927, while his father, Giovanni Minardi, competed in his own cars in the late 1940s. The first Minardi car ever was the GM75 built by Giovanni Minardi: it had a 6 cylinder engine designed by Oberdan Golfieri and built by Antonio Lotti. Rino Ferniani drove it at the Circuito del Garda, retiring when he was leading the race.\nAfter his father\u2019s death, Giancarlo took over the racing part of the family business. He took the reins of the Scuderia del Passatore in the early 1970s. He decided to start competing with a Brabham BT28 chassis and an Alfa Romeo engine in Formula Italia rather than Formula 3, like it was decided before. In 1972, the team finished runner-up with Giancarlo Martini, but he won in the following season. In 1974, Lamberto Leoni lost the championship due to a controversial black flag. In 1975, the team was renamed \u201cScuderia Everest\u201d for sponsorship reasons. The promising Elio De Angelis raced for the team in 1977 and 1978 while Clay Regazzoni raced in 1978 and 1979. Minardi ran with March chassis and BMW engines in Formula Two from 1975 to 1979.\nIn 1976, the team briefly ran a customer Formula One Ferrari 312T with Giancarlo Martini, uncle of Pierluigi Martini. Martini Sr. qualified 15th for the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch but failed to start the race after an accident during the warm-up lap. The team then competed at the BRDC International Trophy in Silverstone where Martini finished 10th. In 1979, Minardi received financial backing from well known Italian motor racing patron Piero Mancini and set up the Minardi racing team as a Formula Two constructor.\nRacing history.\nFormula Two (1980\u20131984).\nThe team first competed under the Minardi name in the 1980 European Formula Two championship. Rather than using a customer chassis, the team commissioned a BMW-powered design from Giacomo Caliri's FLY studios \u2014 previously responsible for the Fittipaldi Automotive team's F5A Formula One car. The first Minardi's driver was Miguel \u00c1ngel Guerra, who achieved 9th place in the standings with 10 points. In 1981, Caliri and Marmiroli designed the Minardi M281 driven by Michele Alboreto, Johnny Cecotto, Miguel \u00c1ngel Guerra, Roberto Farneti and Enzo Coloni: Alboreto won the Misano race and finished 8th with 13 points, Cecotto gained 3 points and moved to March in summer. A Ferrari Dino 206 engine was used in 1981, but the team changed to a BMW four-cylinder unit in 1982. The new design continued Minardi's naming logic and was called the Minardi M282. The drivers were Alessandro Nannini and Paolo Barilla. Barilla didn't score any points, Nannini got 10th place with 8 points. The 1983 season saw several drivers racing with the Minardi M283: Alessandro Nannini (11 points), Pierluigi Martini (6 points), Paolo Barilla (0 points), Enzo Coloni (1 race), Emilio De Villota (2 races), Oscar Larrauri (1 race) and Aldo Bertuzzi (1 race). The last season in Formula 2 was in 1984. Nannini (finished 10th with 9 points) was the first driver, the others were Roberto Del Castello (14th, 1 point), Pierre Chauvet (1 race) and Lamberto Leoni (3 races).\nThe team's most notable result remains the 1981 win at the Misano round by Michele Alboreto. Minardi left the lower division at the end of 1984, although in 1986 a modified version of their final Formula Two car, the M283, was entered without success in two rounds of the Formula 3000 championship which had replaced Formula Two in 1985.\nMinardi Formula One (1985\u20131993).\nDuring 1984, Minardi took the decision to enter Formula One the following year. Caliri designed the M184, the team's prototype Formula One car (intended as a dual purpose design for the new Formula 3000) around Alfa Romeo's V8 turbocharged engine but when engineer Carlo Chiti left Alfa Romeo to found Motori Moderni, Minardi became the only customer for his new V6 engine design. The engine was not ready for the start of the season, so the team converted their M185 chassis to accept a Cosworth DFV engine for the first two races. The single car team was unsuccessful in its first year, scoring no points. The new engine was underpowered and driver Pierluigi Martini finished only two races, although he was also classified 11th at the German Grand Prix despite stopping with engine problems. Martini's best position was 8th in the 1985 Australian Grand Prix, behind Huub Rothengatter in an Osella.\nNonetheless, the team expanded to two cars for the season. In 1988, Minardi switched to Cosworth engines, and in 1989 it became top entrant for Pirelli's return to Formula One. The team was moderately successful in the midfield through the late 1980s and early 1990s, giving a succession of Italian drivers their first chance at the top level, including Alessandro Nannini, Pierluigi Martini and Gianni Morbidelli (Nannini, who had been the team's Formula 2 driver from 1982\u20131984, had actually been the team's first choice as their F1 driver in 1985, but they had to go with Martini after FISA refused to grant Nannini the Super Licence required to drive in F1. They would grant Nannini the licence in 1986). Martini in particular was synonymous with Minardi, eventually having three spells with the team. He drove for them on their debut in 1985, scored their first point in the 1988 United States Grand Prix, although he had been running 5th for quite a long time during the race until being passed by Tyrrell's Jonathan Palmer, took their only front-row start at 1990 USA Grand Prix (aided by special Pirelli tyres; several of their other drivers had surprise qualifying results that day. Also, day 2 of qualifying was rained out so no one improved), their only lap leading a race in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix, where he finished 5th, and scored their joint-best F1 result up to that point (the other being at the British Grand Prix the same year).\nIn 1991, Minardi became the first team in modern times to make use of customer engines from Ferrari and in 1992 they used Lamborghini V12s. In 1993, Minardi enjoyed a good campaign, collecting seven points thanks to Christian Fittipaldi's fourth place in the 1993 South African Grand Prix and fifth place in the 1993 Monaco Grand Prix and Fabrizio Barbazza sixth places in the 1993 European Grand Prix and 1993 San Marino Grand Prix.\nMinardi, Scuderia Italia and Fondmetal (1994\u20132000).\nAs the number of small teams shrank, Minardi slipped from the mid-field towards the back of the grid. Money woes hit and in 1994 Minardi merged with BMS Scuderia Italia in an effort to survive. Giancarlo Minardi retained 14.5% with the remaining 85.5% distributed between the Scuderia Italia investors (Emilio Gnutti, Giuseppe Lucchini and Vittorio Palazzani) and Defendente Marniga. In 1994, Martini finished 5th at both the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix and 1994 French Grand Prix, while Michele Alboreto scored his last point in Formula 1 with a 6th place in the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. Acknowledging that the team was struggling, Bernie Ecclestone spoke to Flavio Briatore, who agreed to buy a share in the team in 1995. In 1996, Italian businessman Gabriele Rumi, former owner of the Fondmetal team switched his sponsorship support from Tyrrell to Minardi. He gradually increased his interest in the Faenza outfit, becoming co-owner and chairman. In 1997, Minardi teamed up with engine manufacturer Brian Hart. For the season the team were forced to use 1998-spec Ford Zetec-R V10 engines, which were rebadged as Fondmetal engines in deference to his financial input. However, Rumi's poor health forced him to withdraw his backing at the end of the season.\nPoints were rare during this time; Pedro Lamy scored his one and only point in Formula 1 with a 6th place in the 1995 Australian Grand Prix; this result was followed by a long barren spell until Marc Gen\u00e9 finished 6th in the 1999 European Grand Prix. That same race, Luca Badoer had been running fourth until his gearbox failed with 13 laps to go, at which point the Italian burst into tears next to his stricken car. Other Minardi drivers also came close to scoring points, including Shinji Nakano who finished 7th at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix and Esteban Tuero, who finished 8th at the 1998 San Marino Grand Prix.\nMinardi was known for not using pay drivers, but for the 2000 season, the team signed Argentinian Gast\u00f3n Mazzacane, who only acquired the seat thanks to backing from the short-lived pay television channel Pan-American Sports Network.\nEuropean Minardi (2001\u20132005).\nThe team, now near collapse, was purchased by Australian businessman Paul Stoddart in early 2001, merging it with his European Racing Formula 3000 team. That season saw Fernando Alonso make his F1 debut for the team at the age of 19; though he (and the team) failed to score any points that year, his performance was impressive enough that the reborn Renault F1 team signed him for 2002. He was replaced by Mark Webber, another future race winner, and heavy attrition at his debut race in Melbourne saw him finish in the points in 5th, with teammate Alex Yoong just outside the points in 7th. During the season the team used Asiatech branded engines (formerly Peugeot), the rest of the season did not yield any further points for the team. The team finished above the newly debuted Toyota factory team who arguably had a much more sizable budget for the debut campaign than Minardi's budgets over several seasons combined. Minardi also finished ahead of the Arrows team who went bankrupt halfway through the season due to mounting debts and several mounting court cases against them.\nFrom 2003 until their final season in 2005, Minardi used Ford Cosworth/Cosworth branded engines due to Asiatech folding at the end of the previous season. The Cosworth engines though not very reliable did help Minardi to some decent points scoring positions now and again.\nAnother memorable episode happened during the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix. The race was stopped just after 75% distance, after treacherous weather and a sequence of accidents, including a spin into the grass for lead Minardi driver Jos Verstappen. Stoddart later claimed that Verstappen had enough fuel on board to last until just after the time the red flag was eventually waved, due to the large number of safety car laps. Assuming Stoddart was being truthful, Verstappen may well have won this race had he not spun.\nDuring its final years, the Minardi team was almost as famous for its politics as for its racing. Stoddart was described as the Formula One teams' unofficial shop steward. During his time as team principal, Stoddart campaigned for reduced costs in the sport. He appealed to the competing car manufacturers for an agreement where the independent (and, on the whole, financially weaker) teams in Formula One would get cheaper engine deals than at present. In return, the team principals who would benefit from this would support the works teams when it came to opposing new rule changes enforced by the FIA, such as the proposed ban on traction control. Before the start of the 2004 season, however, Stoddart threatened to withdraw his support against the ban on traction control, but later changed his mind. Midway through the 2004 season, the other teams voted to change the unpopular single lap qualifying system back to the old 1 hour format, but Stoddart voted against because it would also mean the 107% rule being reintroduced; this meant the change never occurred, as a unanimous vote was required to change something so significant in the middle of a season. Before the 2005 Australian Grand Prix, Stoddart initially threatened to withdraw his cars if they were made to comply with the revised regulations for 2005, claiming Minardi could not afford to do so. Once again Stoddart ended up withdrawing his threat. Stoddart also repeatedly called for the resignation of the FIA's President, Max Mosley, particularly in the aftermath of the 2005 United States Grand Prix where the majority of teams withdrew from the race due to safety concerns about their Michelin tyres. While Minardi had run Bridgestone tyres, Stoddart had offered to compromise with the Michelin teams but Mosley had rejected it.\nIn 2004, Minardi was represented by two rookies, Italian Gianmaria \"Gimmi\" Bruni and Hungarian Zsolt Baumgartner. During the year, they celebrated their 20th season in F1. Baumgartner scored Minardi's first point in more than 2 years at the United States Grand Prix, finishing 8th. Baumgartner was also the first Hungarian to score a point in a World Championship F1 race.\nIn 2005, Minardi's drivers were Christijan Albers and Patrick Friesacher. They amassed a total of seven points following the debacle of the 2005 United States Grand Prix, in which they finished fifth and sixth (of six runners) respectively. After losing financial backing from his sponsors before the 2005 German Grand Prix, Friesacher was replaced by Dutch Jordan test driver Robert Doornbos, creating the first all-Dutch driver line-up in Formula One since Carel Godin de Beaufort and Ben Pon drove together for the Ecurie Maarsbergen team at the 1962 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.\nRed Bull purchase.\nIn 2005, Paul Stoddart stated that he would sell Minardi if he could find the right buyer. Stoddart claimed that he had 41 approaches. His criterion for a sale was the ability of a buyer to move the team forward and leave the team based in Faenza. The drinks manufacturer Red Bull GmbH, which already owned another Formula One team, Red Bull Racing, decided to set up a second team to promote drivers who had risen through its young driver programme, Red Bull Driver Search by integrating all Minardi F1 Academy members and resources.\nEnding several weeks of speculation on 10 September 2005 Red Bull announced it would take control of Minardi in November and run it as their \"rookie team\" from 2006.\nMinardi fans worldwide immediately started an online petition to save the Minardi team name and the team's 20-year heritage in F1 after the news broke. The petition was not successful and the team was renamed Scuderia Toro Rosso for the 2006 season. The greatly increased funding from Red Bull, including the use of the Red Bull chassis, customer Ferrari engines and Red Bull Technology transmissions, gradually led to improved results, culminating in Toro Rosso's only pole position and win by Sebastian Vettel at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. The team was further renamed Scuderia AlphaTauri in 2020 to promote the clothing brand of Red Bull. The team won as AlphaTauri at Monza in 2020, with Pierre Gasly. The team was further renamed again as Visa Cash App RB in 2024.\nRacing return for Minardi.\nGiancarlo Minardi and Paul Stoddart have both made use of the Minardi name in new motorsport ventures.\nOn 1 January 2006, Giancarlo Minardi re-acquired certain rights to use the Minardi name in racing. He also announced that he was licensing the Minardi name to established team GP Racing in the junior Euro Formula 3000 series, to be entitled 'Minardi Team by GP Racing'. The team raced with moderate success, scoring a podium in each leg of the Spa round in June 2006. For 2007, Minardi Team by GP Racing combined forces with GP2 team Piquet Sports, to form Minardi Piquet Sports. For 2008 the team was known simply as Piquet Sports.\nIn 2006, Paul Stoddart declared his intention to enter a new team called 'European Minardi F1 Team Ltd' into Formula One beginning in . His application was unsuccessful, with the 12th place on the grid being awarded to Prodrive. Instead, Stoddart turned his attentions to the U.S.-based Champ Car series. On 18 December 2006, it was confirmed that he had purchased a controlling interest in the CTE Racing-HVM Champ Car team and that the team would be renamed Minardi Team USA. In 2007, the team had reasonable success. Robert Doornbos took two wins and several podium places on his way to third in the series, winning Rookie of the Year honours. When the series folded before its planned 2008 season, Stoddart's involvement ceased, with the team entering the IndyCar Series under the HVM name.\nStoddart retains the right to use the Minardi name for a British-registered company.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

() is a global fashion brand based in Ponzano Veneto, Italy, founded in 1965. Benetton Group has a network of about 5,000 stores worldwide. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Benetton family's holding company .\nHistory.\nIn 1965, the Benettons opened their first store in Belluno, in the Veneto region of northern Italy, and three years later, in Paris. The company's core business consists of clothing brands United Colors of Benetton and Sisley.\nBenetton was an iconic brand in the 1980s and 1990s, but has since struggled to regain this position. In 2000, it ranked 75th in Interbrand's ranking of the best global brands; however, by 2002, it had dropped out of the list.\nIn 2012, Benetton Group was delisted from the stock exchange and is now a fully owned subsidiary of the Benetton family company holding.\nIn 2017, the group posted a loss of \u20ac180 million. Prompted by the heavy losses, Luciano Benetton, who was then 83 years old, returned from retirement as executive chairman for the brand.\nRevival efforts also included appointing French designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac as artistic director and re-appointing photographer Oliviero Toscani. As of 2020, United Colors of Benetton had 1,500 employees and used 25,000 workers through subcontractors. In March 2020, Massimo Renon was named CEO of the company.\nOn May 25, 2024, Luciano Benetton announced that the group had a loss of \n\u20ac100 million and accused Renon and other executives of mismanagement.\nFollowing Renon's departure, in 2024 Claudio Sforza was appointed CEO of Benetton Group while Christian Coco became president.\nIn 2025 it was announced that more than 418 stores will close. 180 of 418 were already closed since 2024.\nMarketing.\nBenetton is known for its innovative and often controversial advertising campaigns. In 1982, Benetton hired Oliviero Toscani as creative director, marking a shift from conventional fashion promotion to raising awareness of global social issues. In 1984, Toscani photographed the first multiracial ad for the brand, and by 1989, he had refocused Benetton's advertising strategy under the \"United Colors of Benetton\" slogan. \nThe company's large-scale billboard ads depicted a variety of subjects intended to provoke debate. One featured the deathbed photograph of a man (AIDS activist David Kirby) dying from AIDS, used in a 1992 Benetton campaign during the height of the AIDS crisis in the US. Another showed a bloodied, unwashed newborn baby with umbilical cord still attached. This ad prompted roughly 650 complaints to the British Advertising Standards Authority, which noted in its 1991 annual report that it had \"attracted more complaints than we have ever previously known.\" Other images addressed the issues of race, including a black stallion mating with a white mare, a light-skinned girl with blond hair hugging a dark-skinned boy whose hair was styled into devil horns, and a black woman breastfeeding a white child.\nIn 2000, Benetton was included in the reference publication \"Guinness World Records\" for the \"Most Controversial Campaign\".\nIn November 2011, Benetton created the UNHATE Foundation, launching a worldwide communication campaign described as an invitation to leaders and citizens of the world to combat the \"culture of hatred\". Benetton claimed the campaign was created to serve as its corporate social responsibility strategy. The UNHATE poster series uses altered images of political and religious leaders, such as then-President of the United States Barack Obama and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, then President of Venezuela, kissing each other. Following Vatican protests, Benetton removed an ad purportedly showing Pope Benedict XVI kissing Ahmed Mohamed el Tayeb, the imam of Egypt's Al Azhar mosque.\nBenetton won the Press Grand Prix at the 2012 Cannes Ad festival for its Unhate campaign.\nIn November 2017, Benetton launched a campaign in collaboration with Devbhumi, a company owned by rural women from India's remote Uttarakhand region. The initiative claimed to have empowered more than 6,000 rural women artisans in India.\nIn 2019, Benetton Group announced it would be hosting one of the four days of talks and presentations which makes up the 88th annual International Wool Textile Organisation (IWTO) congress.\nSport and sponsorship.\nBenetton Group entered Formula One as a sponsor of Tyrrell in , then Alfa Romeo in ; this arrangement was extended to both Alfa and Toleman in . Benetton Formula Ltd. was formed at the end of 1985 when the Toleman and Spirit teams were sold to the Benetton family. The team saw its greatest success under Flavio Briatore, who managed the team from to . Michael Schumacher won his first Drivers' Championships with the team in and , and the team won their only Constructors' title in 1995. From , the team raced under an Italian licence, although it continued to be based, like Toleman, in Oxfordshire in England. The team was bought by Renault for US$120 million in and was rebranded Renault F1 in 2002.\nIn 1979, Benetton first sponsored their (then amateur) local rugby team, A.S. Rugby Treviso. Benetton Rugby has since become a major force in Italian rugby, with 11 league titles and supplying many players to the national team. Benetton Group was the main sponsor and majority owner of basketball club Pallacanestro Treviso (then known as Benetton Basket) during its golden era from 1982 to 2012, when the club won 17 Italian titles and 2 European cups. Benetton Group has been also main sponsor of Sisley Volley (1987\u20132012).\nCriticisms.\nIn 1991, Edizone Holding International, a Benetton subsidiary, bought Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tierras del Sud Argentino S. A. and became the largest private landowner in Argentina after taking over the land the company had inherited from the 19th century Conquest of the Desert. Benetton has faced criticism, particularly from Mapuche organizations, over its ownership and management of traditional Mapuche lands in Patagonia. In 1997, Benetton invested in a museum in Leleque which presented the Mapuche as migrants from Chile, which was interpreted as an attempt to diminish the Mapuche's traditional claims. The Curi\u00f1anco-Nahuelquir family was evicted from their land in 2002 following Benetton's claim to it, but the land was restored in 2007. The company published a position statement regarding the Mapuche in Patagonia in 2012. Protests and occupations began again in 2015. Activist Santiago Maldonado was last seen being evicted by the Argentine National Gendarmerie from the disputed area in August 2017. His body was found two months later.\nBenetton aroused suspicion when they considered using RFID tracking chips on clothes to monitor inventory. A boycott site alleges the tracking chips \"can be read from a distance and used to monitor the people wearing them.\" Issues of consumer privacy were raised, and the plan was shelved. Benetton's position on RFID technology is also available on their website.\nPETA launched a boycott campaign against Benetton for buying wool from farmers who practiced mulesing. Benetton has since agreed to buy nonmulesed wool and has further urged the wool industry to adopt the PETA and Australian Wool Growers Association agreement to end mulesing. Benetton's position statement on the mulesing controversy is available on their website.\nBuilding collapse at Savar.\nOn 24 April 2013, the eight-storey \"Rana Plaza\" commercial building collapsed outside Dhaka. It housed one of the factories in which Benetton clothing was made. At least 1,130 people died. Benetton first denied reports linking production of their clothing at the factory, but clothes and documents linked to Benetton were discovered at the disaster site. Of the 29 brands identified as having sourced products from the Rana Plaza factories, only nine attended meetings held in November 2013 to agree a proposal on compensation to the victims. Several companies refused to sign including Walmart, Carrefour, Bonmarch\u00e9, Mango, Auchan and Kik. The agreement was signed by Primark, Loblaw, Bonmarche and El Corte Ingles. A year after the collapse, Benetton faced international protests after failing to pay any compensation to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund.

In British English, \"bollocks\" is a comparable expletive. It is mostly a slang term and a profanity which means \"nonsense\", especially as a rebuke in response to communication or actions viewed as deceptive, misleading, disingenuous, unfair or false. As with many expletives, the term can be used as an interjection, or as many other parts of speech, and can carry a wide variety of meanings. A person who excels at communicating nonsense on a given subject is sometimes referred to as a \"bullshit artist\" instead of a \"liar\".\nIn philosophy and psychology of cognition, the term \"bullshit\" is sometimes used to specifically refer to statements produced without particular concern for truth, clarity, or meaning, distinguishing \"bullshit\" from a deliberate, manipulative lie intended to subvert the truth. In business and management, guidance for comprehending, recognizing, acting on and preventing bullshit, are proposed for stifling the production and spread of this form of misrepresentation in the workplace, media and society. Within organizations bullshitting is considered to be a social practice that people engage with to become part of a speech community, to get things done in that community, and to reinforce their identity. Research has also produced the Organizational Bullshit Perception Scale that reveals three factors of organizational bullshit (regard for truth, the boss, and bullshit language) that can be used to gauge perceptions of the extent of organizational bullshit that exists in a workplace.\nThe word is generally used in a depreciatory sense, but it may imply a measure of respect for language skills or frivolity, among various other benign usages. In philosophy, Harry Frankfurt, among others, analyzed the concept of \"bullshit\" as related to, but distinct from, lying; the liar tells untruth, the bullshitter aims to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true\u2014it may be.\nAs an exclamation, \"Bullshit!\" conveys a measure of dissatisfaction with something or someone, but this usage need not be a comment on the truth of the matter.\nEtymology.\n\"Bull\", meaning nonsense, dates from the 17th century, while the term \"bullshit\" has been used as early as 1915 in British and American slang and came into popular usage only during World War\u00a0II. The word \"bull\" itself may have derived from the Old French , meaning \"fraud, deceit\". The term \"horseshit\" is a near synonym. An occasionally used South African English equivalent, though more common in Australian slang, is \"bull dust\".\nAlthough there is no confirmed etymological connection, these older meanings are synonymous with the modern expression \"bull\", generally considered and used as a contraction of \"bullshit\".\nAnother proposal, according to the lexicographer Eric Partridge, is that the term was popularized by the Australian and New Zealand troops from about 1916 arriving at the front during World War I. Partridge claims that the British commanding officers placed emphasis on \"bull\"; that is, attention to appearances, even when it was a hindrance to waging war. The Diggers allegedly ridiculed the British by calling it bullshit.\nIn the philosophy of truth and rhetoric.\nAssertions of fact.\n\"Bullshit\" is commonly used to describe statements made by people concerned with the response of the audience rather than with truth and accuracy. On one prominent occasion, the word itself was part of a controversial advertisement. During the 1980 U.S. presidential campaign, the Citizens Party candidate Barry Commoner ran a radio advertisement that began with an actor exclaiming: \"Bullshit! Carter, Reagan and Anderson, it's all bullshit!\" NBC refused to run the advertisement because of its use of the expletive, but Commoner's campaign successfully appealed to the Federal Communications Commission to allow the advertisement to run unedited.\nHarry Frankfurt's concept.\nIn his essay \"On Bullshit\" (originally written in 1986, and published as a monograph in 2005), philosopher Harry Frankfurt of Princeton University characterizes bullshit as a form of falsehood distinct from lying. The liar, Frankfurt holds, knows and cares about the truth, but deliberately sets out to mislead instead of telling the truth. The \"bullshitter\", on the other hand, does not care about the truth and is only seeking \"to manipulate the opinions and the attitudes of those to whom they speak\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is impossible for someone to lie unless he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such conviction. A person who lies is thereby responding to the truth, and he is to that extent respectful of it. When an honest man speaks, he says only what he believes to be true; and for the liar, it is correspondingly indispensable that he considers his statements to be false. For the bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.\nFrankfurt connects this analysis of bullshit with Ludwig Wittgenstein's disdain of \"non-sense\" talk and with the popular concept of a \"bull session\", in which speakers may try out unusual views without commitment. He fixes the blame for the prevalence of \"bullshit\" in modern society upon the (at that time) growing influence of postmodernism and anti-realism in academia as well as situations in which people are expected to speak or have opinions without appropriate knowledge of the subject matter.\nIn his 2006 follow-up book, On Truth, Frankfurt clarified and updated his definition of bullshitters:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My claim was that bullshitters, although they represent themselves as being engaged simply in conveying information, are not engaged in that enterprise at all. Instead, and most essentially, they are fakers and phonies who are attempting by what they say to manipulate the opinions and the attitudes of those to whom they speak. What they care about primarily, therefore, is whether what they say is effective in accomplishing this manipulation. Correspondingly, they are more or less indifferent to whether what they say is true or whether it is false. (p. 3-4)\nSeveral political commentators have noted that Frankfurt's concept of bullshit provides insights into political campaigns. Gerald Cohen, in \"Deeper into Bullshit\", contrasted the kind of \"bullshit\" Frankfurt describes with a type he referred to as \"unclarifiable unclarity\" (i.e., nonsensical discourse presented as coherent and sincere but is incapable of being meaningful). Cohen points out that this sort of bullshit can be produced either accidentally or deliberately, but is especially prevalent in academia (what he calls \"academic bullshit\"). According to Cohen, a sincere person might be disposed to produce a large amount of nonsense unintentionally or be deceived by and innocently repeat a piece of bullshit without intent to deceive others. However, he defined \"aim-bullshitters\" as those who intentionally produce \"unclarifiable unclarity\" (i.e., Cohen-bullshit) in situations \"when they have reason to want what they say to be unintelligible, for example, in order to impress, or in order to give spurious support to a claim\" (p.\u00a0133).\nCohen gives the example of Alan Sokal's \"Transgressing the Boundaries\" as a piece of \"deliberate\" bullshit (i.e., \"aim-bullshitting\"). Indeed, Sokal's aim in creating it was to show that the \"postmodernist\" editors who accepted his paper for publication could not distinguish nonsense from sense, and thereby by implication that their field was \"bullshit\".\nAnother application of Frankfurt's concept of bullshit is with regards to generative AI. It has been argued that the outputs from ChatGPT and similar chatbots should be regarded as bullshit, particularly when it \"hallucinates\", producing confident but false information. In 2025, researchers proposed a \"bullshit index\" and a \"bullshit taxonomy\" to quantify the degree of disregard for truth in large language models.\nDavid Graeber's theory of bullshit work in the modern economy.\nAnthropologist David Graeber's book \"Bullshit Jobs: A Theory\" argues the existence and societal harm of meaningless jobs. He contends that over half of societal work is pointless, which becomes psychologically destructive.\nEducation and reasoning as immunization against bullshit.\nBrandolini's law, also known as the \"bullshit asymmetry principle\", holds that \"the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than what\u2019s needed to produce it\". This truism highlights that while the battle against misinformation more generally must be fought \"face to face\", the larger war against belief in misinformation won\u2019t be won without prevention. Once people are set in their ways, beliefs are notoriously hard to change. Building immunity against false beliefs in the first place is the more effective long-term strategy.\nUniversity of Washington biologist Carl Bergstrom and professor Jevin West began a college course on \"Calling Bullshit: Data Reasoning in a Digital World\". They then launched the Calling Bullshit website and published a book with the same title.\nAs an object of psychological research.\nAlthough attempts had been made in the past to examine bullshit and bullshitting from a scientific perspective, it did not gain attention among cognitive scientists as a legitimate area of research until 2015 when Dr.\u00a0Gordon Pennycook (still a graduate student at that time) and his colleagues at University of Waterloo developed the \"Bullshit Receptivity Scale\" (BSR), a questionnaire designed to quantify receptivity to a particular kind of bullshit that they called \"pseudo-profound bullshit\". The development of the BSR led to Pennycook and his colleagues winning the 2016 Ig Nobel Prize (for Peace).\nFurther research from Wake Forest University psychologists found evidence to support Frankfurt's notion that a person is more likely to engage in bullshitting when they feel a social pressure to provide an opinion and perceive that they will be given a social \u201cpass\u201d to get away with it. Indeed, some have theorized that social media offers a prime environment for bullshitting as it combines the social pressure to offer one's opinions on a wide variety of topics along with an anonymity that arguably provides a social \u201cpass\u201d. According to researchers from Queen\u2019s University in Belfast (2008): \u201calong with a pervasive and balkanized social media ecosystem and high internet immersion, public life provides abundant opportunities to bullshit and lie on a scale we could have scarcely credited 30 years ago\u201d.\nMore recently, researchers have identified a type of Dunning\u2013Kruger effect for bullshit receptivity called the \"bullshit blind spot.\" The researchers found that those who were the worst at detecting bullshit were not only grossly overconfident in their BS detection abilities but also believed that they were better at detecting it than the average person (i.e., they have a bullshit blind spot). Conversely, those who were the best at detecting bullshit were not only underconfident in their abilities, they also believed they were somewhat worse at detecting it than the average person. The researchers referred to this underconfidence bias among the high performers as \"bullshit blindsight.\"\nGiven that much of the early scientific work on bullshit focused on those more likely to fall for it (i.e., the \"bullshittees\"), some researchers have turned their attention to examining those more likely to produce it (i.e., the \"bullshitters\"). For example, in 2021, a research team at the University of Waterloo developed the \"Bullshitting Frequency Scale\", which measures two types of bullshitting: \"persuasive\" and \"evasive\". They defined \"persuasive bullshitting\" as a rhetorical strategy intended to impress, persuade, or otherwise fit in with others by bullshitting about one's knowledge, ideas, attitudes, skills, or competence. \"Evasive bullshitting\" refers to an evasive rhetorical strategy in which one provides \"non-relevant truths\" in response to inquiries when direct answers could result in reputational harm for oneself or others.\nBuilding on these findings, the researchers also tested the familiar adage that \u201cyou can\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter\u201d. To do so, they explored associations between scores on the Bullshitting Frequency Scale and performance on measures of receptivity to pseudo-profound bullshit, pseudoscientific bullshit, and fake news. They found that higher scores of \"persuasive bullshitting\" positively predicted scores for all three types of \"bullshit receptivity\". In other words, those who are most likely to persuasively bullshit others are in turn more likely to believe persuasive bullshit, suggesting that you can indeed bullshit a bullshitter after all.\nIn everyday language.\nOutside of the academic world, among natural speakers of North American English, as an interjection or adjective, \"bullshit\" conveys general displeasure, an objection to, or points to unfairness within, some state of affairs. With this colloquial usage of \"bullshit\", which began in the 20th century, \"bullshit\" does not give a truth score to another's discourse. It simply labels something that the speaker does not like and feels he is unable to change.\nIn the colloquial English of the Boston, Massachusetts area, \"bullshit\" can be used as an adjective to communicate that one is angry or upset, for example, \"I was wicked bullshit after someone parked in my spot\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lauda won three Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles and\u2014at the time of his retirement\u2014held the record for most podium finishes (54); he won 25 Grands Prix across 13 seasons, and remains the only driver to have won a World Drivers' Championship with both Ferrari and McLaren.\nBorn and raised in Vienna, Lauda was the grandson of local industrialist Hans Lauda. Starting his career in karting, he progressed to Formula Vee and privateer racing in the late 1960s. After his career stalled, Lauda took out a bank loan and secured a place in European Formula Two with March Engineering in , making his Formula One debut with the team at the Austrian Grand Prix. He was promoted to a full-time seat in , ending the season with a non-classified championship finish, while winning the British Formula Two Championship. Lauda moved to BRM for the season, scoring his maiden points finish in Belgium and earning a seat with Ferrari the following year alongside Clay Regazzoni. Lauda took his maiden podium in his debut for Ferrari, and his maiden victory three races later at the Spanish Grand Prix. After winning five Grands Prix in his campaign, Lauda won his first title, becoming the first Ferrari-powered World Drivers' Champion in 11 years. \nWhile leading the championship\u2014amid a fierce title battle with James Hunt\u2014Lauda was seriously injured during the German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring, suffering severe burns and other life-changing injuries when his Ferrari 312T2 caught fire during a crash. He returned to racing six weeks later at the Italian Grand Prix, eventually losing the title to Hunt by one point. Lauda remained at Ferrari in , winning several races on the way to his second championship and clinching the title at the United States Grand Prix. He left Ferrari, where he was replaced by Gilles Villeneuve, and signed with Brabham in , achieving podiums in every race he finished that season, with victories in Sweden and Italy. Amid a winless season for Brabham, which had moved to Ford Cosworth V8 engines, Lauda left the team after the Italian Grand Prix, and took a two-year hiatus from racing. He returned with McLaren in , winning multiple races. After a winless campaign, Lauda was partnered by Alain Prost the following season, where he beat Prost to his third title by a record half-point. Lauda retired after the season\u2014taking his final victory at the Dutch Grand Prix\u2014having achieved 25 race wins, 24 pole positions, 24 fastest laps, and 54 podiums in Formula One. \nOutside of Formula One, Lauda won the N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours in 1973 with Alpina, and the inaugural BMW M1 Procar Championship in 1979 with Project Four. In aviation, Lauda founded and managed three airlines: Lauda Air from 1985 to 1999, Niki from 2003 to 2011, and Lauda from 2016 onwards. He returned to Formula One in an advisory role at Ferrari in , and was the team principal of Jaguar from to . From until his death, Lauda was the non-executive chairman and co-owner of Mercedes, winning six consecutive World Constructors' Championships with the team from to . Lauda was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1993.\nEarly years in racing.\nNiki Lauda was born on 22 February 1949 in Vienna, Austria, to a wealthy paper manufacturing family. His paternal grandfather was the Viennese-born industrialist Hans Lauda.\nLauda became a racing driver despite his family's disapproval. After starting out with a Mini, Lauda moved on into Formula Vee, as was normal in Central Europe, but rapidly moved up to drive in private Porsche and Chevron sports cars. With his career stalled, he took out a \u00a330,000 bank loan, secured by a life insurance policy, to buy his way into the fledgling March team as a Formula Two driver in 1971. Because of his family's disapproval, he had an ongoing feud with them over his racing ambitions and abandoned further contact.\nLauda was quickly promoted to the Formula One team but drove for March in Formula One and Formula Two in 1972. Although the latter cars were good and Lauda's driving skills impressed March principal Robin Herd, March's 1972 Formula One season was catastrophic. Perhaps the lowest point of the team's season came at the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, where both March cars were disqualified within three laps of each other, just past three-quarters of the race distance. Lauda took out another bank loan to buy his way into the BRM team in 1973. Lauda was instantly quick, but the team was in decline; although the BRM P160E was fast and easy to drive it was not reliable and its engine lacked power. Lauda's popularity was on the rise after he was running third at the Monaco Grand Prix that year before a gearbox failure ended his race prematurely, resulting in Enzo Ferrari becoming interested. When his BRM teammate Clay Regazzoni left to rejoin Ferrari in 1974, team owner Enzo Ferrari asked him what he thought of Lauda. Regazzoni spoke so favorably of Lauda that Ferrari promptly signed him, paying him enough to clear his debts.\nFerrari (1974\u20131977).\nAfter an unsuccessful start to the 1970s, culminating in a disastrous start to the season, Ferrari regrouped completely under Luca di Montezemolo and were resurgent in . The team's faith in the little-known Lauda was quickly rewarded by a second-place finish in his debut race for the team, the season-opening Argentine Grand Prix. His first Grand Prix (GP) victory\u2014and the first for Ferrari since 1972\u2014followed only three races later in the Spanish Grand Prix. Although Lauda became the season's pacesetter, achieving six consecutive pole positions, a mixture of inexperience and mechanical unreliability meant Lauda won only one more race that year, the Dutch GP. He finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship and demonstrated immense commitment to testing and improving the car.\nThe 1975 Formula One season started slowly for Lauda; after no better than a fifth-place finish in the first four races, he won four of the next five driving the new Ferrari 312T. His first World Championship was confirmed with a third-place finish at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza; Lauda's teammate Regazzoni won the race and Ferrari clinched their first Constructors' Championship in 11 years. Lauda then picked up a fifth win at the last race of the year, the United States GP at Watkins Glen. He also became the first driver to lap the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife in under seven minutes, which was considered a huge feat as the Nordschleife section of the N\u00fcrburgring was two miles longer than it is today. Lauda did not win the German Grand Prix from pole position there that year; after battling hard with Patrick Depailler for the lead for the first half of the race, Lauda led for the first 9 laps but suffered a puncture at the Wippermann, 9 miles into the 10th lap and was passed by Carlos Reutemann, James Hunt, Tom Pryce and Jacques Laffite; Lauda made it back to the pits with a damaged front wing and a destroyed left front tyre. The Ferrari pit changed the destroyed tyre and Lauda managed to make it to the podium in third behind Reutemann and Laffite after Hunt retired and Pryce had to slow down because of a fuel leak. Lauda was known for giving away any trophies he won to his local garage in exchange for his car to be washed and serviced.\nUnlike 1975 and amidst tensions between Lauda and Montezemolo's successor, Daniele Audetto, Lauda dominated the start of the 1976 Formula One season, winning four of the first six races and finishing second in the other two. By the time of his fifth win of the year at the British GP, he had more than double the points of his closest challengers Jody Scheckter and James Hunt, and a second consecutive World Championship appeared a formality. It was a feat not achieved since Jack Brabham's victories in 1959 and 1960. He also looked set to win the most races in a season, a record held by the late Jim Clark since 1963.\n1976 N\u00fcrburgring crash.\nA week before the 1976 German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring, even though he was the fastest driver on that circuit at the time, Lauda urged his fellow drivers to boycott the race, largely because of the circuit's safety arrangements, citing the organisers' lack of resources to properly manage such a huge circuit, including lack of fire marshals, fire and safety equipment, and safety vehicles. Formula One was quite dangerous at the time (three of the drivers that day later died in Formula One incidents: Tom Pryce in 1977; Ronnie Peterson in 1978; and Patrick Depailler in 1980), but a majority of the drivers voted against the boycott and the race went ahead.\nOn 1 August 1976, during the second lap at the very fast left kink before Bergwerk, Lauda was involved in an accident where his Ferrari swerved off the track, hit an embankment, burst into flames, and made contact with Brett Lunger's Surtees-Ford car. Unlike Lunger, Lauda was trapped in the wreckage. Drivers Arturo Merzario, Lunger, Guy Edwards, and Harald Ertl arrived at the scene a few moments later, but before Merzario was able to pull him from his car, Lauda suffered severe burns to his head and hands and inhaled hot toxic gases that damaged his lungs and blood. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Lauda said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There were basically two or three drivers trying to get me out of the car, but one was Arturo Merzario, the Italian guy, who also had to stop there at the scene, because I blocked the road; and he really came into the car himself, and uh, triggered my, my seatbelt loose, and then pulled me out. It was unbelievable, how he could do that, and I met him afterwards, and I said, 'How could you do it?!'. He said, 'Honestly, I do not know, but to open your seatbelt was so difficult, because you were pushing so hard against it, and when it was open, I got you out of the car like a feather...'.\u2014\u200a\nAs Lauda was wearing a modified helmet, it did not fit him properly; the foam had compressed and it slid off his head after the accident, leaving his face exposed to the fire. Although Lauda was conscious and able to stand immediately after the accident, he later lapsed into a coma. While in the hospital, he was given the last rites.\nLauda suffered extensive scarring from the burns to his head, losing most of his right ear as well as the hair on the right side of his head, his eyebrows, and his eyelids. He chose to limit reconstructive surgery to replacing the eyelids and restoring their functionality. After the accident he always wore a cap to cover the scars on his head. He arranged for sponsors to use the cap for advertising.\nWith Lauda out of the contest, Carlos Reutemann was taken on as his replacement. Ferrari boycotted the Austrian Grand Prix in protest at what they saw as preferential treatment shown toward McLaren driver James Hunt at the Spanish and British Grands Prix.\nThe corner where the accident happened was subsequently named Lauda Links (Lauda Left).\nReturn to racing.\nLauda missed only two races, appearing at the Monza press conference six weeks after the accident with his fresh burns still bandaged. He finished fourth in the Italian Grand Prix, whilst being, by his own admission, absolutely petrified. Formula One journalist Nigel Roebuck recalls seeing Lauda in the pits, peeling the blood-soaked bandages off his scarred scalp. He also had to wear a specially adapted crash helmet so as not to be in too much discomfort. In Lauda's absence, Hunt had mounted a late charge to reduce Lauda's lead in the World Championship standings. Hunt and Lauda were friends away from the circuit, and their personal on-track rivalry, while intense, was cleanly contested and fair. Following wins in the Canadian and United States Grands Prix, Hunt stood only three points behind Lauda before the final race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix.\nLauda qualified third, one place behind Hunt, but on race day there was torrential rain, and Lauda retired after two laps. He later said that he felt it was unsafe to continue under these conditions, especially since his eyes were watering excessively because of his fire-damaged tear ducts and inability to blink. Hunt led much of the race before his tyres blistered and a pit stop dropped him down the order. He recovered to third, thus winning the title by a single point.\nLauda's previously good relationship with Ferrari was severely affected by his decision to withdraw from the Japanese Grand Prix, and he endured a difficult 1977 season; he won the championship through consistency rather than outright pace. Lauda disliked his new teammate, Reutemann, who had served as his replacement driver. Lauda was not comfortable with this move and felt he had been let down by Ferrari. \"We never could stand each other, and instead of taking pressure off me, they put on even more by bringing Carlos Reutemann into the team.\" Having announced his decision to quit Ferrari at season's end, Lauda left earlier after he won the Drivers' Championship at the United States Grand Prix because of the team's decision to run the unknown Gilles Villeneuve in a third car at the Canadian Grand Prix.\nBrabham and first retirement (1978\u20131979).\nJoining Parmalat-sponsored Brabham-Alfa Romeo in 1978 for a $1\u00a0million salary, Lauda endured two unsuccessful seasons, remembered mainly for his one race in the Brabham BT46B, a radical design known as the Fan Car: it won its first and only race at the Swedish GP, but Brabham did not use the car in Formula One again; other teams vigorously protested the fan car's legality and Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone, who at the time was maneuvering for acquisition of Formula One's commercial rights, did not want to fight a protracted battle over the car, but the victory in Sweden remained official. The Brabham BT46 Alfa Romeo flat-12 began the 1978 season at the third race in South Africa. It suffered from a variety of troubles that forced Lauda to retire the car 9 out of 14 races. Lauda's best results, apart from the win in Sweden, was a win in Italy after the penalization of Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve, second places in Monaco and Great Britain, and a third in the Netherlands.\nThe Alfa flat-12 engine was too wide for ground effect designs in that the opposed cylinder banks impeded with the venturi tunnels, so Alfa designed a V12 for 1979. It was the fourth 12-cylinder engine design that propelled the Austrian in Formula One since 1973. Lauda's 1979 Formula One season was again marred by retirements and poor pace, even though he won the non-championship 1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix with the Brabham-Alfa. In the single-make BMW M1 Procar Championship, driving for the British Formula Two team Project Four Racing (led by Ron Dennis) when not in a factory entry, Lauda won three races for P4 plus the series. Decades later, Lauda won a BMW Procar exhibition race event before the 2008 German Grand Prix.\nIn September, Lauda finished fourth in Monza, and won the non-WC Imola event, still with the Alfa V12 engine. After that, Brabham returned to the familiar Cosworth V8. In late September, during practice for the 1979 Canadian Grand Prix, Lauda cut short a practice session and promptly informed team principal Ecclestone, that he wished to retire immediately, as he had no more desire to \"continue the silliness of driving around in circles\". Lauda, who in the meantime had founded Lauda Air, a charter airline, returned to Austria to run the company full-time.\nMcLaren comeback, third world title, and second retirement (1982\u20131985).\nIn 1982, Lauda returned to racing, for an unprecedented $3\u00a0million salary. After a successful test with McLaren, the only problem was to convince then team sponsor Marlboro that he was still capable of winning. Lauda proved he was when, in his third race back, he won the Long Beach Grand Prix. Before the opening race of the season at Kyalami race track in South Africa, Lauda was the organiser of the so-called \"drivers' strike\"; Lauda had seen that the new Super Licence required the drivers to commit themselves to their present teams and realised that this could hinder a driver's negotiating position. The drivers, with the exception of Teo Fabi, barricaded themselves in a banqueting suite at Sunnyside Park Hotel until they had won the day.\nThe 1983 season proved to be transitional for the McLaren team as they were making a change from Ford-Cosworth engines, to TAG-badged Porsche turbo engines, and Lauda did not win a race that year, with his best finish being second at Long Beach behind his teammate John Watson. Some political maneuvering by Lauda forced a furious chief designer John Barnard to design an interim car earlier than expected to get the TAG-Porsche engine some much-needed race testing; Lauda nearly won the last race of the season in South Africa.\nLauda won a third world championship in 1984 by half a point over teammate Alain Prost, due only to half points being awarded for the shortened 1984 Monaco Grand Prix. His Austrian Grand Prix victory that year is so far the only time an Austrian has won his home Grand Prix. Initially, Lauda did not want Prost to become his teammate, as he presented a much faster rival. However, during the two seasons together, they had a good relationship and Lauda later said that beating the talented Frenchman was a big motivator for him. The whole season continued to be dominated by Lauda and Prost, who won 12 of 16 races. Lauda won five races, while Prost won seven. However, Lauda, who set a record for the most pole positions in a season during the 1975 season, rarely matched his teammate in qualifying. Lauda's championship win came in Portugal, when he had to start in eleventh place on the grid, while Prost qualified on the front row. Prost did everything he could, starting from second and winning his seventh race of the season, but Lauda's calculating drive (which included setting the fastest race lap), passing car after car, saw him finish second behind his teammate which gave him enough points to win his third title. His second place was a lucky one though as Nigel Mansell was in second for much of the race. However, as it was his last race with Lotus before joining Williams in 1985, Lotus boss Peter Warr refused to give Mansell the brakes he wanted for his car and the Englishman retired with brake failure on lap 52. As Lauda had passed the Toleman of rookie Ayrton Senna for third place only a few laps earlier, Mansell's retirement elevated him to second behind Prost.\nLauda had signed an initial letter of intent to leave McLaren team and join Renault for the 1985 season. The agreement was not implemented and Lauda stayed with McLaren for the 1985 season.\nThe 1985 season was a disappointment for Lauda, with eleven retirements from the fourteen races he started. He did not start the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps after crashing and breaking his wrist during practice, and he later missed the European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch; John Watson replaced him for that race. He did manage fourth at the San Marino Grand Prix, 5th at the German Grand Prix, and a single race win at the Dutch Grand Prix where he held off a fast-finishing Prost late in the race. This proved to be his last Grand Prix victory, as after announcing his impending retirement at the 1985 Austrian Grand Prix, he retired for good at the end of that season.\nLauda's final Formula One Grand Prix drive was the inaugural Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, South Australia. After qualifying 16th, a steady drive saw him leading by lap 53. However, the McLaren's ceramic brakes suffered on the street circuit and he crashed out of the lead at the end of the long Brabham Straight on lap 57 when his brakes finally failed. He was one of only two drivers in the race who had driven in the non-championship 1984 Australian Grand Prix, the other being World Champion Keke Rosberg, who won in Adelaide in 1985 and took Lauda's place at McLaren in 1986.\nHelmet.\nLauda's helmet was originally painted plain red with his full name written on both sides and the Raiffeisen Bank logo in the chin area. He wore a modified AGV helmet in the weeks following his N\u00fcrburgring accident so as the lining would not aggravate his burned scalp too badly. In 1982, upon his return to McLaren, his helmet was white and featured the red \"L\" logo of Lauda Air instead of his name on both sides, complete with branding from his personal sponsor Parmalat on the top. From 1983 to 1985, the red and white were reversed to evoke memories of his earlier helmet design.\nLater management roles.\nIn 1993, Lauda returned to Formula One in a managerial position when Luca di Montezemolo offered him a consulting role at Ferrari. Halfway through the 2001 season, Lauda assumed the role of team principal of the Jaguar Formula One team. The team failed to improve and Lauda was made redundant, together with 70 other key figures, at the end of 2002.\nIn September 2012, he was appointed non-executive chairman of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport. He took part in negotiations to sign Lewis Hamilton to a three-year deal with Mercedes in 2013. He remained at Mercedes until his death in 2019, winning six World Constructors' Championships with the team.\nRoles beyond Formula One.\nLauda returned to running his airline, Lauda Air, on his second Formula One retirement in 1985. During his time as airline manager, he was appointed consultant at Ferrari as part of an effort by Montezemolo to rejuvenate the team. After selling his Lauda Air shares to majority partner Austrian Airlines in 1999, he managed the Jaguar Formula One racing team from 2001 to 2002. In late 2003, he started a new airline, Niki. Similar to Lauda Air, Niki was merged with its major partner Air Berlin in 2011. In early 2016, Lauda took over chartered airline Amira Air and renamed the company LaudaMotion. As a result of Air Berlin's insolvency in 2017, LaudaMotion took over the Niki brand and asset after an unsuccessful bid by Lufthansa and IAG. Lauda held an airline transport pilot's licence and from time to time acted as a captain on the flights of his airline.\nHe was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1993 and from 1996 provided commentary on Grands Prix for Austrian and German television on RTL. He was, however, criticized for calling Robert Kubica a \"polack\" (an ethnic slur for Polish people) on air in May 2010 at the Monaco Grand Prix.\nLauda is sometimes known by the nickname \"the Rat\", \"SuperRat\" or \"King Rat\" because of his prominent buck teeth. He was associated with both Parmalat and Viessmann, sponsoring the ever-present cap he wore from 1976 to hide the severe burns he sustained in his N\u00fcrburgring accident. Lauda said in a 2009 interview with the German newspaper \"Die Zeit\" that an advertiser was paying \u20ac1.2\u00a0million for the space on his red cap.\nIn 2005, the Austrian post office issued a stamp honouring him. In 2008, American sports television network ESPN ranked him 22nd on their \"top drivers of all-time\" list.\nNiki Lauda wrote five books: \"The Art and Science of Grand Prix Driving\" (titled \"Formula 1: The Art and Technicalities of Grand Prix Driving\" in some markets) (1975); \"My Years With Ferrari\" (1978); \"The New Formula One: A Turbo Age\" (1984); \"Meine Story\" (titled \"To Hell and Back\" in some markets) (1986); \"Das dritte Leben\" (en. \"The third life\") (1996). Lauda credited Austrian journalist Herbert Volker with editing the books.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 1976 battle between Lauda and James Hunt was dramatized in the film \"Rush\" (2013), where Lauda was played by Daniel Br\u00fchl\u2014a portrayal that was nominated for a BAFTA Film Award as well as a Golden Globe. Lauda made a cameo appearance at the end of the film. Lauda said of Hunt's death, \"When I heard he'd died age 45 of a heart attack I wasn't surprised, I was just sad.\" He also said that Hunt was one of the very few he liked, one of a smaller number of people he respected and the only person he had envied.\nLauda appeared in an episode of \"Mayday\" titled \"Niki Lauda: Testing the Limits\" regarding the events of Lauda Air Flight 004, and described running an airline as more difficult than winning three Formula 1 championships.\nIn the 2024 Netflix miniseries \"Senna\", based on the life and career of Ayrton Senna, Lauda is portrayed by German actor Johannes Heinrichs.\nPersonal life.\nLauda dated Mariella von Reininghaus from 1968 to 1975. In 1976 he married the Chilean-Austrian Marlene Knaus. They divorced in 1991. Lauda and Knaus had two sons, Mathias, a racing driver, and Lukas, who acted as Mathias's manager. In 1992 Lauda briefly dated racing driver Giovanna Amati. In 2008 he married Birgit Wetzinger, a flight attendant for his airline. In 2005, Wetzinger donated a kidney to Lauda after the kidney he had received from his brother in 1997 failed. In September 2009, Birgit gave birth to twins, Max and Mia.\nLauda spoke fluent German, English, and Italian.\nLauda came from a Catholic family. In an interview with \"Zeit\" he stated that he left the church for a time to avoid paying church taxes, but went back when he had his two children baptised.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn 20 May 2019, Lauda died in his sleep aged 70 at the University Hospital of Z\u00fcrich where he had been undergoing kidney dialysis. He had experienced a period of ill health exacerbated by his lung injuries from the 1976 accident. He had a double lung transplant the previous year, and kidney transplants in 1997 and 2005.\nAt the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, current and former drivers and teams paid tributes on social media and during the pre-race Wednesday press conference. A moment of silence was held before the race. Throughout the weekend, fans and drivers wore red caps in his honour, with the Mercedes team painting their halo device red with the message \"Niki we miss you\" instead of their usual silver scheme. The Haas VF-19's shark-fin engine cover was painted red with Lauda's name and the years of his birth and death. Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel wore helmets in Lauda's honour, and when Hamilton won the race he dedicated it to Lauda.\nHis funeral at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna was attended by prominent Formula One figures, including Gerhard Berger, Jackie Stewart, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet, Jean Alesi, Lewis Hamilton, David Coulthard, Nico Rosberg, Valtteri Bottas, Ren\u00e9 and Hans Binder, and Ren\u00e9 Rast. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Austrian politicians, including Alexander Van der Bellen, also attended. In accordance with his wishes, Lauda was buried in Heiligenst\u00e4dter Friedhof, wearing the Ferrari racing suit he wore from 1974 to 1977.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "40487", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40487", "title": "Squad automatic weapon", "text": "Portable light machine gun\nA squad automatic weapon (SAW), also known as a section automatic weapon or light support weapon (LSW), is a man-portable automatic firearm attached to infantry squads or sections as a source of rapid direct firepower. Weapons fulfilling this role can be light machine guns, or modified selective-fire rifles fitted with a heavier barrel, bipod and a belt/drum-fed design.\nSquad automatic weapons usually fire the same cartridge (though heavier-bullet variants are preferred) as the assault rifles or battle rifles carried by other members of the unit. This reduces logistical requirements by making it only necessary to supply one type of service ammunition to a unit. These weapons are light enough to be carried and operated by one infantryman, unlike medium machine guns (such as the M1919 Browning) that require a crew to operate at full effectiveness; or heavy machine guns (such as the M2 Browning or the DShK) which fire more powerful cartridges but are also crew-served and typically also require a mounting platform to be operable.\nOverview.\nOne of the first weapons used in this role was the Madsen machine gun. Although limited in today's terms, the Madsen was introduced in an era when the standard infantry rifle was a bolt-action repeater with fixed magazines reloaded with single rounds or chargers; sustained rapid fire with these weapons could be maintained only for very short periods of time. The Madsen was capable of fully automatic fire; despite having only limited magazine capacity, this was still more than that of the infantry rifle, and it was of the quick change detachable box magazine type. Though over 100 years old, the Madsen is still in limited use today. The standard machine guns of this era were of the Maxim type. Used by the British, Germans, and the Russians, these weapons were bulky, heavy, tripod-based, and water-cooled, they required a team of four men and, although excellent in the defence, were not suited to manoeuvre warfare.\nAnother pioneering weapon in this role was the Browning automatic rifle (BAR). Introduced late in World War I, it remained in front-line service into the Vietnam War. Intended originally as an automatic rifle capable of delivering suppressing \"walking fire\" in the advance, the BAR came to be used in the light machine gun role. During World War II, as the importance of having a source of mobile automatic fire increased, the number of BARs in a unit also increased, until in some units it represented 1 in 4 of the weapons present in a squad. During its long service in the US military, it was pivotal in the evolution of U.S. fireteam tactics and doctrine that continues to the present day.\nModern squad automatic weapons (such as the RPK and L86) are modified assault rifles or battle rifles (e.g. FN FAL 50.41 and M14A1) that may have increased ammunition capacity and heavier barrels to withstand continued fire and will almost always have a bipod. In the case of some assault rifles, such as the H&amp;K G36 or Steyr AUG, the SAW is simply the standard rifle with a few parts replaced. However, the Austrian Army, though issuing the Steyr AUG rifle, does not issue the HBAR (heavy barrel) variant. Instead, the 7.62mm caliber MG74, a derivative of WW2-era German MG 42, is issued.\nLight machine guns, either belt-fed or magazine-fed, may be used as squad automatic weapons, as may general-purpose machine guns; for example, during most of the Cold War period, the standard squad automatic weapon in the British Army was the FN Mag-derived L7. The most common squad automatic weapons in use today are derived from two basic patterns: the Kalashnikov-based RPK or the purpose-designed FN Minimi.\nNational examples.\nChina.\nThe People's Liberation Army initially used the Type 56 LMG as the primary light machine gun to replace all of its obsolete WW2 LMGs. After the Sino-Vietnamese War, the PLA adopted the drum-fed Type 81 LMG for high mobility, which was later replaced by QJB-95 since the adoption of QBZ-95. However, the PLA changed back to belt-fed QJB-201 light machine guns since 2021.\nGermany.\nWest Germany's original plan in the late 1980s was to adopt the new 5.56mm Heckler &amp; Koch G41 assault rifle (a variant of the HK33) to replace the 7.62mm Heckler &amp; Koch G3 battle rifle and the 4.7mm Heckler &amp; Koch G11 carbine to replace the 9mm IMI MP2 Uzi and Heckler &amp; Koch MP5. The end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany in 1990 forced everyone to scramble for a cheap alternative. The G36 family was created from a proof-of-concept prototype rechambered to fire the 5.56mm NATO cartridge. It is composed of an assault rifle (G36), light machine gun (MG36), assault carbine (G36K), and PDW (G36C). Though produced, presented and ordered, the MG36 was never adopted by the German Army as the differences and benefits to the G36 were seen as marginal, resulting in the order being cancelled. The 5.56mm NATO MG4 is the standard platoon-level support weapon of the German Army, adopted in 2005. The 7.62mm NATO MG5 resembles the MG4 and is the new general-purpose machine gun of the German Army, adopted in 2015.\nItaly.\nIn the 1980s the Italian military considered the idea of adopting a heavy-barrelled magazine-fed 5.56mm automatic rifle. It was to accompany the 5.56mm Beretta AR70/90 assault rifle and supplement the 7.62mm MG 42/59 general purpose machine gun. A rethinking of the concept led to their adoption of the belt-fed FN Minimi instead.\nNetherlands.\nThe Netherlands Marine Corps is the only part of the Dutch military to use the LOAWNLD (an updated version of the Colt Canada Light Support Weapon) as their squad automatic weapon. All other branches use the FN Minimi for this role.\nSoviet Union/Russian Federation.\nThe Russian support weapon concept was designed around providing one standard cartridge that could be used by the clip-fed rifle (SKS), magazine-fed assault rifle (AK-47) and belt-fed light machine gun (RPD). The SKS and RPD were dropped as being less effective than hoped. The RPK, with its magazine and parts commonality with the base AK-47, was more effective. It replaced the RPD as soon as manufacturing techniques allowed it to be mass-produced.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe SA80 program was designed to create a family of light assault weapons that had a commonality of parts, could use the same ammunition and magazines, and would replace the UK military's collection of submachine guns, rifles, and light machine guns. Originally designed around a lighter experimental 4.85mm cartridge, they were forced to redesign the weapon to take the 5.56mm NATO cartridge. The L85 IW (\"Individual Weapon\") was the rifle version and was designed to replace the 9mm L2 Sterling SMG and 7.62mm L1A1 SLR Rifle. The L86 LSW (\"Light Support Weapon\") was the automatic rifle version and was intended to replace the L4 BREN gun and supplement the FN MAG general-purpose machine gun, replacing it at section level. Teething problems, low quality parts, poor ergonomic design and an inability to be wielded left-handed made the SA80 suite unpopular. The magazine-fed L86 was found to not be as capable of sustained fire as a belt-fed system so it was initially supplemented by the L110A1 FN Minimi and then replaced by it. The L86's role was then changed to that of a designated marksman rifle.\nUnited States.\nIn United States usage, the M249 light machine gun is commonly referred to as the squad automatic weapon or SAW.\nIn the 1970s the United States began realizing that it might have to fight a conflict in the deserts and mountains of the Middle East or Near East rather than the jungles of Asia or forests of Europe and Eurasia. The \"Squad Automatic Weapon\" program was designed to create an intermediate weapon between the M16 rifle and M60 machine gun. It would have to fire tracer ammunition out to a visible range of 800 meters or more, be capable of accurate high-volume sustained fire, and be lighter and more reliable than the M60. Initially the contenders were built around a new intermediate cartridge, but the problems with approval for a new third American-backed standard NATO cartridge forced its abandonment. The program then selected between the control group weapons: the FN Minimi (XM249) and Heckler &amp; Koch HK 23 (XM262) chambered for the improved 5.56mm SS109 round. The FN Minimi was adopted as the M249 because it could optionally fire from magazines from an integral magazine port rather than requiring an exchange of parts in the field like the HK23.\nThe Infantry automatic rifle program was launched by the United States Marine Corps in 2005. Its task was to find a replacement for the heavy and cumbersome M249 SAW that was serving as the Squad Automatic weapon in a fireteam at the time. Two of the weapons in the competition were the FN SCAR HAMR and a slightly modified HK416. The weapon chosen to replace the M249 was the modified HK416, later designated the M27 IAR. The M249 SAW is still in use as a squad automatic weapon by the US Army.\nIn 2019, US Army launched Next Generation Squad Weapon Program to find replacement for M249 SAW and replacement for 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round. There are three competitors:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The muzzle is threaded for a flash suppressor or blank-firing device.\nThe rear stock trunnion was strengthened and the magazine well was reinforced with steel inserts.\nAdditionally, the RPK-74 has a modified return mechanism compared to the AK-74, which uses a new type of metal spring guide rod and recoil spring. The rear sight assembly, forward handguard and receiver dust cover were all retained from the RPK.\nFeeding.\nThe RPK-74 feeds from a 45-round steel or polymer box magazine, interchangeable with magazines from the AK-74, and is designed to be charged from stripper clips. \nDrum magazines similar to those used on the previous RPK models were tested during its development phase, but were discontinued in favor of the 45-round box magazine. However, recently the production of a 97-round drum has started. \nThis drum was designed to be used with the AK-107 but can also be used in any 5.45\u00d739mm weapon with compatible magazines, such as the RPK-74 and RPK-74M. They were also testing with experimental conventional drums, a prototype 100-round belt fed drum magazine was also created. \nThe RPK-74 attaches into the regular magazine well, but the cartridges are stored on a 100-round belt inside a box. A feed system removes them from the belt and puts them in a position where they can be loaded through the regular magazine well. This system is actuated by a lever from the magazine that clips around the charging handle. It is unknown if this ever went into service.\nAccessories.\nStandard equipment includes eight magazines, six stripper clips (15 rounds per clip), a speedloader guide, cleaning rod, cleaning kit, sling, oil bottle and two magazine pouches. Some variants do not come with the cleaning kit option.\nVariants.\nRPKS-74.\nThe RPKS-74 is the paratrooper variant of the RPK-74, equipped with a wooden folding stock from the RPKS.\nRPK-74M.\nThe RPK-74M (; ) is an updated variant of the RPK-74 developed during the mid-'90s. \nIn line with the AK-74M assault rifle variant, the RPK-74M lower handguard, gas tube cover, pistol grip, and new synthetic stock are made from a black, glass-filled polyamide. \nThe stock is shaped like the RPK-74 fixed stock, but also side-folds like the RPKS-74. The stock additionally has an easier to use release mechanism, replacing the bullet press release from the RPKS and RPKS-74. \nEach RPK-74M is fitted standard with a side-rail bracket for mounting optics. It also includes most of the 74M economic changes, such as the dimpled on barrel hardware, omission of lightening cuts from the front sight block and piston and stamped gas tube release lever. Updated magazines were produced by Molot with horizontal ribs going up the sides of the magazines.\nRPK-201.\nAn export variant chambered in 5.56\u00d745mm NATO was introduced, designated as the RPK-201.\nRPK-203.\nA modernised export variant of the RPK was developed, designated as the RPK-203. It uses the same polymer construction as the RPK-74M.\nNight fighting configurations.\nModels designated RPKN-1, RPKSN-1, RPK-74N and RPKS-74N can mount the multi-model night vision scope NSPU-3 (1PN51) while RPKN2, RPKSN2, RPK-74N2 and RPKS-74N2 can mount the multi-model night vision scope NSPUM (1PN58).\nAdoption.\nThe RPK-74 is in widespread use by former Soviet Union states, as well as Bulgaria."}
