Such a topology is called a vector topology and every topological vector space has a uniform topological structure, allowing a notion of uniform convergence and completeness. Some authors also require that the space is a Hausdorff space (although this article does not). One of the most widely studied categories of TVSs are locally convex topological vector spaces. This article focuses on TVSs that are not necessarily locally convex. Other well-known examples of TVSs include Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces and Sobolev spaces.\nMany topological vector spaces are spaces of functions, or linear operators acting on topological vector spaces, and the topology is often defined so as to capture a particular notion of convergence of sequences of functions.\nIn this article, the scalar field of a topological vector space will be assumed to be either the complex numbers formula_1 or the real numbers formula_2 unless clearly stated otherwise. \nMotivation.\nNormed spaces.\nEvery normed vector space has a natural topological structure: the norm induces a metric and the metric induces a topology.\nThis is a topological vector space because:\nThus all Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces are examples of topological vector spaces.\nNon-normed spaces.\nThere are topological vector spaces whose topology is not induced by a norm, but are still of interest in analysis. Examples of such spaces are spaces of holomorphic functions on an open domain, spaces of infinitely differentiable functions, the Schwartz spaces, and spaces of test functions and the spaces of distributions on them. These are all examples of Montel spaces. An infinite-dimensional Montel space is never normable. The existence of a norm for a given topological vector space is characterized by Kolmogorov's normability criterion. \nA topological field is a topological vector space over each of its subfields.\nDefinition.\nA topological vector space (TVS) formula_9 is a vector space over a topological field formula_7 (most often the real or complex numbers with their standard topologies) that is endowed with a topology such that vector addition formula_3 and scalar multiplication formula_5 are continuous functions (where the domains of these functions are endowed with product topologies). Such a topology is called a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;vector topology or a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;TVS topology on formula_13\nEvery topological vector space is also a commutative topological group under addition.\nHausdorff assumption\nMany authors (for example, Walter Rudin), but not this page, require the topology on formula_9 to be T1; it then follows that the space is Hausdorff, and even Tychonoff. A topological vector space is said to be if it is Hausdorff; importantly, \"separated\" does not mean separable. The topological and linear algebraic structures can be tied together even more closely with additional assumptions, the most common of which are listed below.\nCategory and morphisms\nThe category of topological vector spaces over a given topological field formula_7 is commonly denoted formula_16 or formula_17 The objects are the topological vector spaces over formula_7 and the morphisms are the continuous formula_7-linear maps from one object to another.\nA (abbreviated ), also called a , is a continuous linear map formula_20 between topological vector spaces (TVSs) such that the induced map formula_21 is an open mapping when formula_22 which is the range or image of formula_23 is given the subspace topology induced by formula_24\nA (abbreviated ), also called a , is an injective topological homomorphism. Equivalently, a TVS-embedding is a linear map that is also a topological embedding.\nA (abbreviated ), also called a or an , is a bijective linear homeomorphism. Equivalently, it is a surjective TVS embedding\nMany properties of TVSs that are studied, such as local convexity, metrizability, completeness, and normability, are invariant under TVS isomorphisms.\nA necessary condition for a vector topology\nA collection formula_25 of subsets of a vector space is called additive if for every formula_26 there exists some formula_27 such that formula_28\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharacterization of continuity of addition at formula_29\u2014\nIf formula_30 is a group (as all vector spaces are), formula_31 is a topology on formula_8 and formula_33 is endowed with the product topology, then the addition map formula_34 (defined by formula_4) is continuous at the origin of formula_33 if and only if the set of neighborhoods of the origin in formula_37 is additive. This statement remains true if the word \"neighborhood\" is replaced by \"open neighborhood.\"\nAll of the above conditions are consequently a necessity for a topology to form a vector topology.\nDefining topologies using neighborhoods of the origin.\nSince every vector topology is translation invariant (which means that for all formula_38 the map formula_39 defined by formula_40 is a homeomorphism), to define a vector topology it suffices to define a neighborhood basis (or subbasis) for it at the origin.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u00a0(Neighborhood filter of the origin)\u2014\nSuppose that formula_9 is a real or complex vector space. If formula_42 is a non-empty additive collection of balanced and absorbing subsets of formula_9 then formula_42 is a neighborhood base at formula_29 for a vector topology on formula_13 That is, the assumptions are that formula_42 is a filter base that satisfies the following conditions:\nIf formula_42 satisfies the above two conditions but is not a filter base then it will form a neighborhood subbasis at formula_29 (rather than a neighborhood basis) for a vector topology on formula_13\nIn general, the set of all balanced and absorbing subsets of a vector space does not satisfy the conditions of this theorem and does not form a neighborhood basis at the origin for any vector topology.\nDefining topologies using strings.\nLet formula_9 be a vector space and let formula_57 be a sequence of subsets of formula_13 Each set in the sequence formula_59 is called a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;knot of formula_59 and for every index formula_61 formula_62 is called the formula_63-th knot of formula_64 The set formula_65 is called the beginning of formula_64 The sequence formula_59 is/is a:\nIf formula_75 is an absorbing disk in a vector space formula_9 then the sequence defined by formula_77 forms a string beginning with formula_78 This is called the natural string of formula_75 Moreover, if a vector space formula_9 has countable dimension then every string contains an absolutely convex string.\nSummative sequences of sets have the particularly nice property that they define non-negative continuous real-valued subadditive functions. These functions can then be used to prove many of the basic properties of topological vector spaces.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u00a0(formula_81-valued function induced by a string)\u2014\nLet formula_82 be a collection of subsets of a vector space such that formula_83 and formula_68 for all formula_85 For all formula_86 let formula_87\nDefine formula_88 by formula_89 if formula_90 and otherwise let formula_91\nThen formula_92 is subadditive (meaning formula_93 for all formula_94) and formula_95 on formula_96 so in particular, formula_97 If all formula_62 are symmetric sets then formula_99 and if all formula_62 are balanced then formula_101 for all scalars formula_102 such that formula_103 and formula_104 are two collections of subsets of a vector space formula_9 and if formula_102 is a scalar, then by definition:\nIf formula_117 is a collection sequences of subsets of formula_8 then formula_117 is said to be directed (downwards) under inclusion or simply directed downward if formula_117 is not empty and for all formula_121 there exists some formula_122 such that formula_123 and formula_124 (said differently, if and only if formula_117 is a prefilter with respect to the containment formula_126 defined above).\nNotation: Let formula_127 be the set of all knots of all strings in formula_128\nDefining vector topologies using collections of strings is particularly useful for defining classes of TVSs that are not necessarily locally convex.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u00a0(Topology induced by strings)\u2014If formula_37 is a topological vector space then there exists a set formula_117 of neighborhood strings in formula_9 that is directed downward and such that the set of all knots of all strings in formula_117 is a neighborhood basis at the origin for formula_133 Such a collection of strings is said to be formula_31 fundamental.\nConversely, if formula_9 is a vector space and if formula_117 is a collection of strings in formula_9 that is directed downward, then the set formula_138 of all knots of all strings in formula_117 forms a neighborhood basis at the origin for a vector topology on formula_13 In this case, this topology is denoted by formula_141 and it is called the topology generated by formula_128\nIf formula_117 is the set of all topological strings in a TVS formula_37 then formula_145 A Hausdorff TVS is metrizable if and only if its topology can be induced by a single topological string.\nTopological structure.\nA vector space is an abelian group with respect to the operation of addition, and in a topological vector space the inverse operation is always continuous (since it is the same as multiplication by formula_146). Hence, every topological vector space is an abelian topological group. Every TVS is completely regular but a TVS need not be normal.\nLet formula_9 be a topological vector space. Given a subspace formula_148 the quotient space formula_149 with the usual quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological vector space if and only if formula_150 is closed. This permits the following construction: given a topological vector space formula_9 (that is probably not Hausdorff), form the quotient space formula_149 where formula_150 is the closure of formula_154 formula_149 is then a Hausdorff topological vector space that can be studied instead of formula_13\nInvariance of vector topologies.\nOne of the most used properties of vector topologies is that every vector topology is :\nfor all formula_38 the map formula_39 defined by formula_40 is a homeomorphism, but if formula_160 then it is not linear and so not a TVS-isomorphism.\nScalar multiplication by a non-zero scalar is a TVS-isomorphism. This means that if formula_161 then the linear map formula_39 defined by formula_163 is a homeomorphism. Using formula_164 produces the negation map formula_39 defined by formula_166 which is consequently a linear homeomorphism and thus a TVS-isomorphism.\nIf formula_167 and any subset formula_168 then formula_169 and moreover, if formula_170 then formula_171 is a neighborhood (resp. open neighborhood, closed neighborhood) of formula_172 in formula_9 if and only if the same is true of formula_174 at the origin.\nLocal notions.\nA subset formula_175 of a vector space formula_9 is said to be\nEvery neighborhood of the origin is an absorbing set and contains an open balanced neighborhood of formula_29 so every topological vector space has a local base of absorbing and balanced sets. The origin even has a neighborhood basis consisting of closed balanced neighborhoods of formula_191 if the space is locally convex then it also has a neighborhood basis consisting of closed convex balanced neighborhoods of the origin.\nBounded subsets\nA subset formula_175 of a topological vector space formula_9 is bounded if for every neighborhood formula_194 of the origin there exists formula_195 such that formula_196.\nThe definition of boundedness can be weakened a bit; formula_175 is bounded if and only if every countable subset of it is bounded. A set is bounded if and only if each of its subsequences is a bounded set. Also, formula_175 is bounded if and only if for every balanced neighborhood formula_194 of the origin, there exists formula_195 such that formula_201 \nMoreover, when formula_9 is locally convex, the boundedness can be characterized by seminorms: the subset formula_175 is bounded if and only if every continuous seminorm formula_204 is bounded on formula_205\nEvery totally bounded set is bounded. If formula_150 is a vector subspace of a TVS formula_8 then a subset of formula_150 is bounded in formula_150 if and only if it is bounded in formula_13\nMetrizability.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBirkhoff\u2013Kakutani theorem\u2014\nIf formula_37 is a topological vector space then the following four conditions are equivalent:\nBy the Birkhoff\u2013Kakutani theorem, it follows that there is an equivalent metric that is translation-invariant.\nA TVS is pseudometrizable if and only if it has a countable neighborhood basis at the origin, or equivalent, if and only if its topology is generated by an \"F\"-seminorm. A TVS is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and pseudometrizable.\nMore strongly: a topological vector space is said to be normable if its topology can be induced by a norm. A topological vector space is normable if and only if it is Hausdorff and has a convex bounded neighborhood of the origin.\nLet formula_7 be a non-discrete locally compact topological field, for example the real or complex numbers. A Hausdorff topological vector space over formula_7 is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional, that is, isomorphic to formula_223 for some natural number formula_224\nCompleteness and uniform structure.\nThe canonical uniformity on a TVS formula_37 is the unique translation-invariant uniformity that induces the topology formula_31 on formula_13\nEvery TVS is assumed to be endowed with this canonical uniformity, which makes all TVSs into uniform spaces. Therefore making sense to related notions such as completeness, uniform convergence, Cauchy nets, and uniform continuity, etc., which are always assumed to be with respect to this uniformity (unless indicated other). This implies that every Hausdorff topological vector space is Tychonoff. A subset of a TVS is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded (for Hausdorff TVSs, a set being totally bounded is equivalent to it being precompact). But if the TVS is not Hausdorff then there exist compact subsets that are not closed. However, the closure of a compact subset of a non-Hausdorff TVS is again compact (so compact subsets are relatively compact).\nWith respect to this uniformity, a net (or sequence) formula_228 is Cauchy if and only if for every neighborhood formula_194 of formula_230 there exists some index formula_231 such that formula_232 whenever formula_233 and formula_234\nEvery Cauchy sequence is bounded, although Cauchy nets and Cauchy filters may not be bounded. A topological vector space where every Cauchy sequence converges is called sequentially complete; in general, it may not be complete (in the sense that all Cauchy filters converge).\nThe vector space operation of addition is uniformly continuous and an open map. Scalar multiplication is Cauchy continuous but in general, it is almost never uniformly continuous. Because of this, every topological vector space can be completed and is thus a dense linear subspace of a complete topological vector space.\nExamples.\nFinest and coarsest vector topology.\nLet formula_9 be a real or complex vector space.\nTrivial topology\nThe trivial topology or indiscrete topology formula_247 is always a TVS topology on any vector space formula_9 and it is the coarsest TVS topology possible. An important consequence of this is that the intersection of any collection of TVS topologies on formula_9 always contains a TVS topology. Any vector space (including those that are infinite dimensional) endowed with the trivial topology is a compact (and thus locally compact) complete pseudometrizable seminormable locally convex topological vector space. It is Hausdorff if and only if formula_250\nFinest vector topology\nThere exists a TVS topology formula_251 on formula_8 called the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;finest vector topology on formula_8 that is finer than every other TVS-topology on formula_9 (that is, any TVS-topology on formula_9 is necessarily a subset of formula_251). Every linear map from formula_257 into another TVS is necessarily continuous. If formula_9 has an uncountable Hamel basis then formula_251 is not locally convex and not metrizable.\nCartesian products.\nA Cartesian product of a family of topological vector spaces, when endowed with the product topology, is a topological vector space. Consider for instance the set formula_9 of all functions formula_261 where formula_81 carries its usual Euclidean topology. This set formula_9 is a real vector space (where addition and scalar multiplication are defined pointwise, as usual) that can be identified with (and indeed, is often defined to be) the Cartesian product formula_264 which carries the natural product topology. With this product topology, formula_265 becomes a topological vector space whose topology is called the topology of pointwise convergence on formula_266 The reason for this name is the following: if formula_267 is a sequence (or more generally, a net) of elements in formula_9 and if formula_269 then formula_270 converges to formula_92 in formula_9 if and only if for every real number formula_273 formula_274 converges to formula_275 in formula_266 This TVS is complete, Hausdorff, and locally convex but not metrizable and consequently not normable; indeed, every neighborhood of the origin in the product topology contains lines (that is, 1-dimensional vector subspaces, which are subsets of the form formula_277 with formula_278).\nFinite-dimensional spaces.\nBy F. Riesz's theorem, a Hausdorff topological vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if it is locally compact, which happens if and only if it has a compact neighborhood of the origin.\nLet formula_7 denote formula_81 or formula_1 and endow formula_7 with its usual Hausdorff normed Euclidean topology. Let formula_9 be a vector space over formula_7 of finite dimension formula_285 and so that formula_9 is vector space isomorphic to formula_223 (explicitly, this means that there exists a linear isomorphism between the vector spaces formula_9 and formula_223). This finite-dimensional vector space formula_9 always has a unique Hausdorff vector topology, which makes it TVS-isomorphic to formula_291 where formula_223 is endowed with the usual Euclidean topology (which is the same as the product topology). This Hausdorff vector topology is also the (unique) finest vector topology on formula_13 formula_9 has a unique vector topology if and only if formula_250 If formula_296 then although formula_9 does not have a unique vector topology, it does have a unique Hausdorff vector topology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof outline\nThe proof of this dichotomy (i.e. that a vector topology is either trivial or isomorphic to formula_7) is straightforward so only an outline with the important observations is given. As usual, formula_7 is assumed have the (normed) Euclidean topology. Let formula_308 then formula_9 has infinitely many distinct vector topologies:\nNon-vector topologies.\nDiscrete and cofinite topologies\nIf formula_9 is a non-trivial vector space (that is, of non-zero dimension) then the discrete topology on formula_9 (which is always metrizable) is not a TVS topology because despite making addition and negation continuous (which makes it into a topological group under addition), it fails to make scalar multiplication continuous. The cofinite topology on formula_9 (where a subset is open if and only if its complement is finite) is also not a TVS topology on formula_13\nLinear maps.\nA linear operator between two topological vector spaces which is continuous at one point is continuous on the whole domain. Moreover, a linear operator formula_92 is continuous if formula_331 is bounded (as defined below) for some neighborhood formula_9 of the origin.\nA hyperplane in a topological vector space formula_9 is either dense or closed. A linear functional formula_92 on a topological vector space formula_9 has either dense or closed kernel. Moreover, formula_92 is continuous if and only if its kernel is closed.\nTypes.\nDepending on the application additional constraints are usually enforced on the topological structure of the space. In fact, several principal results in functional analysis fail to hold in general for topological vector spaces: the closed graph theorem, the open mapping theorem, and the fact that the dual space of the space separates points in the space.\nBelow are some common topological vector spaces, roughly in order of increasing \"niceness.\"\nDual space.\nEvery topological vector space has a continuous dual space\u2014the set formula_357 of all continuous linear functionals, that is, continuous linear maps from the space into the base field formula_358 A topology on the dual can be defined to be the coarsest topology such that the dual pairing each point evaluation formula_359 is continuous. This turns the dual into a locally convex topological vector space. This topology is called the weak-* topology. This may not be the only natural topology on the dual space; for instance, the dual of a normed space has a natural norm defined on it. However, it is very important in applications because of its compactness properties (see Banach\u2013Alaoglu theorem). Caution: Whenever formula_9 is a non-normable locally convex space, then the pairing map formula_361 is never continuous, no matter which vector space topology one chooses on formula_362 A topological vector space has a non-trivial continuous dual space if and only if it has a proper convex neighborhood of the origin.\nProperties.\nFor any formula_363 of a TVS formula_8 the \"convex\" (resp. \"balanced, disked, closed convex, closed balanced, closed disked\"') \"hull\" of formula_174 is the smallest subset of formula_9 that has this property and contains formula_367 The closure (respectively, interior, convex hull, balanced hull, disked hull) of a set formula_174 is sometimes denoted by formula_369 (respectively, formula_370 formula_371 formula_372 formula_373).\nThe convex hull formula_374 of a subset formula_174 is equal to the set of all convex combinations of elements in formula_376 which are finite linear combinations of the form formula_377 where formula_378 is an integer, formula_379 and formula_380 sum to formula_381 The intersection of any family of convex sets is convex and the convex hull of a subset is equal to the intersection of all convex sets that contain it.\nNeighborhoods and open sets.\nProperties of neighborhoods and open sets\nEvery TVS is connected and locally connected and any connected open subset of a TVS is arcwise connected. If formula_363 and formula_75 is an open subset of formula_9 then formula_385 is an open set in formula_9 and if formula_363 has non-empty interior then formula_388 is a neighborhood of the origin.\nThe open convex subsets of a TVS formula_9 (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex) are exactly those that are of the form formula_390 for some formula_391 and some positive continuous sublinear functional formula_204 on formula_13\nIf formula_394 is an absorbing disk in a TVS formula_9 and if formula_396 is the Minkowski functional of formula_394 then formula_398 where importantly, it was not assumed that formula_394 had any topological properties nor that formula_204 was continuous (which happens if and only if formula_394 is a neighborhood of the origin).\nLet formula_31 and formula_403 be two vector topologies on formula_13 Then formula_405 if and only if whenever a net formula_228 in formula_9 converges formula_29 in formula_409 then formula_244 in formula_133\nLet formula_25 be a neighborhood basis of the origin in formula_8 let formula_168 and let formula_415 Then formula_416 if and only if there exists a net formula_417 in formula_174 (indexed by formula_25) such that formula_420 in formula_13 This shows, in particular, that it will often suffice to consider nets indexed by a neighborhood basis of the origin rather than nets on arbitrary directed sets.\nIf formula_9 is a TVS that is of the second category in itself (that is, a nonmeager space) then any closed convex absorbing subset of formula_9 is a neighborhood of the origin. This is no longer guaranteed if the set is not convex (a counter-example exists even in formula_424) or if formula_9 is not of the second category in itself.\nInterior\nIf formula_426 and formula_174 has non-empty interior then \nformula_428\nand\nformula_429\nThe topological interior of a disk is not empty if and only if this interior contains the origin. \nMore generally, if formula_174 is a balanced set with non-empty interior formula_431 in a TVS formula_9 then formula_433 will necessarily be balanced; consequently, formula_434 will be balanced if and only if it contains the origin. For this (i.e. formula_435) to be true, it suffices for formula_174 to also be convex (in addition to being balanced and having non-empty interior).; \nThe conclusion formula_435 could be false if formula_174 is not also convex; for example, in formula_439 the interior of the closed and balanced set formula_440 is formula_441\nIf formula_235 is convex and formula_443 then formula_444 \nExplicitly, this means that if formula_235 is a convex subset of a TVS formula_9 (not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex), formula_447 and formula_448 then the open line segment joining formula_172 and formula_450 belongs to the interior of formula_451 that is, formula_452\nIf formula_453 is any balanced neighborhood of the origin in formula_9 then formula_455 where formula_456 is the set of all scalars formula_457 such that formula_458\nIf formula_172 belongs to the interior of a convex set formula_363 and formula_461 then the half-open line segment formula_462 and formula_463 \nIf formula_464 is a balanced neighborhood of formula_29 in formula_9 and formula_467 then by considering intersections of the form formula_468 (which are convex symmetric neighborhoods of formula_29 in the real TVS formula_470) it follows that: formula_471 and furthermore, if formula_472 then formula_473 and if formula_474 then formula_475\nNon-Hausdorff spaces and the closure of the origin.\nA topological vector space formula_9 is Hausdorff if and only if formula_212 is a closed subset of formula_8 or equivalently, if and only if formula_479 Because formula_212 is a vector subspace of formula_8 the same is true of its closure formula_482 which is referred to as the closure of the origin in formula_13 This vector space satisfies formula_484 so that in particular, every neighborhood of the origin in formula_9 contains the vector space formula_486 as a subset. \nThe subspace topology on formula_486 is always the trivial topology, which in particular implies that the topological vector space formula_486 a compact space (even if its dimension is non-zero or even infinite) and consequently also a bounded subset of formula_13 In fact, a vector subspace of a TVS is bounded if and only if it is contained in the closure of formula_154 \nEvery subset of formula_486 also carries the trivial topology and so is itself a compact, and thus also complete, subspace (see footnote for a proof). In particular, if formula_9 is not Hausdorff then there exist subsets that are both compact and complete but not closed in formula_9; for instance, this will be true of any non-empty proper subset of formula_494\nIf formula_363 is compact, then formula_496 and this set is compact. Thus the closure of a compact subset of a TVS is compact (said differently, all compact sets are relatively compact), which is not guaranteed for arbitrary non-Hausdorff topological spaces.\nFor every subset formula_168 formula_498 and consequently, if formula_363 is open or closed in formula_9 then formula_501 (so that this arbitrary open or closed subsets formula_174 can be described as a \"tube\" whose vertical side is the vector space formula_486). \nFor any subset formula_363 of this TVS formula_8 the following are equivalent:\nIf formula_150 is a vector subspace of a TVS formula_9 then formula_149 is Hausdorff if and only if formula_150 is closed in formula_13 \nMoreover, the quotient map formula_516 is always a closed map onto the (necessarily) Hausdorff TVS.\nEvery vector subspace of formula_9 that is an algebraic complement of formula_486 (that is, a vector subspace formula_519 that satisfies formula_520 and formula_521) is a topological complement of formula_494 \nConsequently, if formula_519 is an algebraic complement of formula_486 in formula_9 then the addition map formula_526 defined by formula_527 is a TVS-isomorphism, where formula_519 is necessarily Hausdorff and formula_486 has the indiscrete topology. Moreover, if formula_235 is a Hausdorff completion of formula_519 then formula_532 is a completion of formula_533\nClosed and compact sets.\nCompact and totally bounded sets\nA subset of a TVS is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded. Thus, in a complete topological vector space, a closed and totally bounded subset is compact. \nA subset formula_174 of a TVS formula_9 is totally bounded if and only if formula_369 is totally bounded, if and only if its image under the canonical quotient map formula_537 is totally bounded.\nEvery relatively compact set is totally bounded and the closure of a totally bounded set is totally bounded. \nThe image of a totally bounded set under a uniformly continuous map (such as a continuous linear map for instance) is totally bounded. \nIf formula_174 is a subset of a TVS formula_9 such that every sequence in formula_174 has a cluster point in formula_174 then formula_174 is totally bounded.\nIf formula_394 is a compact subset of a TVS formula_9 and formula_75 is an open subset of formula_9 containing formula_547 then there exists a neighborhood formula_464 of 0 such that formula_549\nClosure and closed set\nThe closure of any convex (respectively, any balanced, any absorbing) subset of any TVS has this same property. In particular, the closure of any convex, balanced, and absorbing subset is a barrel.\nThe closure of a vector subspace of a TVS is a vector subspace. Every finite dimensional vector subspace of a Hausdorff TVS is closed. \nThe sum of a closed vector subspace and a finite-dimensional vector subspace is closed. \nIf formula_150 is a vector subspace of formula_9 and formula_464 is a closed neighborhood of the origin in formula_9 such that formula_554 is closed in formula_9 then formula_150 is closed in formula_13 \nThe sum of a compact set and a closed set is closed. However, the sum of two closed subsets may fail to be closed (see this footnote for examples). \nIf formula_363 and formula_457 is a scalar then formula_560 where if formula_9 is Hausdorff, formula_562 then equality holds: formula_563 In particular, every non-zero scalar multiple of a closed set is closed. \nIf formula_363 and if formula_565 is a set of scalars such that neither formula_566 contain zero then formula_567\nIf formula_568 then formula_369 is convex.\nIf formula_426 then formula_571 and so consequently, if formula_572 is closed then so is formula_573\nIf formula_9 is a real TVS and formula_168 then formula_576 where the left hand side is independent of the topology on formula_577 moreover, if formula_174 is a convex neighborhood of the origin then equality holds.\nFor any subset formula_168 formula_580 where formula_25 is any neighborhood basis at the origin for formula_13 \nHowever, formula_583 and it is possible for this containment to be proper (for example, if formula_584 and formula_174 is the rational numbers). It follows that formula_586 for every neighborhood formula_75 of the origin in formula_13\nClosed hulls\nIn a locally convex space, convex hulls of bounded sets are bounded. This is not true for TVSs in general.\nIf formula_426 and the closed convex hull of one of the sets formula_174 or formula_594 is compact then formula_595 \nIf formula_426 each have a closed convex hull that is compact (that is, formula_597 and formula_598 are compact) then formula_599\nHulls and compactness\nIn a general TVS, the closed convex hull of a compact set may fail to be compact. \nThe balanced hull of a compact (respectively, totally bounded) set has that same property. \nThe convex hull of a finite union of compact convex sets is again compact and convex.\nOther properties.\nMeager, nowhere dense, and Baire\nA disk in a TVS is not nowhere dense if and only if its closure is a neighborhood of the origin. \nA vector subspace of a TVS that is closed but not open is nowhere dense.\nSuppose formula_9 is a TVS that does not carry the indiscrete topology. Then formula_9 is a Baire space if and only if formula_9 has no balanced absorbing nowhere dense subset.\nA TVS formula_9 is a Baire space if and only if formula_9 is nonmeager, which happens if and only if there does not exist a nowhere dense set formula_605 such that formula_606 \nEvery nonmeager locally convex TVS is a barrelled space.\nImportant algebraic facts and common misconceptions\nIf formula_363 then formula_608; if formula_174 is convex then equality holds. For an example where equality does not hold, let formula_172 be non-zero and set formula_611 formula_612 also works.\nA subset formula_235 is convex if and only if formula_614 for all positive real formula_615 or equivalently, if and only if formula_616 for all formula_186\nThe convex balanced hull of a set formula_363 is equal to the convex hull of the balanced hull of formula_619 that is, it is equal to formula_620 But in general, formula_621 where the inclusion might be strict since the balanced hull of a convex set need not be convex (counter-examples exist even in formula_622).\nIf formula_426 and formula_457 is a scalar then formula_625 \nIf formula_426 are convex non-empty disjoint sets and formula_627 then formula_628 or formula_629\nIn any non-trivial vector space formula_8 there exist two disjoint non-empty convex subsets whose union is formula_13\nOther properties\nEvery TVS topology can be generated by a family of \"F\"-seminorms. \nIf formula_632 is some unary predicate (a true or false statement dependent on formula_167) then for any formula_634 formula_635 \nSo for example, if formula_632 denotes \"formula_637\" then for any formula_634 formula_639 Similarly, if formula_161 is a scalar then formula_641 The elements formula_167 of these sets must range over a vector space (that is, over formula_9) rather than not just a subset or else these equalities are no longer guaranteed; similarly, formula_644 must belong to this vector space (that is, formula_391).\nProperties preserved by set operators.\nThe following table, the color of each cell indicates whether or not a given property of subsets of formula_9 (indicated by the column name, \"convex\" for instance) is preserved under the set operator (indicated by the row's name, \"closure\" for instance). If in every TVS, a property is preserved under the indicated set operator then that cell will be colored green; otherwise, it will be colored red.\nSo for instance, since the union of two absorbing sets is again absorbing, the cell in row \"formula_647\" and column \"Absorbing\" is colored green. But since the arbitrary intersection of absorbing sets need not be absorbing, the cell in row \"Arbitrary intersections (of at least 1 set)\" and column \"Absorbing\" is colored red. If a cell is not colored then that information has yet to be filled in.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProofs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a psychologist. Published in 2000, \"WMCF\" seeks to found a cognitive science of mathematics, a theory of embodied mathematics based on conceptual metaphor.\n\"WMCF\" definition of mathematics.\nMathematics makes up that part of the human conceptual system that is special in the following way:\nIt is precise, consistent, stable across time and human communities, symbolizable, calculable, generalizable, universally available, consistent within each of its subject matters, and effective as a general tool for description, explanation, and prediction in a vast number of everyday activities, [ranging from] sports, to building, business, technology, and science. - \"WMCF\", pp. 50, 377\nNikolay Lobachevsky said \"There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.\" A common type of conceptual blending process would seem to apply to the entire mathematical procession.\nHuman cognition and mathematics.\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez's avowed purpose is to begin laying the foundations for a truly scientific understanding of mathematics, one grounded in processes common to all human cognition. They find that four distinct but related processes metaphorically structure basic arithmetic: object collection, object construction, using a measuring stick, and moving along a path.\n\"WMCF\" builds on earlier books by Lakoff (1987) and Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), which analyze such concepts of metaphor and image schemata from second-generation cognitive science. Some of the concepts in these earlier books, such as the interesting technical ideas in Lakoff (1987), are absent from \"WMCF\".\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez hold that mathematics results from the human cognitive apparatus and must therefore be understood in cognitive terms. \"WMCF\" advocates (and includes some examples of) a \"cognitive idea analysis\" of mathematics which analyzes mathematical ideas in terms of the human experiences, metaphors, generalizations, and other cognitive mechanisms giving rise to them. A standard mathematical education does not develop such idea analysis techniques because it does not pursue considerations of A) what structures of the mind allow it to do mathematics or B) the philosophy of mathematics.\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez start by reviewing the psychological literature, concluding that human beings appear to have an innate ability, called subitizing, to count, add, and subtract up to about 4 or 5. They document this conclusion by reviewing the literature, published in recent decades, describing experiments with infant subjects. For example, infants quickly become excited or curious when presented with \"impossible\" situations, such as having three toys appear when only two were initially present.\nThe authors argue that mathematics goes far beyond this very elementary level due to a large number of metaphorical constructions. For example, the Pythagorean position that all is number, and the associated crisis of confidence that came about with the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of two, arises solely from a metaphorical relation between the length of the diagonal of a square, and the possible numbers of objects.\nMuch of \"WMCF\" deals with the important concepts of infinity and of limit processes, seeking to explain how finite humans living in a finite world could ultimately conceive of the actual infinite. Thus much of \"WMCF\" is, in effect, a study of the epistemological foundations of the calculus. Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez conclude that while the potential infinite is not metaphorical, the actual infinite is. Moreover, they deem all manifestations of actual infinity to be instances of what they call the \"Basic Metaphor of Infinity\", as represented by the ever-increasing sequence 1, 2, 3, ...\n\"WMCF\" emphatically rejects the Platonistic philosophy of mathematics. They emphasize that all we know and can ever know is \"human mathematics\", the mathematics arising from the human intellect. The question of whether there is a \"transcendent\" mathematics independent of human thought is a meaningless question, like asking if colors are transcendent of human thought\u2014colors are only varying wavelengths of light, it is our interpretation of physical stimuli that make them colors.\n\"WMCF\" (p.\u00a081) likewise criticizes the emphasis mathematicians place on the concept of closure. Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez argue that the expectation of closure is an artifact of the human mind's ability to relate fundamentally different concepts via metaphor.\n\"WMCF\" concerns itself mainly with proposing and establishing an alternative view of mathematics, one grounding the field in the realities of human biology and experience. It is not a work of technical mathematics or philosophy. Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez are not the first to argue that conventional approaches to the philosophy of mathematics are flawed. For example, they do not seem all that familiar with the content of Davis and Hersh (1981), even though the book warmly acknowledges Hersh's support.\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez cite Saunders Mac Lane (the inventor, with Samuel Eilenberg, of category theory) in support of their position. \"Mathematics, Form and Function\" (1986), an overview of mathematics intended for philosophers, proposes that mathematical concepts are ultimately grounded in ordinary human activities, mostly interactions with the physical world.\nExamples of mathematical metaphors.\nConceptual metaphors described in \"WMCF\", in addition to the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, include:\nMathematical reasoning requires variables ranging over some universe of discourse, so that we can reason about generalities rather than merely about particulars. \"WMCF\" argues that reasoning with such variables implicitly relies on what it terms the Fundamental Metonymy of Algebra.\nExample of metaphorical ambiguity.\n\"WMCF\" (p.\u00a0151) includes the following example of what the authors term \"metaphorical ambiguity.\" Take the set formula_1 Then recall two bits of standard terminology from elementary set theory:\nBy (1), \"A\" is the set {1,2}. But (1) and (2) together say that \"A\" is also the ordered pair (0,1). Both statements cannot be correct; the ordered pair (0,1) and the unordered pair {1,2} are fully distinct concepts. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) term this situation \"metaphorically ambiguous.\" This simple example calls into question any Platonistic foundations for mathematics.\nWhile (1) and (2) above are admittedly canonical, especially within the consensus set theory known as the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axiomatization, \"WMCF\" does not let on that they are but one of several definitions that have been proposed since the dawning of set theory. For example, Frege, \"Principia Mathematica\", and New Foundations (a body of axiomatic set theory begun by Quine in 1937) define cardinals and ordinals as equivalence classes under the relations of equinumerosity and similarity, so that this conundrum does not arise. In Quinian set theory, \"A\" is simply an instance of the number 2. For technical reasons, defining the ordered pair as in (2) above is awkward in Quinian set theory. Two solutions have been proposed:\nThe Romance of Mathematics.\nThe \"Romance of Mathematics\" is \"WMCF\"'s light-hearted term for a perennial philosophical viewpoint about mathematics which the authors describe and then dismiss as an intellectual myth:\nIt is very much an open question whether \"WMCF\" will eventually prove to be the start of a new school in the philosophy of mathematics. Hence the main value of \"WMCF\" so far may be a critical one: its critique of Platonism and romanticism in mathematics.\nCritical response.\nMany working mathematicians resist the approach and conclusions of Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez. Reviews of \"WMCF\" by mathematicians in professional journals, while often respectful of its focus on conceptual strategies and metaphors as paths for understanding mathematics, have taken exception to some of the \"WMCF\"'s philosophical arguments on the grounds that mathematical statements have lasting 'objective' meanings. For example, Fermat's Last Theorem means exactly what it meant when Fermat initially proposed it in 1664. Other reviewers have pointed out that multiple conceptual strategies can be employed in connection with the same mathematically defined term, often by the same person (a point that is compatible with the view that we routinely understand the 'same' concept with different metaphors). The metaphor and the conceptual strategy are not the same as the formal definition which mathematicians employ. However, \"WMCF\" points out that formal definitions are built using words and symbols that have meaning only in terms of human experience.\nCritiques of \"WMCF\" include the humorous:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's difficult for me to conceive of a metaphor for a real number raised to a complex power, but if there is one, I'd sure like to see it. \u2014 Joseph Auslander\nand the physically informed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But their analysis leaves at least a couple of questions insufficiently answered. For one thing, the authors ignore the fact that brains not only observe nature, but also are part of nature. Perhaps the math that brains invent takes the form it does because math had a hand in forming the brains in the first place (through the operation of natural laws in constraining the evolution of life). Furthermore, it's one thing to fit equations to aspects of reality that are already known. It's something else for that math to tell of phenomena never previously suspected. When Paul Dirac's equations describing electrons produced more than one solution, he surmised that nature must possess other particles, now known as antimatter. But scientists did not discover such particles until after Dirac's math told him they must exist. If math is a human invention, nature seems to know what was going to be invented.\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez tend to dismiss the negative opinions mathematicians have expressed about \"WMCF\", because their critics do not appreciate the insights of cognitive science. Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez maintain that their argument can only be understood using the discoveries of recent decades about the way human brains process language and meaning. They argue that any arguments or criticisms that are not grounded in this understanding cannot address the content of the book.\nIt has been pointed out that it is not at all clear that \"WMCF\" establishes that the claim \"intelligent alien life would have mathematical ability\" is a myth. To do this, it would be required to show that intelligence and mathematical ability are separable, and this has not been done. On Earth, intelligence and mathematical ability seem to go hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by Keith Devlin among others. The authors of \"WMCF\" have not explained how this situation would (or even could) be different anywhere else.\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez also appear not to appreciate the extent to which intuitionists and constructivists have presaged their attack on the Romance of (Platonic) Mathematics. Brouwer, the founder of the intuitionist/constructivist point of view, in his dissertation \"On the Foundation of Mathematics\", argued that mathematics was a mental construction, a free creation of the mind and totally independent of logic and language. He goes on to criticize the formalists for building verbal structures that are studied without intuitive interpretation. Symbolic language should not be confused with mathematics; it reflects, but does not contain, mathematical reality.\nEducators have taken some interest in what \"WMCF\" suggests about how mathematics is learned, and why students find some elementary concepts more difficult than others.\nHowever, even from an educational perspective, WMCF is still problematic. From the conceptual metaphor theory's point of view, metaphors reside in a different realm, the abstract, from that of 'real world', the concrete. In other words, despite their claim of mathematics being human, \u00a0established mathematical knowledge \u2014 which is what we learn in school \u2014 is assumed to be and treated as abstract, completely detached from its physical origin. It cannot account for the way learners could access to such knowledge.\nWMCF is also criticized for its monist approach. First, it ignores the fact that the sensori-motor experience upon which our linguistic structure \u2014 thus, mathematics \u2014 is assumed to be based may vary across cultures and situations. Second, the mathematics WMCF is concerned with is \"almost entirely... standard utterances in textbooks and curricula\", which is the most-well established body of knowledge. It is negligent of the dynamic and diverse nature of the history of mathematics.\nWMCF's logo-centric approach is another target for critics. While it is predominantly interested in the association between language and mathematics, it does not account for how non-linguistic factors contribute to the emergence of mathematical ideas (e.g. See Radford, 2009; Rotman, 2008).\nSumming up.\n\"WMCF\" (pp.\u00a0378\u201379) concludes with some key points, a number of which follow. Mathematics arises from our bodies and brains, our everyday experiences, and the concerns of human societies and cultures. It is:\nThe cognitive approach to formal systems, as described and implemented in \"WMCF\", need not be confined to mathematics, but should also prove fruitful when applied to formal logic, and to formal philosophy such as Edward Zalta's http://. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) fruitfully employ the cognitive approach to rethink a good deal of the philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, and the history of ideas.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pyrite is the most abundant sulfide mineral. \nPyrite's metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname of \"fool's gold\". The color has also led to the nicknames \"brass\", \"brazzle\", and \"brazil\", primarily used to refer to pyrite found in coal.\nThe name \"pyrite\" is derived from the Greek (), 'stone or mineral which strikes fire', in turn from (), 'fire'. In ancient Roman times, this name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when struck against steel; Pliny the Elder described one of them as being brassy, almost certainly a reference to what is now called pyrite.\nBy Georgius Agricola's time, c.\u20091550, the term had become a generic term for all of the sulfide minerals.\nPyrite is usually found associated with other sulfides or oxides in quartz veins, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock, as well as in coal beds and as a replacement mineral in fossils, but has also been identified in the sclerites of scaly-foot gastropods. Despite being nicknamed \"fool's gold\", pyrite is sometimes found in association with small quantities of gold. A substantial proportion of the gold is \"invisible gold\" incorporated into the pyrite. It has been suggested that the presence of both gold and arsenic is a case of coupled substitution but as of 1997 the chemical state of the gold remained controversial.\nUses.\nPyrite gained a brief popularity in the 16th and 17th\u00a0centuries as a source of ignition in early firearms, most notably the wheellock, where a sample of pyrite was placed against a circular file to strike the sparks needed to fire the gun.\nPyrite is used with flintstone and a form of tinder made of stringybark by the Kaurna people of South Australia, as a traditional method of starting fires.\nPyrite has been used since classical times to manufacture \"copperas\" (ferrous sulfate). Iron pyrite was heaped up and allowed to weather (an example of an early form of heap leaching). The acidic runoff from the heap was then boiled with iron to produce iron sulfate. In the 15th century, new methods of such leaching began to replace the burning of sulfur as a source of sulfuric acid. By the 19th\u00a0century, it had become the dominant method.\nPyrite remains in commercial use for the production of sulfur dioxide, for use in such applications as the paper industry, and in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Thermal decomposition of pyrite into FeS (iron(II) sulfide) and elemental sulfur starts at ; at around , \"p\"S2 is about 1 atm.\nA newer commercial use for pyrite is as the cathode material in Energizer brand non-rechargeable lithium metal batteries.\nPyrite is a semiconductor material with a band gap of 0.95 eV. Pure pyrite is naturally n-type, in both crystal and thin-film forms, potentially due to sulfur vacancies in the pyrite crystal structure acting as n-dopants.\nDuring the early years of the 20th\u00a0century, pyrite was used as a mineral detector in radio receivers, and is still used by crystal radio hobbyists. Until the vacuum tube matured, the crystal detector was the most sensitive and dependable detector available\u2014with considerable variation between mineral types and even individual samples within a particular type of mineral. Pyrite detectors occupied a midway point between galena detectors and the more mechanically complicated perikon mineral pairs. Pyrite detectors can be as sensitive as a modern 1N34A germanium diode detector.\nPyrite has been proposed as an abundant, non-toxic, inexpensive material in low-cost photovoltaic solar panels. Synthetic iron sulfide was used with copper sulfide to create the photovoltaic material. More recent efforts are working toward thin-film solar cells made entirely of pyrite.\nPyrite is used to make marcasite jewelry. Marcasite jewelry, using small faceted pieces of pyrite, often set in silver, has been made since ancient times and was popular in the Victorian era. At the time when the term became common in jewelry making, \"marcasite\" referred to all iron sulfides including pyrite, and not to the orthorhombic FeS2 mineral marcasite which is lighter in color, brittle and chemically unstable, and thus not suitable for jewelry making. Marcasite jewelry does not actually contain the mineral marcasite. The specimens of pyrite, when it appears as good quality crystals, are used in decoration. They are also very popular in mineral collecting. Among the sites that provide the best specimens are Soria and La Rioja provinces (Spain).\nIn value terms, China ($47\u00a0million) constitutes the largest market for imported unroasted iron pyrites worldwide, making up 65% of global imports. China is also the fastest growing in terms of the unroasted iron pyrites imports, with a CAGR of +27.8% from 2007 to 2016.\nResearch.\nIn July 2020 scientists reported that they have observed a voltage-induced transformation of normally diamagnetic pyrite into a ferromagnetic material, which may lead to applications in devices such as solar cells or magnetic data storage.\nResearchers at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland have demonstrated that FeS2 can be exfoliated into few-layers just like other two-dimensional layered materials such as graphene by a simple liquid-phase exfoliation route. This is the first study to demonstrate the production of non-layered 2D-platelets from 3D bulk FeS2. Furthermore, they have used these 2D-platelets with 20% single walled carbon-nanotube as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries, reaching a capacity of 1000 mAh/g close to the theoretical capacity of FeS2.\nIn 2021, a natural pyrite stone has been crushed and pre-treated followed by liquid-phase exfoliation into two-dimensional nanosheets, which has shown capacities of 1200 mAh/g as an anode in lithium-ion batteries.\nFormal oxidation states for pyrite, marcasite, molybdenite and arsenopyrite.\nFrom the perspective of classical inorganic chemistry, which assigns formal oxidation states to each atom, pyrite and marcasite are probably best described as Fe2+[S2]2\u2212. This formalism recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite occur in pairs with clear S\u2013S bonds. These persulfide [\u2212S\u2013S\u2212] units can be viewed as derived from hydrogen disulfide, H2S2. Thus pyrite would be more descriptively called iron persulfide, not iron disulfide. In contrast, molybdenite, MoS2, features isolated sulfide S2\u2212 centers and the oxidation state of molybdenum is Mo4+. The mineral arsenopyrite has the formula FeAsS. Whereas pyrite has [S2]2\u2212 units, arsenopyrite has [AsS]3\u2212 units, formally derived from deprotonation of arsenothiol (H2AsSH). Analysis of classical oxidation states would recommend the description of arsenopyrite as Fe3+[AsS]3\u2212.\nCrystallography.\nIron-pyrite FeS2 represents the prototype compound of the crystallographic pyrite structure. The structure is cubic and was among the first crystal structures solved by X-ray diffraction. It belongs to the crystallographic space group \"Pa\"3 and is denoted by the Strukturbericht notation C2. Under thermodynamic standard conditions the lattice constant formula_1 of stoichiometric iron pyrite FeS2 amounts to 541.87 pm. The unit cell is composed of a Fe face-centered cubic sublattice into which the S2 ions are embedded. (Note though that the iron atoms in the faces are not equivalent by translation alone to the iron atoms at the corners.) The pyrite structure is also seen in other \"MX\"2 compounds of transition metals \"M\" and chalcogens \"X\" = O, S, Se and Te. Certain dipnictides with \"X\" standing for P, As and Sb etc. are also known to adopt the pyrite structure.\nThe Fe atoms are bonded to six S atoms, giving a distorted octahedron. The material is a semiconductor. The Fe ions are usually considered to be \"low spin\" divalent state (as shown by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy as well as XPS). The material as a whole behaves as a Van Vleck paramagnet, despite its low-spin divalency.\nThe sulfur centers occur in pairs, described as S22-. Reduction of pyrite with potassium gives potassium dithioferrate, KFeS2. This material features ferric ions and isolated sulfide (S2\u2212) centers.\nThe S atoms are tetrahedral, being bonded to three Fe centers and one other S atom. The site symmetry at Fe and S positions is accounted for by point symmetry groups \"C\"3\"i\" and \"C\"3, respectively. The missing center of inversion at S lattice sites has important consequences for the crystallographic and physical properties of iron pyrite. These consequences derive from the crystal electric field active at the sulfur lattice site, which causes a polarization of S ions in the pyrite lattice. The polarisation can be calculated on the basis of higher-order Madelung constants and has to be included in the calculation of the lattice energy by using a generalised Born\u2013Haber cycle. This reflects the fact that the covalent bond in the sulfur pair is inadequately accounted for by a strictly ionic treatment.\nArsenopyrite has a related structure with heteroatomic As\u2013S pairs rather than S-S pairs. Marcasite also possesses homoatomic anion pairs, but the arrangement of the metal and diatomic anions differs from that of pyrite. Despite its name, chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) does not contain dianion pairs, but single S2\u2212 sulfide anions.\nCrystal habit.\nPyrite usually forms cuboid crystals, sometimes forming in close association to form raspberry-shaped masses called framboids. However, under certain circumstances, it can form anastomosing filaments or T-shaped crystals.\nPyrite can also form shapes almost the same as a regular dodecahedron, known as pyritohedra, and this suggests an explanation for the artificial geometrical models found in Europe as early as the 5th century BC.\nVarieties.\nCattierite (CoS2), vaesite (NiS2) and hauerite (MnS2), as well as sperrylite (PtAs2) are similar in their structure and belong also to the pyrite group.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Bravoite is a nickel-cobalt bearing variety of pyrite, with &gt;\u00a050% substitution of Ni2+ for Fe2+ within pyrite. Bravoite is not a formally recognised mineral, and is named after the Peruvian scientist Jose J. Bravo (1874\u20131928).\nDistinguishing similar minerals.\nPyrite is distinguishable from native gold by its hardness, brittleness and crystal form. Pyrite fractures are very uneven, sometimes conchoidal because it does not cleave along a preferential plane. Native gold nuggets, or glitters, do not break but deform in a ductile way. Pyrite is brittle, gold is malleable. Natural gold tends to be anhedral (irregularly shaped without well defined faces), whereas pyrite comes as either cubes or multifaceted crystals with well developed and sharp faces easy to recognise. Well crystallised pyrite crystals are euhedral (\"i.e.\", with nice faces). Pyrite can often be distinguished by the striations which, in many cases, can be seen on its surface. \nChalcopyrite () is brighter yellow with a greenish hue when wet and is softer (3.5\u20134 on Mohs' scale). Arsenopyrite (FeAsS) is silver white and does not become more yellow when wet.\nHazards.\nIron pyrite is unstable when exposed to the oxidizing conditions prevailing at the Earth's surface: iron pyrite in contact with atmospheric oxygen and water, or damp, ultimately decomposes into iron oxyhydroxides (ferrihydrite, FeO(OH)) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This process is accelerated by the action of \"Acidithiobacillus\" bacteria which oxidize pyrite to first produce ferrous ions (Fe2+), sulfate ions (SO42-), and release protons (\u200aH+, or ). In a second step, the ferrous ions (Fe2+) are oxidized by into ferric ions (Fe3+) which hydrolyze also releasing \u200aH+ ions and producing FeO(OH). These oxidation reactions occur more rapidly when pyrite is finely dispersed (framboidal crystals initially formed by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in argillaceous sediments or dust from mining operations).\nPyrite oxidation and acid mine drainage.\nPyrite oxidation by atmospheric in the presence of moisture () initially produces ferrous ions (Fe2+) and sulfuric acid which dissociates into sulfate ions and protons, leading to acid mine drainage (AMD). An example of acid rock drainage caused by pyrite is the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill.\nDust explosions.\nPyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion. The solution is the use of buffer blasting and the use of various sealing or cladding agents to hermetically seal the mined-out areas to exclude oxygen.\nIn modern coal mines, limestone dust is sprayed onto the exposed coal surfaces to reduce the hazard of dust explosions. This has the secondary benefit of neutralizing the acid released by pyrite oxidation and therefore slowing the oxidation cycle described above, thus reducing the likelihood of spontaneous combustion. In the long term, however, oxidation continues, and the hydrated sulfates formed may exert crystallization pressure that can expand cracks in the rock and lead eventually to roof fall.\nWeakened building materials.\nBuilding stone containing pyrite tends to stain brown as pyrite oxidizes. This problem appears to be significantly worse if any marcasite is present. The presence of pyrite in the aggregate used to make concrete can lead to severe deterioration as pyrite oxidizes. In early 2009, problems with Chinese drywall imported into the United States after Hurricane Katrina were attributed to pyrite oxidation, followed by microbial sulfate reduction which released hydrogen sulfide gas (). These problems included a foul odor and corrosion of copper wiring. In the United States, in Canada, and more recently in Ireland, where it was used as underfloor infill, pyrite contamination has caused major structural damage. Concrete exposed to sulfate ions, or sulfuric acid, degrades by sulfate attack: the formation of expansive mineral phases, such as ettringite (small needle crystals exerting a huge crystallization pressure inside the concrete pores) and gypsum creates inner tensile forces in the concrete matrix which destroy the hardened cement paste, form cracks and fissures in concrete, and can lead to the ultimate ruin of the structure. Normalized tests for construction aggregate certify such materials as free of pyrite or marcasite.\nOccurrence.\nPyrite is the most common of sulfide minerals and is widespread in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. It is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks, where it also occasionally occurs as larger masses arising from an immiscible sulfide phase in the original magma. It is found in metamorphic rocks as a product of contact metamorphism. It also forms as a high-temperature hydrothermal mineral, though it occasionally forms at lower temperatures.\nPyrite occurs both as a primary mineral, present in the original sediments, and as a secondary mineral, deposited during diagenesis. Pyrite and marcasite commonly occur as replacement pseudomorphs after fossils in black shale and other sedimentary rocks formed under reducing environmental conditions. Pyrite is common as an accessory mineral in shale, where it is formed by precipitation from anoxic seawater, and coal beds often contain significant pyrite.\nNotable deposits are found as lenticular masses in Virginia, U.S., and in smaller quantities in many other locations. Large deposits are mined at Rio Tinto in Spain and elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula.\nCultural beliefs.\nIn the beliefs of the Thai people (especially those in the south), pyrite is known as \"Khao tok Phra Ruang\", \"Khao khon bat Phra Ruang\" (\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07, \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e01\u0e49\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07) or \"Phet na tang\", \"Hin na tang\" (\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e17\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07, \u0e2b\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e17\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07).

He successfully overthrew the Kamakura shogunate in 1333 and established the short-lived Kenmu Restoration to bring the Imperial House back into power. This was to be the last time the emperor had real power until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The Kenmu restoration was in turn overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, ushering in the Ashikaga shogunate. The overthrow split the imperial family into two opposing factions between the Ashikaga backed Northern Court situated in Kyoto and the Southern Court based in Yoshino. The Southern Court was led by Go-Daigo and his later successors.\nBiography.\nBefore his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (\"imina\") was Takaharu\"-shinn\u014d\" (\u5c0a\u6cbb\u89aa\u738b).\nHe was the second son of the Daikakuji-t\u014d emperor, Emperor Go-Uda. His mother was Fujiwara no \"Ch\u016bshi\"/Tadako (\"\u85e4\u539f\u5fe0\u5b50\"), daughter of Fujiwara no Tadatsugu (Itsutsuji Tadatsugu) (\"\u85e4\u539f\u5fe0\u7d99/\u4e94\u8fbb\u5fe0\u7d99\"). She became Nyoin called Dantenmon-in (\u8ac7\u5929\u9580\u9662). His older brother was Emperor Go-Nij\u014d.\nEmperor Go-Daigo's ideal was the Engi era (901\u2013923) during the reign of Emperor Daigo, a period of direct imperial rule. An emperor's posthumous name was normally chosen after his death, but Emperor Go-Daigo chose his personally during his lifetime, to share it with Emperor Daigo.\nEvents of Go-Daigo's life.\nIn 1324, with the discovery of Emperor Go-Daigo's plans to overthrow the Kamakura shogunate, the Rokuhara Tandai disposed of his close associate Hino Suketomo in the Sh\u014dch\u016b Incident.\nIn the Genk\u014d Incident of 1331, Emperor Go-Daigo's plans were again discovered, this time by a betrayal by his close associate Yoshida Sadafusa. He quickly hid the Sacred Treasures in a secluded castle in Kasagiyama (the modern town of Kasagi, S\u014draku District, Ky\u014dto Prefecture) and raised an army, but the castle fell to the shogunate's army the following year, and they enthroned Emperor K\u014dgon, exiling Daigo to Oki Province (the Oki Islands in modern-day Shimane Prefecture), the same place to which Emperor Go-Toba had been exiled after the J\u014dky\u016b War of 1221.\nIn 1333, Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Oki with the help of Nawa Nagatoshi and his family, raising an army at Senjo Mountain in H\u014dki Province (the modern town of Kotoura in T\u014dhaku District, Tottori Prefecture). Ashikaga Takauji, who had been sent by the shogunate to find and destroy this army, sided with the emperor and captured the Rokuhara Tandai. Immediately following this, Nitta Yoshisada, who had raised an army in the east, laid siege to Kamakura. When the city finally fell to Nitta, H\u014dj\u014d Takatoki, the shogunal regent, fled to T\u014dsh\u014d temple, where he and his entire family committed suicide. This ended H\u014dj\u014d power and paved the way for a new military regime.\nUpon his triumphal return to Kyoto, Daigo took the throne from Emperor K\u014dgon and began the Kenmu Restoration. The Restoration was ostensibly a revival of the older ways, but, in fact, the emperor had his eye set on an imperial dictatorship like that of the emperor of China. He wanted to imitate the Chinese in all their ways and become the most powerful ruler in the East. Impatient reforms, litigation over land rights, rewards, and the exclusion of the samurai from the political order caused much complaining, and his political order began to fall apart. In 1335, Ashikaga Takauji, who had travelled to eastern Japan without obtaining an imperial edict in order to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion, became disaffected. Daigo ordered Nitta Yoshisada to track down and destroy Ashikaga. Ashikaga defeated Nitta Yoshisada at the Battle of Takenoshita, Hakone. Kusunoki Masashige and Kitabatake Akiie, in communication with Kyoto, smashed the Ashikaga army. Takauji fled to Ky\u016bsh\u016b, but the following year, after reassembling his army, he again approached Ky\u014dto. Kusunoki Masashige proposed a reconciliation with Takauji to the emperor, but Go-Daigo rejected this. He ordered Masashige and Yoshisada to destroy Takauji. Kusunoki's army was defeated at the Battle of Minatogawa.\nWhen Ashikaga's army entered Ky\u014dto, Emperor Go-Daigo resisted, fleeing to Mount Hiei, but seeking reconciliation, he sent the imperial regalia to the Ashikaga side. Takauji enthroned the Jimy\u014din-t\u014d emperor, K\u014dmy\u014d, and officially began his shogunate with the enactment of the Kenmu Law Code.\nGo-Daigo escaped from the capital in January 1337, the regalia that he had handed over to the Ashikaga being counterfeit, and set up the Southern Court among the mountains of Yoshino, beginning the Period of Northern and Southern Courts in which the Northern Dynasty in Kyoto and the Southern Dynasty in Yoshino faced off against each other.\nEmperor Go-Daigo ordered Imperial Prince Kaneyoshi to Ky\u016bsh\u016b and Nitta Yoshisada and Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi to Hokuriku, and so forth, dispatching his sons all over, so that they could oppose the Northern Court.\nThe actual site of Go-Daigo's grave is settled.

Since the 2011 local government reform, it has been part of the municipality Pylos-Nestoras, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. It was the capital of the former Pylia Province. It is the main harbour on the Bay of Navarino. Nearby villages include Gialova, Pyla, Elaiofyto, Schinolakka, and Palaionero. The town of Pylos has 2,568 inhabitants, the municipal unit of Pylos 4,559 (2021). The municipal unit has an area of 143.911\u00a0km2.\nPylos has been inhabited since Neolithic times. It was a significant kingdom in Mycenaean Greece, with the remains of the so-called \"Palace of Nestor\" excavated nearby, named after Nestor, the king of Pylos in Homer's \"Iliad\". In Classical times, the site was uninhabited, but became the site of the Battle of Pylos in 425\u00a0BC, during the Peloponnesian War. After that, Pylos is scarcely mentioned until the 13th century, when it became part of the Frankish Principality of Achaea. Increasingly known by its French name of \"Port-de-Jonc\" or its Italian name \"Navarino\", in the 1280s the Franks built the Old Navarino castle on the site. Pylos came under the control of the Republic of Venice from 1417 until 1500, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans used Pylos and its bay as a naval base, and built the New Navarino fortress there. The area remained under Ottoman control, with the exception of a brief period of renewed Venetian rule from 1685\u20131715 and a Russian occupation from 1770\u201371, until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821. Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt recovered it for the Ottomans in 1825, but the defeat of the Turco-Egyptian fleet in the 1827 Battle of Navarino and the French military intervention of the 1828 Morea expedition forced Ibrahim to withdraw from the Peloponnese and confirmed Greek independence. The current city was built outside the fortress walls by the military engineers of the Morea expedition from 1829 and the name \"Pylos\" was revived by royal decree in 1833.\nName.\nPylos retained its ancient name into Byzantine times, but after the Frankish conquest in the early 13th century, two new names appear:\nIn the late 14th or early 15th century, when it was held by the Navarrese Company, it was also known as , and called (, \"village of the Spaniards\") by the local Greeks.\nUnder Ottoman rule (1498\u20131685, 1715\u20131821), the Turkish name was (). After the construction of the new Ottoman fortress () in 1571/2, it became known as ( or , \"new castle\") among the local Greeks, while the old Frankish castle became known as ( or , \"old castle\").\nHistory.\nNeolithic Pylos.\nThe region of Pylos has a long history, which goes hand in hand with that of Peloponnese. It starts in the depths of prehistory, as the region has been inhabited since the Neolithic, when populations from Anatolia began to spread in the Balkans and Greece around 6500 BC, bringing with them the practice of agriculture and farming. Excavations have demonstrated a continuous human presence from the Late Neolithic period (5300 BC) on several sites of Pylia, in particular in those of \"Voidokilia\" and of \"Nestor's\" \"cave\", where numerous ostraca or fragments of painted, black and polished ceramics have been found, as well as later engraved and written pottery. The Neolithic period ended with the appearance of bronze metallurgy around 3000 BC.\nMycenaean Pylos.\nDuring the Bronze Age (3000\u20131000 BC), the Mycenaean civilization developed, particularly in Peloponnese. Pylos then became the capital of one of the most important human centers of this civilization and of a powerful kingdom, often referred to as Nestor's kingdom of \"sandy Pylos\" (\"\u1f20\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2\") and described later by Homer in both his \"Iliad\" and his \"Odyssey\" (Book 17) when Telemachus says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;we went to Pylos and to Nestor, the shepherd of the people, and he received me in his lofty house and gave me kindly welcome, as a father might his own son who after a long time had newly come from afar: even so kindly he tended me with his glorious sons.\nThe Mycenaean state of Pylos (1600\u20131200\u00a0BC) covered an area of and had a minimum population of 50,000 according to the Linear B tablets discovered there, or even perhaps as large as 80,000\u2013120,000. It should not however be confused with the current city of Pylos. The urban center of ancient Pylos indeed remains only partially identified to date. The various archaeological remains of palaces and administrative or residential infrastructures that have been found in the region so far suggest to modern scholars that the ancient city would have developed over a much larger area, that of the Pylia Province. The typical point of reference for the Mycenaean city remains the Palace of Nestor, but many other palaces (such as those of Nichoria and Iklaina) or villages (such as Malthi) of the Mycenaean era have been recently discovered, which were quickly subordinated to Pylos. Its port and its acropolis were probably established on the \"Koryphasion\" promontory (or \"Cape Coryphasium\") commanding the northern entrance to the bay, 4\u00a0km north of the modern city and south of Nestor's palace, but no remains were found.The Pylos site is located on the hill of Ano Englianos, about 9\u00a0km northeast of the bay , near the village of Chora and about 17 kilometres from the modern city of Pylos. It hosts one of the most important Mycenaean palaces in Greece, known as the great \"Palace of Nestor\" described in the Homeric poems. This palace remains today the best preserved palace in Greece and one of the most important of all Mycenaean civilization. It was discovered and first excavated in 1939 by American archaeologist Carl Blegen (1887\u20131971) of the University of Cincinnati and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and by Konstantinos Kourouniotis (1872\u20131945) of the Greek archaeological service. Their excavations were interrupted by the Second World War, and then resumed in 1952 under the direction of Blegen until 1966. He found many architectural elements such as the throne room with its foyer, an anteroom, rooms and passageways all covered with frescoes of Minoan inspiration, and also large warehouses, the external walls of the palace, unique baths, galleries, and 90 meters outside the palace, a beehive \"tholos\" tomb, perfectly restored in 1957 (\"Tholos tomb IV\").\nIn addition to the archaeological remains of the palace, Blegen also found there thousands of clay tablets with inscriptions written in Linear B, a syllabic script used between 1425 and 1200 BC for writing Mycenaean Greek. Pylos is the largest source in Greece of these tablets with 1,087 fragments found on the site of the Nestor's Palace. In 1952, when self-taught linguist Michael Ventris and John Chadwick deciphered the script, Mycenaean Greek turned out to be the earliest attested form of Greek, some elements of which have survived in the language of Homer thanks to a long oral tradition of epic poetry. Thus, these clay tablets, generally used for administrative purposes or for recording economic transactions, clearly demonstrate that the site itself was already called \"Pylos\" by its Mycenaean inhabitants (\"Pulos\" in Mycenaean Greek; attested in Linear B as \"pu-ro,\" ).\nIn 2015, the team of American archaeologists Sharon Stocker and Jack L. Davis of the University of Cincinnati and under the aegis of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, discovered near the \"Tholos tomb IV\", a shaft tomb (non-tholos) dated to the Late Helladic IIA (LHIIA, 1600\u20131470 BC), of an individual of 30\u201335 years old and 1.70 m tall, the \"Griffin warrior\", named for the mythological creature, part eagle, part lion, engraved on an ivory plaque in his tomb. The tomb also contained armor, weapons, mirror and many pearl and gold jewels, including several gold signet rings of exceptional craftsmanship and thoroughness. Researchers believe it could be the grave of a Wanax, a tribal king, lord or military leader during the Mycenaean era. It was also in this tomb that was found the Pylos Combat Agate, a seal made of agate dated from around 1450 BC, which represents a warrior engaged in a hand-to-hand combat. In 2017, the same team discovered two other exceptional tholos tombs, \"Tholos tombs VI and VII\". Although their domes had collapsed, they discovered that they were littered with flakes of gold leaf that once papered the walls and found a multitude of cultural artifacts and delicate jewelry, including a gold pendant representing the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, which showed for the first time that Pylos clearly had trade relations with Egypt and the Middle East around 1500 BC.\nPylos was the only palace of that time to have no walls or fortifications. It was destroyed by fire around 1180 BC and many clay tablets in linear B clearly bear the stigmata of the fire. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force. The site of the Mycenaean Pylos then seems to have been abandoned during the Dark Ages (1100\u2013800 BC). The region of Pylos, together with that of the ancient Messene, was later enslaved by Sparta.\nThe ruins of a crude stone fortress on nearby Sphacteria, apparently of Mycenaean origin, were used by the Spartans during the Peloponnesian War. (Thucydides iv. 31)\nClassical Pylos.\nIt was one of the last places which held out against the Spartans in the Second Messenian War, after which the inhabitants emigrated to Cyllene, and from there, with the other Messenians, to Sicily. Its name is mentioned again in the seventh year of the Peloponnesian War. According to the Greek historian Thucydides in his \"History of the Peloponnesian War\", the area was \"together with most of the country round, unpopulated\". The ancient city was not located at the modern Pylos, but north of the isle of Sphacteria. In 425\u00a0BC the Athenian politician Cleon sent an expedition to Pylos where the Athenians fortified the rocky promontory now known as Koryphasion (\u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) or Old Pylos at the northern edge of the bay, near the Gialova Lagoon, and after a conflict with Spartan ships in the Battle of Pylos, seized and occupied the bay. Demosthenes, the Athenian commander, completed the fort in 424\u00a0BC.\nThe erection of this fort led to one of the most memorable events in the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides has given a minute account of the topography of the district, which, though clear and consistent with itself, does not coincide, in all points, with the existing locality, Thucydides describes the harbour, of which the promontory Coryphasium (\"Koryphasion\") formed the northern termination, as fronted and protected by the island Sphacteria, which stretched along the coast, leaving only two narrow entrances to the harbour,--the one at the northern end, opposite to Coryphasium, being only wide enough to admit two triremes abreast, and the other at the southern end wide enough for eight or nine triremes. The island was about 15 stadia in width, covered with wood, uninhabited and untrodden. Pausanias also says that the island Sphacteria lies before the harbour of Pylos like Rheneia before the anchorage of Delos. A little later the Athenians captured a number of Spartan troops besieged on the adjacent island of Sphacteria (see Battle of Sphacteria). Spartan anxiety over the return of the prisoners, who were taken to Athens as hostages, contributed to their acceptance of the Peace of Nicias in 421\u00a0BC.\nMiddle Ages.\nLittle is known of Pylos under Byzantine rule, except for a mention of raids by Cretan Saracens in the area c. 872/3. In the 12th century, the Muslim geographer al-Idrisi mentioned it as the \"commodious port\" of \"Ir\u016bda\" in his \"Nuzhat al-Mushtaq\".\nIn 1204, following the Fourth Crusade, the Peloponnese became the Principality of Achaea, a Crusader state. Pylos fell quickly to the Crusaders according to a brief reference in the \"Chronicle of the Morea\", but it is not until the 1280s that it is mentioned again. According to the French and Greek versions of the \"Chronicle\", Nicholas II of Saint Omer, the lord of Thebes, who in c. 1281 received extensive lands in Messenia in exchange for his wife's possessions of Kalamata and Chlemoutsi, erected a castle at Navarino. According to the Greek version, he intended this as a future fief for his nephew, Nicholas III, although the Aragonese version attributes the construction to Nicholas III himself, a few years later. According to A. Bon, a construction under Nicholas II in the 1280s is more likely, possibly in the period 1287\u201389 when he served as the viceroy () of Achaea. Despite Nicholas II's intentions, however, it is unclear whether his nephew did indeed inherit Navarino. If he did, it remained his until his death in 1317, when it and all the Messenian lands of the family reverted to the princely domain, as Nicholas III had no children.\nThe fortress remained relatively unimportant thereafter, except for the naval battle in 1354 between Venice and Genoa, and an episode in 1364, during the conflict between Mary of Bourbon and the Prince Philip of Taranto, due to Mary's attempt to claim the Principality following the death of her husband, Robert of Taranto. Mary had been given possession of Navarino (along with Kalamata and Mani) by Robert in 1358, and the local castellan, loyal to Mary, briefly imprisoned the new Prince's , Simon del Poggio. Mary retained control of Navarino until her death in 1377. At about this time, Albanians settled in the area, while in 1381/2, Navarrese, Gascon and Italian mercenaries were active there. From the early years of the 15th century, Venice set its eyes on the fortress of Navarino, fearing lest its rivals the Genoese seize it and use it as a base for attacks against the Venetian outposts of Modon and Coron. In the event, the Venetians seized the fortress themselves in 1417 and, after prolonged diplomatic manoeuvring, succeeded in legitimizing their new possession in 1423.\nFirst Venetian and first Ottoman periods.\nIn 1423, Navarino, like the rest of the Peloponnese, suffered its first Ottoman raid, led by Turakhan Bey, which was repeated in 1452. It was also at Navarino that Emperor John VIII Palaiologos embarked in 1437, heading for the Council of Ferrara, and where the last Despot of the Morea, Thomas Palaiologos, embarked with his family in 1460, following the Ottoman conquest of the Despotate of the Morea. After 1460, the fortress, along with the other Venetian outposts and Monemvasia and the Mani Peninsula, were the only Christian-held areas in the peninsula. Venetian control over Navarino survived the First Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u201379), but not the Second (1499\u20131503): following the Venetian defeat in the Battle of Modon in August 1500, the 3,000-strong garrison surrendered, although it was well provisioned for a siege. The Venetians recaptured it shortly after, on 3/4 December, but on 20 May 1501, a joint Ottoman land and sea attack under Kemal Reis and Had\u0131m Ali Pasha retook it.\nThe Ottomans used Navarino (which they called or ) as a naval base, either for piratical raids or for major fleet operations in the Ionian and Adriatic seas. In 1572/3, the Ottoman chief admiral (Kapudan Pasha) Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis built a new fortress at Navarino (, \"New Navarino\", or , in Greek), to replace the outdated Frankish castle.\nThe Venetians briefly captured Navarino in the 1650s during the Cretan War.\nIn 1668, Evliya \u00c7elebi described the city in his \"Seyahatname\":\nAnavarin-i Atik is an unequalled castle... the harbor is a safe anchorage...&lt;br&gt;in most streets of Anavarin-i Cedid there are many fountains of running water... The city is embellished with trees and vines so that the sun does not beat into the fine marketplace at all, and\nall the city notables sit here, playing backgammon, chess, various kinds of draughts, and other board games...\nSecond Venetian period and Ottoman reconquest.\nIn 1685, during the early stages of the Morean War, the Venetians under Francesco Morosini and Otto Wilhelm K\u00f6nigsmarck invaded the Peloponnese and captured most of it, successfully storming the two fortresses of Navarino in the process. With the peninsula safely in Venetian hands, Navarino became an administrative centre in the new \"Kingdom of the Morea\", as the Venetian province was called, until 1715, when the Ottomans recovered the Peloponnese. The Venetian census of 1689 gave the population as 1,413, while twenty years later it had risen to 1,797 inhabitants.\nAfter the Ottoman reconquest, Navarino became the centre of a \"kaza\" in the Sanjak of the Morea. On 10 April 1770, after a six-day siege, the fortress of New Navarino surrendered to the Russians during the Orlov Revolt. The Ottoman garrison was allowed to depart for Crete, while the Russians repaired the fortress to make it their base. On 1 June, however, the Russians left, and the Ottomans re-entered the fort and burned and partially demolished it. Meanwhile, the population gathered there had escaped to nearby Sphacteria, where Albanian mercenaries of the Ottomans slaughtered most of them.\nThe Greek War of Independence of 1821.\nAfter the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman occupation in mid-March 1821, the Greeks quickly won many victories and proclaimed their independence on 1 January 1822. Navarino was besieged by the local Greeks on 29 March. The garrison, augmented by the local Muslim population of Kyparissia, held out until the first week of August, when they were forced to capitulate. Despite their promise for safe conduct, the Greeks massacred them all.\nThe Greek victories was short lived. The Sultan called for aid from his Egyptian vassal Muhammad Ali, who dispatched his son Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, and later added 25,000 troops. Ibrahim's intervention proved decisive: the region of Pylos fell on 18 May 1825 after the battles of Sphacteria (8 May) and Neokastro (11 May), much of the Peloponnese was reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of Messolonghi fell in 1826; and Athens was taken in 1827. The only territory still held by Greek nationalists was in Nafplion, Mani, Hydra, Spetses and Aegina.\nThe Naval Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827).\nA strong current of philhellenism had developed in Western Europe, especially after the fall in 1826 of Missolonghi, where the poet Lord Byron had died in 1824. Many artists and intellectuals like Chateaubriand, Victor Hugo, Alexander Pushkin, Gioachino Rossini, Hector Berlioz or Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (in his paintings \"Scenes massacres of Scio\" in 1824, and \"Greece on the ruins of Missolonghi\" in 1826), amplified the current of sympathy for the Greek cause in the public opinion. By the Treaty of London of July 1827, France, Russia and the United Kingdom recognised the autonomy of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a demonstration of force was proposed and adopted; subsequently a fleet of 27 warships of the allied navies of United Kingdom, France and Russia was sent to exert diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. It included twelve British ships (for 456 guns), seven French ships (352 guns) and eight Russian ships (490 guns), for a total firepower of nearly 1,300 guns. The Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) resulted in the total destruction of the combined Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet (around 60 warships destroyed).\nAn obelisk-shaped memorial dedicated to the victory of the Allied fleets and their three admirals, the British Edward Codrington, the French Henri de Rigny and the Russian Lodewijk van Heiden was later erected on the central square of Pylos. The monument was the work of the sculptor Thomas Thomopoulos (1873\u20131937) and its unveiling took place in 1930, although it was completed in 1933.\nThe liberation of Pylos (6 October 1828) and the construction of the modern city.\nOn 6 October 1828, Pylos was definitively liberated from the Ottoman\u2013Egyptian troops of Ibrahim Pasha by the French troops of the Morea expedition commanded by Marshal Nicolas-Joseph Maison. The mission of this expeditionary corps of 15,000 men, sent by king Charles X of France to the Peloponnese between 1828 and 1833, was to implement the Treaty London of 1827, an agreement under which the Greeks would have the right to an independent state. The French troops liberated the cities of Navarino (Pylos), Modon (Methoni), Coron (Koroni) and Patras in October 1828.\nThe current city of Pylos was built starting in the spring of 1829, outside the walls of Neokastro, on the model of the bastides of Southwest France and the cities of the Ionian Islands (which share common features, such as a central geometrical square bordered by covered galleries built with a succession of contiguous arches, each supported by a colonnade, as the arcades of Pylos or Corfu). Pylos's urban framework was designed by Joseph-Victor Audoy, lieutenant-colonel of the military engineering of the Morea expedition, who originated from Tarn, a department of Southwest France. This plan was approved by the governor of independent Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias on 15 January 1831, making it the second urban plan (after that of Methoni) in the history of the modern Greek state. The fortifications of \"Neokastro\" were raised, a barracks was built (the \"Maison's building\" which houses nowadays the Archaeological Museum of Pylos), many improvements were made to the city (installation of school, hospital, church, postal service, shops, bridges, squares, fountains, gardens, etc.), the old Ottoman aqueduct, which had fallen into ruins until 1828, was restored (it then served until 1907), and the road between Navarin and Modon, the first road of independent Greece (which is still used today), was also built by the French engineers.\nPart of the Morea expedition were also 19 scientists from the \"Morea Scientific Mission\", whose work proved essential to the ongoing development of the new Greek State and, more broadly, marked a major milestone in the modern history of archaeology, cartography and natural sciences, as well as in the study of Greece. According to one of their population censuses in the province of Navarino in 1829, it had a total of 1,596 inhabitants. Some French merchants and officers of the Morea expedition, who remained in the city with their families after the troops returned to France in 1833, settled in a district located in the north of the city, near a Catholic church that has since been demolished. This district is still called today \"Francomahalas\" (in Greek: \u03a6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2, from Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0644\u0629 (\"mahallah\"), district) or \"Francoklisa\" (in Greek: \u03a6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03ac, church of the French). The French always had a particular interest in the city, and at that time, the greatest French writers wrote texts specifically dedicated to Pylos, such as Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand in 1806, Eug\u00e8ne Sue and Victor Hugo in 1827, Edgar Quinet in 1830 and Alphonse de Lamartine in 1832.\nIn 1833, after the departure of the French, the name \"Pylos\" (in reference to the ancient city of King Nestor) was given to the new city of Navarino by royal decree of the newly installed king Otto I of Greece.\n20th century.\nThe fortress of Pylos was transformed into a place of deportation of political opponents during the totalitarian regime of Metaxas between 1936 and 1941. Administratively, Pylos was the seat of the Municipality of Pylos between 1912 and 1946, then became the seat of the Deme of Pylos between 1946 and 2010. \n21st century.\nSince the 2011 reform, Pylos has been the seat of the new Municipality of Pylos-Nestor.\nOn the night of 14 June 2023, a vessel carrying an estimated 400\u2013750 immigrants and refugees capsized off the coast of Pylos, after the Greek coastguard allegedly tried to pull the boat into the Italian Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) zone. More than 500 people were presumed dead.\nGeography.\nSite.\nThe city of Pylos is located at the foot of a promontory which extends Mount Aghios Nikolaos (482 m) and carries the fortress. It is located at the south-western end of Peloponnese, on the Ionian coast. It is an important shipping center and, in recent years, it has experienced significant tourist development, exploiting its magnificent coastline. The narrow island of Sphacteria serves as a natural breakwater for Navarino Bay, making the port of Pylos one of the safest anchors of the Ionian coast.\nCommunication.\nPylos has excellent roads and all the communication amenities of a modern city. Greek National Road 82 departs from the center of Pylos and connects directly to Kalamata in less than an hour, and from there to Athens in two hours. Kalamata International Airport (KLX, Captain Vassilis C. Constantakopoulos Airport), which is expanding rapidly, offers many scheduled flights to the major cities of Greece, and many charter flights during the touristic season from many international destinations.\nPopulation.\nAccording to the census of 2021, the municipality (deme) of Pylos-Nestor has 17,194 inhabitants. The municipal unit of Pylos has 4,559 inhabitants, while the community of Pylos has 2,568 inhabitants, making it the seventh most populous city in Messenia, after the capital Kalamata (58,816), Messini (5,958), Kyparissia (5,763), Filiatra (4,729), Gargalianoi (4,724) and Chora (2,609).\nUrban landscape.\nNavarino castles.\nThe city of Pylos has two castles (\"Kastra\"): the Frankish \"Paleokastro\" (old castle) and the Ottoman \"Neokastro\" (new castle). The first is located northwest of Navarino Bay and north of the island of Sphacteria, while the second is southwest of the bay, on the heights of the city of Pylos. The \"Paleokastro\", located on the top of the promontory of Coryphasium \"(Koryphasion)\" (which is in geological continuity with the island of Sphacteria from which it is only separated by the narrow pass of \"Sykia\"), is built on the site of the ancient acropolis of Pylos. It offers a panoramic view, stretching from the Ionian Sea to the Plain of Pylia. Below is Nestor's cave, where, according to mythology, the king of Pylos raised his oxen, and the bay of Voidokilia, whose beach is regularly ranked among the most beautiful in the world. It borders the Gialova lagoon (\"Osman-aga lake\"), located to the east and Navarino bay to the south. However, access to the \"Paleokastro\" may present some risks for the safety of visitors, due to its great deterioration. On the other side of the Navarino bay, the \"Neokastro\", which is in a better state of conservation, looks out onto the island of Sphacteria, the bay of Navarino, and the city. It is one of the best preserved castles in Greece. It contains within its walls the well-preserved \"Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior\", built by the Franks, later transformed into a mosque, then again into a Christian church. In the pine forest of the \"Neokastro\" is also the old barracks built by the French troops of the Morea expedition, which now houses the http://.\nNavarino aqueduct.\nSouth of the city of Pylos, on the road to Methoni, is the old Navarino aqueduct, built in the 16th century by the Ottomans to meet the water supply needs of the \"Neokastro\". Composed by two hydraulic systems, it led the waters from the water intakes of the \"plateau of Koumbeh\" (located near the town of Chandrinou about 15 kilometers northeast of Pylos on the road to Kalamata) and \"Paleo Nero\" (located near the village of Palaionero). The two systems combined into a single system that can still be seen today around Pylos in the district of \"Kamares\". Then, thanks to an underground conduit of the aqueduct, the water penetrated inside the fortress to feed there the fountains of the \"Neokastro\".\"\" Fallen into ruins until 1828, it was restored in 1832 by the French engineers of the Morea expedition, and was used to supply Pylos with water until 1907.\nPylos city center.\nLeaning against two hills, one of which is overlooked by the fortress of the \"Neokastro,\" the town of Pylos faces the bay of Navarino. Pylos preserves many houses from the 19th century. These are built of stone, with typical Messenian architecture and surrounded by spacious courtyards and gardens. They are built mainly between narrow streets, generally symmetrical, and according to the original urban plan established by French military engineers of the Morea expedition at the beginning of the 19th century. Many of the streets have retained their original stone paving, and several of those which climb the hills, are pedestrianized and have steps.\nNear the seafront is the central city square, the Square of the Three Admirals, surrounded by buildings whose ground floor houses, most often under arcade galleries, markets, bakeries, shops and traditional cafes. The seaside, to the north-west of the city, follows a recently pedestrianized street which leads from the central square to the modern port, passing through the \"Francomahalas\" district. In this street, aligned along the old port, are several traditional fish taverns. The port is dominated by the City Hall of Pylos. Next to it is recently renovated two-story house of the Olympic champion Kostis Tsiklitiras, in which a museum has been installed, which exposes a collection of paintings, engravings and ancient documents collected by the French philhellene, historian and writer Ren\u00e9 Puaux (1878\u20131936). A little further, still following the seaside, is the historic building of the College of Pylos which was founded in September 1921 by royal decree and built in 1924. After the cessation of its activities in 1987, the building housed until very recently the Institute of Physical Astrophysics \"Nestor\" of the National Observatory of Greece. The institute is in charge of the international research project NESTOR and its underwater neutrino detector, which is installed more than 4,000 meters deep, in the deepest marine trench of the Mediterranean Sea, 31\u00a0km off Pylos. In September 1992, the historic building of the College of Pylos was classified by the Ministry of Culture as a \"Preserved Historic Monument\" and will house soon in the near future the public library and gallery of the municipality of Pylos.\nThe city also has bank branches, a post office, various clinics, a health center, a fire station, a sailing school, nurseries, primary schools, a college, a high school and a music conservatory recognized by the State. The city is also home to several cultural and development associations.\nThe central square of the Three Admirals.\nAlso built by French troops of the Morea expedition in 1829, the central square of Pylos is characterized by its triangular geometric pattern, one of the sides of which opens onto the sea and the port of Pylos, and whose two other sides are bordered by covered galleries with arcades, built with a succession of contiguous arches, each supported by a colonnade, recalling the architecture of the central squares of the bastides of Southwest France and those of the cities of the Ionian Islands (such as Corfu). These galleries are home to many small markets and businesses, as well as traditional and more modern cafes and restaurants. Most of their terraces extend over the square itself, which is shaded by several hundred-year-old plane trees. In the center, surrounded by two majestic phoenix, is a monument commemorating the battle of Navarino, an obelisk dedicated to the victory of the Allied fleets and their three admirals, the British Edward Codrington, the French Henri de Rigny and the Russian Lodewijk van Heiden.\nChurches.\nOn the eastern slope of Pylos hill is the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary (\"Ieros Naos tis Kimiseos tis Theotokou\"), while to the west, inside the \"Neokastro\", is the former Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior (\"Ieros Naos tis Metamorphosis tou Sotiros\"), both of which belong to the Metropolis of Messenia. The Church of the Transfiguration occasionally organizes religious activities (it has been converted into a museum and exhibition center), while that of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary still gathers many faithful during its regular services, and particularly during the celebration of Easter and the Myrtidiotissa Virgin (the Virgin with myrtles, to whom the church is dedicated) which attract many pilgrims from Athens and abroad who come to take part in processions that take place in the center of the city.\nThe port and the marina.\nThe port of Pylos is one of the safest boarding destinations for ships traveling in the Mediterranean Sea. Navarino Bay continues to regularly serve as a shelter for ships during storms in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, its strategic location between the Ionian Sea and the Aegean Sea makes it an ideal destination for an intermediate station on the route to the Cyclades, the Dodecanese Islands or to Crete. With its modern pier, it frequently welcomes many cruise ships during the summer season. To the east of the port, there is also the marina of Pylos, for which a project of modernization is currently running to meet the requirements for the rapid tourism development of the region.\nAround Pylos.\nThe Palace of Nestor.\nNorth of Pylos () and south of the town of Chora (4 kilometres), is the hill of \"Ano Englianos\" which houses the Mycenaean Bronze Age palace known as the \"Palace of Nestor\" (1600\u20131200 BC). This palace remains today in Greece the best preserved palace and one of the most important of all Mycenaean civilization. The remains of the palace consist of the throne room with its foyer, an anteroom, passageways, large warehouses, the external walls of the palace, unique baths, galleries, and 90 meters away from the palace, a beehive tholos tomb (funerary chamber with dome) perfectly restored in 1957 (\"Tholos tomb IV)\". Very recently, in 2015, the team of American archaeologists Sharon Stocker and Jack L. Davis of the University of Cincinnati discovered and excavated, near the palace, the tomb of the \"Griffin Warrior\", and even more recently in 2017, two other tholos tombs (\"Tholos tombs VI and VII\"), all three containing a multitude of cultural artifacts and jewels of exceptional delicacy (such as the Pylos Combat Agate or a golden pendant depicting the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, which show that Pylos had trading connections, previously unknown, with Egypt and the Near East around 1500 B.C.E). In June 2016, the site reopened to the public after 3 years of work to replace the old roof of the 1960s with a modern structure with elevated walkways for visitors. The archaeological site of the Palace of Nestor can be visited every day, except on holidays and on Tuesdays.\nThe Archaeological Museum of Chora.\nThe archaeological museum is located in the center of the village of Chora, located 4 kilometres north of the Palace of Nestor. The museum was built in 1969 to house the artifacts discovered in Nestor's Palace and in the rest of the region. However, some of them are currently exposed in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, in the first room devoted to Mycenaean civilization. The Museum of Chora has three rooms. The first room contains finds almost exclusively from the tombs of the region: pots, weapons and jewelry. The second room contains finds from the region of Englianos and from the Palace of Nestor. In addition to the large storage jars and other ceramics from the palace warehouses, there are some wall frescoes, such as that depicting a lyre player with a bird, as well as war and hunting scenes. In the last room are exposed other finds from the hill of Englianos and the Palace of Nestor and in particular part of the contents of the tombs of this region, such as giant vases, cups and jewelry. The Archaeological Museum of Chora can be visited every day, except on public holidays and on Tuesdays.\nThe lagoon of Gialova and the beaches of Vo\u00efdokilia and Divari.\nNorth of Navarino Bay, near the village of Gialova, the Gialova wetland (\"Osman-aga lake\") is one of 10 major lagoons in Greece. Part of the Natura 2000 network, it is considered a place of remarkable natural beauty and as one of the important bird areas in Europe. It has also been listed as a 1500-acre archaeological site, lying between Gialova and the bay of Voidokilia. Its alternative name of \"Vivari\" is Latin, meaning 'fishponds'. With a depth, at its deepest point, of no more than four meters, its pond constitutes an ornithological reserve of exceptional importance in Europe, as it is the southernmost stopover of birds migrating between the Balkans and Africa. It gives shelter to no fewer than 270 bird species, among them greater flamingos, glossy ibis, grey herons, great egrets, little egrets, Eurasian curlews, golden plovers, black-winged stilts, great cormorants, common kingfishers, ruffs, garganeys, but also Audouin's gulls and birds of prey (lesser kestrels, ospreys, peregrine falcons and imperial eagles). It is Gialova, too, which plays host to a very rare species, nearing extinction throughout Europe, the African chameleon. The observation post of the Greek Ornithological Society allows visitors to find out more and to watch the shallow brackish waters of the lake; they can walk the paths that circumscribe Gialova's different ecosystems.At the western end of the lagoon is the small bay of Voidokilia, whose cove-shaped beach is regularly ranked among the most beautiful in the world. It is bordered on one side (to the east) by the Divari lagoon from which it is separated by a dune bank, on the other side (to the west) by the Ionian Sea onto which it opens, and finally on a third side (to the south) by the Navarino bay. The beach is also part of the Natura 2000 network. It is free to access and can be reached by two routes: either by a road from the village of Gialova which crosses the Divari lagoon, or by a path which crosses the village of Petrochori. On the northern promontory at the entrance to the Voidokilia lagoon is a Mycenaean beehive tholos tomb known as \"\"Thrasymedes\"', the son of king Nestor. On the heights of the beach, going up towards the \"Paleokastro\", is the cave known as \"\"Cave\" \"of Nestor\"\", in which, according to mythology, the king of Pylos was raising his oxen.\nOn the way from Vo\u00efdokilia to the village of Gialova to the east, an asphalt road follows the narrow strip of land passing between the Divari lagoon and Navarino bay. Along this road is a long white sandy beach which runs along the bay of Navarino: the Beach of the Golden Coast (\"Paralia tis Chrysis Aktis\") or Divari beach. It joins to the east another beach, within the village of Gialova, the beach of Gialova.\nEvents.\nSince 2017, every year around October 20, the \"Navarinia\" are organized in memory of the battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) by the municipality of Pylos-Nestor and the volunteers of the local association who is in charge to organize the event. Spread over a period of several days, the celebrations culminate on the anniversary of the battle in the port of Pylos, with the participation of the Hellenic Navy and diplomatic and military representatives of the three Allied countries. Frigates of the Hellenic, British, French and Russian navies, as well as many old sailing ships take part in the reenactment of the famous battle organized with an impressive sound and light show. The evening most often ends with the firing of a reconstructed ship that supposedly took part in the battle and with an impressive fireworks display fired from the port.\nThe celebrations are also accompanied on previous days by various cultural events that take place in parallel in other parts of the city (ceremonies and tributes to the dead on the various memorials of Pylos and of the region, national and international conferences, parades in the streets of Pylos, traditional musical and dance performances, etc.). Although organized at the end of the touristic season, these celebrations generally attract a large crowd of spectators. In 2019, the demonstrations, which took place in the presence of the President of the Hellenic Republic, gathered more than 10,000 visitors. In 2020, the Navarinia have been awarded the \"Gold Tourism Award 2020\" in the category Cultural Tourism.\nIn 2025, the 144th IOC Session was held in Pylos. Kirsty Coventry was elected as President of the International Olympic Committee at the session.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Avildsen\nRocky is a 1976 American independent sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen, written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the first installment in the \"Rocky\" franchise and also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, and Burgess Meredith. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a poor small-time club fighter and loanshark debt collector from Philadelphia, gets an unlikely once in a lifetime shot at the world heavyweight championship held by Apollo Creed (Weathers).\n\"Rocky\" entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days. It entered a complicated production process after Stallone refused to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; United Artists eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six figure deal for the film rights. Principal photography began in January 1976, with filming primarily held in Philadelphia; several locations featured in the film, such as the Rocky Steps, are now considered cultural landmarks. With an estimated production budget of under $1.1\u00a0million, \"Rocky\" popularized the rags to riches and American Dream themes of sports dramas which preceded the film.\n\"Rocky\" had its premiere in New York City on November 20, 1976, and was released in the United States on December 3, 1976. \"Rocky\" became the highest-grossing film of 1976, earning approximately $225\u00a0million worldwide. The film received critical acclaim for Stallone's writing, as well as the film's performances, direction, musical score, cinematography and editing; among other accolades, it received ten Academy Award nominations and won three, including Best Picture. It has been ranked by numerous publications as one of the greatest films of all time, as well as one of the most iconic sports films ever.\n\"Rocky\" and its theme song have become a pop-cultural phenomenon and an important part of 1970s American popular culture. In 2006, the Library of Congress selected \"Rocky\" for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". The first sequel in the series, \"Rocky II\", was released in 1979.\nPlot.\nTo mark the upcoming United States Bicentennial, heavyweight boxing world champion Apollo Creed plans to hold a title bout in Philadelphia. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand, and that all other potential replacements are either booked up or unable to get into shape in time. Having already invested heavily into the fight, Creed decides instead to give a local contender a chance to challenge him.\nCreed selects Rocky Balboa, an Italian-American journeyman southpaw boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a Mafia loan shark, on the basis of his nickname, \"The Italian Stallion\". Rocky fights in a local Philadelphia fight club, and he won his last fight with Spider Rico. He meets with promoter George Jergens, who tells him Creed has selected Rocky to fight him for the World Heavyweight Championship. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight, which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as punching bags.\nRocky is later approached by Mickey Goldmill, a former bantamweight fighter-turned-trainer whose gym Rocky frequents, about further training. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and saw him as a wasted talent, but eventually Rocky accepts the offer.\nRocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino, a shy woman who is working part-time at the J&amp;M Tropical Fish pet store. Adrian's brother and Rocky's best friend, Paulie, helps Rocky get a date with his sister and offers to work as a cornerman with him for the fight, an offer Rocky turns down. Paulie becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the meat packing business where Paulie works for sponsorship as part of the upcoming fight, and both of them reconcile. Rocky trains extensively for the championship fight, while Apollo is unconcerned about the match and puts more effort into promotion than training. The night before the match, Rocky visits the Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to go the distance against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone.\nOn New Year's Day, the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as George Washington and then Uncle Sam. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round\u2014the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries: Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut to restore his vision, while Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's incredible stamina, toughness and an unbreakable will to fight on. As the final bell sounds, both fighters promise each other there will be no rematch.\nAs the ring is flooded with reporters and excited fans, Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down as Paulie distracts security, helping her get into the ring. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision, Rocky and Adrian embrace and profess their love for each other, unconcerned with the outcome of the fight.\nProduction.\nDevelopment and writing.\nSylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for \"Rocky\" in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner that took place at Richfield Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio, on March 24, 1975. Wepner was TKO'd in the 15th\u00a0round of the match by Ali, with few expecting him to last as long as he did. Despite the match motivating Stallone to begin work on \"Rocky\", he has denied Wepner provided any inspiration for the script. Other inspiration for the film may have included characteristics of real-life boxers Rocky Marciano and Joe Frazier, as well as Rocky Graziano's autobiography \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" and the movie of the same name. Wepner sued Stallone, and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.\nHenry Winkler, Stallone's co-star in \"The Lords of Flatbush\" who then broke out as Arthur Fonzarelli on ABC's \"Happy Days\", said he had taken the script to executives at the network. They expressed interest in turning it into a made-for-television movie and actually bought the script but insisted that someone else rewrite it. Upon hearing the news, Stallone begged Winkler not to let ABC change writers, so Winkler went back to the executives and offered to return the money in exchange for the rights. While ABC refused at first, Winkler said he was able to use his status as one of its biggest stars at the time to convince them to sell the rights back.\nAt the time, Film Artists Management Enterprises (FAME), a joint venture between Hollywood talent agents Craig T. Rumar and Larry Kubik, represented Stallone. He submitted his script to Rumar and Kubik, who immediately saw the potential for it to be made into a motion picture. They shopped the script to various producers and studios in Hollywood but were repeatedly rejected because Stallone insisted that he be cast in the lead role. Eventually, they secured a meeting with Winkler-Chartoff productions (no relation to Henry Winkler). After repeated negotiations with Rumar and Kubik, Winkler-Chartoff agreed to a contract for Stallone to be the writer and also star in the lead role for \"Rocky\". Stallone offered the script to Ralph Bakshi to direct, because he loved Bakshi's 1973 film \"Heavy Traffic\", but Bakshi turned it down because he didn't want to leave animation, and John G. Avildsen signed on to direct instead.\nUnited Artists liked Stallone's script and viewed it as a vehicle for a well-established star like Robert Redford, Ryan O'Neal, Burt Reynolds, or James Caan. United Artist initially thought the project was going to be a disaster. Stallone's agents insisted that Stallone portray the title character, to the point of issuing an ultimatum. Stallone later said that he would never have forgiven himself had the film become a success with somebody else in the lead. He also knew that producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff's contract with the studio enabled them to \"greenlight\" a project if the budget was kept low enough. The producers also collateralized any possible losses with their big-budget entry, \"New York City\" (whose eventual losses were covered by \"Rocky\"'s success). The film's production budget ended up being $1,075,000, with a further $100,000 spent on producers' fees and $4.2\u00a0million on advertising costs.\nPre-production.\nAlthough Chartoff and Irwin Winkler were enthusiastic about the script and the idea of Stallone playing the lead character, they were hesitant about having an unknown headline the film. The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by the production standards. Real-life boxer Ken Norton was initially sought for the role of Apollo Creed, but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to Carl Weathers. Norton, upon whom Creed was loosely based, fought Muhammad Ali three times. According to \"The Rocky Scrapbook\", Carrie Snodgress was originally chosen to play Adrian, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere. Susan Sarandon and Cher auditioned for the role but Sarandon was deemed too pretty for the character and Cher too expensive. After Talia Shire's ensuing audition, Chartoff and Winkler, and director John Avildsen, insisted that she play the part.\nPhiladelphia-based boxer Joe Frazier has a cameo appearance in the film. Outspoken boxer Muhammad Ali, who fought Frazier three times, influenced the character of Apollo Creed. During the 49th Academy Awards ceremony in 1977, Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show the film did not offend Ali. Frazier has claimed that some of the plot's most memorable moments\u2014Rocky's carcass-punching scenes and Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of his training regimen\u2014are taken without credit from his own real-life exploits.\nBecause of the film's comparatively low budget, members of Stallone's family played minor roles. His father rings the bell to signal the start and end of a round; his brother Frank plays a street corner singer, and his first wife, Sasha, was stills photographer. Other cameos include former Philadelphia and then Los Angeles television sportscaster Stu Nahan playing himself, alongside radio and TV broadcaster Bill Baldwin; and Lloyd Kaufman, founder of the independent film company Troma, appearing as a drunk. Diana Lewis, then a news anchor in Los Angeles and later in Detroit, has a minor scene as a TV news reporter. Tony Burton appears as Apollo Creed's trainer, Tony \"Duke\" Evers, a role he would reprise throughout the entire \"Rocky\" series, though the character is not named until \"Rocky\u00a0II\". Michael Dorn, who would later gain fame as the Klingon Worf in ' and ', made his acting debut, albeit uncredited, as Creed's bodyguard.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography for \"Rocky\" began on January\u00a09, 1976. Filming took place primarily throughout Philadelphia, with a few scenes shot in Los Angeles. Rocky's house was located at 1818 East Tusculum Street in the Kensington neighborhood of North Philadelphia. Inventor Garrett Brown's new Steadicam was used to accomplish smooth photography while running alongside Rocky during the film's Philadelphia street training sequences and the run up the Art Museum's flight of stairs, now colloquially known as the Rocky Steps. It was also used for some shots in the fight scenes and can be seen at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight. \"Rocky\" is often erroneously cited as the first film to use the Steadicam, although it was actually the third, after \"Bound for Glory\" and \"Marathon Man\".\nCertain elements of the story were altered during filming. The original script had a darker tone: Mickey was portrayed as racist, and the script ended with Rocky throwing the fight after realizing he did not want to be part of the professional boxing world after all.\nBoth Stallone and Weathers suffered injuries during the shooting of the final fight; Stallone suffered bruised ribs and Weathers suffered a damaged nose, the opposite injuries of what their characters had.\nThe first date between Rocky and Adrian, in which Rocky bribes a janitor to allow them to skate after closing hours on a deserted ice skating rink, was shot that way due to budgetary the scene was originally scheduled to be shot in a public skating rink during regular business hours, but the producers decided they could not afford the hundreds of extras that would have been required.\nThe poster seen above the ring before Rocky fights Apollo Creed shows Rocky wearing red shorts with a white stripe when he actually wears white shorts with a red stripe. When Rocky points this out, promoter George Jergens tells him that it \"doesn't really matter, does it?\". Avildsen said this was an actual mistake made by the props department that they could not afford to rectify, so the brief scene was written to ensure the audience did not see it as a goof. Conversely, Stallone has said he was indeed supposed to wear red shorts with a white stripe as Rocky, but changed to the opposite colors \"at the last moment\". Similarly, when Rocky's robe arrived far too baggy on the day it was needed for filming, Stallone wrote in dialogue where Rocky points this out.\nMusic.\nSoundtrack.\nBill Conti composed the musical score for \"Rocky\". He had composed a score for director John G. Avildsen's \"W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings\" (1975) that the studio ultimately rejected. David Shire (then-husband of Talia Shire) was the first to be offered the chance to compose the music for \"Rocky\" but had to turn it down because of prior commitments. Avildsen reached out to Conti without any studio help because of the film's relatively low budget. Avildsen said, \"The budget for the music was 25 grand. And that was for everything: The composer's fee, that was to pay the musicians, that was to rent the studio, that was to buy the tape that it was going to be recorded on.\"\nThe main theme song, \"Gonna Fly Now\", made it to number one on \"Billboard\" magazine's Hot 100 list for one week (from July\u00a02 to July\u00a08, 1977) and the American Film Institute placed it 58th on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs. United Artists Records released the soundtrack album on November\u00a012, 1976. EMI re-released the album on CD and cassette.\nFrank Stallone's song \"Take You Back\" is also on the soundtrack, and he also sings the song in the movie with other friends around a trash can fire.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\nThe movie began with two premieres in New York, starting with the world premiere for Rocky, which would take place at Paramount Theatre in New York City on Saturday, November 20, 1976, by United Artists and the other on the day after Sunday, November 21, 1976, by United Artists at Cinema II in New York City. The Los Angeles premiere took place at the Plaza in Westwood Village on December 1, 1976. This was then followed by a full official release on December 3, 1976, all throughout North America in the United States and Canada.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Rocky\" grossed $5,488 on its opening day at Cinema\u00a0II, a house record. When it was released nationally, it grossed $5\u00a0million during its first wide weekend and consistently performed well for eight months and eventually reached $117\u00a0million at the North American box office. Adjusted for inflation in 2018, the film earned over $500\u00a0million in North America alone. Overseas, \"Rocky\" grossed $107\u00a0million, for a worldwide box office total of $225\u00a0million. With its production budget of just under $1\u00a0million, \"Rocky\" is notable for its worldwide percentage return of over 11,000 percent. It was the highest-grossing film released in 1976 in the United States and Canada and the second highest-grossing film of 1977, behind \"Star Wars\".\nCritical response.\n\"Rocky\" received positive reviews at the time of its release. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said that Stallone reminded him of \"the young Marlon Brando.\" \"Box Office Magazine\" claimed audiences would be \"touting Sylvester 'Sly' Stallone as a new star\". Frank Rich liked the film, calling it \"almost 100 per cent schmaltz\", but favoring it over the cynicism that was prevalent in movies at that time, although he referred to the plot as \"gimmicky\" and the script \"heavy-handed\". Several reviews, including Richard Eder's (as well as Canby's negative review), compared the work to that of Frank Capra.\nThe film did not escape criticism. Vincent Canby, of \"The New York Times\", called it \"pure '30s make believe\" and dismissed both Stallone's acting and Avildsen's directing, calling the latter \"none too decisive\". Andrew Sarris found the Capra comparisons disingenuous: \"Capra's movies projected more despair deep down than a movie like \"Rocky\" could envisage, and most previous ring movies have been much more cynical about the fight scene\"; commenting on Rocky's work for a loan shark, Sarris says the film \"teeters on the edge of sentimentalizing gangsters\". He found Meredith \"oddly cast in the kind of part the late James Gleason used to pick his teeth\".\nThe film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives nearly universal praise. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% approval rating based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's critics consensus states: \"This story of a down-on-his-luck boxer is thoroughly predictable, but Sylvester Stallone's script and stunning performance in the title role brush aside complaints.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 70 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating .\nLegacy.\nThe Directors Guild of America awarded \"Rocky\" its annual award for best film of the year in 1976. Additionally, the Directors Guild voted \"Rocky\" as the 65th best-directed film of all time, and in 2006, Sylvester Stallone's original screenplay for the film was selected by the Writers Guild of America as the 78th best screenplay of all time. In a 2012 survey of members of the Motion Picture Editors Guild, \"Rocky\" was voted as one of the 75 best-edited films in all of cinema.\nIn 2006, the Library of Congress selected \"Rocky\" for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\nIn 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked \"Rocky\" as the 78th best film in American cinema. The film's ranking rose to No. 57 on AFI's 10th anniversary edition of the list in 2007. Additionally, in June 2008, AFI revealed its 10 Top 10\u2014the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres\u2014after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. \"Rocky\" was acknowledged as the second-best film in the sports genre, after \"Raging Bull\".\nFilm scholar Steven J. Schneider included \"Rocky\" in his book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\", writing that the film is \"often overlooked as schmaltz\".\nFilmsite.org, a subsidiary of American Movie Classics, included the film on their list of the 300 greatest films of all time.

In 1982, a statue of Rocky, commissioned by Stallone for \"Rocky\u00a0III\", was placed at the top of the Rocky Steps. City Commerce Director Dick Doran claimed that Stallone and Rocky had done more for the city's image than \"anyone since Ben Franklin\".\nDiffering opinions of the statue and its placement led to a relocation to the sidewalk outside the Spectrum Arena, although the statue was temporarily returned to the top of the steps in 1990 for \"Rocky\u00a0V\", and again in 2006 for the 30th anniversary of the original \"Rocky\" (although this time it was placed at the bottom of the steps). Later that year, it was moved permanently to a spot next to the steps.\nThe scene is frequently parodied in other media. In the 2008 movie \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\", Zohan's nemesis, Phantom, goes through a parody training sequence finishing with him running up a desert dune and raising his hands in victory. In the fourth-season finale of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", as the credits roll at the end of the episode, Will is seen running up the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art; however, as he celebrates after finishing his climb, he passes out in exhaustion, and while he lies unconscious on the ground, a pickpocket steals his wallet and his wool hat. In \"The Nutty Professor\", there is a scene where Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) struggles to, and eventually succeeds at, running up a lengthy flight of steps on his college campus, victoriously throwing punches at the top.\nIn 2006, E! named the \"Rocky Steps\" scene number 13 on its 101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment list.\nDuring the 1996 Summer Olympics torch relay, Philadelphia native Dawn Staley was chosen to run up the museum steps. In 2004, presidential candidate John Kerry ended his pre-convention campaign at the foot of the steps before going to Boston to accept his party's nomination for president.\nNovelization.\nUpon the film's release, a paperback novelization of the screenplay written by Rosalyn Drexler under the pseudonym Julia Sorel and published by Ballantine Books was released.\nVideo games.\nSeveral video games have been produced based on the film. \"Rocky\" was released in 1987 for the Master System. \"Rocky\" was released in 2002 for the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, and a sequel, \"Rocky Legends\", was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. In 2016, Tapinator released a mobile game named \"ROCKY\" for the iOS platform, with a planned 2017 release for Google Play and Amazon platforms.\nMusical.\nA musical was written by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics and music), with the book by Thomas Meehan, based on the film. The musical premiered in Hamburg, Germany in October 2012. It began performances at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway on February\u00a011, 2014, and officially opened on March\u00a013, 2014.\nDocumentaries.\n\"Rocky\" is featured in the 2017 documentary \"John G. Avildsen: King of the Underdogs\" about Academy Award-winning \"Rocky\" director John G. Avildsen, directed and produced by Derek Wayne Johnson.\nStallone later hand-picked Johnson to direct and produce a documentary on the making of the original \"Rocky\", entitled \"40 Years of Rocky: The Birth of a Classic\", which was released in 2020. The documentary features Stallone narrating behind-the-scenes footage from the making of the film.\nParodies.\n\"Rocky\" has been parodied a lot over the years, even getting a feature length spoof called \"Ricky 1\" in 1988. In 1986, Finnish director Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki made an 8-minute spoof of \"Rocky IV\" called \"Rocky VI\".\nNational Museum of American history.\nThe red satin robe and black hat worn by Stallone in \"Rocky\" are featured in the National Museum of American History. Likewise, the red gloves worn by Stallone in \"Rocky II\" (1979), his white Nike boxing shoes, and striped boxing trunks from \"Rocky III\" (1981) are archived at the museum. All items were on display for a temporary period following Stallone's donation in 2006, and have since been moved to the museum archives.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45773", "revid": "5811002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45773", "title": "Kinshasa", "text": "Capital and most populous city of DR Congo\nKinshasa (; ; ), formerly named L\u00e9opoldville from 1881\u20131966 (), is the capital and largest city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kinshasa is one of the world's fastest-growing megacities, with an estimated population of 17.8 million in 2024. It is the most densely populated city in the DRC, the third-most populous city and third-largest metropolitan area in Africa, and the world's twenty-second most populous city and fourth-most populous capital city. It is the leading economic, political, and cultural center of the DRC, housing several industries including manufacturing, telecommunications, banking, and entertainment. The city also hosts some of the DRC's significant institutional buildings, such as the People's Palace, Palace of the Nation, Court of Cassation, Constitutional Court, African Union City, Marble Palace, Martyrs Stadium, Government House, Kinshasa Financial Center, and other national departments and agencies.\nThe Kinshasa site has been inhabited by Teke and Humbu people for centuries and was known as \"Nshasa\" before transforming into a commercial hub during the 19th and 20th centuries. The city was named L\u00e9opoldville by Henry Morton Stanley in honor of Leopold II of Belgium. The name was changed to Kinshasa in 1966 during Mobutu Sese Seko's \"Zairianisation\" campaign as a tribute to \"Nshasa\" village. Covering 9,965 square kilometers, Kinshasa stretches along the southern shores of the Pool Malebo on the Congo River. It forms an expansive crescent across flat, low-lying terrain at an average altitude of about 300 meters. Kinshasa borders the Mai-Ndombe Province, Kwilu Province, and Kwango Province to the east; the Congo River delineates its western and northern perimeters, constituting a natural border with the Republic of the Congo; to the south lies the Kongo Central Province. Across the river sits Brazzaville, the smaller capital of the neighboring Republic of the Congo, forming the world's closest pair of capital cities despite being separated by a four-kilometer-wide unbridged span of the Congo River.\nKinshasa also functions as one of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; it is administratively divided into 24 communes, which are further subdivided into 365 neighborhoods. With an expansive administrative region, over 90 percent of the province's land remains rural, while urban growth predominantly occurs on its western side. Kinshasa is the largest nominally Francophone urban area globally, with French being the language of government, education, media, public services and high-end commerce, while Lingala is used as a lingua franca in the street. The city's inhabitants are popularly known as \"Kinois\", with the term \"Kinshasans\" used in English terminology.\nThe National Museum of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is DRC's most prominent and central museum. The College of Advanced Studies in Strategy and Defense is the highest military institution in DRC and Central Africa. The National Pedagogical University is DRC's first pedagogical university and one of Africa's top pedagogical universities. N'Djili International Airport is the largest airport in the nation. In 2015, Kinshasa was designated as a City of Music by UNESCO and has been a member of the Creative Cities Network since then. Nsele Valley Park is the largest urban park in Kinshasa, housing a range of fauna and flora. According to the 2016 annual ranking, Kinshasa is Africa's most expensive city for expatriate employees, ahead of close to 200 global locations.\nToponymy.\nThere are several theories about the origin of the name \"Kinshasa\". Paul Raymaekers, an anthropologist and ethnologist, suggests that the name derives from the combination of the Kikongo and Kihumbu languages. The prefix \"\"Ki(n)\" signifies a hill or inhabited area and \"Nsasa\" or \"Nshasa\"\" refers to a bag of salt. According to Raymackers, \"Kinshasa\" was a significant trading site where people from the Lower Congo (now Kongo Central Province) and South Atlantic Ocean exchanged salt for goods such as iron, slaves and ivory brought by those from the Upper Congo (now Tshopo Province). However Hendrik van Moorsel, an anthropologist, historian and researcher, proposes that Bateke fishermen traded fish for cassava with locals along the riverbank, and the place of this exchange was called \"Ulio\". In Teke, \"exchange\" is \"Utsaya\", and \"place of exchange\" is \"Intsaya\". Thus, the name evolved from \"Ulio\" to \"Intsaya\", and later, under the influence of Kikongo, transformed into \"Kintsaya\", eventually becoming \"Kinshasa\". \"Kinshasa\", also known as \"N'shasa\", is regarded as the primary \"place of exchange\" on the southern bank of the Pool Malebo, where bartering occurred even before the commercial boom of Kintambo.\nThe name \"Nshasa\" is believed to originate from the Teke verb \"tsaya\" (\"tsaa\"), meaning \"to exchange\", and the noun \"intsaya\" (\"insaa\"), referring to any market or place of exchange. It was at this location that Teke brokers traded ivory and slaves from the Banunu slave traders, often mistaken for the Yanzi, for European trade items brought by the Zombo and Kongo people. Despite the various theories, the historical name of \"Kinshasa\" is known to have been \"Nshasa\", as documented by Henry Morton Stanley during his crossing of Africa from Zanzibar to Boma in 1874\u20131877 when he mentioned visiting \"the king of Nshasa\" on 14 March 1877.\nHistory.\nIn pre-colonial times, the area was inhabited by two trading centres, Ntamo and Ntsaasa, which were part of the Tio Kingdom.\nThe city was established as a trading post by Henry Morton Stanley in 1881. It was named L\u00e9opoldville in honor of Stanley's employer King Leopold II of the Belgians. He would then proceed to take control of most of the Congo Basin as the Congo Free State, not as a colony but as his private property. The post flourished as the first navigable port on the Congo River above Livingstone Falls, a series of rapids over below Leopoldville. At first, all goods arriving by sea or being sent by sea had to be carried by porters between L\u00e9opoldville and Matadi, the port below the rapids and from the coast. The completion of the Matadi-Kinshasa portage railway, in 1898, provided an alternative route around the rapids and sparked the rapid development of L\u00e9opoldville. In 1914, a pipeline was installed so that crude oil could be transported from Matadi to the upriver steamers in Leopoldville. By 1923, the city was elevated to capital of the Belgian Congo, replacing the town of Boma in the Congo estuary, pursuant to the Royal Decree of 1 July 1923, countersigned by the Minister of the Colonies, Louis Franc. This transition, finalized in 1929, led to the development of a new administrative \"quartier\" located between Kinshasa, then emerging as a major commercial center, and L\u00e9opoldville-West, a preexisting settlement. The selected site was named Kalina (now Gombe) and developed as the colonial administrative center. Before this, L\u00e9opoldville was designated an \"urban district\", encompassing exclusively the communes of Kintambo and the current Gombe, which burgeoned around Ngaliema Bay. Then the communes of Kinshasa, Barumbu, and Lingwala emerged. In the 1930s, these communes predominantly housed employees of Chanic, Filtisaf, and Utex Africa.\nIn 1941, legislative ordinance n\u00b0293/AIMO of 25 June 1941, conferred Kinshasa the status of a city and established an Urban Committee (\"Comit\u00e9 Urbain\"), with an allocated area of 5,000 hectares and a population of 53,000. Concurrently, it became the colony's capital, the Congo-Kasa\u00ef Province's capital, and the Moyen Congo district. The city was demarcated into two zones: the urban zone, comprising L\u00e9o II, L\u00e9o-Ouest, Kalina, L\u00e9o-I, or L\u00e9o-Est, and Ndolo; and the indigenous zone to the south. The urban populace swelled in 1945 with the cessation of forced labor, facilitating the influx of native Africans from rural regions. L\u00e9opoldville then became predominantly inhabited by the Bakongo ethnic group.\nIn the 1950s, planned urban centers such as Lemba, Matete, and a segment of Ndjili were established to accommodate workers from the Limete industrial zone. Lovanium University, the colony's inaugural university, was founded in 1954. By 1957, L\u00e9opoldville comprised eleven communes and six adjunct regions: Kalamu, Dendale (present-day Kasa-Vubu commune), Saint Jean (now Lingwala), Ngiri-Ngiri, Kintambo, Limete, Bandalungwa, L\u00e9opoldville (current Gombe), Barumbu, Kinshasa, and Ngaliema; along with the adjunct regions of Lemba, Binza, Makala, Kimwenza, Kimbanseke, and Kingasani. Subsequently, the adjunct regions of Ndjili and Matete were incorporated.\nAfter gaining its independence on 30 June 1960, following riots in 1959, the Republic of the Congo elected its first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba whose perceived pro-Soviet leanings were viewed as a threat by Western interests. This being the height of the Cold War, the U.S. and Belgium did not want to lose control of the strategic wealth of the Congo, in particular its uranium. Less than a year after Lumumba's election, the Belgians and the U.S. bought the support of his Congolese rivals and set in motion the events that culminated in Lumumba's assassination. In 1964, Mo\u00efse Tshombe decreed the expulsion of all nationals of Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Mali, as well as all political refugees from Rwanda. In 1965, with the help of the U.S. and Belgium, Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu seized power in the Congo. He initiated a policy of \"Authenticity\", attempting to renativize the names of people and places in the country. On 2 May 1966, the government announced that the nation's major cities would be restored to their pre-colonial names, effective on 30 June, the sixth anniversary of independence. L\u00e9opoldville was renamed \"Kinshasa\", for a village named Kinshasa that once stood near the site. Kinshasa grew rapidly under Mobutu, drawing people from across the country who came in search of their fortunes or to escape ethnic strife elsewhere, thus adding to the many ethnicities and languages already found there.\nUrban history.\nColonial urban planning.\nEuropean urban development began in 1881 and was guided by rigid planning principles aimed at preserving an orderly and aesthetically pleasing environment, emphasizing open space and vegetation. A major catalyst for urban expansion was the construction of the Matadi\u2013L\u00e9opoldville Railway, initiated in 1890 and completed in 1911. This infrastructure project was emblematic of colonial progress and served as a critical link between the port of L\u00e9opoldville and the coastal city of Matadi. Upon its completion, the station area began to transform, with the erection of prefabricated residences known as \"Danish houses\", imported from Belgium. These permanent structures gradually replaced the temporary tents that had accommodated early explorers, soldiers, and mercenaries. As L\u00e9opoldville developed into an administrative and military center, agents of the Congo Free State, and, after 1908, those of the Belgian Congo, settled in the area. Europeans often took on multiple roles, functioning as engineers, architects, carpenters, and builders. They were supported by mercenaries and trained African laborers, who were instrumental in the physical construction. By 1902, the Kitambo (now Kintambo) area was entirely occupied by European constructions. The urban center expanded as surrounding villages grew, drawn by the prospects of employment and commerce. These settlements would eventually constitute the earliest \"cit\u00e9s indig\u00e8nes\", designated residential areas for the African population.\nAt this early stage, the connection between L\u00e9opoldville (commonly referred to as \"L\u00e9o\") and Kinshasa consisted of an eight-kilometer track that was often impassable during the rainy season. Transportation was rudimentary, with a few bicycles, limited private cars, and even dromedaries in use, as public transit infrastructure was virtually nonexistent. In 1911, George Moulaert, an influential colonial administrator, drafted a comprehensive urban plan for L\u00e9opoldville and the greater Kinshasa area. This plan would guide spatial development for the coming decades. Ironically, World War I accelerated local economic activity. The Belgian Congo, largely cut off from Europe, experienced a period of relative prosperity. Motorboats and trucks increasingly replaced traditional forms of transport, such as canoes and human porters. By the end of the war in 1918, L\u00e9opoldville had emerged as a dynamic urban center, rivaling other Congolese cities and attracting the attention of Belgian architects, who viewed the city as a potential model for colonial urban experimentation. Colonial urbanization remained tightly controlled and reflected the aspirations and limitations of Belgian policy. In 1922, a decree mandated that large companies provide housing for their African workers. While major firms such as Huileries du Congo Belge (HCB) complied by building workers' camps, smaller enterprises often failed to meet these requirements. The existing framework, governed by the decree on \"the labor contract between natives and civilized masters\", proved insufficient to meet growing housing demands. In response, religious missions extended loans to African residents for self-construction, though they were quickly overwhelmed by demand. A special fund was subsequently established to provide interest-free loans for the construction of houses using locally available materials.\nSegregation.\nColonial authorities enforced a racially segregated urban model. African residents were confined to separate indigenous quarters, known as \"cit\u00e9s indig\u00e8nes\", such as L\u00e9o I and L\u00e9o II. These zones were delineated by colonial authorities who allocated land in rudimentary grids. Lacking modern infrastructure like sewers, these neighborhoods only had basic sanitation facilities, typically simple pit latrines made from a hole dug or drilled into the ground. During the 1920s, the urban growth brought the indigenous quarters into proximity with European residential areas, particularly near the Matadi\u2013Kinshasa Railway and the Boulevard Albert 1er (now Boulevard du 30 Juin). This spatial convergence led to heightened concerns among European settlers regarding public health and urban hygiene, leading the L\u00e9opoldville Urban Committee in 1933 to implement a buffer known as the \"neutral zone\". Although an 800-meter-wide zone was recommended, the implemented buffer measured only 250 to 300 meters due to logistical constraints and exemptions granted to some Europeans residing in the area. This zone, referred to as Parc De Bock, now the Kinshasa Botanical Garden, was created by District Commissioner Fernand De Bock and agronomist Roeck. The zone also housed the Kinshasa Zoological Garden and served both as a recreational area for European residents and as a sanitary barrier between the European and indigenous quarters. Vegetable gardens, maintained by unemployed volunteers, were cultivated within the park. Located immediately south of the neutral zone, the indigenous area included notable facilities such as Ndolo Airport, a market, the botanical and zoological gardens, Kinshasa General Hospital, a wireless telegraph station (TSF), a golf course, a cemetery, and Camp L\u00e9opold II (now Camp Kokolo).\nAfrican housing and post-World War II urban development.\nBelgian colonial authorities, motivated by a paternalistic ideology associated with the so-called \"civilizing mission\", initiated efforts to provide formal housing for the African population, particularly for those employed in urban areas. In the aftermath of the Second World War, a large-scale residential project was launched in Dendale, present-day Kasa-Vubu commune, on 407 hectares of land. The development was overseen by the \"Service de la Population Noire\" under the direction of Dendale, from whom the area took its name. This \"Nouvelle Cit\u00e9\" was among the first planned residential zones for Congolese workers. By 1947, just two years after its inception, the area housed over 8,000 residents, including future President Joseph Kasa-Vubu.\nTo further address housing needs for the African population, the \"Office des Cit\u00e9s Africaines\" (OCA) was tasked with urban development. Beginning in 1949, under a ten-year plan, OCA spearheaded projects involving urban design, infrastructure, community facilities, and housing construction. Over 40,000 homes were built by 1959, following a controlled, segregationist approach. Planning responsibilities were initially led by urban planner Georges Ricquier and later taken over by Maurice Heymans in 1953. The new city plan preserved European dominance over the historical center (La Gombe), limiting expansion to adjacent zones and promoting industrial development in Limete.\nPost-1950s urban expansion arose due to the \"sprawl of \"quartiers\", the high demand for housing among the population, and the increasing distance between riverside employment zones and \"cit\u00e9s indig\u00e8nes\"\". Communes like Kasa-Vubu and Ngiri-Ngiri featured structured housing with proper streets, sanitation systems, twin houses, and single-level row buildings. Some housing areas were self-built but still regulated, with residents adhering to official layouts and construction guidelines based on their resources. Between 1954 and 1960, OCA developed Matete, Bandalungwa, and Lemba, alongside the satellite city of Ndjili. These included prearranged roads, drainage systems, sewer networks, and paved primary access routes.\nFor the first time, two-story houses and collective apartment buildings appeared, particularly in Bandalungwa, Matete, and Lemba. Kalamu followed with the expansion of Camp Kaouka and the 20 May neighborhood beyond the Funa River. Further east, across the Yolo River, residential development continued in Limete and its accompanying industrial zone.\nUnrest in 1991 and the First Congo War.\nIn 1991 the city had to fend off rioting soldiers, who were protesting the government's failure to pay them. Subsequently a rebel uprising began, which in 1997 finally brought down the regime of Mobutu.\nThe eruption of the First Congo War (1996\u20131997), closely tied to the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, significantly intensified instability in Kinshasa and across the broader region. Following the genocide, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), under Paul Kagame, launched military operations into eastern Zaire, not only targeting Hutu insurgents but also committing large-scale violence against Hutu civilians. UNHCR consultant Robert Gersony estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 people were killed monthly in mid-1994 alone. The influx of over two million Rwandan Hutu refugees into eastern Zaire further exacerbated security and humanitarian tensions, particularly in provinces such as South Kivu. President Mobutu's regime proved incapable of managing the crisis, thus facilitating the conditions for war. By 1996, foreign-backed militias, including the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), the Ugandan People's Defence Force (UPDF), and Burundi's \"Forces Arm\u00e9es Burundaises\" (FAB), began supporting Congolese Tutsi groups such as the Banyamulenge. Belgian legal and political scholar Filip Reyntjens describes the First Congo War as the convergence of two overlapping goals: the genuine resistance of Congolese Tutsi, who feared retaliation, and the strategic use of this resistance by the Rwandan government to justify the RPA's military involvement in Zaire.\nThe fall of Kinshasa in May 1997 to the Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed \"Alliance des Forces D\u00e9mocratiques pour la Lib\u00e9ration du Congo\" (AFDL), led by Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, marked the beginning of serious human rights abuses in the capital. In the days following the city's capture, AFDL and RPA forces carried out extrajudicial killings, acts of torture, rape, and targeted former regime officials as well as members of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP). On 17 May, Mobutu was overthrown in an AFDL-led coup. Between 18 and 22 May 1997, volunteer teams from the Congolese Red Cross collected between 228 and 318 bodies in Kinshasa and its outskirts and evacuated wounded civilians to local medical facilities. Reports from the United Nations Special Rapporteur and the United Nations Mapping Team indicate that the security situation deteriorated further between May and June 1997. During this period, AFDL and RPA units, often with the participation of civilians, carried out public executions, frequently incinerating the bodies in neighborhoods such as Masina, Matete, and Kingabwa (Limete commune). At the GLM (\"Groupe Litho Moboti\") building, detainees, many of them former members of the Zairean Armed Forces (\"Forces Arm\u00e9es Za\u00efroises\"; FAZ) or political opponents, were routinely executed and their bodies discarded in the Congo River, a practice halted only after intervention by human rights advocates alerted by local fishermen. In September 1997, the security crisis in Kinshasa was compounded by cross-border shelling from Brazzaville. Armed factions involved in a separate conflict in Brazzaville launched artillery fire into Kinshasa between 29 September and 1 October, killing at least 21 civilians. In retaliation, FAC and RPA forces shelled Brazzaville for two consecutive days.\nSystematic torture, detention conditions, and crackdowns on political opposition.\nSecurity forces also engaged in systemic torture and abuse. In June and July 1997, detainees in military prisons at Kokolo and Tshatshi camps suffered ill-treatment that led to numerous deaths from torture, disease, and medical neglect. Reports from late 1997 indicate that at least 24 wounded former members of the Rwandan Armed Forces (\"Forces Arm\u00e9es Rwandaises\", ex-FAR) soldiers disappeared after being transferred from hospitals to military camps, where they were subjected to threats and degrading treatment. The militarization of Kinshasa's public life continued under the new regime. Units of the Congolese Air Force (\"Force A\u00e9rienne Congolaise\", FAC) and the RPA, particularly the young child soldiers known as \"Kadogo\", imposed harsh disciplinary measures on civilians, including public floggings and whippings with the \"chicotte\", a \"leather-thonged whipping device\". These punishments often resulted in severe internal injuries and deaths due to internal bleeding.\nBeginning in June 1997, the new authorities ordered ex-FAZ to undergo political re-education at Kitona military base in Bas-Congo (now Kongo Central). In their absence, soldiers from the newly formed FAC and the RPA occupied military camps in Kinshasa, including CETA and Tshatshi, where they raped large numbers of women and girls, many of whom were family members of ex-FAZ soldiers. Victims were often subjected to sexual slavery and forced domestic labor. At Kokolo military camp, similar atrocities occurred, including gang rapes and the random abduction and assault of women in nearby neighborhoods. At a location known as \"Camp Am\u00e9ricain\", particularly brutal crimes were reported, including the case of a girl who was gang-raped, tortured, and had hot wax poured over her genitals. Violence against women extended beyond military compounds. Numerous reports from the period indicate that FAC and RPA soldiers carried out systematic sexual violence across Kinshasa, including against sex workers and women detained arbitrarily.\nPolitical repression under Kabila's new government intensified after the prohibition of political party activity. Opposition activists and their families were frequently subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, and torture. Women related to political figures were especially vulnerable to sexual violence during state crackdowns. Activists from major opposition parties such as the \"Parti Lumumbiste Unifi\u00e9\" (PALU), \"Union pour la D\u00e9mocratie et le Progr\u00e8s Social\" (UDPS), and the \"Front pour la Survie de la D\u00e9mocratie au Congo\" (FSDC) were frequent targets. In July 1997, FAC and RPA soldiers killed between one and four PALU members during a protest crackdown and injured several others. The residence of PALU leader Antoine Gizenga was ransacked, resulting in the death of an activist and the severe beating of six more. Documented cases of torture and rape continued into 1998. Notably, on 10 December 1997, two sisters of the FSDC president were gang-raped by FAC and RPA personnel. The FSDC leader himself, a former Mobutu loyalist, was arrested in February 1998 and subjected to torture while detained in both the central prison and the Mikonga military training facility.\nSecond Congo War.\nThe eruption of the Second Congo War in August 1998 plunged Kinshasa into a period of acute insecurity and military confrontation. The conflict was precipitated by a dramatic breakdown in relations between President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila and his former allies in Rwanda and Uganda. Kabila accused these states of undermining Congolese sovereignty and harboring ambitions to orchestrate a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". Allegations also surfaced that the United States had provided indirect support to Rwanda during this period, including claims of military training by the Rwanda Interagency Assessment Team (RIAT), ostensibly to secure access to the DRC's vast mineral wealth. American individuals and institutions, such as Roger Winter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, were further implicated in allegedly abetting insurgent activities. In response to these tensions, President Kabila dismissed Rwandan General James Kabarebe from his position as Chief of Staff and demanded the withdrawal of all Rwandan military personnel from Congolese territory. This move provoked a swift counteroffensive, as Rwanda and Uganda backed the formation of a new rebel group, the \"Rassemblement Congolais pour la D\u00e9mocratie\" (RCD), which launched its rebellion from the city of Goma on 2 August 1998. The insurrection was spearheaded by mutinous units within the Congolese armed forces in coordination with Rwandan, Ugandan, and Burundian troops. Within weeks, RCD forces had captured large swathes of territory in the eastern and northern parts of the country, including regions of North and South Kivu, Orientale Province, North Katanga, and \u00c9quateur Province. Their advance toward Kinshasa and the western province of Bas-Congo was halted by military intervention from Angola and Zimbabwe, both of which deployed troops in support of Kabila's government.\nThis escalation led to the effective partition of the DRC. Kabila's administration, reinforced by military contingents from Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad, and Sudan, retained authority over the western and central regions. Conversely, the eastern part of the country fell under the control of the RCD's military wing, the \"Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise\" (ANC), which was supported by Rwandan, Ugandan, and Burundian forces. In response, Kabila aligned with a range of non-state actors and militias, notably the Mayi-Mayi as well as Rwandan and Burundian Hutu rebel groups including the \"Forces pour la D\u00e9fense de la D\u00e9mocratie\" (FDD) and the \"Arm\u00e9e de Lib\u00e9ration du Rwanda\" (ALiR), the latter composed in part of former members of the Rwandan Armed Forces and the Interahamwe militia. Uganda, while occupying substantial portions of Orientale Province, simultaneously sponsored the establishment of the \"Mouvement pour la Lib\u00e9ration du Congo\" (MLC), under the leadership of Jean-Pierre Bemba, to administer the Ugandan-controlled regions of \u00c9quateur. Diverging strategic interests between Uganda and Rwanda eventually led to a split within the RCD itself, giving rise to two rival factions: the Rwanda-aligned RCD\u2013Goma and the Uganda-supported RCD\u2013ML. Despite their military superiority, these rebel coalitions faced persistent challenges in exerting full administrative and security control over rural areas, where they were met with sustained resistance from local militias, interethnic hostility, and community mistrust.\nArmed confrontation and urban warfare.\nBy late August 1998, Kinshasa became the theater of direct armed confrontation. Forces of the ANC, RPA, and UPDF clashed with troops from FAC and the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) for control of the capital. The ZDF employed heavy artillery to bombard densely populated neighborhoods, including Kimbanseke, Masina, Ndjili, and the village of Kingatoko, located near the border of Bas-Congo Province. These attacks resulted in the deaths of approximately 50 civilians and left 282 wounded, who were admitted to medical facilities across the capital during the night of 27 to 28 August. The shelling campaign led to mass displacement, as residents fled to safer parts of the city. The ZDF's indiscriminate use of heavy weapons failed to differentiate between military and civilian targets, striking hospitals, religious buildings, and other non-combatant infrastructure. In some instances, Congolese military authorities exacerbated civilian casualties by ordering residents to remain in their homes, thereby preventing rebel fighters from taking shelter in abandoned buildings and leaving civilians exposed to sustained bombardment.\nDuring the same period, humanitarian workers became direct victims of violence. On 28 August 1998, in Mont-Ngafula, FAC soldiers brutally killed two Red Cross volunteers, one by crushing his skull, as they attempted to rescue victims in the Mitendi and Mbenseke areas. The incident left several others severely wounded. Rebel forces further escalated the crisis by targeting strategic infrastructure. On 13 August 1998, troops from the ANC, RPA, and UPDF seized the Inga hydroelectric power station in Bas-Congo Province, halting its turbines for three weeks. This act deprived Kinshasa and parts of Bas-Congo of electricity and water, critically affecting essential services such as hospitals. As a result, mortality rates, particularly among children, increased markedly in medical facilities.\nSystematic human rights violations, authoritarian repression, and crackdowns on Cabindan separatists.\nFrom the onset of the conflict, Congolese security forces were implicated in widespread human rights abuses, including extrajudicial executions, torture, rape, and arbitrary detentions. Political opponents and ordinary civilians alike were subject to these violations with near-total impunity. Between August 1998 and January 2001, approximately 50 incident reports were submitted to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms, including the Working Groups on arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances, and the Special Rapporteurs on torture and extrajudicial killings.\nParticularly severe abuses were inflicted on members of opposition political parties such as the UDPS and PALU. Victims were often detained in notorious facilities such as the \"Police d'intervention rapide\" (PIR), the \"Direction des renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et services sp\u00e9ciaux\" (DRGS, also known as Kin Mazi\u00e8re), the IPKIN (ex-Circo), and the Kokolo military camp. These sites became centers for torture, sexual violence, and in some cases, extrajudicial execution. A significant crackdown occurred on 28 October 2000, when President Kabila's security services arrested at least 93 individuals, including 60 soldiers and 33 civilians from North Kivu, South Kivu, and Maniema, on accusations of plotting a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" involving Anselme Masasu Nindaga, a founding member of the AFDL. While some detainees were summarily executed or tortured to death, others were held for over three years and released only after a government-issued general amnesty.\nAs part of its military alliance with Angola, the Kinshasa government also acted against members of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC), a separatist movement advocating independence for the Angolan province of Cabinda. Between 1998 and 1999, the DRC's security forces shuttered FLEC offices in Kinshasa and arrested numerous Cabindan militants. Many of those detained were reportedly tortured; others were forcibly transferred to Angola or remain missing to this day.\nJoseph Kabila's rise to power and the shift in the conflict.\nFollowing the assassination of President Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila on 16 January 2001, the Democratic Republic of the Congo entered a new phase in the protracted national crisis. His son and successor, Joseph Kabila, was swiftly installed as president and sought to redirect the country's trajectory through diplomacy and political dialogue. Central to his early agenda was the de-escalation of armed conflict and the promotion of national reconciliation, particularly through the organization of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue (ICD). This initiative aimed to convene representatives from the government, rebel movements, political opposition, and civil society in a comprehensive peace process. In March 2001, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) deployed personnel to key conflict zones to oversee compliance with the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. However, despite these peacebuilding measures, violence persisted, especially in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu. The region remained mired in conflict involving various armed factions, including the Mayi-Mayi militias, the FDD, the ALiR, and the ANC.\nThe formal opening of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue took place on 25 February 2002 in Sun City, South Africa. A preliminary power-sharing accord was reached on 19 April 2002 between President Joseph Kabila and Jean-Pierre Bemba. While the agreement marked progress, it was met with resistance from RCD-Goma and influential opposition parties, notably the UDPS. A significant diplomatic breakthrough occurred on 30 July 2002, when the governments of Rwanda and the DRC signed a peace agreement in Pretoria. Under its terms, Rwanda agreed to withdraw its troops from Congolese territory in return for the disarmament and repatriation of Hutu militias, including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). A parallel agreement was signed with Uganda in Luanda on 6 September 2002, outlining a withdrawal plan for Ugandan forces and aiming to restore stability in the war-torn Ituri Province. By the end of that year, the disengagement of foreign military forces had begun, with troops from Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Namibia initiating their withdrawal. The culmination of these efforts was the signing of the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement in Pretoria on 17 December 2002. The accord laid the foundation for a transitional power-sharing government and the integration of former belligerents into a unified national army. Despite its ambitions, the peace process remained vulnerable to setbacks. On 1 April 2003, delegates at the Inter-Congolese Dialogue ratified the agreement in Sun City, accompanied by a memorandum detailing transitional governance structures and the integration of armed groups. On 30 June 2003, transitional institutions were formally inaugurated, marking a tentative step toward political stabilization.\nNevertheless, President Joseph Kabila, who remained in power until 2019, faced persistent opposition in Kinshasa. His controversial victory in the 2006 presidential election triggered widespread unrest in the capital, prompting the deployment of European Union forces to support the MONUC in maintaining order. Further unrest emerged in 2016 when the Independent National Electoral Commission announced a two-year delay in holding new presidential elections. The decision ignited mass demonstrations in September and December of that year, characterized by street barricades, violent clashes, and a significant civilian death toll. Schools and businesses across Kinshasa were shuttered amid the turmoil.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nKinshasa is strategically situated on the southern bank of the expansive Malebo Pool, spanning 9,965 square kilometers, configured in a grand crescent shape atop a low-lying, flat terrain with an average elevation hovering around 300 meters. Positioned between latitudes 4\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 and longitudinal coordinates 15\u00b0 to 16\u00b032 east, Kinshasa is flanked by the provinces of Mai-Ndombe, Kwilu, and Kwango to the east, while the Congo River delineates its western and northern boundaries, naturally demarcating the border with the Republic of the Congo. To the south, it is demarcated by the Kongo Central Province.\nThe Congo River is the second longest river in Africa after the Nile and has the continent's greatest discharge. As a waterway it provides a means of transport for much of the Congo Basin; it is navigable for river barges between Kinshasa and Kisangani; many of its tributaries are also navigable. The river is an important source of hydroelectric power, and downstream from Kinshasa it has the potential to generate power equivalent to the usage of roughly half of Africa's population.\nRelief.\nTopographically, Kinshasa has a marshy, alluvial plain, with altitudes ranging from 275 to 300 meters, along with hilly terrain that elevates from 310 to 370 meters. The city has four principal features: the Malebo Pool, a vast expanse of water with islands and islets; the Kinshasa Plain, which is a highly urbanizable space, but susceptible to drainage issues; the Terrace, which is a series of low ridges overlooking the plain; and the Hills Area, which is characterized by deep valleys and cirque-shaped formations.\nThe Malebo Pool spans over 35 kilometers in length and 25 kilometers in width and is encircled by Ngaliema commune to the west and Maluku to the east, traversing through Gombe, Barumbu, Limete, Masina, and Nsele communes. The Kinshasa Plain has a banana-like shape and is surrounded by eastward-oriented hills. Comprising mainly sandy alluvial deposits, this plain covers an area of about 20,000 hectares and hosts some of the city's most densely populated and urbanized communes, such as Limete, Kalamu, Bandalungwa, Ngiri-Ngiri, Kinshasa, Barumbu, and Lingwala. Despite its urban potential, the plain is highly vulnerable to seasonal flooding and waterlogging due to inadequate drainage infrastructure, with recurrent inundation occurring during the rainy season.\nThe Terrace is mainly situated in the city's western expanse, between N'djili and Mont-Ngafula. It comprises stony blocks of soft sandstone and silica-covered yellow clay, topped with brown silt, and ranges from 10 to 25 meters in height. It retains vestiges of an ancient surface. The Hills Area commences several kilometers from the Malebo Pool and is characterized by deep valleys and cirque-shaped formations. These hills reach heights surpassing 700 meters and exhibit gentle, rounded contours sculpted by local rivers. While their eastern counterparts may reflect remnants of the Bat\u00e9k\u00e9 Plateau, their origins in the west and south remain enigmatic. This region forms a natural amphitheater shaped by river erosion processes, which have been exacerbated by anthropogenic activities, often resulting in significant environmental degradation. Communes located within or adjacent to these hilly areas include Mont-Ngafula, Bumbu, Selembao, Kisenso, and Ngaliema. In addition, Makala and Ngaba, although partially located within the plains, gradually ascend into the adjacent highlands.\nHydrography.\nKinshasa's hydrographic landscape is defined by an intricate and predominantly dendritic network of rivers and valleys that converge toward the Pool Malebo on the Congo River. This fluvial system, which predominantly flows from the southern and southwestern highlands toward the north and northeast, is shaped by the region's topographical gradient and its underlying lithological structure. The city's current hydrological dynamics are the cumulative result of long-term tectonic shifts, sedimentary processes, and climatic variability that have defined the development of river systems over geological time scales.\nThe hydrographic system is composed of two main categories of rivers: allochthonous (originating outside the city) and autochthonous (local or internal to the city). The allochthonous rivers, which include the N'djili, N'sele, and the Pool Malebo, form the city's eastern and northern boundaries. These rivers have their sources far beyond the city's southern hills and generally flow in a south-to-north direction. The N'djili River, in particular, is prone to recurrent seasonal flooding in its lower reaches, frequently disrupting critical infrastructure. In contrast, the autochthonous rivers, such as the Funa, Lukunga, Bombo, Mai-Ndombe, and Mbale, are generated from localized watersheds scattered throughout the urban area. These rivers often carve deeply incised valleys, especially in the elevated southern regions. The Funa River is commonly but inaccurately referred to as the Kalamu, a misnomer derived from the Teke-Humbu term for \"watercourse\".\nGeomorphology.\nThe current hydrographic network overlays an ancient system, likely dating back to the Tertiary period, which originally drained from south to north but was subsequently modified by tectonic deformation following the late Cretaceous peneplanation. These geodynamic changes reoriented some rivers east-west in the eastern parts of the Congo Basin and west-east in the west. Traces of this paleonetwork persist in the form of broad, flat-bottomed valleys known as \"dambos\" or \"dembos\", which emerged during the Holocene epoch. Characterized by diffuse channels and lacking pronounced riverbeds, these depressions often remain waterlogged throughout the year due to the persistent upwelling of the groundwater table. In recent centuries, however, increased hydrological stress, marked by heightened peak runoff, has induced the incision of more distinct channels within these formerly marshy landscapes. This hydrological transformation is evidenced by a marked rise in surface runoff and a reduction in infiltration retention, resulting in flashier hydrographs, more frequent flood events, and accelerated erosional processes. Recent studies estimate Kinshasa's runoff coefficient has increased to approximately 13%, a stark contrast to the near-zero levels before urban expansion and land-use change.\nAquifers and water table.\nClosely connected to the surface drainage network are the city's groundwater systems, particularly the perched aquifers found in its permeable sandstone substratum. These aquifers, often extending beyond the limits of their corresponding surface catchments, are sustained by deep percolation facilitated by the sandy and porous characteristics of the regional soils. During the dry season, rivers are primarily fed by these underground aquifers, which are recharged during the rainy season. Early seasonal rains are absorbed into the soil and do not contribute to surface runoff until the retention threshold is surpassed, at which point excess water seeps downward to replenish groundwater reserves. The region's high soil permeability also facilitates the formation of erosion cirques, particularly on steep slopes where groundwater undercutting and concentrated surface runoff progressively destabilize hillsides, often culminating in landslides. These geomorphic hazards have become increasingly pronounced in Kinshasa's rapidly urbanizing fringe zones, where informal settlement expansion, deforestation, and inadequate land-use planning intensify environmental vulnerability.\nSoil and geology.\nThe soils of Kinshasa predominantly belong to the Arenoferrasol classification, characterized by fine-textured sands with clay content typically below 20%, low organic matter, and saturated absorbent complexes. These soils exhibit a strong acidity and are chemically deficient. Despite their limited nutrient availability, they experience regular rainfall for approximately eight to nine months annually, resulting in significant leaching and intense hydrolysis of soil minerals. This extended exposure to precipitation adversely affects soil fertility and agricultural potential.\nGeologically, Kinshasa rests on a Precambrian basement complex, composed predominantly of finely stratified red sandstone often containing feldspar minerals. These geological formations are prominently visible at the base of the rapids near Mount Ngaliema and to the south of the N'djili River, where they display considerable resistance to erosion.\nThe region's diverse geological substrata have a notable impact on local soil composition. Schisto-limestone formations, along with older lithologies associated with the West-Congolian Orogeny, give rise to yellow, clay-rich soils that are largely sterile, exhibiting low permeability directly correlated with their sand content. Conversely, schist-sandstone and clay-limestone substrates produce yellow to light brown clayey sands. Although these soils demonstrate slightly improved permeability, they still possess low fertility and minimal agricultural utility. Fertile soils are primarily located within alluvial and colluvial deposits, where sediment accumulation enhances nutrient content and moisture retention.\nIn elevated terrains and along the slopes of deeply incised valleys, hydric erosion actively reshapes the schist-sandstone relief and ancient massifs. In these areas, soils are predominantly grayish sandy or clay-sandy in texture. In lower-lying regions, a distinctive local material known as \"Lemba\" sand is prevalent, although certain pockets of clay-sandy soils yield improved crop outcomes.\nVegetation.\nKinshasa's vegetation consists of gallery forests, savannas, and semi-aquatic to aquatic plant communities, particularly within the valleys surrounding the Pool Malebo. The hilly zones of the region were originally dominated by grassland species, notably \"Loudetia demeusei\" and \"Schizachyrium semiberbe\", which are characteristic tufted hemicryptophytes. However, the natural vegetation has undergone substantial transformation due to anthropogenic influences, most notably urban sprawl. As the city expanded, inhabitants introduced a range of fruit-bearing trees and ornamental plants, often cultivated as living hedges.\nThe gallery forests, typically aligned along principal watercourses and occupying humid valleys associated with the Guineo-Congolese ombrophile-type, have experienced progressive degradation. These once-continuous forest belts have been reduced to fragmented pre-forest fallows, consisting of secondary growths of varying maturity and structure. Historical vegetation mapping reveals that Kinshasa's forest cover declined significantly over the latter half of the 20th century: from 46% in 1960 to 36% in 1982, and plummeting further to just 15% by 1987. In parallel, the coverage of forest\u2013savanna mosaics and terrestrial grassland formations expanded, rising from 48% in 1960 to 56% in 1982, and reaching 64% by 1987. In contrast, areas dominated by aquatic and swamp vegetation remained relatively stable throughout this period.\nResidential and commercial areas.\nKinshasa is a city of sharp contrasts, with affluent residential and commercial areas and three universities alongside sprawling slums. The older and wealthier part of the city (\"ville basse\") is located on a flat area of alluvial sand and clay near the river, while many newer areas are found on the eroding red soil of surrounding hills. Older parts of the city were laid out on a geometric pattern, with \"de facto\" racial segregation becoming \"de jure\" in 1929 as the European and African neighborhoods grew closer together. City plans of the 1920s\u20131950s featured a \"cordon sanitaire\" or buffer between the white and black neighborhoods, which included the central market as well as parks and gardens for Europeans.\nUrban planning in post-independence Kinshasa has been limited. The \"Mission Fran\u00e7aise d'Urbanisme\" drew up some plans in the 1960s which envisioned a greater role for automobile transportation but did not predict the city's significant population growth. Thus much of the urban structure has developed without guidance from a master plan. According to UN-Habitat, the city is expanding by eight square kilometers per year. It describes many of the new neighborhoods as slums, built in unsafe conditions with inadequate infrastructure. Nevertheless, spontaneously developed areas have in many cases extended the grid street plan of the original city.\nAdministrative divisions.\nKinshasa is both a city (\"ville\" in French) and a province, one of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nevertheless, it has city subdivisions and is divided into 24 communes (municipalities), which in turn are divided into 369 quarters and 21 embedded groupings. Maluku, the rural commune to the east of the urban area, accounts for 79% of the total land area of the city-province, with a population of 200,000\u2013300,000. The communes are grouped into four districts which are not in themselves administrative divisions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Kinshasa has a tropical wet and dry climate (\"Aw\"). Its lengthy rainy season spans from October through May, with a relatively short dry season, between June and September. Kinshasa lies south of the equator, so its dry season begins around its winter solstice, which is in June. This is in contrast to African cities further north featuring this climate where the dry season typically begins around December. Kinshasa's dry season is slightly cooler than its wet season, though temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year.\nParks and gardens.\nKinshasa is home to a diverse range of parks and gardens:\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\nKinshasa is the most populous city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with its metropolitan area estimated to host approximately 17.8 million people as of mid-2025. It ranks as the most densely populated city within the DRC, the third-largest metropolitan area in Africa, and the fourth-most populous capital city globally.\nSince the early 20th century, Kinshasa has experienced substantial demographic growth, influenced by urban migration, natural population increase, and various political crises. In 1889, the population of Kinshasa was recorded at a mere 5,000. By 1910, this figure had doubled to 10,000, and by 1930, it escalated to 39,530, driven by an annual increase of approximately 4,700 residents. Between 1935 and 1945, the annual growth rate increased from 1.1% to 1.5%, largely attributable to economic revitalization efforts associated with World War II, which necessitated significant labor forces to support wartime industries mandated by the colonial administration. During the 1940s, the city's population surged from 50,000 to over 200,000. By 1960, coinciding with Congo's independence, Kinshasa expanded to cover 5,500 hectares and approximately 400,000 residents were recorded. Following independence, the city experienced heightened rural-to-urban migration, population displacement due to armed conflicts, and a natural annual population increase of 3.8%. The national census of 1984 recorded 2.6 million residents, while estimates for 2005 varied between 5.3 million and 7.3 million. By 2015, the population approached 12 million, placing Kinshasa among the world's largest metropolises.\nAccording to United Nations Human Settlements Programme, the city receives an average of 390,000 new migrants annually, many fleeing conflict or economic hardship. Projections anticipate that Kinshasa's metropolitan population will reach 35 million by 2050, 58 million by 2075, and 83 million by 2100, making it one of the largest projected urban areas on the planet.\nNative population and other ethnic groups.\nOther groups closely linked to Kinshasa's early history include the Yaka, Banunu, and Bayanzi, primarily from Kongo Central. These populations were active in river-based trade and had longstanding ties to Pool Malebo before colonization.\nInternal and international migration, and urbanization.\nThe city's rapid urbanization has been driven largely by internal migration. Beginning during the colonial era and intensifying after independence in 1960, waves of Congolese from various provinces moved to Kinshasa in search of economic opportunity, political stability, and access to education and services. This demographic surge was channeled through two principal corridors: a river route from northern and central Congo and a road route through Bandundu and Kongo Central. The migration intensified during times of national crisis, especially during political upheavals in the 1990s and protracted conflicts in eastern DRC, which transformed Kinshasa into a refuge for displaced populations from across the country. \nBeyond domestic migrations, Kinshasa has historically exerted a centripetal pull on transnational populations from across the African continent and beyond. The Lari, from the Republic of the Congo, settled on fertile vacant lands and introduced new agricultural practices, including vegetable gardening. Equally salient was the arrival of the \"Coastmen\", or \"Ndingari\", a term for West African migrants from present-day Nigeria, Ghana, Mali, Senegal, Benin, Guinea, and Togo. Predominantly Muslim, they were active in commerce, public works, and artisanal trades. They also influenced the city's cultural makeup by introducing wax-printed textiles and socio-familial practices including polygamy. Among the most demographically and culturally prominent expatriate communities are the Zombo, originally from Maquela do Zombo in Angola's U\u00edge Province. As the most populous foreign African demographic in Kinshasa, the Zombo initially migrated as traders and laborers. From the 1950s onward, they were extensively conscripted to work at the port of CITAS (\"Compagnie Industrielle et de Transport au Stanley Pool\"), where their primary responsibilities included the handling and conveyance of colonial commodities such as palm derivatives, copal resin, cotton, and ivory.\nThe Zombo became known for their physical endurance and work ethic, making them ideal laborers in the eyes of colonial authorities. Outside the workplace, they introduced door-to-door commerce in indigenous neighborhoods, selling rice, doughnuts, and beans, a practice that evolved into mobile street vending using handmade carts (\"pousse-pousse\"). Their numbers escalated markedly during World War II, spurred by both economic incentives in the Belgian Congo and repressive governance in Angola under Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar. The authoritarian policies of the \"Estado Novo\" regime, particularly the brutal enforcement tactics of the PIDE (\"Portuguese secret police\"), pushed many Angolans to seek refuge in Kinshasa. Belgian colonial authorities, constrained by porous borders and entrenched kinship networks among the Bakongo across both nations, were largely ineffectual in stemming this migratory tide.\nIn contrast to other diasporic groups, the Zombo exhibited a pronounced tendency toward permanent settlement and integration. Avoiding repatriation, they raised successive generations in Kinshasa, where they assimilated both culturally and linguistically. Youths often enlisted in the \"Force Publique\", while their elders gained renown for frugality, temperance, and entrepreneurial self-sufficiency. Over time, many transitioned into artisanal vocations and small-scale manufacturing, introducing innovations such as handcrafted women's footwear fashioned from repurposed automobile tires.\nLanguage.\nThe official language is French (See: Kinshasa French vocabulary). Kinshasa is the largest officially Francophone city in the world, though many residents struggle to speak it. Although Lingala is widely used as a spoken national language, French is the language of street signs, posters, newspapers, government documents, schools; it dominates plays, television, and the press, and it is used in vertical relationships among people of different social classes. People of the same class, however, speak the Congolese languages (Kikongo, Lingala, Tshiluba or Swahili) among themselves. Kinshasa hosted the 14th Francophonie Summit in October 2012.\nGovernment and politics.\nAdministrative history.\nFounded on 1 August 1881, as L\u00e9opold II's Station, Kinshasa has maintained a distinct administrative status over time, eventually becoming the administrative center for the Stanley Pool District, Haute-N'sele, and Panzi-Kasa\u00ef. A Royal Decree promulgated on 11 April 1914 instituted a territorial reform in the Belgian Congo, reaffirming Kinshasa's dual role as the colonial capital and the central administrative seat for the districts of Bas-Congo, Kwango, Kasa\u00ef, Sankuru, and L\u00e9opoldville. In 1941, Legislative Ordinance No. 293/AIMO of 25 June granted Kinshasa official city status and established an Urban Committee. Following Congolese independence, the colonial charter was replaced by the Fundamental Law of 19 May 1960, which designated Kinshasa as a neutral city and the political seat of national institutions. This legal evolution culminated in Ordinance No. 68/024 of 20 January 1968, which granted Kinshasa the same politico-administrative status comparable to that of the provinces, thus expanding its communal subdivisions from 11 to 24. The advent of the Third Republic, as codified in the 2006 Constitution, officially institutionalized Kinshasa as a fully-fledged province.\nPolitical organization.\nPursuant to Article 2 of Law No. 08/012 of 31 July 2008, a province is defined as a political and administrative component of the national territory endowed with legal personality and managerial autonomy over its human, economic, financial, and technical resources. Kinshasa exercises its constitutional mandates through two principal organs: the Provincial Assembly and the Provincial Government.\nProvincial Assembly.\nAccording to Article 7 of the same law, the Provincial Assembly serves as the city's legislative body. Its core prerogatives include enacting laws (by way of edicts), electing the provincial governor and vice-governor, and overseeing the provincial government. Comprising 48 deputies elected by universal suffrage, the Assembly is administratively structured with a Bureau composed of a President, Vice-President, , Rapporteur, and Deputy Rapporteur. The Assembly's legislative authority and procedural framework are outlined in Articles 11, 12, and 13 of Organic Law No. 08/016 from 7 October 2008, which governs decentralized territorial entities.\nProvincial government and public services.\nThe provincial executive branch is constituted by the Governor, the Vice-Governor, and a cabinet of provincial ministers. The operation of the Kinshasa provincial government, like those of other provinces, is based on the provisions of Law No. 08/012 of 7 October 2008. Ministerial portfolios are regulated by \"Arr\u00eat\u00e9\" No. SC/0121/BGV/2007 of 30 July 2007, which specifies the jurisdiction of each provincial ministry. The Provincial Director, serving as the Governor's principal administrative advisor, oversees the coordination of fifty departmental directorates and inspectorates. These entities function as provincial extensions of national ministries, entrusted with the territorial execution of state policies and regulatory directives.\nSince 2008, the Kinshasa provincial government has established several technical public services, collectively known as \"urban r\u00e9gies\" to improve administrative effectiveness and city management. These services operate under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Kinshasa. The principal entities include:\nCommunal and neighborhood.\nThe 24 communes are recognized as administrative subdivisions of the city, each further divided into smaller entities known as \"quartiers\" (neighborhoods). As decentralized territorial entities (\"entit\u00e9s territoriales d\u00e9centralis\u00e9es\", ETD), the communes are endowed with legal personality and administrative autonomy. Each commune operates through two main governing bodies: the \"Conseil Communal\" (Communal Council) and the \"Coll\u00e8ge Ex\u00e9cutif Communal\" (Communal Executive College).\nEvery commune is managed by a \"Bourgmestre\" and their Deputy, and each is provisioned with public services such as civil registry (\"\u00c9tat civil\"), sanitation, and general population services. These are supported by technical services representing central ministries, made available to municipal authorities to enable the exercise of devolved functions. These technical services include urban planning and development, rural infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and livestock, public health, education, environmental protection, alternative energy, finance, budget, demographic statistics, and more. Additionally, specialized branches such as the Agence Nationale de Renseignements (ANR), the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Migration (DGM), and the Commissariat Communal of the Congolese National Police maintain a presence at the communal level.\nNeighborhoods (\"quartiers\") function as subunits of the communes. As of 2015, the 24 communes of Kinshasa are divided into approximately 310 neighborhoods. These \"quartiers\" vary in structure depending on whether they fall within formally planned urban zones or more informally developed areas. Popular semi-urban neighborhoods often exceed the size of planned residential districts and represent the core of the city's urban makeup. Each neighborhood is administered through a simplified structure that includes the \"chef de quartier\" (neighborhood chief), the \"chef de quartier adjoint\" (deputy), the \"secr\u00e9taire du quartier\" (secretary), the \"charg\u00e9 de la population\" (population officer), and two to three agents \"recenseurs\" (enumerators). These officials are appointed by the Governor of Kinshasa and assigned to their respective territories. In highly populated semi-urban neighborhoods, administrative overload is common due to insufficient infrastructure for public health, urban roads, potable water, and electricity, resources that remain concentrated in lower-density, affluent residential areas.\nPolitics.\nAs of 2015, the Mouvement de Lib\u00e9ration du Congo (MLC) held legislative predominance; however, the provincial elections of 20 December 2023 resulted in a power shift in favor of the presidential coalition, the Union Sacr\u00e9e de la Nation (USN), led by President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi's Union pour la D\u00e9mocratie et le Progr\u00e8s Social (UDPS), which secured 14 seats. Daniel Bumba assumed the governorship on 21 June 2024. Kinshasa wields sovereign powers, encompassing the authority to issue passports and to act on behalf of the country in international forums. The city also hosts the headquarters of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), formerly known as MONUC. In 2016, the United Nations bolstered its peacekeeping presence in Kinshasa in response to civil unrest related to President Joseph Kabila's controversial extension of power.\nIn addition to state institutions, international and non-governmental organizations exert significant influence on local development and governance. The Belgian development agency, Enabel, has been a key actor since 2016 through its sponsorship of the Programme d'Appui aux Initiatives de D\u00e9veloppement Communautaire (PAIDECO), a \u20ac6 million initiative aimed at stimulating economic development in the region. The initial implementation took place in Kimbanseke, a densely populated hill commune with an estimated population of nearly one million. In a strategic effort to address urban overcrowding and stimulate regional development, the provincial government established the \"Comit\u00e9 Strat\u00e9gique pour la Supervision du Projet d'Extension de la Ville de Kinshasa\" (CSSPEVK) in October 2023. The committee, under the leadership of a provincial coordinator, was tasked with overseeing the \"Kinshasa Kia Mona\" urban expansion project in the Maluku district.\nEconomy.\nHistorically, Kinshasa experienced a period of robust economic growth driven predominantly by a flourishing industrial sector. During its economic peak, often nostalgically referred to as \"la belle \u00e9poque, the city's industrial activities spanned diverse domains including food processing, textiles, metallurgy, and assembly-line production. These industries produced goods for domestic consumption and international export. It was during this era that Kinshasa earned the affectionate monikers Kin la belle, Kin-Kiese, and Kin la joie\". By the 1970s, Kinshasa had become a critical economic hub in Zaire, employing approximately 25% of the country's salaried workforce and accounting for nearly half (50%) of the national wage bill. Surveys conducted between 1974 and 1977 indicated that 33.7% of Kinshasa's working population held positions as executives or skilled laborers, with respective shares of 6.5% and 27.2%. In terms of industrial concentration, Kinshasa in 1977 accounted for 49.9% of the country's manufactured industries. It ranked second in secondary sector activity with 18%, following Katanga, which held 67.3%. In the tertiary sector, Kinshasa ranked first with 27.3%, followed by Katanga at 22%. The city also hosted 22.8% of all registered businesses nationwide, compared to 18% in Katanga. By 1980, an estimated 412,000 people were in stable employment, supporting an average household of six. However, by the 1990s, inflation and economic deterioration significantly diminished purchasing power. Studies revealed that by 1988, only 20% of workers could meet basic living costs on their wages, and by 1990, Kinshasa had become more expensive to live in than other interior cities of the country. In 1977, wages could cover 62% of basic needs and 51% of family needs; these figures declined steeply in the subsequent decades.\nThe 1990s marked a particularly devastating decade for Kinshasa's economy, beginning with waves of looting in 1991 and 1992. These events inflicted severe damage on the city's economic infrastructure. In the aftermath of these upheavals, an estimated 300,000 executives and skilled workers lost their jobs, with no prospect of compensation. According to the Agence Nationale des Entrepreneurs du Za\u00efre (ANEZA), Kinshasa lost approximately 100,000 jobs during this period. Subsequent years of political instability and warfare further paralyzed the city's already weakened economic sectors. Since then, industrial activity in Kinshasa has largely stagnated or been dismantled altogether. The city's rapidly expanding population, combined with a shortage of economic reintegration mechanisms for unemployed graduates from technical and tertiary institutions, has worsened the unemployment crisis. The dismantling of the industrial sector has been significant, with much of the wage-earning population absorbed into the informal sector. This informal economy has now become the city's primary employment source, engaging nearly 70% of Kinshasa's total labor force.\nMining sector and export growth.\nIn 2022, Kinshasa's GDP exceeded initial expectations by expanding 8.5%, as reported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The mining industry in the DRC has been instrumental in maintaining a positive economic outlook, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Raw material exports, particularly cobalt and copper, have experienced historically high prices, resulting in substantial investment in the industry. Parenthetically, production has increased, and Covid-related restrictions have eased, leading to sustained economic growth.\nFiscal performance and debt sustainability.\nDespite facing external challenges, including the repercussions of the Russo-Ukrainian War, the DRC has shown fiscal stability. In 2022, tax performance exceeded projections, showcasing improved revenue generation. However, increased expenditures related to security concerns and internal arrears resulted in a deterioration of the overall budget balance. Nevertheless, the DRC's debt risk remains moderate, with public debt at 24.7% of GDP. The approval of the third review of the IMF program reflects the satisfactory performance of the country's reform efforts.\nCompanies, foreign exchange reserves, international support.\nBig manufacturing companies such as Marsavco S.A., All Pack Industries and Angel Cosmetics are located in the center of town (Gombe) in Kinshasa.\nThere are many other industries, such as Trust Merchant Bank, located in the heart of the city. Food processing is a major industry, and construction and other service industries also play a significant role in the economy.\nAlthough home to only 13% of the DRC's population, Kinshasa accounts for 85% of the Congolese economy as measured by gross domestic product. A 2004 investigation found 70% of inhabitants employed informally, 17% in the public sector, 9% in the formal private sector, and 3% other, of a total 976,000 workers. Most new jobs are classified as informal. By the end of 2022, Kinshasa's foreign exchange reserves had seen a significant improvement, soaring past $4.5 billion. The DRC benefits from support and partnerships with several global organizations and financial institutions, including the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, European Union, China and France.\nThe People's Republic of China has been heavily involved in the Congo since the 1970s, when they financed the construction of the Palais du Peuple and backed the government against rebels in the Shaba war. In 2007\u20132008 China and Congo signed an agreement for an $8.5\u00a0billion loan for infrastructure development. Chinese entrepreneurs are gaining an increasing share of local marketplaces in Kinshasa, displacing in the process formerly successful Congolese, West African, Indian, and Lebanese merchants.\nMean household spending in 2005 was the equivalent of US$2,150, amounting to $1 per day per person. The median household spending was $1,555, 66 cents per person per day. Among the poor, more than half of this spending goes to food, especially bread and cereal.\nEducation.\nKinshasa is home to several education institutes, covering a wide range of disciplines, including civil engineering, nursing, and journalism. The city is also home to three large universities and an arts school:\nPrimary and secondary schools:\nThe education system in DRC is plagued by low coverage, low quality and poor educational infrastructure, especially in rural areas. According to USAID (2018), 3.5 million children of primary school age are out of school, and 44% of those who do attend school started only after age six. Various statistical estimates by UNESCO, (2013) regarding secondary and tertiary education also reveal the difficulties facing the country. In DRC it is difficult to get a reliable estimate on the actual proportion of the population who can read and write, however, according to data from UIS (2016), the literacy rate of the population of 15 years and older in the country, is estimated to 77.04%. This rate is 88.5% for men and 66.5% for women. There is also a shortage of reading material, and certainly no culture of reading for pleasure.\nHealth and medicine.\nThere are twenty hospitals in Kinshasa, plus various medical centers and polyclinics.\nCulture.\nLocated in Kinshasa are the National Museum and the Kinshasa Fine Arts Academy.\nKinshasa has a flourishing music scene which, since the 1960s, has operated under the patronage of the city's elite. The Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste, formed in 1994, began using improved musical instruments and has since grown in means and reputation.\nA pop culture ideal type in Kinshasa is the \"mikiliste\", a fashionable person with money who has traveled to Europe. Adrien Mombele, a.k.a. Stervos Niarcos, and musician Papa Wemba were early exemplars of the mikiliste style. La Sape, a linked cultural trend also described as dandyism, involves wearing flamboyant clothing.\nMany Kinois have a negative view of the city, expressing nostalgia for the rural way of life, and a stronger association with the Congolese nation than with Kinshasa.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship, which are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kinshasa (Catholic Church), Kimbanguist Church, Baptist Community of Congo (Baptist World Alliance), Baptist Community of the Congo River (Baptist World Alliance), The Salvation Army, Assemblies of God, Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo (Anglican Communion), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which has a temple and over 100 congregations in Kinshasa, Presbyterian Community in Congo (World Communion of Reformed Churches). There are also Muslim mosques. A Baha'i House of Worship is in construction. A Jewish synagogue, operated by the Chabad world movement, exists.https://\nMedia.\nKinshasa serves as the nation's principal media hub, hosting the largest concentration of media outlets in the country. The primary languages used in media production are French and Lingala, with other indigenous languages seldom appearing. Press freedom remains limited, with journalism subject to strict control and censorship. The 2023 Press Freedom Index rated the Democratic Republic of the Congo at 48.55%. State-run channels generally provide minimal political content, and restrictive regulations limit investigative journalism. In the early 2000s, especially during the political transition, Kinshasa's media scene grew rapidly. By 2004, the city had 23 radio stations and 26 TV stations, with the number of television broadcasters increasing dramatically to 63 by 2007.\nThese outlets are primarily commercial, religious, or community-based and are often affiliated, formally or informally, with political figures or parties. For instance, Numerica TV is owned by Kibambi Shintwa and Kabeya Pindi Pasi, both of whom were candidates in the 2006 parliamentary elections. Mirador TV is owned by Michel Ladi Luya, a former Member of Parliament and newspaper publisher. Digital Congo TV was co-founded by Croatian businessman Nicolas Vazonne and Jaynet Kabila, twin sister of then-President Joseph Kabila. Africa TV is associated with Azarias Ruberwa, a former vice president and 2006 presidential candidate, and Eug\u00e8ne Serufuli Ngayabaseka, the then-governor of North Kivu. CCTV (\"Canal Congo T\u00e9l\u00e9vision\") and Canal Kin are linked to Jean-Pierre Bemba. While many of these channels deny formal political affiliations, their ownership structures suggest otherwise. Not all stations are politically aligned. Neutral and independent outlets such as Antenne A and Congoweb TV contribute to a more balanced media environment. RTNC1 remains the primary public broadcaster with nationwide reach, while other widely viewed stations include RTGA (\"Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Groupe L'Avenir\"), Digital Congo TV, Mirador TV, Congoweb TV, and Antenne A.\nSeveral prominent national radio and television stations are headquartered in Kinshasa. The RTNC operates multiple channels, RTNC1, RTNC2, RTNC3, and RTNC4, providing news, cultural programming, and public service broadcasts. The UN-supported Radio Okapi, jointly managed with MONUSCO, is also based in the city and is widely regarded for its balanced reporting. Other notable broadcasters include Top Congo FM, RTGA, Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Message de Vie (RTMV), Raga FM, and Digital Congo FM. In addition to these, Kinshasa hosts a wide array of specialized and religious broadcasters, such as Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Arm\u00e9e de l'\u00c9ternel (RTAE), Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Sentinelle (RTS), Canal Chemin de V\u00e9rit\u00e9 et Vie (CVV), Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Catholique Elikya (RTCE), Radio Parole de l'\u00c9ternel (RPE), and Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9 Assembl\u00e9e Chr\u00e9tienne (RTACK). Community-based stations include Radio Shaloom Racha, Radio 7, Tam Tam Africain, Jo Dacosta FM, Afri Radio, and Mirador FM. International broadcasters such as the BBC (on 92.6 FM), Radio France Internationale (RFI), Africa Radio, China Radio International, and Euronews are also present and broadcast according to the editorial policies of their parent organizations.\nThe print and digital media sector is equally diverse, with the capital being home to the state-owned news agency \"Agence Congolaise de Presse\" (ACP) and a range of newspapers and online platforms. Among the most prominent publications are \"L'Avenir, L'Observateur\", \"Le Potentiel\", \"Le Phare\", \"Le Soft\", \"La Conscience\", and \"LeCongolais\".\nSports.\nSports, especially football and martial arts are popular in Kinshasa. The city is home to the country's national stadium, the Stade des Martyrs (Stadium of the Martyrs). The Vita Club, Daring Club Motema Pembe and AS Dragons frequently draws large crowds, enthusiastic and sometimes rowdy, to the Stade des Martyrs. Dojos are popular and their owners influential.\nIn 1974, Kinshasa hosted The Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, in which Ali defeated Foreman, to regain the World Heavyweight title.\nBuildings and institutions.\nKinshasa is home to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo including:\nThe Central Bank of the Congo has its headquarters on Boulevard Colonel Tshatshi, across the street from the Mausoleum of Laurent Kabila and the presidential palace.\nNotable features of the city include the Gecamines Commercial Building (formerly SOZACOM) and Hotel Memling; L'ONATRA, the building of the Ministry of Transport; the central market; the Limete Tower.\nInfrastructure and housing.\nThe city's infrastructure for running water and electricity is generally in bad shape. The electrical network is in disrepair to the extent that prolonged and periodic blackouts are normal, and exposed lines sometimes electrify pools of rainwater.\nRegideso, the national public company with primary responsibility for water supply in the Congo, serves Kinshasa only incompletely, and without uniform quality. Other areas are served by decentralized \"Associations des Usagers des R\u00e9seau d'Eau Potable\" (ASUREPs). Gombe uses water at a high rate (306 liters per day per inhabitant) compared to other communes (from 71 L/d/i in Kintambo down to 2 L/d/i in Kimbanseke).\nThe city is estimated to produce 6,300 m3 of trash and 1,300 m3 of industrial waste per day, with little to no capacity for disposal.\nThe housing market has seen rising prices and rents since the 1980s. Houses and apartments in the central area are expensive, with houses selling for a million dollars and apartments going for $5000 per month. High prices have spread outward from the central area as owners and renters move out of the most expensive part of the city. Gated communities and shopping malls, built with foreign capital and technical expertise, began to appear in 2006. Urban renewal projects have led in some cases to violent conflict and displacement. The high prices leave incoming refugees with few options for settlement besides illegal shantytowns such as Pakadjuma. The Cit\u00e9 du Fleuve, an upmarket residential development, has had significant delays.\nIn 2005, 55% of households had televisions and 43% had mobile phones. 11% had refrigerators and 5% had cars.\nTransport.\nThe city-province has 5000\u00a0km of roadways, 10% of which are paved. The Boulevard du 30 Juin (Boulevard of 30 June) links the main areas of the central district of the city. Other roads also converge on Gombe. The east\u2013west road network linking the more distant neighborhoods is weak and thus transit through much of the city is difficult. The quality of roads has improved somewhat, developed in part with loans from China, since 2000.\nThe public bus company for Kinshasa, created in 2003, is Transco (Transport au Congo). Kinshasa is the largest city in the world without a dedicated bus terminal for intercity services.\nSeveral companies operate registered taxis and taxi-buses, identifiable by their yellow color. \nIn addition, an app-based taxi hailing service was introduced in 2023.\nAir.\nThe city has two airports: N'djili Airport (FIH) is the main airport with connections to other African countries as well as to Istanbul, Brussels, Paris and some other destinations. N'Dolo Airport, located close to downtown, is used for domestic flights only with small turboprop aircraft. Several international airlines serve Ndjili Airport including Kenya Airways, South African Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Air France and Turkish Airlines. An average of ten international flights depart each day from N'djili Airport. A small number of airlines provide domestic service from Kinshasa, for example Congo Airways and CAA. Both offer scheduled flights from Kinshasa to a limited number of cities inside DR Congo.\nRail.\nThe Matadi\u2013Kinshasa Railway connects Kinshasa with Matadi, Congo's Atlantic port. The line reopened in September 2015 after around a decade without regular service. There is an intermittent service, with a poor safety record.\nAccording to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale des Transports et des Ports (SCTP), the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway (CFMK) has the highest transport of goods in import, 8 746 tonnes in January, 11,318 tonnes in February 10,032 tonnes in March, 7,244 tonnes in April, 5,024 tonnes in March and 7,745 tonnes in June. The monthly tonnage of exported goods reached only 1,000 tonnes in the month of March 2018. In January some 284 tonnes of goods were exported from the ports of Boma and Matadi, via the railway, and 711 tonnes in February, then 1,058 tonnes in March, 684 tonnes in April, 818 tonnes in May and 853 tonnes in June.\nThe monthly statistics for passenger traffic are as follows: 2,294 persons in January, 1,836 in February 2065 in March, 2,660 in April, 1,952 in May and 2,660 in June.\nThe line connecting the port of Matadi to Kinshasa is 366\u00a0km long. Its distance has been since 3111 of 3112 feet or 42 inches (lane capped 1,067 meter): This railway belongs, in fact, to the National Railway Company of the Congo (\"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale des chemins de fer du Congo\"; SNCC). It is only exploited by the SCTP, formerly ONATRA, according to an agreement signed by the two companies.\nThis line lost large shares of the market, following its lamentable state, insecurity on the rails (some trains are attacked), and the rehabilitation of the road along the rails in 2000. According to Congolese sources, an agreement with a Chinese construction company was signed in 2006, according to which this Chinese company will finance the renovation of the track, the rolling stock, the communication channels for the signaling, and the electrical power source. The ex-ONATRA has, in fact, opted for an aggressive commercial policy to revive the rails.\nOn 30 June 2018 the SCTP received two locomotives and 50 wagons from the African firm ARSS (African-Rolling Stock Solution).\nIn 2017, some 2.2 million tonnes of cement were produced by the two new start-up companies, PPC Barnet and Kongo Cement Factory (CIMKO). The SCTP did indeed transport part of this production to Kinshasa but the exact quantity was not communicated by the railway department of the company, the former DG Kimbembe Mazunga had communicated an agreed protocol of agreements with the cement manufacturers of Kongo-Central for the transport of their productions.\nExternal transport.\nKinshasa is the major river port of the Congo. The port, called 'Le Beach Ngobila' extends for about along the river, comprising scores of quays and jetties with hundreds of boats and barges tied up. Ferries cross the river to Brazzaville, a distance of about . River transport also connects to dozens of ports upstream, such as Kisangani and Bangui.\nThere are road and rail links to Matadi, the sea port in the Congo estuary from the Atlantic Ocean.\nThere are no rail links from Kinshasa further inland, and road connections to much of the rest of the country are few and in poor condition, although there has been a road built to the city of Kikwit (around 500\u00a0km away) that has been in operation since 2015 or so. It was recently extended to the small city of Tshikapa.\nSocial issues.\nCrime and punishment.\nSince the Second Congo War, the city has been striving to recover from disorder, with many youth gangs living and operating from Kinshasa's poorer areas. The U.S. State Department in 2010 informed travelers that Kinshasa and other major Congolese cities are generally safe for daytime travel, but to beware of robbers, especially in traffic jams and in areas near hotels and stores.\nSome sources say that Kinshasa is extremely dangerous, with one source giving a homicide rate of 112 per 100,000 people per year. Another source cites a homicide rate of 12.3 per 100,000. By some accounts, crime in Kinshasa is not so rampant, due to relatively good relations among residents and perhaps to the severity with which even petty crime is punished.\nWhile the military and National Police operate their own jails in Kinshasa, the main detention facility under the jurisdiction of the local courts is the Kinshasa Penitentiary and Re-education center in Makala. This prison houses much more than its nominal capacity of 1,000 inmates. In 2024, the population of Makala Prison was reported at 15,000.\nThe Congolese military intelligence organization, D\u00e9tection Militaire des Activit\u00e9s Anti-Patrie (DEMIAP) operates the Ouagadougou prison in Kintambo commune with notorious cruelty.\nStreet children.\nIn the 2010s, street children or \"Shegu\u00e9s\", often orphaned, are subject to abuse by the police and military. Of the estimated 20,000 children living on Kinshasa's streets, almost a quarter are beggars, some are street vendors and about a third have some kind of employment. Some have fled from physically abusive families, notably step-parents, others were expelled from their families as they were believed to be witches, and have become outcasts.\nStreet children are mainly boys, but the percentage of girls is increasing according to UNICEF. Ndako ya Biso provides support for street children, including overnight accommodation for girls. There are also second generation street children.\nThese children have been the object of considerable outside study.\nInternational relations.\nKinshasa is twinned with:\nIn popular culture.\nWith its mix of culture, history, and lively atmosphere, Kinshasa has become a focus for filmmakers, musicians, writers, and artists.\nCinematic and TV representations.\nKinshasa has been represented in various films, most notably in the film \"When We Were Kings\" (1996). This documentary chronicles the historic \"Rumble in the Jungle\" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, held in Kinshasa in 1974. The film showcases the electrifying atmosphere of the city during the momentous event.\nIn \"Viva Riva!\" (2010), directed by Djo Tunda Wa Munga, the film offers a gritty portrayal of the city's underworld, showing the tension between corruption, ambition, and survival.\nKinshasa's social complexities are explored in \"F\u00e9licit\u00e9\" (2017), directed by Alain Gomis. The film explores themes of pliability, community, and the power of music in the face of adversity. The film portrayed the essence of Kinshasa, depicting its vivacious music scene and the struggles faced by its inhabitants with sensitivity and authenticity.\nIn 2019, The Widow (TV series) was released on Amazon Prime and the UK's ITV network. The mini-series tells the story of a woman searching for her husband in Kinshasa, after believing he'd been killed in a plane crash.\nLiterary depictions.\nThroughout history, authors have depicted the essence of Kinshasa in their writing, delving into its diverse cultural fabric, storied past, and the personal narratives of its residents. Fiston Mwanza Mujila's \"Tram 83\" depicts the city's nightlife while exploring themes of postcolonial identity and the struggle for social and economic progress. Meanwhile, In Koli Jean Bofane's novel \"Congo Inc.: Bismarck's Testament\" the city serves as a microcosm of post-colonial Congo, exploring themes of globalization, political corruption, and environmental degradation.\nMusic and dance.\nThe music scene of Kinshasa has made a significant impact on popular culture, with Congolese rumba, born in both Kinshasa and Brazzaville in the 1920s\u20131930s, influencing audiences worldwide. Artists like Franco Luambo Makiadi, Syran Mbenza, Le Grand Kall\u00e9, Nico Kasanda, Tabu Ley Rochereau, M'bilia Bel, Madilu System, Papa No\u00ebl Nedule, Vicky Longomba, Awilo Longomba, P\u00e9p\u00e9 Kall\u00e9, Kanda Bongo Man, Nyboma Mwan'dido, General Defao, Papa Wemba, Koffi Olomide, Werrason, Abeti Masikini, Lokua Kanza, Fally Ipupa, and Ferr\u00e9 Gola have played a key role in popularizing Congolese music on the international stage, many of whom began their careers in Kinshasa. During the 1950s and 60s, the city became \"Africa's most energetic recording industry\", famously described by Gary Stewart in \"Rumba on the River\" as home to several Greek-owned studios where local artists could earn a living recording. As Congolese rumba gained strength at the heart of Congolese life, Congolese-owned studios began to flourish. In 1971, Mobutu Sese Seko enlisted OK Jazz to tour the nation in support of his \"Authenticit\u00e9\" campaign, which sought to elevate local culture above Western influences. However, this golden era was short-lived \u2014 Mobutu's authoritarian rule, combined with economic decline, falling copper prices, and high inflation, crippled Kinshasa's once-thriving music industry. Many recording companies relocated abroad, especially to France and Belgium, while smaller domestic bands struggled to survive. Nonetheless, Congolese music adapted creatively, most notably through \"kobwaka mabanga\", a \"name-dropping\" system where musicians earn income by mentioning patrons' names during performances, often accounting for most of their earnings.\nThe city itself has been repeatedly immortalized in song. Tabu Ley Rochereau's 1971 track \"Kinshasa\" and Franco's 1980 composition \"Kinshasa mboka ya makambo\" (\"Kinshasa, city of problems\") reflect pride and criticism, capturing the spirit and struggles of urban life. Cameroonian jazz saxophonist Manu Dibango echoed these themes in his track \"Twist \u00e0 L\u00e9o\" (1960s), depicting the city's youth dancing to global rhythms during the twilight of the colonial era. Following the upheavals of the 1990s, the city's music scene evolved dramatically: while some artists turned to Christian gospel, others revived indigenous traditions through the \"tradi-modern\" movement, led by bands like Sw\u00e9d\u00e9 Sw\u00e9d\u00e9 and supported by Belgian producer Vincent Kenis. This led to the acclaimed \"Congotronics\" album series, which introduced international audiences to groups like Konono N\u00ba1, Kasai Allstars, Staff Benda Bilili, and Mbongwana Star, who performed using handmade instruments and rudimentary amplification.\nContemporary projects have built on this momentum. In 2011, the DRC Music collective, curated by Damon Albarn, recorded the collaborative album \"Kinshasa One Two\" in just five days, bringing together over fifty Congolese musicians and international producers to celebrate the city's musical ingenuity. Among the featured artists was Jupiter Bokondji, whose band Okwess International has championed \"bofenia rock\", a genre drawing from Congo's immense ethnic and musical diversity. His albums, such as \"Hotel Univers\" and \"Kin Sonic\", incorporate Congolese rhythms, Western rock influences, and multilingual lyrics. The city has also become a site for international artistic exchange, as since 2009, the Royal Flemish Theatre in Brussels has organized the Connexion Kin arts festival in Limete, transforming it into a hub of cross-cultural collaboration between artists from Kinshasa and their European counterparts. A notable product of this initiative was the acclaimed 2014 performance \"Coup Fatal\", which combined Congolese guitar with classical opera, jazz, and contemporary choreography, earning praise at the Avignon Festival and in Brussels.\nIn 2011, Belgian-Congolese rapper and singer Baloji, who was born in Lubumbashi, returned to Kinshasa to record his album \"Kinshasa Succursale\". Blending Congolese rumba, hip-hop, funk, and experimental sounds, his style symbolizes a diasporic artists' reconnection with Kinshasa's musical roots while blending them with contemporary global influences.\nVisual arts and fashion.\nKinshasa's street art scene has gained recognition globally, with talented artists using their creations to express social and political messages. Murals and graffiti, adorned with colorful imagery, can be found throughout the city.\nLa Sape.\nThe La Sape subculture, characterized by extravagant and dapper fashion choices, has become an emblem of style, self-expression, and identity for the \"sapeurs\" of Kinshasa. It has gained international recognition through the lens of well-known photographers such as Daniele Tamagni. Tamagni's book \"Gentlemen of Bacongo\" (2009) showcases the impeccable style and distinct personalities of Kinshasa's \"sapeurs\", accentuating their taste in tailored suits, bold hues, and eye-catching accessories. The city serves as the epicenter of La Sape, with various neighborhoods, communes and districts hosting events like \"le concours\" or \"la f\u00eate\" where sapeurs can display their style. La Sape has also inspired popular music and cultural expressions in Kinshasa, with sapeurs often featured in Congolese music videos as symbols of refinement and sophistication. Musicians such as Papa Wemba have embraced La Sape as an essential part of their artistic identity.\nMartial arts.\nWWE wrestler Shinsuke Nakamura uses a running knee strike, called the \"Kinshasa\", as his finisher, a reference to the eponymous city. The move was previously named as \"Bomaye\" (which translated to \"kill him\") during his time in New Japan Pro Wrestling but was renamed in 2016 when he was signed with the WWE for trademark reasons. Both \"Bomaye\" and \"Kinshasa\" are homages to Nakamura's mentor, Antonio Inoki, who received \"Bomaye\" as a nickname from Muhammad Ali when Inoki and Ali fought in 1976, with Ali first hearing \"Bomaye\" in Kinshasa during the Rumble In The Jungle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nLat. long.

{"id": "45775", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45775", "title": "Colonization", "text": "Establishment and development of settlements by people or animals\nColonization (British English: colonisation) is a process of establishing control over areas or peoples for foreign people to advance their trade, cultivation, exploitation and possibly settlement. Colonization functions through establishing a differentiation between the area and people of the colonized and colonizers, establishing metropoles, coloniality and possibly outright colonies. Colonization is commonly pursued and maintained by, but distinct from, imperialism, mercantilism, or colonialism. Conquest can take place without colonization, but a conquering process may often result in or from migration and colonizing. The term \"colonization\" is sometimes used synonymously with the word \"settling\", as with colonization in biology.\nSettler colonialism is a type of colonization structured and enforced by the settlers directly, while their or their ancestors' metropolitan country (\"metropole\") maintains a connection or control through the settler's activities. In settler colonization, a minority group rules either through the assimilation or oppression of the existing inhabitants, or by establishing itself as the demographic majority through driving away, displacing or outright killing the existing people, as well as through immigration and births of metropolitan as well as other settlers.\nThe European colonization of Australia, New Zealand, and other places in Oceania was fueled by explorers, and colonists often regarding the encountered landmasses as (\"empty land\", or literally \"nobody's land\" in Latin). This resulted in laws and ideas such as Mexico's 1824 General Colonization Law and the United States' manifest destiny doctrine which furthered colonization.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"colonization\" is derived from the Latin words (\"to cultivate, to till\"), (\"a landed estate\", \"a farm\") and (\"a tiller of the soil\", \"a farmer\"), then by extension \"to inhabit\". Someone who engages in colonization, i.e. the agent noun, is referred to as a \"colonizer\", while the person who gets colonized, i.e. the object of the agent noun or absolutive, is referred to as a \"colonizee\", \"colonisee\" or the \"colonised\".\nPre-modern colonizations.\nClassical period.\nIn ancient times, maritime nations such as the city-states of Greece and Phoenicia established colonies in other parts of the Mediterranean.\nAnother period of colonization in ancient times was during the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire conquered large parts of Western Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. In North Africa and West Asia, the Romans often conquered what they regarded as 'civilized' peoples. As they moved north into Europe, they mostly encountered rural peoples/tribes with very little in the way of cities. In these areas, waves of Roman colonization often followed the conquest of the areas. Many of the current cities throughout Europe began as Roman colonies, such as Cologne, Germany, originally called \"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\" by the Romans, and the British capital city of London, which the Romans founded as \"Londinium\".\nMiddle Ages.\nThe decline and collapse of the Roman Empire saw (and was partly caused by) the large-scale movement of people in Eastern Europe and Asia. This is largely seen as beginning with nomadic horsemen from Asia (specifically the Huns) moving into the richer pasture land to the west, thus forcing the local people there to move further west and so on until eventually the Goths were forced to cross into the Roman Empire, resulting in continuous war with Rome which played a major role in the fall of the Roman Empire. During this period there were large-scale movements of people establishing new colonies all over western Europe. The events of this time saw the development of many of the modern-day nations of Europe like the Franks in France and Germany and the Anglo-Saxons in England.\nIn West Asia, during the reign of the Sassanid Empire, some Persians established colonies in Yemen and Oman. The Arabs also established colonies in Northern Africa, Mesopotamia, and the Levant.\nThe Vikings of Scandinavia also carried out a large-scale colonization. The Vikings are best known as raiders, setting out from their original homelands in Denmark, southern Norway, and southern Sweden, to pillage the coastlines of northern Europe. In time, the Vikings began trading and established colonies. The Vikings first came across Iceland and established colonies there before moving onto Greenland, where they built settlements that endured until the 15th century. The Vikings launched an unsuccessful attempt at colonizing an area they called Vinland, which is probably at a site now known as L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland and Labrador, on the eastern coastline of Canada.\nColonial Era.\nIn the Colonial Era, colonialism in this context refers mostly to Western European countries' colonization of lands mainly in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The main European countries active in this form of colonization included Spain, Portugal, France, the Tsardom of Russia (later Russian Empire), the Kingdom of England (later Great Britain), the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Prussia (now mostly Germany), Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden-Norway, and, beginning in the 18th century, the United States. Most of these countries had a period of almost complete power in world trade at some stage in the period from roughly 1500 to 1900. Beginning in the late 19th century, the Empire of Japan also engaged in settler colonization, most notably in Hokkaido and Korea.\nWhile some European colonization focused on shorter-term exploitation of economic opportunities (Newfoundland, for example, or Siberia) or addressed specific goals such as settlers seeking religious freedom (Massachusetts), at other times long-term social and economic planning was involved for both parties, but more on the colonizing countries themselves, based on elaborate theory-building (note James Oglethorpe's Colony of Georgia in the 1730s and Edward Gibbon Wakefield's New Zealand Company in the 1840s).\nColonization may be used as a method of absorbing and assimilating foreign people into the culture of the imperial country. One instrument to this end is linguistic imperialism, or the use of non-indigenous colonial languages to the exclusion of any indigenous languages from administrative (and often, any public) use.\n20th\u201321st century on Earth.\nSoviet Union.\nIn the 1920s, the Soviet regime implemented the so-called korenization policy in an attempt to win the trust of non-Russians by promoting their ethnic cultures and establishing for them many of the characteristic institutional forms of the nation-state. The early Soviet regime was hostile to even voluntary assimilation, and tried to de-Russify assimilated non-Russians. Parents and students not interested in the promotion of their national languages were labeled as displaying \"abnormal attitudes\". The authorities concluded that minorities unaware of their ethnicities had to be subjected to Belarusization, Polonization, etc.\nBy the early 1930s, the Soviet regime introduced limited Russification; allowing voluntary assimilation, which was often a popular demand. The list of nationalities was reduced from 172 in 1927 to 98 in 1939, by revoking support for small nations in order to merge them into bigger ones. For example, Abkhazia was merged into Georgia and thousands of ethnic Georgians were sent to Abkhazia. The Abkhaz alphabet was changed to a Georgian base, Abkhazian schools were closed and replaced with Georgian schools, the Abkhaz language was banned. The ruling elite was purged of ethnic Abkhaz and by 1952 over 80% of the 228 top party and government officials and enterprise managers in Abkhazia were ethnic Georgians (there remained 34 Abkhaz, 7 Russians and 3 Armenians in these positions). For K\u00f6nigsberg area of East Prussia (modern Kaliningrad Oblast) given to the Soviet Union at the 1945 Potsdam Conference Soviet control meant a forcible expulsion of the remaining German population and mostly involuntary resettlement of the area with Soviet civilians.\nRussians were now presented as the most advanced and least chauvinist people of the Soviet Union.\nBaltic states.\nLarge numbers of ethnic Russians and other Russian speakers were settled in the three Baltic countries \u2013 Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia \u2013 after their reoccupation in 1944, while local languages, religion and customs were suppressed. David Chioni Moore classified it as a \"reverse-cultural colonization\", where the colonized perceived the colonizers as culturally inferior. Colonization of the three Baltic countries was closely tied to mass executions, deportations and repression of the native population. During both Soviet occupations (1940\u20131941; 1944\u20131991) a combined 605,000 inhabitants of the three countries were either killed or deported (135,000 Estonians, 170,000 Latvians and 320,000 Lithuanians), while their properties and personal belongings, along with ones who fled the country, were confiscated and given to the arriving colonists \u2013 Soviet military and NKVD personnel, as well as functionaries of the Communist Party and economic migrants from kolkhozes.\nThe most dramatic case was Latvia, where the amount of ethnic Russians swelled from 168,300 (8.8%) in 1935 to 905,500 (34%) in 1989, whereas the proportion of ethnic Latvians fell from 77% in 1935 to 52% in 1989. Baltic states also faced intense economic exploitation, with Latvian SSR, for example, transferring 15.961 billion rubles (or 18.8% percent of its total revenue of 85 billion rubles) more to the USSR budget from 1946 to 1990 than it received back. And of the money transferred back, a disproportionate amount was spent on the region's militarization and funding of repressive institutions, especially in the early years of the occupation. It has been calculated by a Latvian state-funded commission that the Soviet occupation cost the economy of Latvia a total of 185 billion euros.\nConversely, Marxian economist and world-systems analyst Samir Amin asserts that, in contrast to colonialism, capital transfer in the USSR was used to develop poorer regions in the South and East with the wealthiest regions like Western Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic Republics being the main source of capital. Estonian researcher Epp Annus acknowledges that the Soviet rule in the Baltic states did not possess every single characteristic of traditional colonialism since the Baltic states were already modern industrial European nation states with an established sense of national identity and cultural self-confidence prior to their Soviet invasion in 1940 and proposed that the initial Soviet occupation developed into a colonial rule gradually, as the local resistance turned into a hybrid coexistence with the Soviet power. The Soviet colonial rule never managed to fully establish itself and began rapidly disintegrating during \"perestroika\", but after the restoration of independence, the Baltic states similarly had to deal with problems of a characteristically colonial nature, such as pollution, economic collapse and demographic tensions.\nJewish oblast.\nIn 1934, the Soviet government established the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the Soviet Far East to create a homeland for the Jewish people. Another motive was to strengthen Soviet presence along the vulnerable eastern border. The region was often infiltrated by the Chinese; in 1927, Chiang Kai-shek had ended cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party, which further increased the threat. Japan also seemed willing and ready to detach the Far Eastern provinces from the USSR. To make settlement of the inhospitable and undeveloped region more enticing, the Soviet government allowed private ownership of land. This led to many non-Jews to settle in the oblast to get a free farm.\nBy the 1930s, a massive propaganda campaign developed to induce more Jewish settlers to move there. In one instance, a government-produced Yiddish film called \"Seekers of Happiness\" told the story of a Jewish family that fled the Great Depression in the United States to make a new life for itself in Birobidzhan. Some 1,200 non-Soviet Jews chose to settle in Birobidzhan. The Jewish population peaked in 1948 at around 30,000, about one-quarter of the region's population. By 2010, according to data provided by the Russian Census Bureau, there were only 1,628 people of Jewish descent remaining in the JAO (1% of the total population), while ethnic Russians made up 92.7% of the JAO population. The JAO is Russia's only autonomous oblast and, aside of Israel, the world's only Jewish territory with an official status.\nIsrael.\nWhether or not the Zionist movement represents a settler colonial project is a hotly debated subject in Middle Eastern political theory. In the First Aliyah, much of the Zionist settlement consisted of legal land purchases for agricultural colonies, or moshavot, for wine and citrus production.\nAccording to Elia Zuriek in his book \"Israel's Colonial Project in Palestine: Brutal Pursuit\", Israeli settlements in the West Bank are a form of colonization. This view is part of a key debate in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. Law professors Steven Lubet and Jonathan Zasloff describe the \"Zionism as settler colonialism\" theory as politically motivated, derogatory and highly controversial.\nAccording to them, there are important differences between Zionism and settler colonialism, for instance:\nIndonesia.\nThe transmigration program is an initiative of the Indonesian government to move landless people from densely populated areas of Java, but also to a lesser extent from Bali and Madura, to less populous areas of the country including Papua, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.\nPapua New Guinea.\nIn 1884 Britain declared a protective order over South East New Guinea, establishing an official colony in 1888. Germany however, annexed parts of the North. This annexation separated the entire region into the South, known as \"The Territory of Papua\" and North, known as \"German New Guinea\".\nPhilippines.\nDue to marginalization produced by continuous Resettlement Policy, by 1969, political tensions and open hostilities developed between the Government of the Philippines and Moro Muslim rebel groups in Mindanao.\nSubject peoples.\nMany colonists came to colonies for slaves to their colonizing countries, so the legal power to leave or remain may not be the issue so much as the actual presence of the people in the new country. This left the indigenous natives of their lands slaves in their own countries.\nThe Canadian Indian residential school system was identified by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada) as colonization through depriving the youth of First Nations in Canada of their languages and cultures.\nDuring the mid 20th century, there was the most dramatic and devastating attempt at colonization, and that was pursued with Nazism. Hitler and Heinrich Himmler and their supporters schemed for a mass migration of Germans to Eastern Europe, where some of the Germans were to become colonists, having control over the native people. These indigenous people were planned to be reduced to slaves or wholly annihilated.\nMany advanced nations currently have large numbers of guest workers/temporary work visa holders who are brought in to do seasonal work such as harvesting or to do low-paid manual labor. Guest workers or contractors have a lower status than workers with visas, because guest workers can be removed at any time for any reason.\nEndo-colonization.\nColonization may be a domestic strategy when there is a widespread security threat within a nation and weapons are turned inward, as noted by Paul Virilio:\nObsession with security results in the \"endo-colonization\" of society: endo-colonization is the use of increasingly powerful and ubiquitous technologies of security turned \"inward\", to attempt to secure the fast and messy circulations of our globalizing, networked society...it is the increasing domination of public life with stories of dangerous otherness and suspicion...\nSome instances of the burden of endo-colonization have been noted:\nThe acute difficulties of the Latin American and southern European military-bureaucratic dictatorships in the seventies and early eighties and the Soviet Union in the late eighties can in large part be attributed to the economic, political and social contradictions induced by endo-colonizing militarism.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45777", "revid": "492987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45777", "title": "Reform Act 1832", "text": "UK law reforming the electoral system\nThe Representation of the People Act 1832 (also known as the Reform Act 1832, Great Reform Act or First Reform Act) was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (indexed as 2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 45) to reform the electoral system in England and Wales and to expand the franchise. The measure was brought forward by the Whig government of Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey.\nThe legislation granted the right to vote to a broader segment of the male population by standardizing property qualifications, extending the franchise to small landowners, tenant farmers, shopkeepers, and all householders who paid a yearly rental of \u00a310 or more. The act also reapportioned constituencies to address the unequal distribution of seats. The act of England and Wales was accompanied by the Scottish Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 65) and Irish Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 88).\nThe act was technically repealed in 1998 as part of a restructuring of the entirety of English statute law. The electoral system in the UK is now defined principally by the Representation of the People Act 1983 and the Electoral Administration Act 2006.\nBefore the reform, most members of Parliament nominally represented boroughs. However, the number of electors in a borough varied widely, from a dozen or so up to 12,000. The criteria for qualification for the franchise also varied greatly among these boroughs, from the requirement to own land, to merely living in a house with a hearth sufficient to boil a pot.\nThe Irish Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4 c. 88) brought similar changes to Ireland, and the separate Scottish Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4 c. 65) was revolutionary, enlarging the electorate by a factor of 13 from 5,000 to 65,000.\nThe historiography of the Reform Act is marked by longstanding debates over its causes, nature, and impact. Scholars have long grappled with whether it was a radical modernizing movement that introduced democracy or a conservative measure intended to preserve aristocratic rule by making necessary concessions.\nUnreformed House of Commons.\nAfter the Acts of Union 1800 became law on 1 January 1801, the unreformed House of Commons comprised 658 members, of whom 513 represented England and Wales. There were two types of constituency: counties and boroughs. County members were supposed to represent landholders, while borough members were supposed to represent mercantile and trading interests.\nCounties.\nCounties were historical national subdivisions established between the 8th and 16th centuries. They were not merely parliamentary constituencies: many components of government (as well as courts and the militia) were organised along county lines. The members of Parliament chosen by the counties were known as knights of the shire. In Wales, each county elected one member, while in England, each county elected two members until 1826 when Yorkshire's representation was increased to four, following the disfranchisement of the Cornish borough of Grampound.\nBoroughs.\nParliamentary boroughs in England ranged in size from small hamlets to large cities, partly because they had evolved haphazardly. The earliest boroughs were chosen in the Middle Ages by county sheriffs, and even a village might be deemed a borough. Many of these early boroughs (such as Winchelsea and Dunwich) were substantial settlements at the time of their original enfranchisement, but later went into decline, and by the early 19th century some only had a few electors, but still elected two MPs; they were often known as rotten boroughs. Of the 70 English boroughs that Tudor monarchs enfranchised, 31 were later disfranchised. Finally, the parliamentarians of the 17th century compounded the inconsistencies by re-enfranchising 15 boroughs whose representation had lapsed for centuries, seven of which were later disfranchised by the Reform Act 1832. After Newark was enfranchised in 1661, no additional boroughs were enfranchised, and, with the sole exception of Grampound's 1821 disfranchisement, the system remained unchanged until the Reform Act 1832. Most English boroughs elected two MPs; but five boroughs elected only one MP: Abingdon, Banbury, Bewdley, Higham Ferrers and Monmouth. The City of London and the joint borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis each elected four members. The Welsh boroughs each returned a single member.\nThe franchise.\nStatutes passed in 1430 and 1432, during the reign of Henry VI, standardised property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of freehold property or land with an annual value of at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling freehold, was never adjusted for inflation of land value; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to men by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, the vast majority of people were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000 and 400,000 enfranchised Englishmen overall. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times. Not only was this typically legal (since there was usually no need for a property owner to live in a constituency in order to vote there) it was also feasible, even with the technology of the time, since polling was usually held over several days.\nIn boroughs the franchise was far more varied. There were broadly six types of parliamentary boroughs, as defined by their franchise:\nSome boroughs had a combination of these varying types of franchise, and most had special rules and exceptions, so many boroughs had a form of franchise that was unique to themselves. \nThe largest borough, Westminster, had about 12,000 voters, while many of the smallest, usually known as \"rotten boroughs\", had fewer than 100 each. The most famous rotten borough was Old Sarum, which had 13 burgage plots that could be used to \"manufacture\" electors if necessary\u2014usually around half a dozen was thought sufficient. Other examples were Dunwich (32 voters), Camelford (25), and Gatton (7).\nPocket boroughs.\nMany constituencies, especially those with small electorates, were under the control of rich landowners, and were known as nomination boroughs or pocket boroughs, because they were said to be in the pockets of their patrons. Most patrons were noblemen or landed gentry who could use their local influence, prestige, and wealth to sway the voters. This was particularly true in rural counties, and in small boroughs situated near a large landed estate. Some noblemen even controlled multiple constituencies: for example, the Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven, while the Earl of Lonsdale controlled nine. Writing in 1821, Sydney Smith proclaimed that \"The country belongs to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Newcastle, and about twenty other holders of boroughs. They are our masters!\" T. H. B. Oldfield stated in his \"Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland\" that, out of the 514 members representing England and Wales, about 370 were selected by nearly 180 patrons. A member who represented a pocket borough was expected to vote as his patron ordered, or else lose his seat at the next election. Voters in some constituencies resisted outright domination by powerful landlords, but were often open to corruption.\nMovement for reform.\nAfter the French Revolution.\nSupport for parliamentary reform plummeted after the French Revolution in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly opposed to any major political change. Despite this reaction, several Radical Movement groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale, and Charles Grey founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the Society of the Friends of the People, included 28 MPs. In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from the Friends of the People, outlining abuses of the system and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament's reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, but the House again rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.\nOther notable pro-reform organisations included the Hampden Clubs (named after John Hampden, an English politician who opposed the Crown during the English Civil War) and the London Corresponding Society (which consisted of workers and artisans). But the \"Radical\" reforms supported by these organisations (for example, universal suffrage) found even less support in Parliament. For example, when Sir Francis Burdett, chairman of the London Hampden Club, proposed a resolution in favour of universal suffrage, equally sized electoral districts, and voting by secret ballot to the House of Commons, his motion found only one other supporter (Lord Cochrane) in the entire House.\nDespite such setbacks, popular pressure for reform remained strong. In 1819, a large pro-reform rally was held in Birmingham. Although the city was not entitled to any seats in the Commons, those gathered decided to elect Sir Charles Wolseley as Birmingham's \"legislatorial representative\". Following their example, reformers in Manchester held a similar meeting to elect a \"legislatorial attorney\". Between 20,000 and 60,000 (by different estimates) attended the event. The protesters were ordered to disband; when they did not, the Manchester Yeomanry suppressed the meeting by force. Eighteen people were killed and several hundred injured in what later became known as the Peterloo Massacre. In response, the government passed the Six Acts, measures designed to quell further political agitation. In particular, the Seditious Meetings Act prohibited groups of more than 50 people from assembling to discuss any political subject without prior permission from the sheriff or magistrate.\nReform during the 1820s.\nSince the House of Commons regularly rejected direct challenges to the system of representation by large majorities, supporters of reform had to content themselves with more modest measures. The Whig Lord John Russell brought forward one such measure in 1820, proposing the disfranchisement of the notoriously corrupt borough of Grampound in Cornwall. He suggested that the borough's two seats be transferred to the city of Leeds. Tories in the House of Lords agreed to the disfranchisement of the borough, but refused to accept the precedent of directly transferring its seats to an industrial city. Instead, they modified the proposal so that two further seats were given to Yorkshire, the county in which Leeds is situated. In this form, the bill passed both houses and became law. In 1828, Lord John Russell suggested that Parliament repeat the idea by abolishing the corrupt boroughs of Penryn and East Retford, and by transferring their seats to Manchester and Birmingham. This time, however, the House of Lords rejected his proposals. In 1830, Russell proposed another, similar scheme: the enfranchisement of Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, and the disfranchisement of the next three boroughs found guilty of corruption; again, the proposal was rejected.\nSupport for reform came from an unexpected source\u2014a reactionary faction of the Tory Party\u2014in 1829. The Tory government under Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, responding to the danger of civil strife in largely Roman Catholic Ireland, drew up the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. This legislation repealed various laws that imposed political disabilities on Roman Catholics, in particular laws that prevented them from becoming members of Parliament. In response, disenchanted ultra-Tories who perceived a danger to the established religion came to favour parliamentary reform, in particular the enfranchisement of Manchester, Leeds, and other heavily Nonconformist cities in northern England.\nPassage of the Reform Act.\nFirst Reform Bill.\nThe death of King George IV on 26 June 1830 dissolved Parliament by law, and a general election was held. Electoral reform, which had been frequently discussed during the preceding parliament, became a major campaign issue. Across the country, several pro-reform \"political unions\" were formed, made up of both middle and working class individuals. The most influential of these was the Birmingham Political Union, led by Thomas Attwood. These groups confined themselves to lawful means of supporting reform, such as petitioning and public oratory, and achieved a high level of public support.\nCharles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey became prime minister in 1830, and his first announcement as prime minister was a pledge to carry out parliamentary reform. On 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell brought forward the Reform Bill in the House of Commons on the government's behalf. The bill disfranchised 60 of the smallest boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others. Some seats were completely abolished, while others were redistributed to the London suburbs, to large cities, to the counties, and to Scotland and Ireland. Furthermore, the bill standardised and expanded the borough franchise, increasing the size of the electorate (according to one estimate) by half a million voters.\nOn 22 March, the vote on the second reading attracted a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced the total number of seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. The ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.\nSecond Reform Bill.\nThe political and popular pressure for reform had grown so great that in the 1831 general election pro-reform Whigs won as close to a landslide victory as the unreformed electoral system was capable of producing; Whig candidates won nearly every seat where there was a meaningful contest - the anti-reform Tories were reduced almost entirely to the members for the rotten boroughs. The Reform Bill was again brought before the House of Commons, which agreed to the second reading by a large majority in July. During the committee stage, opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September 1831, by a margin of more than 100 votes.\nThe Bill was then sent up to the House of Lords, a majority in which was known to be hostile to it. After the Whigs' decisive victory in the 1831 election, some speculated that opponents would abstain, rather than openly defy the public will. Indeed, when the Lords voted on the second reading of the bill after a memorable series of debates, many Tory peers did refrain from voting. However, the Lords Spiritual mustered in unusually large numbers, and of 22 present, 21 voted against the Bill. It failed by 41 votes.\nWhen the Lords rejected the Reform Bill, public violence ensued. That very evening, riots broke out in Derby, where a mob attacked the city jail and freed several prisoners. In Nottingham, rioters set fire to Nottingham Castle (the home of the Duke of Newcastle) and attacked Wollaton Hall (the estate of Lord Middleton). The most significant disturbances occurred at Bristol, where rioters controlled the city for three days. The mob broke into prisons and destroyed several buildings, including the palace of the Bishop of Bristol, the mansion of the Lord Mayor of Bristol, and several private homes. Other places that saw violence included Dorset, Leicestershire, and Somerset.\nMeanwhile, the political unions, which had hitherto been separate groups united only by a common goal, decided to form the National Political Union. Already wary that the riots earlier in the year might be the prelude to revolution, the government saw this new organisation as a potential threat, and issued a proclamation pursuant to the Corresponding Societies Act 1799 declaring the association \"unconstitutional and illegal\", and commanding all loyal subjects to shun it. The Union continued in defiance of the proclamation, but leaders of the influential Birmingham branch decided to co-operate with the government by discouraging activities on a national level.\nThird Reform Bill.\nAfter the Reform Bill was rejected in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a motion of confidence affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited the introduction of the same bill twice during the same parliamentary session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.\nRealizing that another rejection would not be politically feasible, opponents of reform decided to use amendments to change the bill's essential character; for example, they voted to delay consideration of clauses in the bill that disfranchised the rotten boroughs. The ministers believed that they were left with only one path to the bill's passage: to create a large number of new peerages, swamping the House of Lords with pro-reform votes but the prerogative of creating peerages rested with the king, who recoiled from so drastic a step and rejected the unanimous advice of his cabinet. Lord Grey then resigned, and the king invited the Duke of Wellington to form a new government.\nVerge of revolution.\nThe ensuing period became known as the \"Days of May\"; a wave of large pro-reform demonstrations, led by the political unions, swept the country. A minority of the protestors called for the abolition of the nobility; the most radical demanded the end of the monarchy. The protests were peaceful, but their massive scale nonetheless spooked many in Parliament. With the July Revolution in France still in recent memory, many thought that if the bill did not pass, revolution was all but inevitable. The Queen believed that \"an English revolution [was] rapidly approaching, and that her own fate [was] to be that of Marie Antoinette\". Whig MP Edward Littleton wrote that the nation was \"in a state little short of insurrection\". Though the National Political Union kept within the bounds of the law, its leader Thomas Attwood boasted that \"the nation could be mobilized in an hour\", making it clear to all involved that the Union was a powerful extra-Parliamentary force; if an uprising broke out, the government might be unable to suppress it.\nMany protesters advocated tax resistance, and urged a run on the banks; signs appeared across London reading \"Stop the Duke; go for gold!\" \u00a31.8\u00a0million was withdrawn from the Bank of England in the first days of the run (one-fourth of the \u00a37\u00a0million in the bank's possession). The National Political Union and other organisations sent petitions to the House of Commons, demanding that they withhold supply (cut off funding to the government) until the Lords passed the bill.\nWith revolution seeming to grow likelier by the day, the Duke of Wellington, a reactionary Tory and long an ardent opponent of parliamentary reform, found it impossible to form a government, despite promising a modest reform package. King William was left with no choice but to recall Lord Grey and soon consented to create enough Whig peers to force the bill through the Lords; however, without the knowledge of his cabinet, Wellington circulated a letter among Tory peers, encouraging them to desist from further opposition, and warning them of the consequences of continuing. At this, enough Tory peers relented. By abstaining from further votes, they allowed the legislation to pass in the House of Lords, and the Crown was thus not forced to create new peers. The bill finally received royal assent on 7 June 1832, thereby becoming law.\nResults.\nHistoriography.\nThe extensive scholarship on the Reform Act is filled with debates over its causes, nature, and impact. Historians have long grappled with whether it was a radical modernizing movement that successfully introduced democracy or rather a conservative measure intended to preserve traditional upper class rule by making a few necessary concessions and thus blocking a revolution.\nProvisions.\nAbolition of seats.\nThe Reform Act's chief objective was the reduction of the number of nomination boroughs. There were 203 boroughs in England before the Act. The 56 smallest of these, as measured by their housing stock and tax assessments, were completely abolished. The next 30 smallest boroughs each lost one of their two MPs. In addition Weymouth and Melcombe Regis's four members were reduced to two. Thus in total the Act abolished 143 borough seats in England (one of the boroughs to be completely abolished, Higham Ferrers, returned only a single MP).\nCreation of new seats.\nIn their place the Act created 130 new seats in England and Wales:\nThus 65 new county seats and 65 new borough seats were created in England and Wales. The total number of English members fell by 17 and the number in Wales increased by four. The boundaries of the new divisions and parliamentary boroughs were defined in a separate Act, the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832.\nExtension of the franchise.\nIn county constituencies, franchise rights were extended to copyholders and long-term (at least sixty years) leaseholders of land with at least \u00a310 annual value, medium-term (between twenty and sixty years) leaseholders of land with at least \u00a350 annual value, and to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of at least \u00a350. Annual value refers to the rent at which the land might reasonably be expected to be let from year to year. (The franchise rights of 40 shilling freeholders were retained.)\nThe property qualifications of borough franchise were standardised to male occupants of property who paid a yearly rental of \u00a310 or more. The property could be a house, warehouse, counting-house, shop, or other building as long as it was occupied, and occupied for at least 12 months. Existing borough electors retained a lifetime right to vote, however they had qualified, provided they were resident in the boroughs in which they were electors. In those boroughs which had freemen electors, voting rights were to be enjoyed by future freemen as well, provided their freemanship was acquired through birth or apprenticeship and they too were resident.\nThe Act also introduced a system of voter registration, to be administered by the overseers of the poor in every parish and township. It instituted a system of special courts to review disputes relating to voter qualifications. It also authorised the use of multiple polling places within the same constituency, and limited the duration of polling to two days. (Formerly, polls could remain open for up to fifteen days.)\nThe Reform Act itself did not affect constituencies in Scotland or Ireland. However, there were also reforms there, under the Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number of seats in the House of Commons the same as it had been before the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised and the size of the electorate was increased in both.\nEffects.\nBetween 1835 and 1841, local Conservative Associations began to educate citizens about the party's platform and encouraged them to register to vote annually, as required by the Act. Coverage of national politics in the local press was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press. Grassroots Conservatives therefore saw themselves as part of a national political movement during the 1830s.\nThe size of the pre-Reform electorate is difficult to estimate. Voter registration was lacking, and many boroughs were rarely contested in elections. It is estimated that immediately before the Reform Act 1832, 400,000 English citizens (people who lived in the country) were entitled to vote, and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%. Rodney Mace estimates that before, 1 per cent of the population could vote and that the Reform Act only extended the franchise to 7 per cent of the population.\nTradesmen, such as shoemakers, mistakenly believed that the Reform Act had given them the vote. One example is the shoemakers of Duns, Berwickshire. They created a banner celebrating the Reform Act which declared, \"The battle's won. Britannia's sons are free.\" This banner is on display at People's History Museum in Manchester.\nMany major commercial and industrial cities became separate parliamentary boroughs under the act. The new constituencies saw party conflicts within the middle class, and between the middle class and working class. A study of elections in the medium-sized borough of Halifax, 1832\u20131852, concluded that the party organisations, and the voters themselves, depended heavily on local social relationships and local institutions. Having the vote encouraged many men to become much more active in the political, economic and social sphere.\nThe Scottish Act revolutionised politics in Scotland, with its population of 2\u00a0million. Its electorate had been only 0.2% of the population compared to 4% in England. The Scottish electorate overnight soared from 5,000 to 65,000, or 13% of the adult men, and was no longer a private preserve of a few very rich families.\nTenant voters.\nMost of the pocket boroughs abolished by the Reform Act belonged to the Tory party. These losses were somewhat offset by the extension of the vote to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of \u00a350. This clause, proposed by the Tory Marquess of Chandos, was adopted in the House of Commons despite opposition from the Government. The tenants-at-will thereby enfranchised typically voted as instructed by their landlords, who in turn normally supported the Tory party. This concession, together with the Whig party's internal divisions and the difficulties faced by the nation's economy, allowed the Tories under Sir Robert Peel to make gains in the elections of 1835 and 1837, and to retake the House of Commons in 1841.\nA modern historian, David F. Krein's examination of votes in the House concluded that the traditional landed interest \"suffered very little\" by the 1832 act. They continued to dominate the Commons, while losing some of their power to enact laws that focused on their more parochial interests. By contrast, the same study concluded that the Reform Act 1867 caused serious erosion of their legislative power and the 1874 elections saw great landowners losing their county seats to the votes of tenant farmers in England and especially in Ireland.\nLimitations.\nThe property qualifications of the Reform Act were substantial at the time and barred most of the working class from the vote. This created division between the working class and the middle class and led to the growth of the Chartist Movement.\nAlthough it did disenfranchise most rotten boroughs, a few remained, such as Totnes in Devon and Midhurst in Sussex. Also, bribery of voters remained a problem. As Sir Thomas Erskine May observed, \"it was too soon evident, that as more votes had been created, more votes were to be sold\".\nThe Reform Act strengthened the House of Commons by reducing the number of nomination boroughs controlled by peers. Some aristocrats complained that, in the future, the government could compel them to pass any bill, simply by threatening to swamp the House of Lords with new peerages. The Duke of Wellington lamented: \"If such projects can be carried into execution by a minister of the Crown with impunity, there is no doubt that the constitution of this House, and of this country, is at an end... [T]here is absolutely an end put to the power and objects of deliberation in this House, and an end to all just and proper means of decision.\" The subsequent history of Parliament, however, shows that the influence of the Lords was largely undiminished. They compelled the Commons to accept significant amendments to the Municipal Reform Bill in 1835, forced compromises on Jewish emancipation, and successfully resisted several other bills supported by the public. It would not be until decades later, culminating in the Parliament Act 1911, that Wellington's fears would come to pass.\nFurther reform.\nDuring the ensuing years, Parliament adopted several more minor reforms. The Parliamentary Elections Act 1835 (for borough constituencies) and the Parliamentary Elections (No. 2) Act 1836 (for county constituencies) increased the number of polling places in each constituencies and thus reduced polling to a single day. Parliament also passed several laws aimed at combatting corruption, including the Corrupt Practices Act 1854, though these measures proved largely ineffectual. Neither party strove for further major reform; leading statesmen on both sides regarded the Reform Act as a final settlement.\nThere was considerable public agitation for further expansion of the electorate, however. In particular, the Chartist movement, which demanded universal suffrage for men, equally sized electoral districts, and voting by secret ballot, gained a widespread following. However, the Tories were united against further reform, and the Liberal Party (successor to the Whigs) did not seek a general revision of the electoral system until 1852. The 1850s saw Lord John Russell introduce a number of reform bills to correct defects the first act had left unaddressed. However, no proposal was successful until 1867, when Parliament adopted the Second Reform Act.\nAn area the Reform Act did not address was the issue of municipal and regional government. As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas bridged traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation bridged Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford's developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county boundaries in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was known for his natural performing style and versatility. One of the major stars of Hollywood's Golden Age, Tracy was the first actor to win two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor, from nine nominations. During his career, he appeared in 75 films and developed a reputation among his peers as one of the screen's greatest actors. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Tracy as the 9th greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema.\nTracy first discovered his talent for acting while attending Ripon College, and he later received a scholarship for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He spent seven years in the theater, working in a succession of stock companies and intermittently on Broadway. His breakthrough came in 1930, when his lead performance in \"The Last Mile\" caught the attention of Hollywood. After a successful film debut in John Ford's \"Up the River\" (in which he starred with Humphrey Bogart), he was signed to a contract with Fox Film Corporation. Tracy's five years with Fox featured one acting \"tour de force\" after another that were usually ignored at the box office, and he remained largely unknown to movie audiences after 25 films, nearly all of them starring him as the leading man. None of them were hits, although his performance in \"The Power and the Glory\" (1933) was highly praised at the time.\nIn 1935, Tracy joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's most prestigious studio at the time. His career flourished after his fifth MGM film, \"Fury\" (1936), and in 1937 and 1938 he won consecutive Oscars for \"Captains Courageous\" and \"Boys Town\". Tracy teamed with Clark Gable, MGM's most prominent leading man, for three major box office successes, and by the early 1940s, he was one of MGM's top stars. In 1942, he appeared with Katharine Hepburn in \"Woman of the Year\", beginning a professional and personal partnership that led to nine films over 25 years. In 1955, Tracy won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film \"Bad Day at Black Rock\".\nTracy left MGM in 1955 and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite several health issues and an increasing weariness and irritability as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against severe alcoholism and guilt over his son's deafness. Tracy and his wife Louise became estranged in the 1930s, but the couple never divorced. His 25-year relationship with Katharine Hepburn was an open secret. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director Stanley Kramer. Tracy made his last film with Kramer, \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1967), with filming completed just 17 days before he died.\nEarly life and education.\nSpencer Bonaventure Tracy was born in Milwaukee on April 5, 1900, the second son of Caroline (\"n\u00e9e\" Brown; 1874\u20131942) and truck salesman John Edward Tracy (1873\u20131928). His mother was from a wealthy Presbyterian Midwestern family, while his father was of Irish Catholic descent. He had a brother Carroll, who was four years older.\nTracy was a difficult and hyperactive child\u200a with poor school attendance. Raised Catholic, he was placed in the care of Dominican Order nuns at the age of nine in an attempt to transform his behavior. Later in life, he remarked that he \"never would have gone back to school if there had been any other way of learning to read the subtitles in the movies\". He became fascinated with movies, watching the same ones repeatedly and later re-enacting scenes to his friends and neighbors. He attended several Jesuit academies in his teenage years, which he claimed took the \"badness\" out of him and helped him improve his grades.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt helped me develop memory for lines that has been a godsend since I started stage work; it gave me something of a stage presence; and it helped get rid of my awkwardness. Also, I gradually developed the ability to speak extemporaneously.\n\u2014 Tracy was a key member of his college debating team, which he later said helped with his acting career.\nAt Marquette Academy, he began attending plays with lifelong friend and fellow actor Pat O'Brien, awakening his interest in the theater. With little care for their studies and \"itching for a chance to go and see some excitement\", Tracy and O'Brien enlisted in the Navy together during World War I when Tracy turned 18. They were sent to the Naval Training Station near Chicago, where they were still recruits-in-training when the war came to an end. Tracy achieved the rank of seaman second class, but never went to sea and was discharged in February 1919. His father's desire to see one of his sons gain a college degree drove Tracy back to high school to finish his diploma. Studies at two more institutions, plus the additional allowance of \"war credits\", won Tracy a place at Ripon College. He entered in February 1921, declaring his intention to major in medicine.\nTracy was a popular student at Ripon, where he served as president of his hall and was involved in a number of college activities. He made his stage debut in June 1921, playing the male lead in \"The Truth\". He was very well received in the role and quickly developed a passion for the stage; he was reportedly \"obsessive about acting to the degree that he talked about little else\". He and some friends formed an acting company called the Campus Players, which they took on tour. As a member of the college debate team, Tracy excelled in arguing and public speaking. It was during a tour with the debate team that he auditioned for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA) in New York City. He was offered a scholarship to attend the school after performing a scene from one of his earlier roles.\nTracy left Ripon and began classes at AADA in April 1922. O'Brien was also enrolled there and the two shared a small studio apartment. Money was scarce, and the two often lived on meals of rice and pretzels and shared one decent suit between them. Tracy was deemed fit to progress to the senior class, allowing him to join the academy's stock company. He made his New York debut in a play called \"The Wedding Guests\", which opened in October 1922. He made his debut Broadway appearance three months later, playing a wordless robot in \"R.U.R.\" He graduated from AADA in March 1923.\nCareer.\nStock theater and Broadway (1923\u20131930).\nImmediately following graduation, Tracy joined a new stock company based in White Plains, New York, where he was given peripheral roles. Unhappy there, he moved to a company in Cincinnati, but failed to make an impact. In November 1923, he landed a small part on Broadway in the comedy \"A Royal Fandango\", starring Ethel Barrymore. Reviews for the show were poor and it closed after 25 performances; Tracy later said of the failure, \"My ego took an awful beating.\" When he took a position with a struggling company in New Jersey, Tracy was living on an allowance of 35 cents a day. In January 1924, he played his first leading role with a company in Winnipeg, but the organization soon closed.\nTracy finally achieved some success by joining forces with the notable stock manager William H. Wright in the spring of 1924. A stage partnership was formed with the young actress Selena Royle, who had already made her name on Broadway. It proved a popular draw and their productions were favorably received. One of these performances brought Tracy to the attention of a Broadway producer, who offered him the lead in a new play. \"The Sheepman\" previewed in October 1925, but it received poor reviews and closed after its trial run in Connecticut. Dejected, Tracy was forced back to Wright and the stock circuit.\nIn the fall of 1926, Tracy was offered his third shot at Broadway: a role in a new George M. Cohan play called \"Yellow\". Tracy swore that if the play failed to be a hit he would leave stock and work in a \"regular\" business instead. Tracy was nervous about working with Cohan, one of the most important figures in American theater, but during rehearsals Cohan announced, \"Tracy, you're the best goddamned actor I've ever seen!\" \"Yellow\" opened on September 21; reviews were mixed but it ran for 135 performances. It was the beginning of an important collaboration for Tracy: \"I'd have quit the stage completely,\" he later commented, \"if it hadn't been for George M. Cohan.\" Cohan wrote a part specifically for Tracy in his next play, \"The Baby Cyclone\". It opened on Broadway in September 1927 and was a hit.\nTracy followed this success with another Cohan play, \"Whispering Friends\", and in 1929 took over from Clark Gable in \"Conflict\", a Broadway drama. Other roles followed, but it was the lead in \"Dread\", written by Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist Owen Davis that gave Tracy high hopes for success. The story of a man's descent into madness, \"Dread\" previewed in Brooklyn to an excellent reception, but on the next day\u2014October 29\u2014the New York stock market crashed. Unable to obtain funding, \"Dread\" did not open on Broadway. Following this disappointment, Tracy again considered leaving the theater and returning to Milwaukee for a more stable life.\nIn January 1930, Tracy was approached about a new play called \"The Last Mile\". Looking to cast the lead role of a murderer on death row, producer Herman Shumlin met with Tracy, and later recounted: \"beneath the surface, here was a man of passion, violence, sensitivity and desperation: no ordinary man, and just the man for the part.\" \"The Last Mile\" opened on Broadway in February, where Tracy's performance was met by a standing ovation that lasted 14 curtain calls. The \"Commonweal\" described him as \"one of our best and most versatile young actors\". The play was a hit with critics, and ran for 289 performances.\nFox (1930\u20131935).\nIn 1930, Broadway was being scouted to find actors to work in the new medium of sound films. Tracy was cast in two Vitaphone shorts (\"Taxi Talks\" and \"The Hard Guy\"), but he had not considered becoming a film actor: \"I had no ambition in that direction and I was perfectly happy on the stage\", he later explained in an interview. One person who saw Tracy in \"The Last Mile\" was director John Ford.\nFord wanted Tracy for the lead role in his next picture, a prison movie. Production company Fox Film Corporation was unsure about Tracy, saying that he did not photograph well, but Ford convinced them that he was right for the role. \"Up the River\" (1930) marked the film debut of both Tracy and Humphrey Bogart. After seeing the rushes, Fox immediately offered Tracy a long-term contract. Knowing that he needed the money for his family, with his young son deaf and recovering from polio, Tracy signed with Fox and moved to California. He appeared on the stage only once more in his life.\nWinfield Sheehan, the head of Fox, committed to making Tracy a bankable commodity. The studio promoted the actor, releasing ads for his second film \"Quick Millions\" (1931) with the headline \"A New Star Shines\". Three films were made in quick succession, all of which were unsuccessful at the box office. Tracy found himself typecast in comedies, usually playing a crook or a con man. The mold was broken with his seventh picture, \"Disorderly Conduct\" (1932), and it was the first of his films since \"Up the River\" to return a profit.\nIn mid-1932, after nine pictures, Tracy remained virtually unknown to the public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a raise in his weekly salary to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, with \"Me and My Gal\" (1932) setting an all-time low attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for \"20,000 Years in Sing Sing\" (1932), a prison drama co-starring Bette Davis. Tracy was hopeful that it would be his break-out role, but despite good reviews, this failed to materialize.\nCritics began to notice Tracy with \"The Power and the Glory\" (1933). The story of a man's rise to prosperity had a screenplay by Preston Sturges and Tracy's performance as railroad tycoon Tom Garner received uniformly strong reviews. William Wilkerson of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote: \"This sterling performer has finally been given an opportunity to show an ability that has been boxed in by gangster roles\u00a0... [the film] has introduced Mr. Tracy as one of the screen's best performers\". Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" stated: \"No more convincing performance has been given on the screen than Spencer Tracy's impersonation of Tom Garner.\" \"Shanghai Madness\" (1933), meanwhile, revealed Tracy to have a previously unseen sex appeal and served to advance his standing. Despite this attention, Tracy's next two movies went largely unnoticed. \"Man's Castle\" (1933) with Loretta Young was anticipated to be a hit, but made only a small profit. \"The Show-Off\" (1934), for which he was lent to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, proved popular, but his subsequent outings continued to be unsuccessful.\nTracy drank heavily during his years with Fox and gained a reputation as an alcoholic. He failed to report for filming on \"Marie Galante\" in June 1934, and was found in his hotel room, virtually unconscious after a two-week binge. Tracy was removed from the Fox payroll while he recovered in a hospital, and then sued for $125,000 for delaying the production. He completed only two more pictures with the studio.\nThe details on how Tracy's relationship with Fox ended are unclear: later in life Tracy maintained that he was fired for his drunken behavior, but the Fox records do not support such an account. He was still under contract with the studio when MGM expressed their interest in the actor. They were in need of a new male star, and contacted Tracy on April 2, 1935, offering him a seven-year deal. That afternoon, the contract between Tracy and Fox was terminated \"by mutual consent\". Tracy made a total of 25 pictures in the five years he was with Fox Film Corporation, most of which lost money at the box office.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (1935\u20131955).\nGrowing reputation.\nIn the 1930s, MGM was the most respected movie production studio in Hollywood. When Tracy arrived there, he was all but unknown. Biographer James Curtis writes: \"Tracy was scarcely a blip on the box office barometer in 1935, a critics' darling and little more\". He was, however, well known for being a troublemaker. Producer Irving Thalberg was nevertheless enthusiastic about working with the actor, telling journalist Louella Parsons: \"Spencer Tracy will become one of MGM's most valuable stars.\"\nCurtis notes that the studio managed Tracy with care, a welcome change from the ineptitude and apathy he had known while at Fox, which was like \"a shot of adrenaline\" for the actor. His first film under the new contract was the quickly produced \"The Murder Man\" (1935), which included the feature film debut of James Stewart. Thalberg then began a strategy of pairing Tracy with the studio's top actresses: \"Whipsaw\" (1935) co-starred Myrna Loy and was a commercial success. \"Riffraff\" (1936) put Tracy opposite Jean Harlow. Both films were, however, designed and promoted to showcase their leading ladies, thus continuing Tracy's reputation as a secondary star.\n\"Fury\" (1936) was the first film to prove that Tracy could make a success on his own merit. Directed by Fritz Lang, Tracy played an innocent man who swears revenge after narrowly escaping death by a lynch mob. The film and performance received excellent reviews. It made a profit of $1.3 million worldwide. Curtis writes: \"audiences who, just a year earlier, had no clear handle on him, were suddenly turning out to see him. It was a transition that was nothing short of miraculous\u00a0... [and showed] a willingness on the part of the public to embrace a leading man who was not textbook handsome nor bigger than life.\"\n\"Fury\" was followed one month later with the release of the big-budget disaster movie \"San Francisco\" (1936). Tracy played a supporting role alongside Clark Gable in the film, allowing audiences to see him with the top male star in Hollywood. Taking on the role of a priest, Tracy reportedly felt a heavy responsibility in representing the church. Despite having only 17 minutes of screen time, Tracy was highly praised for his performance and received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. \"San Francisco\" became the highest-grossing picture of 1936. Donald Deschner, in his book on Tracy, credits \"Fury\" and \"San Francisco\" as the \"two films that changed his career and gave him the status of a major star\".\nBy this point, Tracy entered a period of self-imposed sobriety and MGM expressed pleasure with Tracy's professionalism. His public reputation continued to grow with \"Libeled Lady\" (also 1936), a screwball comedy that cast him with William Powell, Loy and Harlow. According to Curtis, \"Powell, Harlow and Loy were among the biggest draws in the industry, and equal billing in such a powerhouse company could only serve to advance Tracy's standing\". \"Libeled Lady\" was his third hit picture in the space of six months.\nOscar wins.\nTracy appeared in four films released in 1937. \"They Gave Him a Gun\", a crime-drama, went largely unnoticed, but \"Captains Courageous\" was one of the major film events of the year. Tracy played a Portuguese fisherman in the adventure movie, based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling. He was uncomfortable feigning a foreign accent, and resented having his hair curled, but the role was a hit with audiences and Tracy won the Academy Award for Best Actor. \"Captains Courageous\" was followed by \"Big City\" with Luise Rainer and \"Mannequin\" with Joan Crawford, the latter of which performed well at the box office. With two years of hit movies and industry recognition, Tracy became a star in the United States. A 1937 poll of 20 million people to find the \"King and Queen of Hollywood\" ranked Tracy sixth among males.\nTracy was reunited with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy for \"Test Pilot\" (1938). The film was another enormous commercial and critical success, permanently cementing the notion of Gable and Tracy as a team in the public imagination.\nBased on the positive response he had received in \"San Francisco\", MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in \"Boys Town\" (also 1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town in Nebraska, was a role Tracy took seriously: \"I'm so anxious to do a good job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night.\" Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: \"I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award\u00a0... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man\u2014Father Flanagan\". Although he did keep his Oscar, a second statuette was struck and immediately sent to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest box office star of 1938.\nTracy was absent from screens for almost a year before returning to Fox on loan and appearing as Henry M. Stanley in \"Stanley and Livingstone\" (1939) with Nancy Kelly. Curtis maintains that Tracy's non-visibility did little to affect his standing with the public or exhibitors. In October 1939, a \"Fortune\" magazine survey of the nation's favorite movie actors listed Tracy in first place.\nEstablished star.\nMGM capitalized on Tracy's popularity, casting him in four movies for 1940. \"I Take This Woman\" with Hedy Lamarr was a critical and commercial failure, but the historical drama \"Northwest Passage\"\u2014Tracy's first film in Technicolor\u2014proved popular. He then portrayed Thomas Edison in \"Edison, the Man\". Howard Barnes of the \"New York Herald Tribune\" was not charmed by the story, but wrote that Tracy, \"by sheer persuasion of his acting\", made the film worthy. \"Boom Town\" was the third and final Gable-Tracy picture, also starring Claudette Colbert and Hedy Lamarr, making it one of the most anticipated films of the year. The film opened to the biggest crowd since \"Gone With the Wind\".\nTracy signed a new contract with MGM in April 1941, which paid $5,000 a week and limited him to three pictures a year (Tracy had previously expressed a need to reduce his workload). The contract also stated for the first time that his billing was to be \"that of a star\". Contrary to popular belief, the contract did not include a clause that he receive top billing, but from this point onward, every film Tracy appeared in featured his name first, with the exception of his \"guest appearance\" in \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" (1944).\nTracy returned to the role of Father Flanagan for the sequel \"Men of Boys Town\" (1941). It was followed by Tracy's only venture into the horror genre, an adaptation of \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (also 1941), co-starring Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner. Tracy was unhappy with the film, disliking the heavy make-up he needed to portray Hyde. Critical response to the film was mixed and brought Tracy the only negative reviews of his career. Theodore Strauss of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"Mr. Tracy's portrait of Hyde is not so much evil incarnate as it is the ham rampant.\" The film was financially successful, however, taking in more than $2 million at the box office.\nTracy was set to star in a film version of \"The Yearling\" for 1942, but several on-set difficulties and bad weather on location forced MGM to shelve the production. With the end of that project, he became available for the new Katharine Hepburn film, \"Woman of the Year\" (1942). Hepburn greatly admired Tracy, calling him \"the best movie actor there was\". She had wanted him for her comeback vehicle, \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). Hepburn was delighted that Tracy was available for \"Woman of the Year\", saying \"I was just damned grateful he was willing to work with me.\" The romantic comedy performed well at the box office and received strong reviews. William Boehnel wrote in the \"New York World-Telegram\", \"To begin with, it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the leading roles. This in itself would be enough to make any film memorable. But when you get Tracy and Hepburn turning in brilliant performances to boot, you've got something to cheer about.\"\n\"Woman of the Year\" was followed by an adaptation of John Steinbeck's \"Tortilla Flat\" (also 1942) which met with a tepid response. MGM did not hesitate to repeat the teaming of Tracy and Hepburn and cast them in the dark mystery \"Keeper of the Flame\" (1943). Despite a weak critical reception the film out-grossed \"Woman of the Year\" confirming the strength of their partnership.\nTracy's next three appearances were all war-based. \"A Guy Named Joe\" (1943) with Irene Dunne surpassed \"San Francisco\" to become his highest-grossing film to date. \"The Seventh Cross\" (1944), a suspense film about an escape from a Nazi concentration camp, met with critical acclaim. It was followed by the aviation film \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" (1944). On the strength of these three releases, the annual Quigley poll revealed Tracy was MGM's biggest money-making star of 1944, His only film the following year was his third with Hepburn, \"Without Love\" (1945), a light romantic comedy that performed well at the box office despite muted enthusiasm from critics.\nStage and screen.\nIn 1945, Tracy returned to the stage for the first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally\u2014culminating with a hospital stay\u2014and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, \"I'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act.\" The play was \"The Rugged Path\" by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold-out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: \"In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction\". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: \"I couldn't say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night\u00a0... At least every day is a new day for me in films\u00a0... But this thing\u2014every day, every day, over and over again.\"\nTracy was absent from screens in 1946, the first year since his motion picture debut that there was no Spencer Tracy release. His next film was \"The Sea of Grass\" (1947), a melodrama set in the American Old West with Hepburn. Similar to \"Keeper of the Flame\" and \"Without Love\", a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad. He followed it later that year with \"Cass Timberlane\", in which he played a judge. It was a commercial success, but Curtis notes that co-star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews.\nA fifth film with Hepburn, Frank Capra's political drama \"State of the Union\", was released in 1948. Tracy played a presidential candidate in the movie, which was warmly received. He then appeared in \"Edward, My Son\" (1949) with Deborah Kerr. Tracy disliked the role, and told director George Cukor, \"It's rather disconcerting to me to find how easily I play a heel.\" Upon its release, \"The New Yorker\" wrote of the \"hopeless miscasting of Mr. Tracy\". The film became Tracy's biggest money-loser at MGM.\nTracy finished off the 1940s with \"Malaya\" (1949), an adventure film with James Stewart, and \"Adam's Rib\" (also 1949), a comedy with Tracy and Hepburn playing married lawyers who oppose each other in court. Tracy and Hepburn's friends, Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, wrote the parts specifically for the two leads. The film received strong reviews and became the highest-grossing Tracy-Hepburn picture to date. Film critic Bosley Crowther wrote, \"Mr. Tracy and Miss Hepburn are the stellar performers in this show and their perfect compatibility in comic capers is delightful to see.\"\nFinal MGM years.\nTracy received his first Academy Award nomination in 12 years for playing the role of Stanley Banks in \"Father of the Bride\" (1950). In the comedy film, Banks attempts to handle preparations for the upcoming wedding of his daughter (Elizabeth Taylor). \"It's the second strong comedy in a row for Spencer Tracy, doing the title role, and he socks it\", \"Variety\" commented. The film was the biggest commercial success of Tracy's career to date, earning $6 million worldwide. MGM wanted a sequel, and while Tracy was unsure, he accepted. \"Father's Little Dividend\" (1951) was released ten months later and performed well at the box office. On the strength of the two movies, Tracy polled as one of the nation's top stars once more.\nTracy portrayed a lawyer in \"The People Against O'Hara\" (1951) and re-teamed with Hepburn for the sports comedy \"Pat and Mike\" (1952), the second feature written expressly for them by Kanin and Gordon. \"Pat and Mike\" became one of the duo's most popular and critically acclaimed films. Tracy followed it with \"Plymouth Adventure\" (also 1952), a historical drama set aboard the \"Mayflower\", co-starring Gene Tierney. It met with poor critical and box office response and posted a loss of $1.8 million for MGM. Tracy returned to the role of a concerned father in \"The Actress\" (1953). Producer Lawrence Weingarten recalled: \"That film\u00a0... got more [acclaim] from the critics than any film I ever made in all the years, and we didn't make enough to pay for the ushers in the theatre.\" For his performance in \"The Actress\", Tracy won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the British Academy Film Award.\nMGM lent Tracy to Fox for the well-received Western film \"Broken Lance\", his only film released in 1954. In 1955, Tracy turned down William Wyler's \"The Desperate Hours\" because he refused to take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility of a small desert town in \"Bad Day at Black Rock\" (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival.\nTracy had personally been unhappy with the picture and threatened to leave during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on \"Tribute to a Bad Man\" in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when he claimed that the shooting location in the Colorado mountains gave him altitude sickness. The problems caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955, he was one of the two remaining stars of the studio's peak years (the other being Robert Taylor), but with his contract up for renewal, Tracy opted to freelance for the first time in his movie career.\nIndependent player (1956\u20131967).\nTracy's first post-MGM appearance was in \"The Mountain\" (1956), released by Paramount Pictures. The film co-starred Robert Wagner, who played his much younger brother (Wagner had earlier played his son in \"Broken Lance\"). The location filming in the French Alps proved a difficult experience, and he threatened to leave the project. His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor. Tracy and Hepburn then paired together for the eighth time in the office-based comedy \"Desk Set\" (1957), released by Twentieth Century-Fox. He again had to be convinced to stay with the film, one which met with a weak response.\nTracy appeared in \"The Old Man and the Sea\" (1958), a project that had been in development for five years. An adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's novella of the same title, Hemingway's agent, Leland Hayward, had previously written to the author: \"Of all Hollywood people, the one that comes the closest to me in quality, in personality and voice, in personal dignity and ability, is Spencer Tracy.\" Tracy was delighted to be offered the role. He was told to lose some of his 210 pounds before filming began but failed to do so. Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a \"terrible liability to the picture\", and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight problem. Appearing alone on screen for most of the film, Tracy considered \"The Old Man and the Sea\" the toughest part he ever played. In reviewing the performance, Jack Moffitt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said it was \"so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that, to me, it almost transcended acting and became reality\". Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work.\nAfter abandoning two projects, including a proposed remake of \"The Blue Angel\" with Marilyn Monroe, Tracy's next feature was \"The Last Hurrah\" (1958). It reunited him with his debut director, John Ford, after 28 years and his childhood friend Pat O'Brien. Tracy took a year to commit to the project, in which he played an Irish-American mayor seeking re-election. The movie was favorably reviewed, but not commercially successful. At the end of 1958, the National Board of Review named Tracy the year's Best Actor. He nevertheless began to ponder retirement, with Curtis writing that he was \"chronically tired, unhappy, ill, and uninterested in work\".\nStanley Kramer partnership.\nTracy did not appear on the screen again until the release of \"Inherit the Wind\" (1960), a film based on the 1925 Scopes \"Monkey Trial\" which debated the right to teach evolution in schools. Director Stanley Kramer sought Tracy for the role of lawyer Henry Drummond (based on Clarence Darrow), from the outset. Starring opposite Tracy was Fredric March, a pairing \"Variety\" described as \"a stroke of casting genius\u00a0... Both men are spellbinders in the most laudatory sense of the word.\" The film garnered Tracy some of the strongest reviews of his career\u2014he was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for the performance\u2014but it was not a commercial hit.\nIn the volcano disaster movie \"The Devil at 4 O'Clock\" (1961), Tracy played a priest for the fourth time in his career. His co-star, Frank Sinatra, ceded top-billing to guarantee Tracy for the picture. Continuing his pattern of indecisiveness, Tracy briefly pulled out of the production before recommitting. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film, which was nevertheless Tracy's most successful box-office outing since \"Father of the Bride\".\n\"Inherit the Wind\" began an enduring collaboration between Stanley Kramer and Tracy\u2014Kramer directed Tracy's three final films. \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", released at the end of 1961, was their second feature together. The film depicts the \"Judges' Trial\", the trial of Nazi judges for their role in the Holocaust. Abby Mann wrote the role of Judge Haywood with Tracy in mind; Tracy called it the best script he had ever read. At the end of the film, Tracy delivered a 13-minute speech. He recorded it in one take and received a round of applause from the cast and crew. Upon seeing the film, Mann wrote to Tracy: \"Every writer ought to have the experience of having Spencer Tracy do his lines. There is nothing in the world quite like it.\" The film met with positive reviews and a large audience; Tracy received an eighth Oscar nomination for his performance.\nTracy turned down roles in \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" (1962) and \"The Leopard\" (1963), and had to pull out of MGM's all-star \"How the West Was Won\" (1962) when it clashed with \"Judgment at Nuremberg\". He was, however, able to record the film's narration track. Tracy was in very poor health by this time, and working became a challenge. In 1962, he took the role of Captain T. G. Culpeper in Kramer's comedy \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), a small but key part that he was able to complete in nine non-consecutive days but which he himself nevertheless considered one of the lowest points in his acting career. The film was released in November 1963. Tracy's name topped the list of performers, and the comedy became one of the highest-grossing American films of the year. As his health worsened, he had to cancel commitments to \"Cheyenne Autumn\" (1964) and \"The Cincinnati Kid\" (1965). Film offers continued to come, but Tracy did not work again until 1967 when he took the starring role in Kramer's \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1967), Tracy's ninth and final film with Hepburn.\n\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" explored the topic of interracial marriage, with Tracy playing a liberal-minded newspaper publisher whose values are challenged when his daughter wishes to marry a black man, played by Sidney Poitier. Tracy appeared happy to be working again, but he told journalists visiting the set that the movie would be his last for he would permanently retire after filming due to his health problems.\nTo commence filming, Tracy had to be insured for the high premium of $71,000 if he died during filming; Hepburn and Kramer both put their salaries in escrow until Tracy completed his scenes. In poor health, Tracy could work for only two or three hours each day. He completed his last scene on May 24, 1967. Tracy died 17 days later from a heart attack on June 10.\nThe film was released in December 1967, and although reviews were mixed, Curtis notes that \"Tracy's performance was singled out for praise in nearly every instance.\" Brendan Gill of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that Tracy gave \"a faultless and, under the circumstances, heartbreaking performance\". The movie became Tracy's highest grossing picture. He received a posthumous nomination for Best Actor\u2014his ninth\u2014at the 40th Academy Awards, along with a Golden Globe Award nomination and a BAFTA win for Best Actor.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and family.\nTracy met actress Louise Treadwell while they were both members of the Wood Players in White Plains, New York\u2014the first stock company Tracy joined after graduating. The couple was engaged in May 1923, and married on September 10 of that year between the matinee and evening performances of his show.\nTheir son, John Ten Broeck Tracy, was born in June 1924. When John was 10 months old, Louise discovered that the boy was deaf. She resisted telling Tracy for three months. Tracy was devastated by the news and felt lifelong guilt over his son's deafness. He was convinced that John's hearing impairment was a punishment for his own sins. As a result, Tracy had trouble connecting with his son and distanced himself from his family. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a friend of Tracy's, later theorized: \"[Tracy] didn't leave Louise. He left the scene of his guilt.\" A second child, Louise \"Susie\" Treadwell Tracy, was born in July 1932. The children were raised in their mother's Episcopal faith.\nTracy left the family home in 1933, and he and Louise openly discussed the separation with the media, maintaining that they were still friends and had not taken divorce action. From September 1933 to June 1934, Tracy had a public affair with Loretta Young, his co-star in \"Man's Castle\". He reconciled with Louise in 1935. There was never again an official separation between Tracy and his wife, but the marriage continued to be troubled. Tracy increasingly lived in hotels and by the 1940s, the two were effectively living separate lives. Tracy frequently engaged in extramarital affairs, including with co-stars Joan Crawford in 1937 and Ingrid Bergman in 1941. He had an affair with Myrna Loy in 1935 and 1936. In 1990, during a phone interview with educator Alan Greenberg, Loy revealed she was in love with Tracy. \"I loved Spence, he was adorable...I loved him and I really did love him. I loved him. I mean I was in love with him and she [Katharine Hepburn] got in the way.\" Later, during the 1940s, Loy regularly visited Tracy at Beverly Hills in his hotel room.\nKatharine Hepburn.\nWhile making \"Woman of the Year\" in September 1941, Tracy began what was to become a lifelong relationship with Katharine Hepburn. The actress became devoted to him, and their relationship lasted until his death 26 years later. Tracy never returned to live in the family home, although he visited regularly.\nThe MGM moguls were careful to protect their stars from controversy, and Tracy wished to conceal his relationship with Hepburn from his wife, so it was hidden from the public. The couple did not live together until the final years of Tracy's life, when they shared a cottage on George Cukor's estate in Beverly Hills. In Hollywood, however, the intimate nature of the Tracy-Hepburn partnership was an open secret. Angela Lansbury, who worked with the pair on \"State of the Union\", later said: \"We all knew, but nobody ever said anything. In those days it wasn't discussed.\" Tracy was not someone to express his emotions, but Tracy's friend, actress Betsy Drake believed that he \"was \"utterly\" dependent upon Hepburn\". Tracy's infidelity apparently continued, however, and he reportedly had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of \"Plymouth Adventure\" in 1952.\nNeither Tracy nor his wife ever pursued a divorce, despite their estrangement. He told Joan Fontaine, \"I can get a divorce whenever I want to, but my wife and Kate like things just as they are.\" Louise, meanwhile, reportedly commented, \"I will be Mrs. Spencer Tracy until the day I die.\" Hepburn did not interfere and never fought for marriage.\nCharacter.\nTracy was an avowed Catholic, but his cousin, Jane Feely, said that he did not devoutly follow the religion: \"He was often not a practical Catholic either. I would call him a spiritual Catholic.\" Garson Kanin, a friend of Tracy's for 25 years, described him as \"a true believer\" who respected his religion. At periods in his life, Tracy attended Mass regularly. Tracy did not believe actors should publicize their political views, but in 1940 lent his name to the \"Hollywood for Roosevelt\" committee and personally identified as a Democrat.\nTracy struggled with alcoholism throughout his adult life, an ailment that ran in his father's side of the family. Rather than being a steady drinker, he was prone to periods of binging on alcohol. Loretta Young remarked that Tracy was \"awful\" when he was drunk, and he was twice arrested for his behavior while intoxicated. Because of this bad reaction to alcohol, Tracy regularly embarked on prolonged periods of sobriety and developed an all-or-nothing routine. Myrna Loy said: \"Days of drinking had left him belligerent.\" Hepburn commented that he would stop drinking for \"months, even years at a time\" before falling off the wagon without warning.\nTracy was prone to bouts of depression and anxiety: he was described by Mrs. Tracy as having \"the most volatile disposition I've ever seen\u2014up in the clouds one minute and down in the depths the next. And when he's low, he's very, very low.\" He was plagued by insomnia throughout his life. As a result, Tracy became dependent on barbiturates to sleep, followed by dexedrine to function. Hepburn, who adopted a nursing role towards Tracy, was unable to understand her partner's unhappiness. She wrote in her autobiography: \"What was it?\u00a0... Never at peace\u00a0... Tortured by some sort of guilt. Some terrible misery.\"\nIllness and death.\nTracy's adult life of alcoholism, smoking cigarettes, taking pills and being overweight left him in poor health by the time he reached his 60s. On July 21, 1963, Tracy was hospitalized after a severe attack of breathlessness. Doctors found that he was suffering from pulmonary edema, where fluid accumulates in the lungs due to an inability of the heart to pump properly. They also declared his blood pressure dangerously high. From this point on Tracy remained very weak, and Hepburn moved into his home to provide constant care. In January 1965, he was diagnosed with hypertensive heart disease and also began treatment for a previously ignored diagnosis of Type II diabetes. Tracy almost died in September 1965: a stay in the hospital following a prostatectomy resulted in his kidneys failing, and he spent the night in a coma. His recovery the next day was described by his attending doctor as \"a kind of miracle\".\nTracy spent most of the next two years at home with Hepburn, living what she described as a quiet life: reading, painting, and listening to music. On June 10, 1967, 17 days after completing what was his last film role in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\", Tracy awakened at 3:00\u00a0am to make himself a cup of tea in his Beverly Hills apartment. Hepburn described in her autobiography how she followed him to the kitchen: \"Just as I was about to give [the door] a push, there was a sound of a cup smashing to the floor\u2014then clump\u2014a loud clump.\" She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67. Hepburn recalled, \"He looked so happy to be done with living, which for all his accomplishments had been a frightful burden for him.\" MGM publicist Howard Strickling told the media that Tracy had been alone when he died and was found by his housekeeper.\nA Requiem Mass was held for Tracy on June 12 at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in East Hollywood. Active pallbearers included George Cukor, Stanley Kramer, Frank Sinatra, James Stewart, and John Ford. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, Hepburn did not attend the funeral. Tracy is interred at Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park, near his wife Louise, son John and daughter Susie.\nReputation and acting style.\nTracy had a solid reputation among his peers and received considerable praise from the film industry. After his death, MGM head Dore Schary said that there \"can be no question that [Tracy] was the best and most protean actor of our screen\". He was referred to as the greatest actor of his generation by Clark Gable, James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, John Ford, Garson Kanin, and Katharine Hepburn. Actor Richard Widmark, who idolized Tracy, called him \"the greatest movie actor there ever was\" and said that he had \"learned more about acting from watching Tracy than in any other way\".\nTracy was particularly respected for his naturalism onscreen. Hume Cronyn, who worked with Tracy on \"The Seventh Cross\", admired his screen presence: \"His method appeared to be as simple as it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything.\" Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances, stating that it was \"inspiring\" to co-star with him and that \"his is such simplicity of performance, such naturalness and humor [...] he walks through a scene [and] makes it seem so easy\". His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said that she \"never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, but the truth of the situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines\". Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists because \"you can't mimic reserve and control very well [...] there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI've never known what acting is. Who can honestly say what it is?\u00a0... I wonder what actors are supposed to be, if not themselves\u00a0... I've finally narrowed it down to where, when I begin a part, I say to myself, this is Spencer Tracy as a judge, or this is Spencer Tracy as a priest or as a lawyer, and let it go at that. Look, the only thing an actor has to offer a director and finally an audience is his instinct. That's all.\n\u2013Tracy giving his opinion on acting.\nTracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills; Barry Nelson said that he \"brought the art of reacting to a new height\", while Stanley Kramer declared that he \"thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures\". Millard Kaufman noted that Tracy \"listened with every fiber of his entire body\". In his memoir, Burt Reynolds noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the set of \"Inherit the Wind\". Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor and Tracy replied, \"An actor, huh? Just remember not to ever let anyone catch you at it.\"\nDespite the perception that he was able to turn up to a shoot and perform effortlessly, Tracy's acquaintances said that he would carefully prepare for each role in private. Joseph L. Mankiewicz lived with him during the production of \"Test Pilot\", and recounted that Tracy would lock himself in his bedroom \"working extremely hard\" each night. Many co-workers commented on his strong work ethic and professionalism. However, he did not like to rehearse and would quickly lose his \"effectiveness\" after shooting two or three takes of the same scene. Kanin described him as \"an instinctive player, who trusted the moment of creation\". Tracy's close friend Chester Erskine pinpointed his acting style as one of \"selection\", stating that he strove to give as little as was needed to be effective and reached \"a minimum to make the maximum\".\nTracy disliked being asked about his technique or what advice he would give to others. He often belittled the profession of acting, once saying to Kanin, \"Why do actors think they're so goddamn important? They're not. Acting is not an important job in the scheme of things. Plumbing is.\" He was also humble about his abilities, telling a journalist, \"It's just that I try no tricks. No profile. No 'great lover' act\u00a0... I just project myself as I am\u2014plain, trying to be honest.\" He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt, \"The art of acting is: learn your lines and don't bump into the furniture!\" Hepburn, in an interview six years after Tracy's death, suggested that Tracy wished he had held a different profession.\nAssessment and legacy.\nIn the 21st century, Tracy is best known to general audiences for his association with Katharine Hepburn. He continues to receive praise from film scholars: critic Leonard Maltin calls Tracy \"one of the 20th century's finest actors\", while film historian Jeanine Basinger describes his career as a \"golden record of movie achievement\". Charles Matthews, writing for \"The Washington Post\", argues that \"Tracy deserves to be remembered for himself, as a master of acting technique\".\nAn award for excellence in film acting is bestowed in Tracy's name at the University of California, Los Angeles. Past recipients of the UCLA Spencer Tracy Award include Kirk Douglas, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins, James Stewart, and Denzel Washington.\nA 1986 PBS documentary titled \"The Spencer Tracy Legacy\" was hosted by Hepburn. It includes clips from Tracy's films, and behind-the-scenes archival footage and home movies of Tracy's private life and career, as well as newly filmed interviews with many of his former co-stars, and with his daughter Susie Tracy. In 2009, Tracy provided inspiration for the character Carl in Pixar's Oscar-winning film \"Up\". Director Pete Docter explained that there is \"something sweet about these grumpy old guys\". In 2014, a film about Tracy's relationship with Katharine Hepburn was announced to be in development.\nSeveral of Tracy's films, particularly his comedies, are regarded as classics of American cinema. He starred in four of the titles on the American Film Institute's list of \"100 Years\u00a0... 100 Laughs\": \"Adam's Rib\", \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\", \"Father of the Bride\" and \"Woman of the Year\". \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" was included on AFI's list of the 100 greatest American movies, while \"Captains Courageous\" was featured on their list of America's most inspiring movies.\nAwards and nominations.\nTracy was nominated for nine Academy Awards for Best Actor, a category record he holds with Laurence Olivier. He was the first of nine actors to win the award twice, and is one of two actors to receive it consecutively, the other being Tom Hanks. Tracy was also nominated for five British Academy Film Awards, of which he won two, and four Golden Globe Awards, winning once. In addition, he received the Cannes Film Festival award for Best Actor and was once named Best Actor by the National Board of Review.\nTracy was recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:\nFilmography.\nSelected filmography:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"genotype\" is an organism's full hereditary information. The \"phenotype\" is an organism's actual observed properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior. This distinction is fundamental in the study of inheritance of traits and their evolution.\nOverview.\nThe terms \"genotype\" and \"phenotype\" were created by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911, although the meaning of the terms and the significance of the distinction have evolved since they were introduced.\nIt is the organism's physical properties that directly determine its chances of survival and reproductive output, but the inheritance of physical properties is dependent on the inheritance of genes. Therefore, understanding the theory of evolution via natural selection requires understanding the genotype\u2013phenotype distinction. The genes contribute to a trait, and the phenotype is the observable manifestation of the genes (and therefore the genotype that affects the trait). If a white mouse had recessive genes that caused the genes responsible for color to be inactive, its genotype would be responsible for its phenotype (the white color).\nThe mapping of a set of genotypes to a set of phenotypes is sometimes referred to as the genotype\u2013phenotype map.\nAn organism's genotype is but one of the factors in the development of its phenotype (with its influence being particularly strong in determining morphology). Two organisms with identical genotypes may differ in their phenotypes, due to phenotypic plasticity. To what extent a particular genotype influences a phenotype depends on the relative dominance, penetrance, and expressivity of the alleles in question.\nOne experiences this in everyday life with monozygous (i.e. identical) twins. Identical twins share the same genotype, since their genomes are identical; but they never have the same phenotype, although their phenotypes may be very similar. This is apparent in the fact that close relations can always tell them apart, even though others might not be able to see the subtle differences. Further, identical twins can be distinguished by their fingerprints, which are never completely identical.\nPhenotypic plasticity.\nThe concept of phenotypic plasticity defines the degree to which an organism's phenotype is determined by its genotype. A high level of plasticity means that environmental factors have a strong influence on the particular phenotype that develops. If there is little plasticity, the phenotype of an organism can be reliably predicted from knowledge of the genotype, regardless of environmental peculiarities during development. An example of high plasticity can be observed in larval newts1: when these larvae sense the presence of predators such as dragonflies, they develop larger heads and tails relative to their body size and display darker pigmentation. Larvae with these traits have a higher chance of survival when exposed to the predators, but grow more slowly than other phenotypes.\nGenetic canalization.\nIn contrast to phenotypic plasticity, the concept of genetic canalization addresses the extent to which an organism's phenotype allows conclusions about its genotype. A phenotype is said to be canalized if mutations (changes in the genome) do not noticeably affect the physical properties of the organism. This means that a canalized phenotype may form from a large variety of different genotypes, in which case it is not possible to exactly predict the genotype from knowledge of the phenotype (i.e. the genotype\u2013phenotype map is not invertible). If canalization is not present, small changes in the genome have an immediate effect on the phenotype that develops.\nImportance to evolutionary biology.\nAccording to Lewontin, the theoretical task for population genetics is a process in two spaces: a \"genotypic space\" and a \"phenotypic space\". The challenge of a \"complete\" theory of population genetics is to provide a set of laws that predictably map a population of genotypes (\"G\"1) to a phenotype space (\"P\"1), where selection takes place, and another set of laws that map the resulting population (\"P\"2) back to genotype space (\"G\"2) where Mendelian genetics can predict the next generation of genotypes, thus completing the cycle. Even if non-Mendelian aspects of molecular genetics are ignored, this is a gargantuan task. Visualizing the transformation schematically:\nformula_1\n(adapted from Lewontin 1974, p.\u00a012). \"T\"1 represents the genetic and epigenetic laws, the aspects of functional biology, or development, that transform a genotype into phenotype. This is the \"genotype\u2013phenotype map\". \"T\"2 is the transformation due to natural selection, \"T\"3 are epigenetic relations that predict genotypes based on the selected phenotypes and finally \"T\"4 the rules of Mendelian genetics.\nIn practice, there are two bodies of evolutionary theory that exist in parallel, traditional population genetics operating in the genotype space and the biometric theory used in plant and animal breeding, operating in phenotype space. The missing part is the mapping between the genotype and phenotype space. This leads to a \"sleight of hand\" (as Lewontin terms it) whereby variables in the equations of one domain, are considered parameters or \"constants\", where, in a full-treatment, they would be transformed themselves by the evolutionary process and are \"functions\" of the state variables in the other domain. The \"sleight of hand\" is assuming that the mapping is known. Proceeding as if it is understood is enough to analyze many cases of interest. For example, if the phenotype is almost one-to-one with genotype (sickle-cell disease) or the time-scale is sufficiently short, the \"constants\" can be treated as such; however, there are also many situations where that assumption does not hold.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, hydrophobicity, self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy. Economic impact of bioinspired materials and surfaces is significant, on the order of several hundred billion dollars per year worldwide. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nOne of the early examples of biomimicry was the study of birds and bats to enable human flight. Although never successful in creating a \"flying machine\", Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of aves and mammals, and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of \"flying machines\". The Wright Brothers, who succeeded in flying the first heavier-than-air aircraft in 1903, allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight.\nDuring the 1950s, the American biophysicist and polymath Otto Schmitt developed the concept of \"biomimetics\". During his doctoral research, he developed the Schmitt trigger by studying the nerves in squid, attempting to engineer a device that replicated the biological system of nerve propagation. He continued to focus on devices that mimic natural systems and by 1957 he had perceived a converse to the standard view of biophysics at that time, a view he would come to call biomimetics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Biophysics is not so much a subject matter as it is a point of view. It is an approach to problems of biological science utilizing the theory and technology of the physical sciences. Conversely, biophysics is also a biologist's approach to problems of physical science and engineering, although this aspect has largely been neglected.\u2014\u200a\nIn 1960, Jack E. Steele coined a similar term, \"bionics\", at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as \"the science of systems which have some function copied from nature, or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues\". During a later meeting in 1963, Schmitt stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let us consider what bionics has come to mean operationally and what it or some word like it (I prefer biomimetics) ought to mean in order to make good use of the technical skills of scientists specializing, or rather, I should say, despecializing into this area of research.\u2014\u200a\nIn 1969, Schmitt used the term \"biomimetic\" in the title one of his papers, and by 1974 it had found its way into \"Webster's Dictionary\". Bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in 1960 as \"a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems\". Bionic took on a different connotation when Martin Caidin referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel \"Cyborg\", which later resulted in the 1974 television series \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and its spin-offs. The term bionic then became associated with \"the use of electronically operated artificial body parts\" and \"having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices\". Because the term \"bionic\" took on the implication of supernatural strength, the scientific community in English speaking countries largely abandoned it.\nThe term \"biomimicry\" appeared as early as 1982. Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author Janine Benyus in her 1997 book \"Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature\". Biomimicry is defined in the book as a \"new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems\". Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a \"Model, Measure, and Mentor\" and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.\nThe potential long-term impacts of biomimicry were quantified in a 2013 Fermanian Business &amp; Economic Institute Report commissioned by the San Diego Zoo. The findings demonstrated the potential economic and environmental benefits of biomimicry, which can be further seen in Johannes-Paul Fladerer and Ernst Kurzmann's \"managemANT\" approach. This term (a combination of the words \"management\" and \"ant\"), describes the usage of behavioural strategies of ants in economic and management strategies.\nBio-inspired technologies.\nBiomimetics could in principle be applied in many fields. Because of the diversity and complexity of biological systems, the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes. Murray's law, which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels, has been re-derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system.\nLocomotion.\nAircraft wing design and flight techniques are being inspired by birds and bats. The aerodynamics of streamlined design of improved Japanese high speed train Shinkansen 500 Series were modelled after the beak of Kingfisher bird.\nBiorobots based on the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals include BionicKangaroo which moves like a kangaroo, saving energy from one jump and transferring it to its next jump; Kamigami Robots, a children's toy, mimic cockroach locomotion to run quickly and efficiently over indoor and outdoor surfaces, and Pleobot, a shrimp-inspired robot to study metachronal swimming and the ecological impacts of this propulsive gait on the environment.\nBiomimetic flying robots (BFRs).\nBFRs take inspiration from flying mammals, birds, or insects. BFRs can have flapping wings, which generate the lift and thrust, or they can be propeller actuated. BFRs with flapping wings have increased stroke efficiencies, increased maneuverability, and reduced energy consumption in comparison to propeller actuated BFRs. Mammal and bird inspired BFRs share similar flight characteristics and design considerations. For instance, both mammal and bird inspired BFRs minimize edge fluttering and pressure-induced wingtip curl by increasing the rigidity of the wing edge and wingtips. Mammal and insect inspired BFRs can be impact resistant, making them useful in cluttered environments.\nMammal inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from bats, but the flying squirrel has also inspired a prototype. Examples of bat inspired BFRs include Bat Bot and the DALER. Mammal inspired BFRs can be designed to be multi-modal; therefore, they're capable of both flight and terrestrial movement. To reduce the impact of landing, shock absorbers can be implemented along the wings. Alternatively, the BFR can pitch up and increase the amount of drag it experiences. By increasing the drag force, the BFR will decelerate and minimize the impact upon grounding. Different land gait patterns can also be implemented.\nBird inspired BFRs can take inspiration from raptors, gulls, and everything in-between. Bird inspired BFRs can be feathered to increase the angle of attack range over which the prototype can operate before stalling. The wings of bird inspired BFRs allow for in-plane deformation, and the in-plane wing deformation can be adjusted to maximize flight efficiency depending on the flight gait. An example of a raptor inspired BFR is the prototype by Savastano et al. The prototype has fully deformable flapping wings and is capable of carrying a payload of up to 0.8\u00a0kg while performing a parabolic climb, steep descent, and rapid recovery. The gull inspired prototype by Grant et al. accurately mimics the elbow and wrist rotation of gulls, and they find that lift generation is maximized when the elbow and wrist deformations are opposite but equal.\nInsect inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from beetles or dragonflies. An example of a beetle inspired BFR is the prototype by Phan and Park, and a dragonfly inspired BFR is the prototype by Hu et al. The flapping frequency of insect inspired BFRs are much higher than those of other BFRs; this is because of the aerodynamics of insect flight. Insect inspired BFRs are much smaller than those inspired by mammals or birds, so they are more suitable for dense environments. The prototype by Phan and Park took inspiration from the rhinoceros beetle, so it can successfully continue flight even after a collision by deforming its hindwings.\nBiomimetic architecture.\nLiving beings have adapted to a constantly changing environment during evolution through mutation, recombination, and selection. The core idea of the biomimetic philosophy is that nature's inhabitants including animals, plants, and microbes have the most experience in solving problems and have already found the most appropriate ways to last on planet Earth. Similarly, biomimetic architecture seeks solutions for building sustainability present in nature. While nature serves as a model, there are few examples of biomimetic architecture that aim to be nature positive.\nThe 21st century has seen a ubiquitous waste of energy due to inefficient building designs, in addition to the over-utilization of energy during the operational phase of its life cycle. In parallel, recent advancements in fabrication techniques, computational imaging, and simulation tools have opened up new possibilities to mimic nature across different architectural scales. As a result, there has been a rapid growth in devising innovative design approaches and solutions to counter energy problems. Biomimetic architecture is one of these multi-disciplinary approaches to sustainable design that follows a set of principles rather than stylistic codes, going beyond using nature as inspiration for the aesthetic components of built form but instead seeking to use nature to solve problems of the building's functioning and saving energy.\nCharacteristics.\nThe term biomimetic architecture refers to the study and application of construction principles which are found in natural environments and species, and are translated into the design of sustainable solutions for architecture. Biomimetic architecture uses nature as a model, measure and mentor for providing architectural solutions across scales, which are inspired by natural organisms that have solved similar problems in nature. Using nature as a measure refers to using an ecological standard of measuring sustainability, and efficiency of man-made innovations, while the term mentor refers to learning from natural principles and using biology as an inspirational source.\nBiomorphic architecture, also referred to as bio-decoration, on the other hand, refers to the use of formal and geometric elements found in nature, as a source of inspiration for aesthetic properties in designed architecture, and may not necessarily have non-physical, or economic functions. A historic example of biomorphic architecture dates back to Egyptian, Greek and Roman cultures, using tree and plant forms in the ornamentation of structural columns.\nProcedures.\nWithin biomimetic architecture, two basic procedures can be identified, namely, the bottom-up approach (biology push) and top-down approach (technology pull). The boundary between the two approaches is blurry with the possibility of transition between the two, depending on each individual case. Biomimetic architecture is typically carried out in interdisciplinary teams in which biologists and other natural scientists work in collaboration with engineers, material scientists, architects, designers, mathematicians and computer scientists.\nIn the bottom-up approach, the starting point is a new result from basic biological research promising for biomimetic implementation. For example, developing a biomimetic material system after the quantitative analysis of the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of a biological system.\nIn the top-down approach, biomimetic innovations are sought for already existing developments that have been successfully established on the market. The cooperation focuses on the improvement or further development of an existing product.\nExamples.\nResearchers studied the termite's ability to maintain virtually constant temperature and humidity in their termite mounds in Africa despite outside temperatures that vary from . Researchers initially scanned a termite mound and created 3-D images of the mound structure, which revealed construction that could influence human building design. The Eastgate Centre, a mid-rise office complex in Harare, Zimbabwe, stays cool via a passive cooling architecture that uses only 10% of the energy of a conventional building of the same size.\nResearchers in the Sapienza University of Rome were inspired by the natural ventilation in termite mounds and designed a double fa\u00e7ade that significantly cuts down over lit areas in a building. Scientists have imitated the porous nature of mound walls by designing a facade with double panels that was able to reduce heat gained by radiation and increase heat loss by convection in cavity between the two panels. The overall cooling load on the building's energy consumption was reduced by 15%.\nA similar inspiration was drawn from the porous walls of termite mounds to design a naturally ventilated fa\u00e7ade with a small ventilation gap. This design of fa\u00e7ade is able to induce air flow due to the Venturi effect and continuously circulates rising air in the ventilation slot. Significant transfer of heat between the building's external wall surface and the air flowing over it was observed. The design is coupled with greening of the fa\u00e7ade. Green wall facilitates additional natural cooling via evaporation, respiration and transpiration in plants. The damp plant substrate further support the cooling effect.\nScientists in Shanghai University were able to replicate the complex microstructure of clay-made conduit network in the mound to mimic the excellent humidity control in mounds. They proposed a porous humidity control material (HCM) using sepiolite and calcium chloride with water vapor adsorption-desorption content at 550 grams per meter squared. Calcium chloride is a desiccant and improves the water vapor adsorption-desorption property of the Bio-HCM. The proposed bio-HCM has a regime of interfiber mesopores which acts as a mini reservoir. The flexural strength of the proposed material was estimated to be 10.3 MPa using computational simulations.\nIn structural engineering, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) has incorporated biomimetic characteristics in an adaptive deployable \"tensegrity\" bridge. The bridge can carry out self-diagnosis and self-repair. The arrangement of leaves on a plant has been adapted for better solar power collection.\nAnalysis of the elastic deformation happening when a pollinator lands on the sheath-like perch part of the flower \"Strelitzia reginae\" (known as bird-of-paradise flower) has inspired architects and scientists from the University of Freiburg and University of Stuttgart to create hingeless shading systems that can react to their environment. These bio-inspired products are sold under the name Flectofin.\nOther hingeless bioinspired systems include Flectofold. Flectofold has been inspired from the trapping system developed by the carnivorous plant \"Aldrovanda vesiculosa\".\nStructural materials.\nThere is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of stiffness, strength, and toughness.\nSuch materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction, transportation, energy storage and conversion. In a classic design problem, strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive, i.e., strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However, natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from nano- to macro-scales are both strong and tough. Generally, most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties. Understanding the highly diverse and multi functional biological materials and discovering approaches to replicate such structures will lead to advanced and more efficient technologies. Bone, nacre (abalone shell), teeth, the dactyl clubs of stomatopod shrimps and bamboo are great examples of damage tolerant materials. The exceptional resistance to fracture of bone is due to complex deformation and toughening mechanisms that operate at spanning different size scales \u2014 nanoscale structure of protein molecules to macroscopic physiological scale. Nacre exhibits similar mechanical properties however with rather simpler structure. Nacre shows a brick and mortar like structure with thick mineral layer (0.2\u20130.9\u00a0\u03bcm) of closely packed aragonite structures and thin organic matrix (~20\u00a0nm). While thin films and micrometer sized samples that mimic these structures are already produced, successful production of bulk biomimetic structural materials is yet to be realized. However, numerous processing techniques have been proposed for producing nacre like materials. Pavement cells, epidermal cells on the surface of plant leaves and petals, often form wavy interlocking patterns resembling jigsaw puzzle pieces and are shown to enhance the fracture toughness of leaves, key to plant survival. Their pattern, replicated in laser-engraved Poly(methyl methacrylate) samples, was also demonstrated to lead to increased fracture toughness. It is suggested that the arrangement and patterning of cells play a role in managing crack propagation in tissues.\nBiomorphic mineralization is a technique that produces materials with morphologies and structures resembling those of natural living organisms by using bio-structures as templates for mineralization. Compared to other methods of material production, biomorphic mineralization is facile, environmentally benign and economic.\nFreeze casting (ice templating), an inexpensive method to mimic natural layered structures, was employed by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to create alumina-Al-Si and IT HAP-epoxy layered composites that match the mechanical properties of bone with an equivalent mineral/organic content. Various further studies also employed similar methods to produce high strength and high toughness composites involving a variety of constituent phases.\nRecent studies demonstrated production of cohesive and self supporting macroscopic tissue constructs that mimic living tissues by printing tens of thousands of heterologous picoliter droplets in software-defined, 3D millimeter-scale geometries. Efforts are also taken up to mimic the design of nacre in artificial composite materials using fused deposition modelling and the helicoidal structures of stomatopod clubs in the fabrication of high performance carbon fiber-epoxy composites.\nVarious established and novel additive manufacturing technologies like PolyJet printing, direct ink writing, 3D magnetic printing, multi-material magnetically assisted 3D printing and magnetically assisted slip casting have also been utilized to mimic the complex micro-scale architectures of natural materials and provide huge scope for future research.\nSpider silk is tougher than Kevlar used in bulletproof vests. Engineers could in principle use such a material, if it could be reengineered to have a long enough life, for parachute lines, suspension bridge cables, artificial ligaments for medicine, and other purposes. The self-sharpening teeth of many animals have been copied to make better cutting tools.\nNew ceramics that exhibit giant electret hysteresis have also been realized.\nNeuronal computers.\nNeuromorphic computers and sensors are electrical devices that copy the structure and function of biological neurons in order to compute. One example of this is the event camera in which only the\npixels that receive a new signal update to a new state. All other pixels do not update until a signal is received.\nSelf healing-materials.\nIn some biological systems, self-healing occurs via chemical releases at the site of fracture, which initiate a systemic response to transport repairing agents to the fracture site. This promotes autonomic healing. To demonstrate the use of micro-vascular networks for autonomic healing, researchers developed a microvascular coating\u2013substrate architecture that mimics human skin. Bio-inspired self-healing structural color hydrogels that maintain the stability of an inverse opal structure and its resultant structural colors were developed. A self-repairing membrane inspired by rapid self-sealing processes in plants was developed for inflatable lightweight structures such as rubber boats or Tensairity constructions. The researchers applied a thin soft cellular polyurethane foam coating on the inside of a fabric substrate, which closes the crack if the membrane is punctured with a spike. Self-healing materials, polymers and composite materials capable of mending cracks have been produced based on biological materials.\nThe self-healing properties may also be achieved by the breaking and reforming of hydrogen bonds upon cyclical stress of the material.\nSurfaces.\nSurfaces that recreate the properties of shark skin are intended to enable more efficient movement through water. Efforts have been made to produce fabric that emulates shark skin.\nSurface tension biomimetics are being researched for technologies such as hydrophobic or hydrophilic coatings and microactuators.\nAdhesion.\nWet adhesion.\nSome amphibians, such as tree and torrent frogs and arboreal salamanders, are able to attach to and move over wet or even flooded environments without falling. This kind of organisms have toe pads which are permanently wetted by mucus secreted from glands that open into the channels between epidermal cells. They attach to mating surfaces by wet adhesion and they are capable of climbing on wet rocks even when water is flowing over the surface. Tire treads have also been inspired by the toe pads of tree frogs. 3D printed hierarchical surface models, inspired from tree and torrent frogs toe pad design, have been observed to produce better wet traction than conventional tire design.\nMarine mussels can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of amino acid residues which has been adapted specifically for adhesive purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes, and one-component adhesive systems with potential for employment in nanofabrication protocols. Other research has proposed adhesive glue from mussels.\nDry adhesion.\nLeg attachment pads of several animals, including many insects (e.g., beetles and flies), spiders and lizards (e.g., geckos), are capable of attaching to a variety of surfaces and are used for locomotion, even on vertical walls or across ceilings. Attachment systems in these organisms have similar structures at their terminal elements of contact, known as setae. Such biological examples have offered inspiration in order to produce climbing robots, boots and tape. Synthetic setae have also been developed for the production of dry adhesives.\nLiquid repellency.\nSuperliquiphobicity refers to a remarkable surface property where a solid surface exhibits an extreme aversion to liquids, causing droplets to bead up and roll off almost instantaneously upon contact. This behavior arises from intricate surface textures and interactions at the nanoscale, effectively preventing liquids from wetting or adhering to the surface. The term \"superliquiphobic\" is derived from \"superhydrophobic,\" which describes surfaces highly resistant to water. Superliquiphobic surfaces go beyond water repellency and display repellent characteristics towards a wide range of liquids, including those with very low surface tension or containing surfactants.\nSuperliquiphobicity emerges when a solid surface possesses minute roughness, forming interfaces with droplets through wetting while altering contact angles. This behavior hinges on the roughness factor (Rf), defining the ratio of solid-liquid area to its projection, influencing contact angles. On rough surfaces, non-wetting liquids give rise to composite solid-liquid-air interfaces, their contact angles determined by the distribution of wet and air-pocket areas. The achievement of superliquiphobicity involves increasing the fractional flat geometrical area (fLA) and Rf, leading to surfaces that actively repel liquids.\nThe inspiration for crafting such surfaces draws from nature's ingenuity, illustrated by the \"lotus effect\". Leaves of water-repellent plants, like the lotus, exhibit inherent hierarchical structures featuring nanoscale wax-coated formations. Other natural surfaces with these capabilities can include Beetle carapaces, and cacti spines, which may exhibit rough features at multiple size scales. These structures lead to superhydrophobicity, where water droplets perch on trapped air bubbles, resulting in high contact angles and minimal contact angle hysteresis. This natural example guides the development of superliquiphobic surfaces, capitalizing on re-entrant geometries that can repel low surface tension liquids and achieve near-zero contact angles.\nCreating superliquiphobic surfaces involves pairing re-entrant geometries with low surface energy materials, such as fluorinated substances or liquid-like silocones. These geometries include overhangs that widen beneath the surface, enabling repellency even for minimal contact angles. These surfaces find utility in self-cleaning, anti-icing, anti-fogging, antifouling, enhanced condensation, and more, presenting innovative solutions to challenges in biomedicine, desalination, atmospheric water harvesting, and energy conversion.\nIn essence, superliquiphobicity, inspired by natural models like the lotus leaf, capitalizes on re-entrant geometries and surface properties to create interfaces that actively repel liquids. These surfaces hold immense promise across a range of applications, promising enhanced functionality and performance in various technological and industrial contexts.\nOptics.\nBiomimetic materials are gaining increasing attention in the field of optics and photonics. There are still little known bioinspired or biomimetic products involving the photonic properties of plants or animals. However, understanding how nature designed such optical materials from biological resources is a current field of research.\nInspiration from fruits and plants.\nOne source of biomimetic inspiration is from plants. Plants have proven to be concept generations for the following functions; re(action)-coupling, self (adaptability), self-repair, and energy-autonomy. As plants do not have a centralized decision making unit (i.e. a brain), most plants have a decentralized autonomous system in various organs and tissues of the plant. Therefore, they react to multiple stimulus such as light, heat, and humidity.\nOne example is the carnivorous plant species \"Dionaea muscipula\" (Venus flytrap). For the last 25 years, there has been research focus on the motion principles of the plant to develop AVFT (artificial Venus flytrap robots). Through the movement during prey capture, the plant inspired soft robotic motion systems. The fast snap buckling (within 100\u2013300\u00a0ms) of the trap closure movement is initiated when prey triggers the hairs of the plant within a certain time (twice within 20\u00a0s). AVFT systems exist, in which the trap closure movements are actuated via magnetism, electricity, pressurized air, and temperature changes.\nAnother example of mimicking plants, is the \"Pollia condensata,\" also known as the marble berry. The chiral self-assembly of cellulose inspired by the \"Pollia condensata\" berry has been exploited to make optically active films. Such films are made from cellulose which is a biodegradable and biobased resource obtained from wood or cotton. The structural colours can potentially be everlasting and have more vibrant colour than the ones obtained from chemical absorption of light. \"Pollia condensata\" is not the only fruit showing a structural coloured skin; iridescence is also found in berries of other species such as \"Margaritaria nobilis\". These fruits show iridescent colors in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum which gives the fruit a strong metallic and shiny visual appearance. The structural colours come from the organisation of cellulose chains in the fruit's epicarp, a part of the fruit skin. Each cell of the epicarp is made of a multilayered envelope that behaves like a Bragg reflector. However, the light which is reflected from the skin of these fruits is not polarised unlike the one arising from man-made replicates obtained from the self-assembly of cellulose nanocrystals into helicoids, which only reflect left-handed circularly polarised light.\nThe fruit of \"Elaeocarpus angustifolius\" also show structural colour that come arises from the presence of specialised cells called iridosomes which have layered structures. Similar iridosomes have also been found in \"Delarbrea michieana\" fruits.\nIn plants, multi layer structures can be found either at the surface of the leaves (on top of the epidermis), such as in \"Selaginella willdenowii\" or within specialized intra-cellular organelles, the so-called iridoplasts, which are located inside the cells of the upper epidermis. For instance, the rain forest plants Begonia pavonina have iridoplasts located inside the epidermal cells.\nStructural colours have also been found in several algae, such as in the red alga \"Chondrus crispus\" (Irish Moss).\nInspiration from animals.\nStructural coloration produces the rainbow colours of soap bubbles, butterfly wings and many beetle scales. Phase-separation has been used to fabricate ultra-white scattering membranes from polymethylmethacrylate, mimicking the beetle \"Cyphochilus\". LED lights can be designed to mimic the patterns of scales on fireflies' abdomens, improving their efficiency.\n\"Morpho\" butterfly wings are structurally coloured to produce a vibrant blue that does not vary with angle. This effect can be mimicked by a variety of technologies. Lotus Cars claim to have developed a paint that mimics the \"Morpho\" butterfly's structural blue colour. In 2007, Qualcomm commercialised an interferometric modulator display technology, \"Mirasol\", using \"Morpho\"-like optical interference. In 2010, the dressmaker Donna Sgro made a dress from Teijin Fibers' Morphotex, an undyed fabric woven from structurally coloured fibres, mimicking the microstructure of \"Morpho\" butterfly wing scales.\nCanon Inc.'s SubWavelength structure Coating uses wedge-shaped structures the size of the wavelength of visible light. The wedge-shaped structures cause a continuously changing refractive index as light travels through the coating, significantly reducing lens flare. This imitates the structure of a moth's eye. Notable figures such as the Wright Brothers and Leonardo da Vinci attempted to replicate the flight observed in birds. In an effort to reduce aircraft noise, researchers have looked to the leading edge of owl feathers, which have an array of small finlets or rachis adapted to disperse aerodynamic pressure and provide nearly silent flight to the bird.\nAgricultural systems.\nHolistic planned grazing, using fencing and/or herders, seeks to restore grasslands by carefully planning movements of large herds of livestock to mimic the vast herds found in nature. The natural system being mimicked and used as a template is grazing animals concentrated by pack predators that must move on after eating, trampling, and manuring an area, and returning only after it has fully recovered. Its founder Allan Savory and some others have claimed potential in building soil, increasing biodiversity, and reversing desertification. However, many researchers have disputed Savory's claim. Studies have often found that the method increases desertification instead of reducing it.\nGeolocation.\nBiomimetics can also mean recreating how insects perceive and navigate. Many insects use skylight polarization patterns to estimate North and geolocate. An open-source project has been shown to simulate the measurement of polarization patterns to aid in developing geolocation systems that use them. The project claims potential future alternatives to traditional GPS systems like GNSS, especially in remote areas and may also be to assist in training neural networks to recognize polarization patterns.\nOther uses.\nSome air conditioning systems use biomimicry in their fans to increase airflow while reducing power consumption.\nTechnologists like Jas Johl have speculated that the functionality of vacuole cells could be used to design highly adaptable security systems. \"The functionality of a vacuole, a biological structure that guards and promotes growth, illuminates the value of adaptability as a guiding principle for security.\" The functions and significance of vacuoles are fractal in nature, the organelle has no basic shape or size; its structure varies according to the requirements of the cell. Vacuoles not only isolate threats, contain what's necessary, export waste, maintain pressure\u2014they also help the cell scale and grow. Johl argues these functions are necessary for any security system design. The 500 Series Shinkansen used biomimicry to reduce energy consumption and noise levels while increasing passenger comfort. With reference to space travel, NASA and other firms have sought to develop swarm-type space drones inspired by bee behavioural patterns, and oxtapod terrestrial drones designed with reference to desert spiders.\nOther technologies.\nProtein folding has been used to control material formation for self-assembled functional nanostructures. Polar bear fur has inspired the design of thermal collectors and clothing. The light refractive properties of the moth's eye has been studied to reduce the reflectivity of solar panels.\nThe Bombardier beetle's powerful repellent spray inspired a Swedish company to develop a \"micro mist\" spray technology, which is claimed to have a low carbon impact (compared to aerosol sprays). The beetle mixes chemicals and releases its spray via a steerable nozzle at the end of its abdomen, stinging and confusing the victim.\nMost viruses have an outer capsule 20 to 300\u00a0nm in diameter. Virus capsules are remarkably robust and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 60\u00a0\u00b0C; they are stable across the pH range 2\u201310. Viral capsules can be used to create nano device components such as nanowires, nanotubes, and quantum dots. Tubular virus particles such as the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) can be used as templates to create nanofibers and nanotubes, since both the inner and outer layers of the virus are charged surfaces which can induce nucleation of crystal growth. This was demonstrated through the production of platinum and gold nanotubes using TMV as a template. Mineralized virus particles have been shown to withstand various pH values by mineralizing the viruses with different materials such as silicon, PbS, and CdS and could therefore serve as a useful carriers of material. A spherical plant virus called cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) has interesting expanding properties when exposed to environments of pH higher than 6.5. Above this pH, 60 independent pores with diameters about 2\u00a0nm begin to exchange substance with the environment. The structural transition of the viral capsid can be utilized in Biomorphic mineralization for selective uptake and deposition of minerals by controlling the solution pH. Possible applications include using the viral cage to produce uniformly shaped and sized quantum dot semiconductor nanoparticles through a series of pH washes. This is an alternative to the apoferritin cage technique currently used to synthesize uniform CdSe nanoparticles. Such materials could also be used for targeted drug delivery since particles release contents upon exposure to specific pH levels.\nMultimimicry Regenerative Model (MRM).\nIn 2025, researchers Yassir Turki and Kilzar Arian proposed the *Multimimicry Regenerative Model (MRM)* as an expanded framework inspired by biomimicry. The model integrates six interrelated domains\u2014Biomimicry, Chemomimicry, Physicomimicry, Geomimicry, Cosmomimicry, and Semiomimicry\u2014to describe how regenerative processes operate across biological, chemical, physical, geological, cosmological, and semiotic systems. The MRM seeks to provide a unified scientific and design approach for regenerative innovation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She began her career as an extra in shorts and silent films. After signing with Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century-Fox) in 1926, she rose to fame and became one of the biggest box office draws of the era. In 1929, she became the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in \"7th Heaven\", \"\" (both 1927) and \"Street Angel\" (1928), the only occasion an actress won one Oscar for multiple film roles. Her success continued into the sound film era; for \"A Star Is Born\" (1937), she received a second Best Actress Academy Award nomination.\nAfter retiring from acting in 1939, Gaynor married film costume designer Adrian, with whom she had a son. She briefly returned to acting in films and television in the 1950s and later became an accomplished oil painter. In 1980, Gaynor made her Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of the 1971 film \"Harold and Maude,\" and appeared in the touring theatrical production of \"On Golden Pond\". She died on September 14, 1984 from health complications caused by injuries sustained in a 1982 automobile accident.\nEarly life.\nGaynor was born Laura Augusta Gainor (some sources stated Gainer) in Germantown, Philadelphia. Nicknamed \"Lolly\" as a child, she was the younger of two daughters born to Laura (Buhl) and Frank De Witt Gainor. Frank Gainor worked as a theatrical painter and paperhanger. When Gaynor was a toddler, her father began teaching her how to sing, dance, and perform acrobatics. As a child in Philadelphia, she began acting in school plays. After her parents divorced in 1914, Gaynor, her sister, and her mother moved to Chicago. Shortly thereafter, her mother married electrician Harry C. Jones. The family later moved to San Francisco.\nAfter graduating from San Francisco Polytechnic High School in 1923, Gaynor spent the winter in Melbourne, Florida, where she did stage work. Upon returning to San Francisco, Gaynor, her mother, and stepfather moved to Los Angeles, where she could pursue an acting career. She was initially hesitant to do so and enrolled at Hollywood Secretarial School. She supported herself by working in a shoe store and later as a theatre usher. Her mother and stepfather continued to encourage her to become an actress and she began making the rounds to the studios (accompanied by her stepfather) to find film work.\nGaynor won her first professional acting job on December 26, 1924, as an extra in a Hal Roach comedy short. This led to more extra work in feature films and shorts for Film Booking Offices of America and Universal. Universal eventually hired her as a stock player for $50 a week. Six weeks after being hired by Universal, an executive at Fox Film Corporation offered her a screen test for a supporting role in the film \"The Johnstown Flood\" (1926). Her performance in the film caught the attention of Fox executives, who signed her to a five-year contract and began to cast her in leading roles.\nLater that year, Gaynor was selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars (along with Joan Crawford, Dolores del R\u00edo, Mary Astor, and others).\nCareer.\nBy 1927, Gaynor was one of Hollywood's leading ladies. Her image was that of a sweet, wholesome and pure young woman, who was notable for playing her roles with depth and sensitivity. Her performances in \"7th Heaven\", the first of 12 films she would make with actor Charles Farrell; \"\", directed by F. W. Murnau; and \"Street Angel\", also with Charles Farrell, earned her the first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1929, when for the first and only time the award was granted for multiple roles, on the basis of total recent work rather than for one particular performance. This practice was prohibited three years later by a new Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences rule. Gaynor was not only the first actress to win the award, but at 22, was the youngest until 1986, when actress Marlee Matlin, 21, won for her role in \"Children of a Lesser God\".\nGaynor was one of only a handful of established lead actresses who made a successful transition to sound films. In 1929, she was re-teamed with Charles Farrell (the pair was known as \"America's favorite love birds\") for the musical film \"Sunny Side Up\".\nDuring the early 1930s, Gaynor was one of Fox's most popular actresses and one of Hollywood's biggest box-office draws. In 1931 and 1932, she and Marie Dressler were tied as the number-one draw at the box office. After Dressler's death in 1934, Gaynor held the top spot alone. She often was cited as a successor to Mary Pickford, and was cast in remakes of two Pickford films: \"Daddy Long Legs\" (1931) and \"Tess of the Storm Country\" (1932). Gaynor drew the line at a proposed remake of \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\", which she considered \"too juvenile\".\nGaynor continued to garner top billing for roles in \"State Fair\" (1933) with Will Rogers and \"The Farmer Takes a Wife\" (1935), which introduced Henry Fonda to the screen as Gaynor's leading man. However, when Darryl F. Zanuck merged his fledgling studio, Twentieth Century Pictures, with Fox Film Corporation to form 20th Century-Fox, her status became precarious, and even tertiary to those of burgeoning actresses Loretta Young and Shirley Temple. According to press reports at the time, Gaynor held out on signing with 20th Century-Fox until her salary was raised from $1,000 per week to $3,000. The studio quickly issued a statement denying that Gaynor was holding out for more money. She quietly signed a new contract, the terms of which were never made public.\nGaynor received top billing above Constance Bennett, Loretta Young, and Tyrone Power in \"Ladies in Love\" (1937), but her box-office appeal had begun to wane: Once ranked number one, she had dropped to number 24. She considered retiring due to her frustration with studio executives, who continued to cast her in the same type of role that brought her fame, while audiences' tastes were changing. After 20th Century-Fox executives proposed that her contract be re-negotiated, and that she be demoted to featured player status, Gaynor left the studio, but her retirement plans were quashed when David O. Selznick offered her the leading role in a new film to be produced by his company, Selznick International Pictures. Selznick, who was friendly with Gaynor off-screen, was convinced that audiences would enjoy seeing her portray a character closer to her true personality. He believed that she possessed the perfect combination of humor, charm, vulnerability, and innocence for the role of aspiring actress Esther Blodgett (later Vicki Lester) in \"A Star Is Born\". Gaynor accepted the role. The romantic drama was filmed in Technicolor, and co-starred Fredric March. Released in 1937, it was an enormous hit, and earned Gaynor her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; she lost to Luise Rainer for \"The Good Earth\".\n\"A Star Is Born\" revitalized Gaynor's career, and she was cast in the screwball comedy \"The Young in Heart\" (1938) with Paulette Goddard. That film was a modest hit, but by then, Gaynor had definitely decided to retire. She later explained: \"I had been working steadily for 17 long years; making movies was really all I knew of life. I just wanted to have time to know other things. Most of all, I wanted to fall in love. I wanted to get married. I wanted a child. And I knew that in order to have these things, one had to make time for them. So, I simply stopped making movies. Then, as if by a miracle, everything I really wanted happened.\" At the top of the industry, she retired at age 33.\nLater years.\nIn August 1939, Gaynor married Hollywood costume designer Adrian, with whom she had a son in 1940. The couple divided their time between their 250-acre cattle ranch in An\u00e1polis, Brazil, and their homes in New York and California. Both were also heavily involved in the fashion and arts community. Gaynor returned to acting in the early 1950s with appearances in live television series, including \"Medallion Theatre\", \"Lux Video Theatre\", and \"General Electric Theater\". In 1957, she appeared in her final film role as Dick Sargent's mother in the musical comedy \"Bernardine\", starring Pat Boone and Terry Moore. In November 1959, she made her stage debut in the play \"The Midnight Sun\" in New Haven, Connecticut. The play, which Gaynor later called \"a disaster\", was not well received and closed shortly after its debut.\nGaynor also became an accomplished oil painter of vegetable and flower still lifes. She sold over 200 paintings and had four showings under the Wally Findlay Galleries banner in New York, Chicago, and Palm Beach from 1975 to February 1982.\nIn 1980, Gaynor made her Broadway debut as Maude in the stage adaptation of the 1971 film \"Harold and Maude\". She received good reviews for her performance, but the play was panned by critics and closed after 21 performances. Later that year, she reunited with her \"Servants' Entrance\" co-star Lew Ayres to film an episode of the anthology series \"The Love Boat\". It was the first television appearance Gaynor had made since the 1950s and was her last screen role. In February 1982, she starred in the touring production of \"On Golden Pond\". This was her final acting role.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and relationships.\nGaynor was romantically involved with her friend and frequent co-star Charles Farrell during their work together in silent films until she married her first husband. Choosing to keep their relationship out of the public eye, Gaynor and Farrell were often assisted by a mutual friend Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in maintaining the ruse. Looking back, Fairbanks would later recall, \"We three were so chummy that I became their 'beard,' the cover-up for their secret romance. I would drive them out to a little rundown, wooden house well south of Los Angeles, near the sea. I'd leave them there and go sailing or swimming until [it was] time to collect them and then we'd all have a bit of dinner.\"\nAccording to Gaynor's biographer Sarah Baker, Farrell proposed marriage during the filming of \"Lucky Star\", but the two never followed through with it. In her later years, Gaynor would hold their different personalities accountable for their eventual separation.\nGaynor was married three times and had one child. Her first marriage was to lawyer Jesse Lydell Peck, whom she married on September 11, 1929. Gaynor's attorney announced the couple's separation in late December 1932. She was granted a divorce on April 7, 1933. On August 14, 1939, she married MGM costume designer Adrian in Yuma, Arizona. This relationship has been called a lavender marriage because Adrian was openly gay within the film community, and Gaynor herself was rumored to be bisexual. The couple had one son, Robin Gaynor Adrian, born in 1940. Gaynor and Adrian remained married until Adrian's death from a stroke on September 13, 1959.\nOn December 24, 1964, Gaynor married her longtime friend, stage producer Paul Gregory, to whom she remained married until her death. The two maintained a home in Desert Hot Springs, California, and owned 3,000 acres of land in Brazil, situated near Bras\u00edlia.\nFriendship with Margaret Lindsay.\nMargaret Lindsay and Gaynor appeared together in the film \"Paddy the Next Best Thing\" (1933). Lindsay and Gaynor often vacationed together for the next several years.&lt;ref name=\"bridgemanimages/5802923\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"queen.spaceports/Lindsay\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nFriendship with Mary Martin.\nGaynor and her husband Paul Gregory traveled frequently with her close friend Mary Martin and her husband Richard Halliday. A Brazilian press report noted that Gaynor and Martin briefly lived with their respective husbands in An\u00e1polis, state of Goi\u00e1s at a ranch (\"fazenda\" in Portuguese) in the 1950s and 1960s. Both houses remain intact as of 2021. There is a project by the Jan Magalinski Institute to restore their houses to create a Cinema Museum of Goi\u00e1s.\nCar wreck and eventual death.\nOn the evening of September 5, 1982, Gaynor, her husband Paul Gregory, actress Mary Martin, and Martin's manager Ben Washer, en route to a Chinatown restaurant,&lt;ref name=\"cdnc/DS19821215.2.36\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; were involved in a serious car wreck in San Francisco. A van ran a red light at the corner of California and Franklin Streets and crashed into the Luxor taxicab in which the group was riding, knocking it into a tree. Ben Washer was killed, Mary Martin sustained two broken ribs and a broken pelvis, and Gaynor's husband suffered two broken legs. Gaynor sustained several serious injuries, including 11 broken ribs, a fractured collarbone, pelvic fractures, a punctured lung, and injuries to her bladder and kidney. Robert Cato, the driver of the van, was arrested on two counts of felony drunk driving, reckless driving, speeding, running a red light, and vehicular homicide.&lt;ref name=\"wapo/1982/09/07/martin-gaynor-hurt-traffic\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nCato, a former policeman, in the previous year, had been charged with two felonies for using his car as a deadly weapon against a motorist, Mellicent Wauters, a dental assistant and amateur actress,&lt;ref name=\"ebay/204315878614\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had argued over a parking spot.&lt;ref name=\"upi/4923400305600\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cato had been placed on informal probation; subsequently, the charges had been dropped.&lt;ref name=\"upi/6094400478400/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nCato pleaded not guilty and was later released on $10,000 bail (equivalent to $ in 2024). On March 15, 1983, he was found guilty of drunk driving and vehicular homicide and was sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref name=\"newspapers.com/56532302\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAs a result of her injuries, Gaynor was hospitalized for four months and underwent two surgeries to repair a perforated bladder and internal bleeding. She recovered sufficiently to return to her home in Desert Hot Springs, but continued to experience health issues due to the injuries and required frequent hospitalizations. Shortly before her death, she was hospitalized for pneumonia and other ailments. On September 14, 1984, Gaynor died at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs at the age of 77. Her doctor, Bart Apfelbaum, attributed her death to the 1982 car wreck and stated that Gaynor \"never recovered\" from her injuries. In September 1984, these injuries were officially ruled to have caused her death.&lt;ref name=\"nytimes/coroner-rules-death-result-82-accident\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nGaynor is buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery next to her second husband, Adrian. Her headstone reads \"Janet Gaynor Gregory\", her legal name after her marriage to her third husband, producer and director Paul Gregory.\nHonors.\nIn 1929, at 23 years old, Gaynor won the first Academy Award for Best Actress.\nFor her contribution to the motion picture industry, Gaynor has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6284 Hollywood Blvd.\nOn March 1, 1978, Howard W. Koch, then the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, presented Gaynor with a citation for her \"truly immeasurable contribution to the art of motion pictures\".\nIn 1979, Gaynor was awarded the Order of the Southern Cross for her cultural contributions to Brazil.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45795", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45795", "title": "Natural capital", "text": "World's stock of natural resources\nNatural capital is the world's stock of natural resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called ecosystem services. All of these underpin our economy and society, and thus make human life possible.\nIt is an extension of the economic notion of capital (resources which enable the production of more resources) to goods and services provided by the natural environment. For example, a well-maintained forest or river may provide an indefinitely sustainable flow of new trees or fish, whereas over-use of those resources may lead to a permanent decline in timber availability or fish stocks. Natural capital also provides people with essential services, like water catchment, erosion control and crop pollination by insects, which in turn ensure the long-term viability of other natural resources. Since the continuous supply of services from the available natural capital assets is dependent upon a healthy, functioning environment, the structure and diversity of habitats and ecosystems are important components of natural capital. Methods, called 'natural capital asset checks', help decision-makers understand how changes in the current and future performance of natural capital assets will impact human well-being and the economy. Unpriced natural capital is what we refer to when businesses or individuals exploit or abuse nature without being held accountable, which can harm ecosystems and the environment. \nHistory of the concept.\nThe term 'natural capital' was first used in 1973 by E. F. Schumacher in his book \"Small Is Beautiful\" and was developed further by Herman Daly, Robert Costanza, and other founders of the science of Ecological Economics, as part of a comprehensive critique of the shortcomings of conventional economics. Natural capital is a concept central to economic assessment ecosystem services valuation which revolves around the idea, that non-human life produces goods and services that are essential to life. Thus, natural capital is essential to the sustainability of the economy.\nIn a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be classified as \"land\" distinct from traditional \"capital\". The historical distinction between \"land\" and \"capital\" defined \"land\" as naturally occurring with a fixed supply, whereas \"capital\", as originally defined referred only to man-made goods. (e.g., Georgism) It is, however, misleading to view \"land\" as if its productive capacity is fixed, because natural capital can be improved or degraded by the actions of man over time (see Environmental degradation). Moreover, natural capital yields benefits and goods, such as timber or food, which can be harvested by humans. These benefits are similar to those realized by owners of infrastructural capital which yields more goods, such as a factory that produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples.\nEcologists are teaming up with economists to measure and express values of the wealth of ecosystems as a way of finding solutions to the biodiversity crisis. Some researchers have attempted to place a dollar figure on ecosystem services such as the value that the Canadian boreal forest's contribution to global ecosystem services. If ecologically intact, the boreal forest has an estimated value of US$3.7 trillion. The boreal forest ecosystem is one of the planet's great atmospheric regulators and it stores more carbon than any other biome on the planet. The annual value for ecological services of the Boreal Forest is estimated at US$93.2 billion, or 2.5 greater than the annual value of resource extraction.\nThe economic value of 17 ecosystem services for the entire biosphere (calculated in 1997) has an estimated average value of US$33 trillion per year. These ecological economic values are not currently included in calculations of national income accounts, the GDP and they have no price attributes because they exist mostly outside of the global markets. The loss of natural capital continues to accelerate and goes undetected or ignored by mainstream monetary analysis.\nWithin the international community the basic principle is not controversial, although much uncertainty exists over how best to value different aspects of ecological health, natural capital and ecosystem services. Full-cost accounting, triple bottom line, measuring well-being and other proposals for accounting reform often include suggestions to measure an \"ecological deficit\" or \"natural deficit\" alongside a social and financial deficit. It is difficult to measure such a deficit without some agreement on methods of valuation and auditing of at least the global forms of natural capital (e.g. value of air, water, soil).\nAll uses of the term currently differentiate natural from man-made or infrastructural capital in some way. Indicators adopted by United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to measure natural biodiversity use the term in a slightly more specific way. According to the OECD, natural capital is \"natural assets in their role of providing natural resource inputs and environmental services for economic production\" and is \"generally considered to comprise three principal categories: natural resources stocks, land, and ecosystems.\"\nThe concept of \"natural capital\" has also been used by the Biosphere 2 project, and the Natural Capitalism economic model of Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins. Recently, it has begun to be used by politicians, notably Ralph Nader, Paul Martin Jr., and agencies of the UK government, including its Natural Capital Committee and the London Health Observatory.\nIn \"\" the author claims that the \"next industrial revolution\" depends on the espousal of four central strategies: \"the conservation of resources through more effective manufacturing processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining natural resources.\"\nNatural capital declaration.\nIn June 2012 a 'natural capital declaration' (NCD) was launched at the Rio+20 summit held in Brazil. An initiative of the global finance sector, it was signed by 40 CEOs to 'integrate natural capital considerations into loans, equity, fixed income and insurance products, as well as in accounting, disclosure and reporting frameworks.' They worked with supporting organisations to develop tools and metrics to integrate natural capital factors into existing business structures.\nIn summary, its four key aims are to:\nNatural Capital Protocol.\nIn July 2016, the Natural Capital Coalition (now known as Capitals Coalition) released the Natural Capital Protocol. The Protocol provides a standardised framework for organisations to identify, measure and value their direct and indirect impacts and dependencies on natural capital. The Protocol harmonises existing tools and methodologies, and guides organisations towards the information they need to make strategic and operational decisions that include impacts and dependencies on natural capital.\nThe Protocol was developed in a unique collaboration between 38 organisations who signed voluntary, pre-competitive contracts. This collaboration was led by Mark Gough, who is now the CEO of the Capitals Coalition.\nThe Protocol is available on a creative commons license and is free for organisations to apply.\nInternationally agreed standard.\nEnvironmental-economic accounts provide the conceptual framework for integrated statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy, including the impacts of the economy on the environment and the contribution of the environment to the economy. A coherent set of indicators and descriptive statistics can be derived from the accounts that inform a wide range of policies.\nThese include, but are not limited to:\nThe System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) contains the internationally agreed standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables for producing internationally comparable statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy. The SEEA is a flexible system in the sense that its implementation can be adapted to countries' specific situations and priorities. Coordination of the implementation of the SEEA and ongoing work on new methodological developments is managed and supervised by the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting (UNCEEA). The final, official version of the SEEA Central Framework was published in February 2014.\nIn March 2021, the United Nations Statistical Commission adopted the SEEA Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) standard at its 52nd session. The SEEA EA is a statistical framework that provides a coherent accounting approach to the measurement of ecosystems. Ecosystem accounts enable the presentation of data and indicators of ecosystem extent, ecosystem condition, and ecosystem services in both physical and monetary terms in a spatially explicit way. Following its adoption, the Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3) released the ARIES for SEEA Explorer in April 2021, an artificial intelligence-powered tool based on the Artificial Intelligence for Environment and Sustainability (ARIES) platform for rapid, standardized and customizable natural capital accounting. The ARIES for SEEA Explorer was made available on the UN Global Platform in order to accelerate SEEA's implementation worldwide.\nPrivate sector approaches.\nSome studies envisage a private sector natural capital 'ecosystem', including investors, assets and regulators.Classification of natural capital aids decisions makers and the ability of governments and businesses to monitor their natural capital assets. There are several proposed systems to classify natural capital into parts, such as land or timber, however many of them do not include all aspects of natural systems.\nOne approach has been the invention of Natural Asset Companies a form of investment in natural capital. \nSeveral governments have implemented policies to incentivize the private sector to protect natural capital. The operations and practices of businesses have not dramatically altered. \nCriticism.\nWhilst measuring the components of natural capital in any region is a relatively straightforward process, both the task and the rationale of putting a monetary valuation on them, or on the value of the goods and services they freely give us, has proved more contentious.\nWithin the UK, \"Guardian\" columnist, George Monbiot, has been critical of the work of the government's Natural Capital Committee and of other attempts to place any sort of monetary value on natural capital assets, or on the free ecosystem services they provide us with. In a speech referring to a report to government which suggested that better protection of the UK's freshwater ecosystems would yield an enhancement in aesthetic value of \u00a3700m, he derided attempts 'to compare things which cannot be directly compared'. He went on to say:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These figures, ladies and gentlemen, are marmalade. They are finely shredded, boiled to a pulp, heavily sweetened ... and still indigestible. In other words they are total gibberish.\u2014\u200a\nThis idea is echoed by Brown University professor Jeff Todd Tinton, who argues that predictions of economic value are unlikely to be accurate because of how complicated the environment is. Furthermore, he argues that the current understanding of environmental capital does not adequately address the importance the environment has on culture. Cultural values are not able to be labeled with a dollar amount, so there will be aspects of nature and the environment that natural capital does not take into account.\nOthers have defended efforts to integrate the valuation of natural capital into local and national economic decision-making, arguing that it puts the environment on a more balanced footing when weighed against other commercial pressures, and that 'valuation' of those assets is not the same as monetisation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first described in 1821 on the basis of a skin of an individual from China. The clouded leopard has large dusky-grey blotches and irregular spots and stripes reminiscent of clouds. Its head-and-body length ranges from with a long tail. It uses its tail for balancing when moving in trees and is able to climb down vertical tree trunks head first. It rests in trees during the day and hunts by night on the forest floor.\nThe clouded leopard is the sister taxon to other pantherine cats, having genetically diverged 9.32 to 4.47 million years ago. Today, the clouded leopard is locally extinct in Singapore, Taiwan, and possibly also in Hainan Island and Vietnam. The wild population is believed to be in decline, with fewer than 10,000 adults and no more than 1,000 in any subpopulation. It has therefore been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2008. The population is threatened by large-scale deforestation and commercial poaching for the wildlife trade. Its body parts are offered for decoration and clothing, though it is legally protected in most range countries.\nThe clouded leopard has been kept in zoological gardens since the early 20th century. Captive breeding programs were initiated in the 1980s. In captivity, the clouded leopard has an average lifespan of 11 years.\nTaxonomy and phylogeny.\n\"Felis nebulosa\" was proposed by Edward Griffith in 1821 who first described a skin of a clouded leopard that was brought alive from Guangdong in China to the menagerie at Exeter Exchange in London.\n\"Felis macrosceloides\" proposed by Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1841 was a clouded leopard specimen from Nepal.\n\"Felis brachyura\" proposed by Robert Swinhoe in 1862 was a clouded leopard skin from Taiwan.\nThe generic name \"Neofelis\" was proposed by John Edward Gray in 1867 who subordinated all three to this genus.\nAt present, \"N. nebulosa\" is considered a monotypic species due to lack of evidence for subspeciation.\n\"Felis diardi\" proposed by Georges Cuvier in 1823 was based on a clouded leopard skin from Java.\nIt was considered a clouded leopard subspecies by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1917. In 2006, it was identified as a distinct \"Neofelis\" species, the Sunda clouded leopard. Populations in Taiwan and Hainan Island are considered to belong to the mainland clouded leopard.\nPhylogeny.\nSkulls of clouded leopard and \"Panthera\" species were analysed morphologically in the 1960s. Results indicate that the clouded leopard forms an evolutionary link between the Pantherinae and the Felinae.\nPhylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in the Miocene around https:// 8.38 in Asia. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at https:// 6.46.\nThe clouded leopard is the sister taxon to all other members of the Pantherinae, diverging https:// 4.47, based on analysis of their nuclear DNA.\nThe clouded leopard from mainland Asia reached Borneo and Sumatra via a now submerged land bridge probably during the Pleistocene, when populations became isolated during periods of global cooling and warming. Genetic analysis of hair samples of the clouded leopard and its sister species the Sunda clouded leopard (\"N. diardi\") indicates that they diverged 2.0\u20130.93 million years ago.\nCharacteristics.\nThe clouded leopard's fur is of a dark grey or ochreous ground-color, often largely obliterated by black and dark dusky-grey blotched pattern. There are black spots on the head, and the ears are black. Partly fused or broken-up stripes run from the corner of the eyes over the cheek, from the corner of the mouth to the neck, and along the nape to the shoulders. Elongated blotches continue down the spine and form a single median stripe on the loins. Two large blotches of dark dusky-grey hair on the side of the shoulders are each emphasized posteriorly by a dark stripe, which passes on to the foreleg and breaks up into irregular spots. The flanks are marked by dark dusky-grey irregular blotches bordered behind by long, oblique, irregularly curved or looped stripes. These blotches yielding the clouded pattern suggest the English name of the cat. The underparts and legs are spotted, and the tail is marked by large, irregular, paired spots. Its legs are short and stout, and paws broad. Females are slightly smaller than males.\nIts hyoid bone is ossified, making it possible to purr. Its pupils contract into vertical slits. Irises are brownish yellow to grayish green. Melanistic clouded leopards are uncommon. It has rather short limbs compared to the other big cats. Its hind limbs are longer than its front limbs to allow for increased jumping and leaping capabilities. Its ulnae and radii are not fused, which also contributes to a greater range of motion when climbing trees and stalking prey. Clouded leopards weigh between . Females vary in head-to-body length from , with a tail long. Males are larger at with a tail long. \nIts shoulder height varies from .\nIts skull is long and low with strong occipital and sagittal crests. The canine teeth are exceptionally long, the upper being about three times as long as the basal width of the socket. The first premolar is usually absent. The upper pair of canines measure or longer.\nIt has a bite force at the canine tip of 544.3 Newton and a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 122.4.\nThe clouded leopard is often referred to as a \"modern-day sabre-tooth\" because it has the largest canines in proportion to its body size.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe clouded leopard occurs from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal, Bhutan and India to Myanmar, southeastern Bangladesh, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia and to south of the Yangtze River in China. It is locally extinct in Singapore and Taiwan.\nClouded leopards were found in Nepal in 1987 and 1988, having previously been presumed to be extinct in the country. Since then, the clouded leopard has been recorded in Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park and in Annapurna Conservation Area. Between 2014 and 2015, it was also recorded in Langtang National Park at an elevation range of .\nIn India, it occurs in the states of Sikkim, northern West Bengal, Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, as well as in the Meghalaya subtropical forests. In Pakke Tiger Reserve, a clouded leopard was photographed in semi-evergreen forest at an elevation of . In Sikkim, clouded leopards were photographed by camera traps at elevations of between April 2008 and May 2010 in the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve. In Manas National Park, 16 individuals were recorded during a survey in November 2010 to February 2011. Between January 2013 and March 2018, clouded leopards were also recorded in Dampa Tiger Reserve, Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary and Singchung-Bugun Village Community Reserve, in Meghalaya's Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary and Balpakram-Baghmara landscape.\nIn Bhutan, it was recorded in Royal Manas National Park, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, Jigme Dorji National Park, Phrumsengla National Park, Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary and several non-protected areas. In Bangladesh, it was recorded in Sangu Matamuhari in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in 2016. In Myanmar, it was recorded by camera traps for the first time in the hill forests of Karen State in 2015.\nIn Thailand, it inhabits relatively open, dry tropical forest in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and closed-forest habitats in Khao Yai National Park. In Laos, it was recorded in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area in dry evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. In Cambodia, it was recorded in deciduous dipterocarp forest in Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary between 2008 and 2009, and in Central Cardamom Mountains National Park, Southern Cardamom National Park, Botum Sakor National Park and Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary between 2012 and 2016. In Peninsular Malaysia, it was recorded in Taman Negara National Park, Ulu Muda Forest, Pasoh Forest Reserve, Belum-Temengor, Temengor Forest Reserve and in a few linkages between 2009 and 2015.\nThe last confirmed record of a Formosan clouded leopard dates to 1989, when the skin of a young individual was found in the Taroko National Park. It was not recorded during an extensive camera trapping survey conducted from 1997 to 2012 in more than 1,450 sites inside and outside Taiwanese protected areas.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nThe clouded leopard is a solitary cat. Early accounts depict it as a rare, secretive, arboreal, and nocturnal inhabitant of dense primary forest.\nIt is one of the most talented climbers among the cats. Captive clouded leopards have been observed to climb down vertical tree trunks head first, and hang on to branches with their hind paws bent around branchings of tree limbs. They are capable of supination and can hang down from branches only by bending their hind paws and their tail around them. They can jump up to high.\nThey use trees as daytime rest sites, but also spend time on the ground when hunting at night. Captive clouded leopards have been observed to scent mark by spraying urine and rubbing their heads on prominent objects.\nTheir vocalisations include a short high-pitched meow call, a loud crying call, both emitted when a cat is trying to locate another one over a long or short distance; they prusten and raise their muzzle when meeting each other in a friendly manner; when aggressive, they growl with a low-pitched sound and hiss with exposed teeth and wrinkled nose.\nRadio-collared clouded leopards were foremost active by night but also showed crepuscular activity peaks.\nClouded leopards recorded in northeast India were most active in the late evening after sunset.\nHome ranges have only been estimated in Thailand:\nIn 2016, clouded leopards were detected in the forest complex of Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Khao Sok National Park during camera trapping surveys; 15 individuals were identified in a core zone of with population density estimated at 5.06 individuals per ; but only 12 individuals were identified in an edge zone of , which is more disturbed by humans, with density estimated at 3.13 individuals per .\nHunting and diet.\nWhen hunting, the clouded leopard stalks its prey or waits for the prey to approach. After making and feeding on a kill, it usually retreats into trees to digest and rest. Its prey includes both arboreal and terrestrial vertebrates.\nPocock presumed that it is adapted for preying upon herbivorous mammals of considerable bulk because of its powerful build, long canines and the deep penetration of its bites. In Thailand, clouded leopards have been observed preying on southern pig-tailed macaque (\"Macaca nemestrina\"), Indian hog deer (\"Axis porcinus\"), Asiatic brush-tailed porcupine (\"Atherurus macrourus\"), Malayan pangolin (\"Manis javanica\") and Berdmore's ground squirrel (\"Menetes berdmorei\"). In India, a clouded leopard also preyed on a Bengal slow loris (\"Nycticebus bengalensis\"). Known prey species in China include barking deer (\"Muntiacus\" sp.) and pheasants.\nIn northern Peninsular Malaysia, a male clouded leopard was photographed while carrying a binturong (\"Arctictis binturong\") in its jaws.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nBoth males and females average 26 months at first reproduction. The female is in estrus for about six days, with her estrous cycle lasting about 30 days. In the wild, mating usually occurs between December and March. The pair mates multiple times over the course of several days. The male grasps the female by the neck who responds with vocalization. Occasionally, he also bites her during courtship and is very aggressive during sexual encounters. Females can bear one litter each year. The male is not involved in raising the cubs.\nThe female gives birth to a litter of one to five, mostly three cubs, after a gestation period of 93 \u00b1 6 days. Cubs are born with closed eyes and weigh from . Their spots are solid dark, rather than dark rings. Their eyes open after about 10 days. They are active within five weeks and fully weaned at around three months of age. They attain the adult coat pattern at around six months and become independent after around 10 months.\nCaptive clouded leopards have an average lifespan of 11 years.\nOne individual has lived to be almost 17 years old.\nThe generation length of the clouded leopard is about seven years.\nThreats.\nClouded leopard require larger areas of intact forest than are present in many parts of their range. They are threatened by habitat loss following large\u2013scale deforestation and commercial poaching for the wildlife trade. In Myanmar, 301 body parts of at least 279 clouded leopards, mostly skins and skeletons, were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006, despite the protected status of clouded leopards in Myanmar. Some markets are located near Myanmar's borders with China and Thailand and are used to facilitate cross-border smuggling.\nIn Nepal, 27 cases of clouded leopard body parts were discovered between November 1988 and March 2020 in nine districts of the country, comprising at least 51 individual clouded leopards. In 17 of these cases, the poachers and traders were arrested.\nConservation.\nThe clouded leopard is listed in CITES Appendix I. Hunting is banned in Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. These bans, however, are poorly enforced in India, Malaysia and Thailand.\nIn the United States, the clouded leopard is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, prohibiting trade in live animals or body parts.\nInternational Clouded Leopard Day is celebrated each year on 4 August since 2018 in zoos and conservation organizations all over the world.\nIn captivity.\nClouded leopards have been kept in zoos since the early 20th century. The international studbook was initiated in the 1970s. Coordinated breeding programs were started in the 1980s and encompass the European Endangered Species Programme, the Species Survival Plan, and the Indian Conservation Breeding Programme. As of 2014, 64 institutions keep clouded leopards.\nEarly captive-breeding programs involving clouded leopards were not successful, largely due to ignorance of their courtship behaviour. Males have the reputation of being aggressive towards females. For breeding success, it has been deemed extremely important that male and female clouded leopards are compatible. Introducing pairs at a young age gives them opportunities to bond and breed successfully. Facilities breeding clouded leopards need to provide the female with a secluded, off-exhibit area. There has been some recent captive breeding success using artificial insemination with cubs successfully born in 1992, 2015 and 2017.\nA study on morbidity and mortality rate of 271 captive clouded leopards across 44 zoos in Europe, Asia and Australia showed that 17% of them died because of respiratory disease, 12% due to maternal neglect and starvation, 10% from generalized infectious disease, 10% from digestive diseases, and 10% from trauma.\nIn March 2011, two breeding females at the Nashville Zoo at Grassmere gave birth to three cubs, which were raised by zookeepers. Each cub weighed . In June 2011, two cubs were born at the Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium. The breeding pair was brought from the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand in an ongoing education and research exchange program. Four cubs were born at Nashville Zoo in 2012. In May 2015, four cubs were born in Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium.\nIn culture.\nThe clouded leopard is the state animal of the Indian state of Meghalaya. In the 1970s, the print of Rama Samaraweera's painting \"Clouded leopard\" was a best-seller in the US.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45800", "revid": "10951369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45800", "title": "Public capital", "text": "Public capital is the aggregate body of government-owned assets that are used as a means for productivity. Such assets span a wide range including: large components such as highways, airports, roads, transit systems, and railways; local, municipal components such as public education, public hospitals, police and fire protection, prisons, and courts; and critical components including water and sewer systems, public electric and gas utilities, and telecommunications. Often, public capital is defined as government outlay, in terms of money, and as physical stock, in terms of infrastructure.\nCurrent state in the U.S..\nIn 1988, the U.S. infrastructure system including all public and private non-residential capital stock was valued at $7 trillion, an immense portfolio to operate and manage. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2004 the U.S. invested $400 billion in infrastructure capital across federal, state, and local levels including the private sectors on transportation networks, schools, highways, water systems, energy, and telecommunications services. While public spending on infrastructure grew by 1.7% annually between 1956 and 2004, it has remained constant as a share of GDP since early 1980s. Despite the value and investment of public capital, growing delays in air and surface transportation, aging electric grid, an untapped renewable energy sector, and inadequate school facilities all have justified additional funding in public capital investment.\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers have continued to give low marks, averaging a D grade, for the nation's infrastructure since its inception of the Report Card in 1998. In 2009, each category of infrastructure varied from C+ to D\u2212 grades with an estimated $2.2 trillion of needed public capital investment. The aviation sector remains mired in continued delays in the reauthorization of federal programs and an outdated air traffic control system. One in four rural bridges and one in three urban bridges are structurally deficient. States are understaffed and underfunded to conduct safety inspections of dams. Texas alone has only seven engineers and an annual budget of $435,000 to oversee more than 7,400 dams. Electricity demand outpaces energy supply transmission and generation. Almost half of the water locks maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are functionally obsolete. Drinking water faces an annual shortfall of $11 billion to manage their aging facilities and comply with federal regulations. Leaking pipes lose an estimated of clean drinking water a day. Under tight budgets, national, state, and local parks suffer neglect. Without adequate funding, rail cannot meet future freight tonnage load. Schools require a staggering $127 billion to bring facilities to decent operating condition. Billions of gallons of untreated sewage continue to be discharged into U.S.\u2019s surface waters each year.\nEconomic growth.\nOne of the most classic macroeconomic inquiries is the effect of public capital investment on economic growth. While many analysts debate the magnitude, evidence has shown a statistically significant positive relationship between infrastructure investment and economic performance. U.S. Federal Reserve economist David Alan Aschauer asserted an increase of the public capital stock by 1% would result in an increase of the total factor productivity by 0.4%. Aschauer argues that the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s were partly due to the post-World War II substantial investment in core infrastructure (highways, mass transit, airports, water systems, electric/gas facilities). Conversely, the drop of U.S. productivity growth in the 1970s and 1980s was in response to the decrease of continual public capital investment and not the decline of technological innovation. Likewise, the European Union nations have declined public capital investment through the same years, also witnessing declining productivity growth rates. A similar situation emerges in developing nations. Analyzing OECD and non-OECD countries\u2019 real-GDP growth rates from 1960 to 2000 with public capital as an explanatory variable (not using public investment rates), Arslanalp, Borhorst, Gupta, and Sze (2010) show that increases in the public capital stock does correlate with increases in growth. However, this relationship depends on initial levels of public capital and income levels for the country. Thus, OECD countries witness a stronger positive link in the short term while non-OECD countries experience a stronger positive link in the long term. Hence, developing countries can benefit from non-concessional foreign borrowing to finance high-prospect public capital investments.\nGiven this relationship of public capital and productivity, public capital becomes a third input in the standard, neoclassical production function:\nformula_1\nwhere: \n\"Y\"\"t\" represents real aggregate output of goods and services of the private sector\n\"A\"\"t\" represents productivity factor or Hicks-Neutral technical change\n\"N\"\"t\" represents aggregate employment of labor services\n\"K\"\"t\" represents aggregate stock of nonresidential capital\n\"G\"\"t\" represents flow of public capital stock (assuming services of public capital are proportional to public capital)\nIn this form, public capital has a direct influence on productivity as a third variable. Additionally, public capital has an indirect influence on multifactor productivity as it affects the other two inputs of labor and private capital. Despite this unique nature, public capital investment, used in the production process of nearly every sector, is not sufficient on its own to generate sustained economic growth. Thus, rather than the ends, public capital is the means. That is, instead of being seen as intermediate goods used as resources by businesses, public capital should be seen as goods which are used to make the final goods and services to consumers-taxpayers. Note that public capital levels should not be too high that it leads to financing costs and high tax rates issues which will negate the positive benefits of such investments. Moreover, infrastructure services carry the market-distorting features of pure, non-rival public goods; network externalities; natural monopolies; and the common resource problem such as congestion and overuse.\nEmpirical models that attempt to estimate the public investment and economic growth link involve a wide variety including: the Cobb-Douglas production function; a behavioral approach cost/profit function which includes public capital stock; Vector Auto Regression (VAR) models; and government investment growth regressions. These models nonetheless contend with reverse causality, heterogeneity, endogeneity, and nonlinearities in trying to capture the public capital and economic growth link. New Keynesian models, though, analyze the effect of government spending through the supply side rather than traditional Keynesian models that analyzes it through the demand side. Therefore, a temporary surge of infrastructure investment yields an expansion of output, and vice versa that dwindling infrastructure, like in the 1970s, hamper longer-term movement in productivity. Furthermore, new research on regional growth (as opposed to national growth with GDP) shows a strong positive relationship between public capital and productivity. Both fixed costs and transport costs lower with expanded infrastructure in localities and the resulting cluster of industries. As a result, economic activity grows along its pattern of trade. Therefore, the importance of regional clusters and metropolitan economies comes into effect.\nSocial benefit.\nBeyond economic performance, public capital investment yields returns in quality of life indicators such as health, safety, recreation, aesthetics, and leisure time and activities. In example, highways provide better access and mobility for increased discretionary time and recreational outlets; mass transit can improve air quality with reduced number of private vehicles; improved municipal waste facilities reduces toxic groundwater contamination and better green space aesthetics such as parks; expanded water facilities aids in health and sanitation and environment such as reducing odor and sewer overflows. Furthermore, infrastructure adds to community ambience and quality of place with livelier downtowns, vibrant waterfronts, efficient land uses, compact spaces for commerce and recreation.\nOn the contrary, inadequate public capital impairs quality of life and social well-being. Over-capacity landfills lead to groundwater contamination, having deleterious effects on health. Deficient supply and quality of mass transit services impacts transit-dependents on their access to opportunity and resources. Increasing congestion in airports and roadways causes loss of discretionary time and recreational activities. The lack of efficient U.S. freight and passenger rail service will neither aid in handling the \u201cperfect storm\u201d of environmental and energy sustainability nor meet the global competitive need of transporting goods and services at heightened speeds and times. Also, the continued loss of footing in clean energy technology will contribute to U.S.\u2019s future loss of prosperity on the global stage in terms of the carbon footprint and economy.\nPublic capital initiatives.\nUnited States.\nPerhaps the largest contribution to the public works system in the U.S. came out of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal initiatives particularly the creation of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1935. At a time of a deep economic crisis, the WPA employed at its peak 3.35 million unemployed heads-of-households to work in rebuilding the country. The program helped construct millions of roads, bridges, parks, schools, hospitals, and levees while also providing educational programs, childcare, job training, and medical services. The overall public spending level for the program, unprecedented at the time, was $4.8 billion ($76 billion in 2008 dollars), and helped to stimulate the economy through public works projects.\nSince then, the U.S. has contributed to other large infrastructure programs including the Interstate Highway System, 1956-1990, with a dedicated financing system through the gas tax and a matching contribution between federal government and states at 90% to 10%. Also, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water Act of 1972 provided a public capital investment of $40 billion in constructing and upgrading sewage treatment facilities with \u201csignificant positive impacts on the Nation\u2019s water quality.\u201d Considered by the National Academy of Engineering to be the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century, the North American electric grid carries electricity over on high-voltage transmission lines across the U.S. Though currently facing aging facilities and equipment, this public capital investment has ubiquitously reached millions of homes and businesses.\nRecently, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) is another example of large public capital investment. Of the $311 billion in appropriations, about $120 billion are set aside for crucial investment in Infrastructure and Science and Energy. Some of ARRA's aims include smart grid technology, retrofitting of homes and federal buildings, automated aviation traffic control, advancing freight and passenger rail services, and upgrading water and waste facilities.\nOther countries.\nWorldwide, transformative public capital investments are taking place. China\u2019s ambitious rapid high-speed rail program is estimated to extend 18,000\u00a0km by 2020. By the end of 2008, the country had a fleet of over 24,000 locomotives, the most lines in the world, the fastest express train in service, and longest high-speed track in the world. UK, Denmark, and other countries in northern Europe that surround the Baltic Sea and North Sea, continue to develop their rapid expansion of off-shore wind farms. With continued expansion of terminals and connection to nation's comprehensive transport system, the Hong Kong International Airport is one of the largest engineering and architectural projects in the world. In the last decade, Chile installed five combined cycle gas-turbined (CCGT) power plants to meet its nation's growing energy needs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Physical capital is the apparatus used to produce a good and services. Physical capital represents the tangible man-made goods that help and support the production. Inventory, cash, equipment or real estate are all examples of physical capital.\nDefinition.\nN.G. Mankiw definition from the book Economics: \n\"Capital is the equipment and structures used to produce goods and services. Physical capital consists of man-made goods (or input into the process of production) that assist in the production process. Cash, real estate, equipment, and inventory are examples of physical capital.\"\nCapital goods represents one of the key factors of corporation function. Generally, capital allows a company to preserve liquidity while growing operations, it refers to physical assets in business and the way a company have reached their physical capital. While referring how companies have obtained their capital it is important to consider both - physical capital and human capital. Based on economic theory, physical capital represents one of the three primary factors of production, that is also recognized as inputs production function. The others are natural resources (including land), and labour. The word \"Physical\" is used to distinguish physical capital from human capital and financial capital. \"Physical capital\" denote to fixed capital, all other sorts of real physical asset that are not included in the production of a product is distinguished from circulating capital. \nPhysical capital in accounting.\nBiased on the order of solvency of a physical capital, it is listed on the balance sheet. The impact of investments of human capital and physical capital can be measured and analysed with the same ratios to measure and analyse the investment performance of physical assets. Both of these investments lead to fundamental improvements in the business model and better overall decision-making. The balance sheet provides an overview, which consist of both physical and human capital, of the value of all physical and some non-physical assets, but it also provides an overview of the capital raised to pay for those assets.\nPhysical capital is noted on the balance sheet as an asset at historical cost, not market value. As a result, the book value of assets is generally higher than market value. Accountants refer to physical capital as a tangible asset. Compering the physical capital and human capital is easy to find on the balance, but the human capital is often only assumed. In addition to goodwill, analysts can value the impact of human capital on operations with efficiency ratios, such as return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The value of human capital can be also determined by the investors in the mark-up on products sold or the industry premium on salary, for instance a company is willing to pay more for an experienced programmer who can produce a higher-margin product. In this case the value of the programmer's experience is the amount the company is willing to pay over and above the market price. \nProduction function.\nProduction function definition by N.G. Mankiw:\n\"Production function is the relationship between the quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good.\"\nCo-operation of four factors of production capital, land, labor and organization crates the result in production of goods, biased on this fact no goods can be produced without the help of these four factors, actually all four are usually used in some technical proportion, with the aim to maximize profit with a minimal cost by the best combination of factors of production. Best combination for producer is enabled by applying the principles of equip-marginal returns and substitution. The principle of equip-marginal returns states that, any producer can have maximum production only when the marginal returns of all the factors of production are equal. For instance, when the marginal product of the land is equal to that of labour, capital and organisation, the production becomes maximum. Production function shoes how much output producer can expect in exact proportion of labour and capital as well as of labour etc. Differently, production function is an indicator of the physical relationship between the inputs and output of a firm.\nLike the demand function a production function is for a definite period. It shows the flow of inputs resulting into a flow of output during some time. The production function of a firm depends on the state of technology. With every development in technology the production function of the firm undergoes a change.\nThe new production function brought about by developing technology displays same inputs and more output or the same output with lesser inputs. Sometimes a new production function of the firm may be adverse as it takes more inputs to produce the same output.\nMathematical description of basic relationship between inputs and outputs:\nQ = f (L, C, N)\nQ = Quantity of output\nL = Labour\nC = Capital\nN = Land\nThe level of output (Q) depends on the quantities of different inputs (L, C, N) available to the firm. In the simplest case, where there are only two inputs, labour (L) and capital (C) and one output (Q), the production function becomes.\nQ =f (L, C)\nThe production function is a technical or engineering relation between input and output. If the natural laws of technology remain unchanged, the production function remains unchanged.\nFeatures of production function.\nThe production function consists of 3 main features \u2013 Substitutability, Complementarity and Specificity. 1. Substitutability: By changing the number and amount of some inputs, while the others stay unchanged, we achieve the possibility, to modify the total output. It is the substitutability of the factors of production that gives rise to the laws of variable proportions. 2. Complementarity: is that two or more inputs are to be used together as nothing will be produced if the quantity of either of the inputs used in the production process is zero. Another example of complementarity is the principles of returns to scale of inputs as it reveals that the quantity of all inputs has to increased simultaneously in order to attain a higher scale of total output. 3. Specificity: Every product has its own specific number and type of inputs. Machines and equipment's, specialized workers and raw materials or commodities are a few examples of the specificity of factors of production. This reveals that in the production process none of the factors can be ignored and in some cases ignorance to even slightest extent is not possible if the factors are perfectly specific. Production consists of time; hence, the way the inputs are combined is determined to a large extent by the time period under consideration. The greater the time period, the greater the freedom the producer must vary the quantities of various inputs used in the production process. In the production function, variation in total output by varying the quantities of all inputs is possible only in the long run whereas the variation in total output by varying the quantity of single input may be possible even in the short run.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some have described it as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common purpose, although this does not align with how it has been measured.\nSocial capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived from strategic alliances, and the evolution of communities.\nHistory.\nWhile it has been suggested that the term \"social capital\" was in intermittent use from about 1890, before becoming widely used in the late 1990s, the earliest credited use is by Lyda Hanifan in 1916 (see 20th century below).\nThe debate of community versus modernization of society and individualism has been the most discussed topic among the founders of sociology: such theorists as T\u00f6nnies (1887), Durkheim (1893), Simmel (1905), Weber (1946) were convinced that industrialisation and urbanization were transforming social relationships in an irreversible way. They observed a breakdown of traditional bonds and the progressive development of anomie and alienation in society.\n18th\u201319th century.\nThe power of \"community governance\" has been stressed by many philosophers from antiquity to the 18th century, from Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas, and Edmund Burke. This vision was strongly criticised at the end of the 18th century, with the development of the idea of \"Homo Economicus\" and subsequently with \"rational choice theory\". Such a set of theories became dominant in the last centuries, but many thinkers questioned the complicated relationship between \"modern society\" and the importance of \"old institutions\", in particular family and traditional communities.\nThe concept that underlies social capital has a much longer history; thinkers exploring the relation between associational life and democracy were using similar concepts regularly by the 19th century, drawing on the work of earlier writers such as James Madison (\"The Federalist Papers\") and Alexis de Tocqueville (\"Democracy in America\") to integrate concepts of social cohesion and connectedness into the pluralist tradition in American political science. John Dewey may have made the first direct mainstream use of \"social capital\" in \"The School and Society\" in 1899, though he did not offer a definition.\nIn the first half of the 19th century, de Tocqueville had observations about American life that seemed to outline and define social capital. He observed that Americans were prone to meeting at as many gatherings as possible to discuss all possible issues of state, economics, or the world that could be witnessed. The high levels of transparency caused greater participation from the people and thus allowed for democracy to work better.\n20th century.\nL. J. Hanifan's 1916 article regarding local support for rural schools is one of the first occurrences of the term \"social capital\" in reference to social cohesion and personal investment in the community. In defining the concept, Hanifan contrasts social capital with material goods by defining it as:I do not refer to real estate, or to personal property or to cold cash, but rather to that in life which tends to make these tangible substances count for most in the daily lives of people, namely, goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social intercourse among a group of individuals and families who make up a social unit.\u2026 If he may come into contact with his neighbour, and they with other neighbours, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbours.\nFollowing the works of T\u00f6nnies (1887) and Weber (1946), reflection on social links in modern society continued with interesting contributions in the 1950s and in the 1960s. In particular, \"mass society theory\"\u00a0\u2013 as developed by Daniel Bell (1962), Robert Nisbet (1969), Maurice R. Stein (1960), William H. Whyte (1956)\u00a0\u2013 proposed themes similar to those of the founders, with a more pessimistic emphasis on the development of society. In the words of Stein (1960:1): \"The price for maintaining a society that encourages cultural differentiation and experimentation is unquestionably the acceptance of a certain amount of disorganization on both the individual and social level.\"\nJane Jacobs used the term early in the 1960s. Although she did not explicitly define the term \"social capital\", her usage referred to the value of networks. Political scientist Robert Salisbury advanced the term as a critical component of interest group formation in his 1969 article \"An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups\" in the \"Midwest Journal of Political Science\".\nSociologist Pierre Bourdieu used the term in 1972 in his \"Outline of a Theory of Practice\", and clarified the term some years later in contrast to cultural, economic, administrative capital, physical capital, political capital, social capital and symbolic capital. Sociologists James Coleman (1988), as well as Barry Wellman &amp; Scot Wortley (1990), adopted Glenn Loury's 1977 definition in developing and popularising the concept. In the late 1990s, the concept gained popularity, serving as the focus of a World Bank research programme and the subject of several mainstream books, including Robert Putnam's \"Bowling Alone\", and Putnam &amp; Lewis Feldstein's \"Better Together\".\nAll of these reflections contributed remarkably to the development of the social capital concept in the following decades. The appearance of the modern social capital conceptualization is a new way to look at this debate, keeping together the importance of community to build generalized trust and the same time, the importance of individual free choice, in order to create a more cohesive society. It is for this reason that social capital generated so much interest in the academic and political world.\nDefinitions and forms.\nSocial capital has multiple definitions, interpretations, and uses. David Halpern argues that the popularity of social capital for policymakers is linked to the concept's duality, coming because \"it has a hard nosed economic feel while restating the importance of the social.\" For researchers, the term is popular partly due to the broad range of outcomes it can explain; the multiplicity of uses for social capital has led to a multiplicity of definitions.\nSocial capital has been used at various times to explain superior managerial performance, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, improved performance of functionally diverse groups, the value derived from strategic alliances, and enhanced supply-chain relations. \"A resource that actors derive from specific social structures and then use to pursue their interests; it is created by changes in the relationship among actors\" (Baker 1990, p.\u00a0619).\nEarly attempts to define social capital focused on the degree to which social capital serves as a resource \u2013 be it for public good or private benefit. Robert D. Putnam (1993) suggested that social capital would facilitate co-operation and mutually supportive relations in communities and nations and would therefore be a valuable means of combating many of the social disorders inherent in modern societies, for example crime. In contrast, others focus on the private benefits derived from the web of social relationships in which individual actors find themselves. This is reflected in Nan Lin's concept of social capital as \"Investment in social relations with expected returns in the marketplace.\" This may subsume the concepts of some others such as Bourdieu, Flap and Eriksson. Newton (1997) treats social capital as a subjective phenomenon formed by values and attitudes that influence interactions. Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), in their examination of the role of social capital in the creation of intellectual capital, suggest that social capital should be considered in terms of three clusters: structural, relational, and cognitive.\nDefinitional issues.\nA number of scholars have raised concerns about the imprecision in defining social capital. Portes (2000), for example, notes that the term has become so widely used, including in mainstream media, that \"the point is approaching at which social capital comes to be applied to so many events and in so many different contexts as to lose any distinct meaning.\" The term \"capital\" is used by analogy with other forms of economic capital, as social capital is argued to have similar (although less measurable) benefits. However, the analogy may be misleading in that, unlike financial forms of capital, social capital is not depleted by use; instead, it is depleted by non-use (\"use it or lose it\"). In this respect, it is similar to the economic concept of human capital.\nRobison, Schmid, and Siles (2002) review various definitions of social capital and conclude that many do not satisfy the formal requirements of a definition. They assert that definitions must be of the form A=B, while many explanations of social capital describe what it can be used to achieve, where it resides, how it can be created, or what it can transform. In addition, they argue that many proposed definitions of social capital fail to satisfy the requirements of capital. They propose that social capital be defined as \"sympathy\": the object of another's sympathy has social capital; those who have sympathy for others provide social capital. This proposition appears to follow Adam Smith, \"Theory of Moral Sentiments\" to some degree, but Smith's conceptualization of sympathy (particularly in the first two chapters of this work) appear more concerned with the roles of acceptance or congruence \u2013 in ethics or virtue \u2013 in evaluating an individual's 'propriety of action'.\n\"Social capital\" is different from the economic theory of social capitalism, which challenges the idea that socialism and capitalism are mutually exclusive.\nForms of capital (Bourdieu).\nIn \"The Forms of Capital\", Pierre Bourdieu distinguishes between three forms of capital: economic capital, cultural capital and social capital. He defines \"social capital\" as \"the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.\" His treatment of the concept is instrumental, focusing on the advantages to possessors of social capital and the \"\"deliberate construction of sociability for the purpose of creating this resource\".\" Quite contrary to Putnam's positive view of social capital, Bourdieu employs the concept to demonstrate a mechanism for the generational reproduction of inequality. Bourdieu thus points out that the wealthy and powerful use their \"old boys network\" or other social capital to maintain advantages for themselves, their social class, and their children.\nNorms of trust and reciprocity (Sander, Putnam, Coleman).\nThomas Sander defines it as \"the collective value of all social networks (who people know), and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (norms of reciprocity).\" Social capital, in this view, emphasizes \"specific benefits that flow from the trust, reciprocity, information, and cooperation associated with social networks.\" It \"creates value for the people who are connected, and for bystanders as well.\" Meanwhile, negative norms of reciprocity serve as disincentives for detrimental and violent behaviors.\nJames Coleman defined social capital functionally as \"a variety of entities with two elements in common: they all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of actors...within the structure\"\u00a0\u2013 that is, social capital is anything that facilitates individual or collective action, generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms. In Coleman's conception, social capital is a neutral resource that facilitates any manner of action, but whether society is better off as a result depends entirely on the individual uses to which it is put.\nAccording to Robert D. Putnam, \"social capital\" refers to \"connections among individuals \u2013 social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them.\" In the view of Putnam and his followers, social capital is a key component to building and maintaining democracy. Putnam says that social capital is declining in the United States. This is seen in lower levels of trust in government and lower levels of civic participation. Putnam also suggests that a root cause of the decline in social capital is women's entry into the workforce, which could correlate with time restraints that inhibit civic organizational involvement like parent-teacher associations. Technological transformation of leisure (e.g., television) is another cause of declining social capital, as stated by Putnam. This offered a reference point from which several studies assessed social capital measurements by how media is engaged strategically to build social capital.\nCivic association (Fukuyama).\nIn \"Social Capital, Civil Society, and Development\", political economist Francis Fukuyama defines social capital as generally understood rules that enable people to cooperate such as the norm of reciprocity or religious doctrine like Christianity. Social capital is formed by repeated interactions over time and, he argues, is critical for development and difficult to generate through public policy. The importance of social capital for economic development is that these norms of behavior reduce transaction cost of exchange such as legal contracts and government regulations. Fukuyama suggests that while social capital is beneficial for development, it also imposes cost on non-group members with unintended consequences for general welfare.\nReferencing Alexis de Tocqueville in \"Democracy in America,\" and what he described as the art of association of the American propensity for civil association, Fukuyama argues social capital is what produces a civil society. While civic engagement is an important part of democracy and development, Fukuyama states that, \"one person's civic engagement is another's rent-seeking.\" Therefore, while social capital can facilitate economic development by reducing transaction cost and increasing productivity, social capital can also distort democracy if civic association enables special interest to gain special favors. However, Fukuyama argues despite the risk of society having too much social capital, it is nonetheless worse to have too little and be unable to organize for public goods and welfare enhancing activity.\nSocial ties.\nCarlos Garc\u00eda Tim\u00f3n describes that the structural dimensions of social capital relate to an individual ability to make weak and strong ties to others within a system. This dimension focuses on the advantages derived from the configuration of an actor's, either individual or collective, network. The differences between \"weak\" and \"strong\" ties are explained by Granovetter (1973). Bridging social capital refers to the weak ties that individuals with heterogeneous limited interactions form. Bridging social capital is more likely to provide valuable new information (Moshkovitz and Hayat, 2021). Some others describes the weak and strong ties relationship as bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital refers to strong ties: the intimate relationships people feel close to and trust. The relational dimension focuses on the character of the connection between individuals. This is best characterized through trust of others and their cooperation and the identification an individual has within a network. Hazleton and Kennan (2000) added a third angle, that of communication. Communication is needed to access and use social capital through exchanging information, identifying problems and solutions, and managing conflict.\nAccording to Boisot (1995), and Boland &amp; Tenkasi (1995), meaningful communication requires at least some sharing context between the parties to such exchange. The cognitive dimension focuses on the shared meaning, representations and interpretations that individuals or groups have with one another.\nNegative social capital.\nWhereas some scholars, most prominently Robert D. Putnam, posit that social capital has positive ends, a sizable body of literature finds that social capital can have adverse effects. Research by Sheri Berman and Dylan Riley, as well as economists Shanker Satyanath, Nico Voigtl\u00e4nder, and Hans-Joachim Voth, have linked civic associations to the rise of fascist movements. Pierre Bourdieu's work tends to show how social capital can be used practically to produce or reproduce inequality, demonstrating for instance how people gain access to powerful positions through the direct and indirect employment of social connections.\nAn example of the complexities of the negative of effects social capital is violence or criminal gang activity that is encouraged through the strengthening of intra-group relationships (bonding social capital). The negative consequences of social capital are more often associated with \"bonding\" vis-\u00e0-vis \"bridging\".\nWithout \"bridging\" social capital, \"bonding\" groups can become isolated and disenfranchised from the rest of society and, most importantly, from groups with which bridging must occur in order to denote an \"increase\" in social capital. Bonding social capital is a necessary antecedent for the development of the more powerful form of bridging social capital. Bonding and bridging social capital can work together productively if in balance, or they may work against each other. As social capital bonds and stronger homogeneous groups form, the likelihood of bridging social capital is attenuated. Bonding social capital can also perpetuate sentiments of a certain group, allowing for the bonding of certain individuals together upon a common radical ideal. The strengthening of insular ties can lead to a variety of effects such as ethnic marginalization or social isolation. In extreme cases ethnic cleansing may result if the relationship between different groups is so strongly negative. In mild cases, it isolates certain communities such as suburbs of cities because of the bonding social capital and the fact that people in these communities spend so much time away from places that build bridging social capital.\nAccessibility.\nEdwards and Foley, as editors of a special edition of the \"American Behavioral Scientist\" on \"Social Capital, Civil Society and Contemporary Democracy\", raised two key issues in the study of social capital. First, social capital is not equally available to all, in much the same way that other forms of capital are differently available. Geographic and social isolation limit access to this resource. Second, not all social capital is created equally. The value of a specific source of social capital depends in no small part on the socio-economic position of the source with society.\nOn top of this, Portes (1998) has identified four negative consequences of social capital:\nIn political institutions.\nSocial capital (in the institutional Robert Putnam sense) may also lead to bad outcomes if the political institution and democracy in a specific country is not strong enough and is therefore overpowered by the social capital groups. \"Civil society and the collapse of the Weimar Republic\" suggests that \"it was weak political institutionalization rather than a weak civil society that was Germany's main problem during the Wihelmine and Weimar eras.\" Because the political institutions were so weak people looked to other outlets. \"Germans threw themselves into their clubs, voluntary associations, and professional organizations out of frustration with the failures of the national government and political parties, thereby helping to undermine the Weimar Republic and facilitate Hitler's rise to power.\" In this article about the fall of the Weimar Republic, the author makes the claim that Hitler rose to power so quickly because he was able to mobilize the groups towards one common goal. Even though German society was, at the time, a \"joining\" society these groups were fragmented and their members did not use the skills they learned in their club associations to better their society, but to encourage their values across all cultures to provide a better society for people. They were very introverted in the Weimar Republic. Hitler was able to capitalize on this by uniting these highly bonded groups under the common cause of bringing Germany to the top of world politics. The former world order had been destroyed during World War I, and Hitler believed that Germany had the right and the will to become a dominant global power.\nAdditionally, in his essay \"A Criticism of Putnam's Theory of Social Capital\", Michael Shindler expands upon Berman's argument that Weimar social clubs and similar associations in countries that did not develop democracy, were organized in such a way that they fostered a \"we\" instead of an \"I\" mentality among their members, by arguing that groups which possess cultures that stress solidarity over individuality, even ones that are \"horizontally\" structured and which were also common to pre-Soviet Eastern Europe, will not engender democracy if they are politically aligned with non-democratic ideologies.\nIn race and ethnicity.\nUsing a network-based conception for characterizing the social capital of collectivities (such as organizations or business clusters), Lester, Maheshwari, and McLain (2013) note that negative social capital may be the cause for disadvantageous differences among minority firms versus majority firms. While studying norms among African-American family firms and Euro-American family firms, Lester et al. noted that negative social capital was created when the owner of the company was pressured to engage in social behavior not conducive to firm profits.\nRobert Putnam, in his later work, also suggests that social capital, and the associated growth of public trust are inhibited by immigration and rising racial diversity in communities. Putnam's study regarding the issue argued that in American areas with a lack of homogeneity, some individuals neither participated in bonding nor bridging social capital. In societies where immigration is high (US) or where ethnic heterogeneity is high (Eastern Europe), it was found that citizens lacked in both kinds of social capital and were overall far less trusting of others than members of homogenous communities were found to be. Lack of homogeneity led to people withdrawing from even their closest groups and relationships, creating an atomized society as opposed to a cohesive community. These findings challenge previous beliefs that exposure to diversity strengthens social capital, either through bridging social gaps between ethnicities or strengthening in-group bonds. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital.\nVarshney (2001) studied the correlation between the presence of interethnic networks (\"bridging\") versus intra-ethnic ones (\"bonding\") on ethnic violence in India.\nHe argues that interethnic networks are agents of peace because they build bridges and manage tensions, by noting that if communities are organized only along intra-ethnic lines and the interconnections with other communities are very weak or even nonexistent, then ethnic violence is quite likely.\nThree main implications of intercommunal ties explain their worth:\nThis is a useful distinction; nevertheless, its implication on social capital can only be accepted if one espouses the functionalist understanding of the latter concept. Indeed, it can be argued that interethnic, as well as intra-ethnic networks can serve various purposes, either increasing or diminishing social capital. In fact, Varshney himself notes that intra-ethnic policing (equivalent to the \"self-policing\" mechanism proposed by Fearon and Laitin, 1996) may lead to the same result as interethnic engagement.\nSocial inequality.\nJames Coleman (1988) has indicated that social capital eventually led to the creation of human capital for the future generation. Human capital, a private resource, could be accessed through what the previous generation accumulated through social capital. John Field (2003) suggested that such a process could lead to the very inequality social capital attempts to resolve. While Coleman viewed social capital as a relatively neutral resource, he did not deny the class reproduction that could result from accessing such capital, given that individuals worked toward their own benefit.\nEven though Coleman never truly addresses Pierre Bourdieu in his discussion, this coincides with Bourdieu's argument set forth in \"Reproduction in Education, Society and Culture\". Bourdieu and Coleman were fundamentally different at the theoretical level (as Bourdieu believed the actions of individuals were rarely ever conscious, but more so only a result of their \"habitus\" being enacted within a particular field, but this realization by both seems to undeniably connect their understanding of the more latent aspects of social capital.\nAccording to Bourdieu, habitus refers to the social context within which a social actor is socialized. Thus, it is the social platform, itself, that equips one with the social reality they become accustomed to. Out of habitus comes field, the manner in which one integrates and displays their habitus. To this end, it is the social exchange and interaction between two or more social actors. To illustrate this, we assume that an individual wishes to better his place in society. He therefore accumulates social capital by involving himself in a social network, adhering to the norms of that group, allowing him to later access the resources (e.g. social relationships) gained over time. If, in the case of education, he uses these resources to better his educational outcomes, thereby enabling him to become socially mobile, he effectively has worked to reiterate and reproduce the stratification of society, as social capital has done little to alleviate the system as a whole. This may be one negative aspect of social capital, but seems to be an inevitable one in and of itself, as are all forms of capital.\nPositive consequences of social capital.\nCompared to Bourdieu, Robert D. Putnam has used the concept in a much more positive light: though he was at first careful to argue that social capital was a neutral term, stating \"whether or not [the] shared are praiseworthy is, of course, entirely another matter,\" his work on American society tends to frame social capital as a producer of \"civic engagement\" and also a broad societal measure of communal health. He also transforms social capital from a resource possessed by individuals to an attribute of collectives, focusing on norms and trust as producers of social capital to the exclusion of networks.\nMahyar Arefi (2003) identifies consensus-building as a direct positive indicator of social capital. Consensus implies \"shared interest\" and agreement among various actors and stakeholders to induce collective action. \"Collective action\" is thus an indicator of increased social capital.\nSubtypes.\nBonding, bridging, linking.\nIn \"Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community\" (2000), Harvard political scientist Robert D. Putnam writes:Henry Ward Beecher's advice a century ago to 'multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America \u2013 though it will be \u2013 but because it will be good for us.Putnam speaks of two main components of the concept, the creation of which Putnam credits to Ross Gittell and Avis Vidal:\nTypical examples are that criminal gangs create bonding social capital, while choirs and bowling clubs (hence the title, as Putnam lamented their decline) create bridging social capital. The distinction is useful in highlighting how social capital may not always be beneficial for society as a whole (though it is always an asset for those individuals and groups involved). Horizontal networks of individual citizens and groups that enhance community productivity and cohesion are said to be positive social capital assets whereas self-serving exclusive gangs and hierarchical patronage systems that operate at cross purposes to societal interests can be thought of as negative social capital burdens on society.\nSimilar to Putnam, Daniel P. Aldrich describes three mechanisms of social capital:\nAldrich also applies the ideas of social capital to the fundamental principles of disaster recovery, and discusses factors that either aid or impede recovery, such as extent of damage, population density, quality of government and aid. In his book \"Building Resilience: Social Capital in Post-Disaster Recovery\", he primarily examines Japanese recovery following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown.\nSocial capital development on the internet via social networking websites such as Facebook or Myspace tends to be bridging capital according to one study, though \"virtual\" social capital is a new area of research.\nConsummatory, instrumental.\nThere are two other sub-sources of social capital:\nConsummatory capital.\nConsummatory capital a behavior that is made up of actions that fulfill a basis of doing what is inherent. Two examples of consummatory social capital are value interjection and solidarity.\nValue interjection: refers to the behavior of individuals or groups adhering to societal norms by meeting expected obligations, such as following established rules, timely bill payments, and punctuality. Diligent adherence contributes personal advantages like financial stability and improved relationships, as well as broader societal gains, including enhanced market confidence and perceived reliability.\nColeman goes on to say that when people live in this way and benefit from this type of social capital, individuals in the society are able to rest assured that their belongings and family will be safe. This understanding of solidarity may be traced to 19th century socialist thinkers, whose main focus was the urban working class of the Industrial Revolution. They analyzed the reasons these workers supported each other for the benefit of the group and held that this support was an adaptation to the immediate social environment, as opposed to a trait that had been taught to the workers in their youth. As another example, Coleman states that possessing this type of social capital individuals to stand up for what they believe in, and even die for it, in the face of adversity.\nWhile the notion of \"solidarity as social capital\" is sometimes attributed to Karl Marx, in particular, the term \"social capital\" had a quite different meaning for Marx. All forms of \"capital\" were, for Marx, possessed only by capitalists and he emphasized the basis of labour in capitalist society, as a class constituted by individuals obliged to sell their labour power, because they lacked sufficient capital, in any sense of the word, to do otherwise. Marx saw \"social capital\" as a theoretical total amount of capital, purely in the sense of accumulated wealth or property, that existed in a particular society. He thereby contrasted it with specific and discrete \"individual capital.\"\nInstrumental capital.\nInstrumental capital is behavior that is taught through one's surroundings over time. Individuals donating their resources are not seeking direct repayment from the recipient, but motivated by membership in the same social structure. Donors might not see a direct repayment, but, most commonly, they will be held by the society in greater honor.\nPortes mentions the donation of a scholarship to a member of the same ethnic group as an example of this. The donor is not giving up resources to be directly repaid by the recipient, but, as stated above, the honor of the community. With this in mind, recipients might not know the benefactor personally, but prospers as a member of the same social group.\nSocial capital is also linked with religious communities. Religion represents an important aspect of social capital (religious social capital). However, Putnam found that membership in secular organizations in the United States had a greater association with volunteering, blood donations, charity, and philanthropy than membership in religious organizations, that membership in secular organizations was associated with participation in community projects while membership in religious organizations was not, and that the difference was mostly attributable due to community and organizational involvement by religious fundamentalists being confined to activities within their congregations rather than the wider communities in which the congregations are located.\nMeasurement.\nThere is no widely held consensus on how to measure social capital, which has become a debate in itself. While usually one can intuitively sense the level/amount of social capital present in a given relationship (regardless of type or scale), quantitative measuring has proven somewhat complicated, resulting in different metrics for different functions.\nSociologists Carl L. Bankston and Min Zhou have argued that one of the reasons social capital is so difficult to measure is that it is neither an individual-level nor a group-level phenomenon, but one that emerges across levels of analysis as individuals participate in groups. They argue that the metaphor of \"capital\" may be misleading because, unlike financial capital, which is a resource held by an individual, the benefits of forms of social organization are not held by actors, but are results of the participation of actors in advantageously organized groups.\nName generators.\nOne type of quantitative social capital measure uses name generators to construct social networks and to measure the level of social capital. These networks are constructed by asking participants to name people that they interact with, such as \"Name all the people you've discussed important matters with in the past six months.\" Name generators are often useful to construct core discussion networks of close ties, rather than weaker ties.\nSocial capital scales.\nMany studies measure social capital by asking the question: \"do you trust the others?\" Other researches analyse the participation in voluntary associations or civic activities.\nTo expand upon the methodological potential of measuring online and offline social bonding, as it relates to social capital, Williams (2006), offers a matrix of social capital measures that distinguishes social bridging as a form of less emotionally-tethered relationships compared to bonding. Bonding and bridging sub-scales are proposed, which have been adopted by over 300 scholarly articles.\nLin, Peng, Kim, Kim &amp; LaRose (2012) offer a noteworthy application of the scale by measuring international residents originating from locations outside of the United States. The study found that social media platforms like Facebook provide an opportunity for increased social capital, but mostly for extroverts. However, less introverted social media users could engage social media and build social capital by connecting with Americans before arriving and then maintaining old relationships from home upon arriving to the states. The ultimate outcome of the study indicates that social capital is measurable and is a concept that may be operationalized to understand strategies for coping with cross-cultural immersion through online engagement.\nCohesion measures.\nThe level of cohesion of a group also affects its social capital and vice versa. However, there is no one quantitative way of determining the level of cohesiveness, but rather a collection of social network models that researchers have used over the decades to operationalize social capital. One of the dominant methods is Ronald Burt's constraint measure, which taps into the role of tie strength and group cohesion. Another network-based model is network transitivity.\nEconomic measures.\nKnack and Keefer (1996) measured econometric correlations between confidence and civic cooperation norms, with economic growth in a large group of countries. They found that confidence and civic cooperation have a great impact in economic growth, and that in less polarized societies in terms of inequality and ethnic differences, social capital is bigger.\nNarayan and Pritchet (1997) researched the associativity degree and economic performance in rural homes of Tanzania. They observed that even in high poverty indexes, families with higher levels of incomes had more participation in collective organizations. The social capital they accumulated because of this participation had individual benefits for them, and created collective benefits through different routes, for example: their agricultural practices were better than those of the families without participation (they had more information about agrochemicals, fertilizers and seeds); they had more information about the market; they were prepared to take more risks, because being part of a social network made them feel more protected; they had an influence on the improvement of public services, showing a bigger level of participation in schools; they cooperated more in the municipality level.\nGroup membership-based.\nIn measuring political social capital, it is common to take the sum of society's membership of its groups. Groups with higher membership (such as political parties) contribute more to the amount of capital than groups with lower membership, although many groups with low membership (such as communities) still add up to be significant. While it may seem that this is limited by population, this need not be the case as people join multiple groups. In a study done by Yankee City, a community of 17,000 people was found to have over 22,000 different groups.\nHow a group relates to the rest of society also affects social capital, but in a different manner. Strong internal ties can in some cases weaken the group's perceived capital in the eyes of the general public, as in cases where the group is geared towards crime, distrust, intolerance, violence or hatred towards others. The Ku Klux Klan is an example of this kind of organizations.\nSocial behaviour-based.\nFoschi and Lauriola have presented a measure of sociability as a proxy of social capital. The authors demonstrated that facets of sociability can mediate between general personality traits and measures of civic involvement and political participation, as predictors of social capital, in a holistic model of political behavior.\nThe World Social Capital Monitor is an instrument for measuring social goods and social capital created by the United Nations Sustainable Development Group in partnership with civil society actors. The project identifies social values such as trust, solidarity, helpfulness, friendliness, hospitality and the willingness to finance public goods with the help of anonymous surveys. The surveys started in 2016.\nIntegrating history and socio-economic analysis.\nBeyond Putnam.\nWhile influential, some have identified areas of concern or improvement within the work of Robert D. Putnam. This includes:\nSocial capital motives.\nRobison and colleagues (2012) measured the relative importance of selfishness and four social capital motives using resource allocation data collected in hypothetical surveys and non-hypothetical experiments.\nThe selfishness motive assumes that an agent's allocation of a scarce resource is independent of his relationships with others. This motive is sometimes referred to as the \"selfishness of preference assumption\" in neoclassical economics.\nSocial capital motives assume that agents' allocation of a scarce resource may be influenced by their social capital or sympathetic relationships with others which may produce socio-emotional goods that satisfy socio-emotional needs for validation and belonging:\nRelation with civil society.\nVarious authors give definitions of \"civil society\" that refer to voluntary associations and organisations outside the market and state. This definition is very close to that of the \"third sector\", which consists of \"private organisations that are formed and sustained by groups of people acting voluntarily and without seeking personal profit to provide benefits for themselves or for others.\"\nAccording to such authors as Walzer (1992), Alessandrini (2002), Newtown, Stolle &amp; Rochon, Foley &amp; Edwards (1997), and Walters, it is through civil society, or more accurately, the \"third sector\", that individuals are able to establish and maintain relational networks. These voluntary associations also connect people with each other, build trust and reciprocity through informal, loosely structured associations, and consolidate society through altruism without obligation. It is \"this range of activities, services and associations produced by... civil society\" that constitutes the sources of social capital.\nNot only has civil society been documented to produce sources of social capital, according to Lyons' \"Third Sector\" (2001), social capital does not appear in any guise under either the factors that enable or those that stimulate the growth of the third sector. Likewise, Onyx (2000) describes how social capital depends on an already functioning community. The idea that creating social capital (i.e., creating networks) will strengthen civil society underlies current Australian social policy aimed at bridging deepening social divisions. The goal is to reintegrate those marginalised from the rewards of the economic system into \"the community.\" However, according to Onyx (2000), while the explicit aim of this policy is inclusion, its effects are exclusionary.\nFoley and Edwards (1997) believe that \"political systems...are important determinants of both the character of civil society and of the uses to which whatever social capital exists might be put.\" Alessandrini agrees, saying that, \"in Australia in particular, neo-liberalism has been recast as economic rationalism and identified by several theorists and commentators as a danger to society at large because of the use to which they are putting social capital to work.\"\nThe resurgence of interest in social capital as a remedy for the cause of today's social problems draws directly on the assumption that these problems lie in the weakening of civil society. However this ignores the arguments of many theorists who believe that social capital leads to exclusion rather than to a stronger civil society. In international development, Ben Fine (2001) and John Harriss (2001) have been heavily critical of the inappropriate adoption of social capital as a supposed panacea (promoting civil society organisations and NGOs, for example, as agents of development) for the inequalities generated by neoliberal economic development. This leads to controversy as to the role of state institutions in the promotion of social capital.\nAn abundance of social capital is seen as being almost a necessary condition for modern liberal democracy. A low level of social capital leads to an excessively rigid and unresponsive political system and high levels of corruption, in the political system and in the region as a whole. Formal public institutions require social capital in order to function properly, and while it is possible to have too much social capital (resulting in rapid changes and excessive regulation), it is decidedly worse to have too little.\nSample societies.\nPost-Communist: Kathleen Dowley and Brian Silver published an article entitled \"Social Capital, Ethnicity and Support for Democracy in the Post-Communist States\", in which they find that in post-communist states, higher levels of social capital did not equate to higher levels of democracy. However, higher levels of social capital led to higher support for democracy.\nThird-world: A number of intellectuals in developing countries have argued that the idea of social capital, particularly when connected to certain ideas about civil society, is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor and NGO-driven imperialism and that it functions, primarily, to blame the poor for their condition.\nChinese: The concept of social capital in a Chinese social context has been closely linked with the concept of \"guanxi\".\nAmerican: One attempt to measure social capital, involving the quantity, quality and strength of an individual social capital, was spearheaded by Corporate Alliance in the English-speaking market segment of the US, and Xentrum through the Latin American Chamber of Commerce in Utah on the Spanish-speaking population of the same country. With the assistance of software applications and web-based relationship-oriented systems such as LinkedIn, these kinds of organizations are expected to provide its members with a way to keep track of the \"number\" of their relationships, meetings designed to boost the \"strength\" of each relationship using group dynamics, executive retreats and networking events as well as training in how to reach out to higher circles of \"influential\" people.\nEffects on women's engagement with politics.\nThere are many factors that drive volume towards the ballot box, including education, employment, civil skills, and time. Careful evaluation of these fundamental factors often suggests that women do not vote at similar levels as men. However the gap between women and men voter turnout is diminishing and in some cases women are becoming more prevalent at the ballot box than their male counterparts. Recent research on social capital is now serving as an explanation for this change.\nSocial capital offers a wealth of resources and networks that facilitate political engagement. Since social capital is readily available no matter the type of community, it is able to override more traditional queues for political engagement; e.g.: education, employment, civil skills, etc.\nThere are unique ways in which women organize. These differences from men make social capital more personable and impressionable to women audiences thus creating a stronger presence in regards to political engagement. A few examples of these characteristics are:\nThe often informal nature of female social capital allows women to politicize apolitical environments without conforming to masculine standards, thus keeping this activity at a low public profile. These differences are hard to recognize within the discourse of political engagement and may explain why social capital has not been considered as a tool for female political engagement until as of late.\nEffects on health.\nA growing body of research has found that the presence of social capital through social networks and communities has a protective quality on health. Social capital affects health risk behavior in the sense that individuals who are embedded in a network or community rich in support, social trust, information, and norms, have resources that help achieve health goals. For example, a person who is sick with cancer may receive the information, money, or moral support needed to endure treatment and recover. Social capital also encourages social trust and membership. These factors can discourage individuals from engaging in risky health behaviors such as smoking and binge drinking.\nFurthermore, neighbourhood social capital may also aid in buffering health inequities amongst children and adolescents. Social capital indicators such as neighbourhood cohesion, social support, and ties providing a bond between members of the same religion, have been found to be associated with better health despite financial or socioeconomic hardship. The function of social capital as a health buffer in circumstances of social disadvantage has also received attention in research on the health of minority ethnic populations. The relationships and networks that are maintained by an ethnic minority population in a geographical area where a high percentage of residents belong to the same ethnic group may lead to better health outcomes than would be expected based on other individual and neighbourhood characteristics. Such effects have been investigated in England, New Zealand, and the United States.\nInversely, a lack of social capital can impair health. For example, results from a survey given to 13- to 18-year-old students in Sweden showed that low social capital and low social trust are associated with higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and depression. Additionally, negative social capital can detract from health. Although there are only a few studies that assess social capital in criminalized populations, there is information that suggests that social capital does have a negative effect in broken communities. Deviant behavior is encouraged by deviant peers via favorable definitions and learning opportunities provided by network-based norms. However, in these same communities, an adjustment of norms (i.e. deviant peers being replaced by positive role models) can pose a positive effect.\nResearchers have also investigated the hypothesis that the health benefits of social capital depend on the socioeconomic resources an individual or community has available to them. For example, social capital may boost health only for those with higher levels of education, or more so for those with a higher rather than a lower income. This research is based on Bourdieu's notion that social, economic, and cultural capital are dependent on each other.\nInfluence of the Internet.\nSimilar to watching the news and keeping abreast of current events, the use of the Internet can relate to an individual's level of social capital. In one study, informational uses of the Internet correlated positively with an individual's production of social capital, and social-recreational uses were negatively correlated (higher levels of these uses correlated with lower levels of social capital). An example supporting the former argument is the contribution of Peter Maranci's blog (\"Charlie on the Commuter Line\") to address the train problems in Massachusetts. He created it after an incident where a lady passed out during a train ride due to the congestion in the train and help was delayed because of the congestion in the train and the inefficiency of the train conductor. His blog exposed the poor conditions of train stations, overcrowding train rides and inefficiency of the train conductor which eventually influenced changes within the transit system.\nAnother perspective holds that the rapid growth of social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace suggests that individuals are creating a virtual-network consisting of both bonding and bridging social capital. Unlike face to face interaction, people can instantly connect with others in a targeted fashion by placing specific parameters with Internet use. This means that individuals can selectively connect with others based on ascertained interests, and backgrounds. Facebook is currently the most popular social networking site and touts many advantages to its users including serving as a \"social lubricant\" for individuals who otherwise have difficulties forming and maintaining both strong and weak ties with others.\nThis argument continues, although the preponderance of evidence shows a positive association between social capital and the Internet. Critics of virtual communities believe that the Internet replaces our strong bonds with online \"weak-ties\" or with socially empty interactions with the technology itself. Others fear that the Internet can create a world of \"narcissism of similarity,\" where sociability is reduced to interactions between those that are similar in terms of ideology, race, or gender. A few articles suggest that technologically based interactions has a negative relationship with social capital by displacing time spent engaging in geographical/ in-person social activities. However, the consensus of research shows that the more time people spend online the more in-person contact they have, thus positively enhancing social capital.\nRecent research, conducted in 2006, also shows that Internet users often have wider networks than those who access the Internet irregularly or not at all. When not considering family and work contacts, Internet users actually tend to have contact with a higher number of friends and relatives. This is supported by another study that shows that Internet users and non-Internet users do feel equally close to the same number of people; also the Internet users maintain relationships with 20% more people whom they \"feel somewhat close\" to.\nOther research shows that younger people use the Internet as a supplemental medium for communication, rather than letting the Internet communication replace face-to-face contact. This supports the view that Internet communication does not hinder development of social capital and does not make people feel lonelier than before.\nEllison, Steinfield &amp; Lampe (2007) suggest social capital exercised online is a result of relationships formed offline; whereby, bridging capital is enabled through a \"maintenance\" of relationships. Among respondents of this study, social capital built exclusively online creates weaker ties. A distinction of social bonding is offered by Ellison et al., 2007, suggesting bonds, or strong ties, are possible through social media, but less likely.\nConversely, in the afterword to the second edition of \"Bowling Alone\" (2020), political scientist Robert D. Putnam found that the expansion of internet access, social media, social networking services, online dating services, professional networking services, and e-commerce was probably accelerating the decline in social capital among the U.S. population that began in the 1960s, while mostly just reinforcing existing social connections rather than creating new ones (i.e. bonding social capital versus bridging social capital)\u2014analogously to the effect that the expansion of telephone ownership by U.S. households had (which grew from an ownership rate of 1 percent in 1890 to a majority by 1946 and to 75 percent by 1957).\nIn the first edition of \"Bowling Alone\" (2000), Putnam found that the social capital decline was caused primarily by the expansion of television ownership by U.S. households (which grew from an ownership rate of 1 percent in 1948 to 75 percent by 1955), the gradual replacement of the Greatest Generation and Silent Generation birth year cohorts by the Baby boomer and Generation X birth year cohorts, and the effect of the television ownership expansion on Baby boomers and Generation X. Putnam anticipated that if internet use resembled television and telephone use that the impact of the internet on social capital would largely be the same as the television and the telephone, but Putnam rejected technological determinism in suggesting that the impacts of the internet on social capital was not inevitable and would depend on how Americans collectively chose to use the internet. With respect to political and civic engagement specifically, Putnam referenced meta-analyses and other research in political science in the second edition of \"Bowling Alone\" that concluded that the effects of social networking services and social media on political and civic participation was minimal or negative.\nWhen considered with the use of social media for passive observation or online-only and low-effort support of political and social movements, Putnam concluded that the relationship between internet activism and offline activism is correlational rather than causal in light of research about pre-internet political and social movements (such as the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War in the United States and the 1989 Peaceful Revolution in East Germany) showing that personal connections with other activists are a stronger predictor of which individuals remain part of a movement rather than ideological commitment. Instead, Putnam argued that the weight of the research showed that social media has exacerbated political polarization in the United States due to ideological and socioeconomic homophily among user social networks and social media algorithms that promote echo chambers, virtue signalling, and disinformation. However, Putnam also suggested that these effects of social media owed to the surveillance capitalism business models of the companies that operated the services rather than the technology itself, which created incentives for the companies to promote consumerism rather than building social capital and social trust.\nEffects on educational achievement.\nCatholic schools (Coleman and Hoffer).\nColeman and Hoffer collected quantitative data of 28,000 students in total 1,015 public, Catholic and other private high schools in America from the 7 years' period from 1980 to 1987. It was found from this longitudinal research that social capital in students' families and communities attributed to the much lower dropout rates in Catholic schools compared with the higher rates in public.\nTeachman et al. (1996) further develop the family structure indicator suggested by Coleman. They criticise Coleman, who used only the number of parents present in the family, neglected the unseen effect of more discrete dimensions such as stepparents' and different types of single-parent families. They take into account of a detailed counting of family structure, not only with two biological parents or stepparent families, but also with types of single-parent families with each other (mother-only, father-only, never-married, and other). They also contribute to the literature by measuring parent-child interaction by the indicators of how often parents and children discuss school-related activities.\nMorgan and Sorensen (1999) directly challenge Coleman for his lacking of an explicit mechanism to explain why Catholic schools students perform better than public school students on standardised tests of achievement. Researching students in Catholic schools and public schools again, they propose two comparable models of social capital effect on mathematic learning. One is on Catholic schools as norm-enforcing schools whereas another is on public schools as horizon-expanding schools. It is found that while social capital can bring about positive effect of maintaining an encompassing functional community in norm-enforcing schools, it also brings about the negative consequence of excessive monitoring. Creativity and exceptional achievement would be repressed as a result. Whereas in horizon expanding school, social closure is found to be negative for student's mathematic achievement. These schools explore a different type of social capital, such as information about opportunities in the extended social networks of parents and other adults. The consequence is that more learning is fostered than norm-enforcing Catholic school students. In sum, Morgan and Sorensen study implies that social capital is contextualised, one kind of social capital may be positive in this setting but is not necessarily still positive in another setting.\nCommunity development.\nIn the setting of education through Kilpatrick, Johns, and Mulford (2010) state that \"social capital is a useful lens for analysing lifelong learning and its relationship to community development.\" Social capital is particularly important in terms of education. Also the importance of education with \"schools being designed to create 'functioning community' - forging tighter links between parents and the school\" linking that without this interaction, the social capital in this area is disadvantaged and demonstrates that social capital plays a major role in education.\nParental involvement.\nPutnam (2000) mentions in his book \"Bowling Alone\", \"Child development is powerfully shaped by social capital\" and continues \"presence of social capital has been linked to various positive outcomes, particularly in education.\" According to his book, these positive outcomes are the result of parents' social capital in a community. In states where there is a high social capital, there is also a high education performance. The similarity of these states is that parents were more associated with their children's education. Teachers have reported that when the parents participate more in their children's education and school life, it lowers levels of misbehavior, such as bringing weapons to school, engaging in physical violence, unauthorized absence, and being generally apathetic about education. Borrowing Coleman's quotation from Putnam's book, Coleman once mentioned we cannot understate \"the importance of the embeddedness of young persons in the enclaves of adults most proximate to them, first and most prominent the family and second, a surrounding community of adults.\"\nWithout social capital in the area of education, teachers and parents who play a responsibility in a students learning, the significant impacts on their child's academic learning can rely on these factors. With focus on parents contributing to their child's academic progress as well as being influenced by social capital in education. Without the contribution by the parent in their child's education, gives parents less opportunity and participation in the student's life. As Tedin and Weiher (2010) state, \"one of the most important factors in promoting student success is the active involvement of parents in a child's education.\" With parents also involved in activities and meetings the school conducts, the more involved parents are with other parents and the staff members. Thus parent involvement contributes to social capital with becoming more involved in the school community and participating makes the school a sustainable and easy to run community.\nSampson et al. (1999) stress the normative or goal-directed dimension of social capital, claiming that \"resources or networks alone (e.g. voluntary associations, friendship ties, organisational density) are neutral---they may or may not be effective mechanism for achieving intended effect.\"\nDifference in male and female.\nMarjoribanks and Kwok (1998) conducted a survey in Hong Kong secondary schools with 387 fourteen-year-old students with an aim to analyse female and male adolescents differential educational achievement by using social capital as the main analytic tool. In that research, social capital is approved of its different effects upon different genders.\nAdaption and ethnic values.\nIn his thesis \"New Arrival Students in Hong Kong: Adaptation and School Performance\", Hei Hang Hayes Tang (2002) argues that adaptation is a process of activation and accumulation of (cultural and social) capitals. The research findings show that supportive networks is the key determinant differentiating the divergent adaptation pathways. Supportive networks, as a form of social capital, is necessary for activating the cultural capital the newly arrived students possessed. The amount of accumulated capital is also relevant to further advancement in the ongoing adaptation process.\nMin Zhou and Carl L. Bankston (1998), in their study of a Vietnamese community in New Orleans, found that preserving traditional ethnic values enable immigrants to integrate socially and to maintain solidarity in an ethnic community. Ethnic solidarity is especially important in the context where immigrants just arrive in the host society. In her article \"Social Capital in Chinatown\", Zhou examines how the process of adaptation of young Chinese Americans is affected by tangible forms of social relations between the community, immigrant families, and the younger generations. Chinatown serves as the basis of social capital that facilitates the accommodation of immigrant children in the expected directions. Ethnic support provides impetus to academic success. Furthermore, maintenance of literacy in native language also provides a form of social capital that contributes positively to academic achievement. Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch found that bilingual students were more likely to obtain the necessary forms of institutional support to advance their school performance and their life chances.\nIn fields of study.\nGeography.\nIn order to understand social capital as a subject in geography, one must look at it in a sense of space, place, and territory. In its relationship, the tenets of geography relate to the ideas of social capital in the family, community, and in the use of social networks. The biggest advocate for seeing social capital as a geographical subject was American economist and political scientist Robert Putnam. His main argument for classifying social capital as a geographical concept is that the relationships of people is shaped and molded by the areas in which they live.\nThere are many areas in which social capital can be defined by the theories and practices. In 1984, Anthony Giddens developed a theory in which he relates social structures and the actions that they produce. In his studies, he does not look at the individual participants of these structures, but how the structures and the social connections that stem from them are diffused over space. If this is the case, the continuous change in social structures could bring about a change in social capital, which can cause changes in community atmosphere. If an area is plagued by social organizations whose goals are to revolt against social norms, such as gangs, it can cause a negative social capital for the area causing those who disagreed with these organizations to relocate thus taking their positive social capital to a different space than the negative.\nAnother area where social capital can be seen as an area of study in geography is through the analysis of participation in volunteerism and its support of different governments. One area to look into with this is through those who participate in social organizations. People that participate are of different races, ages, and economic status. With these in mind, variances of the space in which these different demographics may vary, causing a difference in involvement among areas. Secondly, there are different social programs for different areas based on economic situation. A governmental organization would not place a welfare center in a wealthier neighborhood where it would have very limited support to the community, as it is not needed. Thirdly, social capital can be affected by the participation of individuals of a certain area based on the type of institutions that are placed there. Mohan supports this with the argument of J. Fox in his paper \"Decentralization and Rural Development in Mexico\", which states \"structures of local governance in turn influence the capacity of grassroots communities to influence social investments.\" With this theory, if the involvement of a government in specific areas raises the involvement of individuals in social organizations and/or communities, this will in turn raise the social capital for that area. Since every area is different, the government takes that into consideration and will provide different areas with different institutions to fit their needs thus there will be different changes in social capital in different areas.\nLeisure studies.\nIn the context of leisure studies, social capital is seen as the consequence of investment in and cultivation of social relationships allowing an individual access to resources that would otherwise be unavailable to him or her. The concept of social capital in relation to leisure is grounded in a perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness rather than the separateness of human activity and human goals. There is a significant connection between leisure and democratic social capital. Specific forms of leisure activity contribute to the development of the social capital central to democracy and democratic citizenship. The more an individual participates in social activities, the more autonomy the individual experiences, which will help her or his individual abilities and skills to develop. The greater the accumulation of social capital a person experiences, may transfer to other leisure activities as well as personal social roles, relationships and in other roles within a social structure.\nSocial capital, marriage, and romantic relationships.\nKislev (2019) shows that following vast changes to the status of marriage in modern society singles present higher social capital. They also derive greater happiness from equal levels of social capital compared with married people. In a later study, Kislev (2020) shows the relation between romantic relationships desire and singleness. He shows that a lower degree of relationship desire has a significant effect on the relative importance of friends. Furthermore, both higher levels of the relative importance of friends and social satisfaction are negatively correlated with relationship desire.\nEffects on informal economies.\nSocial capital has been associated with the reduction in access to informal credit in informal economies (especially in developing countries). Social capital in rural communities bring business-related knowledge and skills, entrepreneurial wellbeing, and economic benefits for individuals within communities, while for the community as a whole, strong social capital also brings extra shared economic benefits, and it can also foster socio-cultural change within the community.\nSimilar results were revealed in a cross-sectional study run by Sarker in Bangladesh. Some other authors also note the importance of social capital among female entrepreneurship. Epo (2013) presented the case that social capital and micro loans increase the likelihood of female entrepreneurship in Cameroon. Epo did this by comparing the welfare outcomes of the entrepreneurs who both had access and no access. Other authors, however, disagree about the positive correlation between social capital and microfinance, Kanak and Iiguni argue that formation of social capital is largely dependent on strategies implemented by Microfinance Institutions. Kanak and Iiguni determined this while investigating social capital formation in a rural village in Bangladesh.\nFor their study in Indian rural communities, Trivedi and colleagues make a distinction between internal social capital, i.e. within a rural community, and external social capital, i.e., between people from the community with people outside the community. They argue that both internal and external social capital need to be in place for a rural community to create entrepreneurial and economic benefits, which in turn can reduce poverty.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He distinguished it (as \"enterprise\") from labour which can be coerced and is usually seen as strictly imitative (learned or transmitted, via such means as apprenticeship).\nMarxist economics refers instead to \"an individual's social capital\u2014individuals are sources neither of creativity and innovation, nor management skill. A problem with that analysis is that it simply cannot explain the substitution problem and lack of demand that occurs when, for instance, an understudy takes on a leading role, or a second author takes over writing a popular book series. At the very least there must be some conditional, if not firm-specific then \"class specific\", special ability to command premiums for outstanding personal performance.\nNeoclassical economics by contrast refers to https://, which implies a strong association of the individual with the instructional capital they learn from, with little or no social capital influence. This is orthogonal to the Marxist view, but not necessarily opposed.\nHuman development theory reflects both distinctions: it sees labour as the yield of individual capital in the same way that neoclassical macro-economics sees financial capital as the yield of the looser idea of human capital. But the rest problem and social welfare function selection, as well as the subjective factors in behavioral finance, has led to a closer analysis of factors of production. In effect, the financial architecture is no longer trusted as an arbiter of the value of life as it was in neoclassical economics. Money is not seen as values-neutral, but as embodying a set of larger social choices about money supply rules, made by measuring well-being of whole populations.\nVersus \"human\", \"firm-specific\", \"individual social\".\nWhile conflated in many analyses with human capital, the latter term includes social capital (human relationships) and instructional capital (abstract texts and training materials and so on) that are not tied to any one person, do not die with them or leave employment with them, and therefore cannot be equated with talent alone. In intangibles measurement, value creation and value reporting metrics require all assets with such different characteristics to be categorized as different capital assets, so the more exact reference to the individual person is preferred.\nFusions of terminology are common. Sociological analysts refer to \"individual-level elements of social capital\" or \"an individual's social capital\" or just \"individual social capital\" while economic analysts often use the phrase firm-specific human capital. In either case the clearly includes individual capital but also some \"activity-\", \"community-\" or \"firm-specific\" social capital (community trust) and instructional capital (shareable knowledge or skills). This is easy to measure: its yield is your salary in your current job.\nTo the degree this is consistent if you take other work nearby, this opens the questions of what is \"not\" \"firm-specific\" and whether a nation is just a bigger \"firm\": Some analyses see political capital, or just \"influence\" or \"trust of professionals\" as a full style of capital of its own. Some ethicists, most clearly Jane Jacobs, see this as simple corruption. Nonetheless, corruption clearly has a cash value, involves some creativity to arrange, and is a decision factor. It is a skill like any other.\nVersus \"intellectual capital\".\nPerhaps because of this, not all theorists recognize individual capital as being as essential as labour, or distinct from social or political influence, or from instructional capacity. These theorists often refer to \"intellectual capital\", which more properly describes a debate or locus of complexity that arises when individuals take key instructional roles. Some refer to celebrity as another fusion, when individuals take key social roles.\nHowever, a great many celebrities are clearly not \"intellectual\" achievers nor notable for any cognitive or analytic powers, e.g. Kim Kardashian, professional sports figures or other athletes. While they may through sheer exposure become involved in causes or controversies (as Paris Hilton did in the US presidential election, 2008) it's clearly not correct to label all individually unique talent or economic value as being an \"intellectual\" asset.\nThis failure to distinguish individual's objectively observed economic value (the power to promote or publicize products, draw attention to causes, etc.) from the \"intellectual\" powers is probably an elitist bias. Clearly, there are some individuals, including non-humans such as a racehorse, which have economic value unique to their individual body and being that cannot be captured or defined as an \"intellectual\" asset nor as a set of \"social\" relationships (because horses do not socialize in the sense humans do). Where slavery exists or has existed, there is clearly a value put on living bodies separate from their instructional or social selves.\nThus for analyzing historical or criminal economic activities, or even professional sports, the instructional capital vs. individual capital vs. social capital distinction is essential.\nInvestment.\nThose who differentiate individual capital tend to see it as something that one can invest in, directly, and see growth, directly. For individual skill, even skill at a highly imitative enterprise, like sports or mastery of a musical instrument, this is very often quite measurable. Many enterprises, for instance, a music conservatory or circus school or creative writing coach, are clearly making a living on the identification and (somewhat) measurable enhancement of the individual."}
{"id": "45804", "revid": "44120587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45804", "title": "Human capital", "text": "Economics concept involving knowledge, skills, and training\nHuman capital or human assets is a concept used by economists to designate personal attributes considered useful in the production process. It encompasses employee knowledge, skills, know-how, good health, and education. Human capital has a substantial impact on individual earnings. Research indicates that human capital investments have high economic returns throughout childhood and young adulthood.\nCompanies can invest in human capital; for example, through education and training, improving levels of quality and production.\nHistory.\nAdam Smith included in his definition of capital \"the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society\". The first use of the\nterm \"human capital\" may be by Irving Fisher. An early discussion with the phrase \"human capital\" was from Arthur Cecil Pigou:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is such a thing as investment in human capital as well as investment in material capital. So soon as this is recognised, the distinction between economy in consumption and economy in investment becomes blurred. For, up to a point, consumption is investment in personal productive capacity. This is especially important in connection with children: reducing unduly expenditure on their consumption may greatly lower their efficiency in after-life. Even for adults, after we have descended a certain distance along the scale of wealth, so that we are beyond the region of luxuries and \"unnecessary\" comforts, a check to personal consumption is also a check to investment.\nBut the term only found widespread use in economics after its popularization by economists of the Chicago School, in particular Gary Becker, Jacob Mincer, and Theodore Schultz.\nThe early 20th century Austrian sociologist Rudolf Goldscheid's theory of organic capital and the human economy also served as a precedent for later concepts of human capital.\nThe use of the term in the modern neoclassical economic literature dates back to Jacob Mincer's article \"Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution\" in the \"Journal of Political Economy\" in 1958. Then Theodore Schultz also contributed to the development of the subject matter. The best-known application of the idea of \"human capital\" in economics is that of Mincer and Gary Becker. Becker's book entitled \"Human Capital\", published in 1964, became a standard reference for many years. In this view, human capital is similar to \"physical means of production\", e.g., factories and machines: one can invest in human capital (via education, training, medical treatment) and one's outputs depend partly on the rate of return on the human capital one owns. Thus, human capital is a means of production, into which additional investment yields additional output. Human capital is substitutable, but not transferable like land, labor, or fixed capital.\nSome contemporary growth theories see human capital as an important economic growth factor. Further research shows the relevance of education for the economic welfare of people.\nAdam Smith defined four types of fixed capital (which is characterized as that which affords a revenue or profit without circulating or changing masters). The four types were:\nSmith defined human capital as follows:\nFourthly, of the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society. The acquisition of such talents, by the maintenance of the acquirer during his education, study, or apprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is a capital fixed and realized, as it were, in his person. Those talents, as they make a part of his fortune, so do they likewise that of the society to which he belongs. The improved dexterity of a workman may be considered in the same light as a machine or instrument of trade which facilitates and abridges labor, and which, though it costs a certain expense, repays that expense with a profit.\nTherefore, Smith argued, the productive power of labor are both dependent on the division of labor:\nThe greatest improvement in the productive powers of labor, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgement with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labor.\nThere is a complex relationship between the division of labor and human capital.\nIn the 1990s, the concept of human capital was extended to include natural abilities, physical fitness and healthiness, which are crucial for an individual's success in acquiring knowledge and skills.\nAs a result of his conceptualization and modeling work using Human Capital as a key factor, the 2018 Nobel Prize for Economics was jointly awarded to Paul Romer, who founded the modern innovation-driven approach to understanding economic growth.\nIn the recent literature, the new concept of task-specific human capital was coined in 2004 by Robert Gibbons, an economist at MIT, and Michael Waldman, an economist at Cornell University. The concept emphasizes that in many cases, human capital is accumulated specific to the nature of the task (or, skills required for the task), and the human capital accumulated for the task are valuable to many firms requiring the transferable skills. This concept can be applied to job-assignment, wage dynamics, tournament, promotion dynamics inside firms, etc.\nBackground.\n\"Human capital\" in a broad sense is a collection of activities: all the knowledge, skills, abilities, experience, intelligence, training and competences possessed individually and collectively by individuals in a population. These resources are the total capacity of the people that represents a form of wealth that can be directed to accomplish the goals of the nation or state or a portion thereof. The human capital is further distributed into three kinds;\nMany theories explicitly connect investment in human capital development to education, and the role of human capital in economic development, productivity growth, and innovation has frequently been cited as a justification for government subsidies for education and job skills training.\nIt was assumed in early economic theories, reflecting the context \u2013 i.e., the secondary sector of the economy was producing much more than the tertiary sector was able to produce at the time in most countries\u00a0\u2013 to be a fungible resource, homogeneous, and easily interchangeable, and it was referred to simply as workforce or labor, one of three factors of production (the others being land, and assumed-interchangeable assets of money and physical equipment). Just as land became recognized as natural capital and an asset in itself, human factors of production were raised from this simple mechanistic analysis to human capital. In modern technical financial analysis, the term \"balanced growth\" refers to the goal of equal growth of both aggregate human capabilities and physical assets that produce goods and services.\nThe assumption that labor or workforces could be easily modelled in aggregate began to be challenged in 1950s when the tertiary sector, which demanded creativity, begun to produce more than the secondary sector was producing at the time in the most developed countries in the world. Accordingly, much more attention was paid to factors that led to success versus failure where human management was concerned. The role of leadership, talent, even celebrity was explored.\nToday, most theories attempt to break down human capital into one or more components for analysis. Most commonly, Emotional capital is the set of resources (the personal and social emotional competencies) that is inherent to the person, useful for personal, professional and organizational development, and participates to social cohesion and has personal, economic and social returns (Gendron, 2004, 2008). Social capital, the sum of social bonds and relationships, has come to be recognized, along with many synonyms such as goodwill or brand value or social cohesion or social resilience and related concepts like celebrity or fame, as distinct from the talent that an individual (such as an athlete has uniquely) has developed that cannot be passed on to others regardless of effort, and those aspects that can be transferred or taught: instructional capital. Less commonly, some analyses conflate good instructions for health with health itself, or good knowledge management habits or systems with the instructions they compile and manage, or the \"intellectual capital\" of teams\u00a0\u2013 a reflection of their social and instructional capacities, with some assumptions about their individual uniqueness in the context in which they work. In general, these analyses acknowledge that individual trained bodies, teachable ideas or skills, and social influence or persuasion power, are different.\nManagement accounting is often concerned with questions of how to model human beings as a capital asset. However it is broken down or defined,\nhuman capital is vitally important for an organization's success (Crook et al., 2011); human capital increases through education and experience. Human capital is also important for the success of cities and regions: a 2012 study examined how the production of university degrees and R&amp;D activities of educational institutions are related to the human capital of metropolitan areas in which they are located.\nIn 2010, the OECD encouraged the governments of advanced economies to embrace policies to increase innovation and knowledge in products and services as an economical path to continued prosperity. International policies also often address human capital flight, which is the loss of talented or trained persons from a country that invested in them, to another country which benefits from their arrival without investing in them.\nMeasurement of human capital.\nWorld Economic Forum Global Human Capital Index.\nSince 2012 the World Economic Forum has annually published its Global Human Capital Report, which includes the Global Human Capital Index (GHCI). In the 2017 edition, 130 countries are ranked from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) according to the quality of their investments in human capital. Norway is at the top, with 77.12.\nWorld Bank Human Capital Index.\nIn October 2018, the World Bank published the Human Capital Index (HCI) as a measurement of economic success. The Index ranks countries according to how much is invested in education and health care for young people. The World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on \"The Changing Nature of Work\" showcases the Index and explains its importance given the impact of technology on labor markets and the future of work. One of the central innovations of the World Bank Human Capital Index was the inclusion and harmonization of learning data across 164 countries. This introduced a measure of human capital which directly accounts for the knowledge and skills acquired from schooling, rather than using schooling alone, now widely recognized to be an incomplete proxy. The learning outcomes data, methodology, and applications to the human capital literature underlying this effort were published in \"Nature\".\nOther methods.\nA new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by \"The Lancet\" in September 2018. Finland had the highest level of expected human capital: 28\u00b74 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. Niger had the lowest at less than 1\u00b76 years.\nMeasuring the human capital index of individual firms is also possible: a survey is made on issues like training or compensation, and a value between 0 (worst) and 100 (best) is obtained. Enterprises which rank high are shown to add value to shareholders.\nHuman capital management.\nHuman capital management (HCM) is the term used to describe workforce practices and resources that focus on maximizing needed skills through the recruitment, training, and development of employees. Departments and software applications responsible for HCM often manage tasks that include administrative support, reporting and analytics, education and training, and hiring and recruitment.\nCumulative growth.\nHuman capital is distinctly different from the tangible monetary capital due to the extraordinary characteristic of human capital to grow cumulatively over a long period of time. The growth of tangible monetary capital is not always linear due to the shocks of business cycles. During the period of prosperity, monetary capital grows at relatively higher rate while during the period of recession and depression, there is deceleration of monetary capital. On the other hand, human capital has uniformly rising rate of growth over a long period of time because the foundation of this human capital is laid down by the educational and health inputs. The current generation is qualitatively developed by the effective inputs of education and health. The future generation is more benefited by the advanced research in the field of education and health, undertaken by the current generation. Therefore, the educational and health inputs create more productive impacts upon the future generation and the future generation becomes superior to the current generation. In other words, the productive capacity of future generation increases more than that of current generation. Therefore, rate of human capital formation in the future generation happens to be more than the rate of human capital formation in the current generation. This is the cumulative growth of human capital formation generated by superior quality of manpower in the succeeding generation as compared to the preceding generation.\nIntangibility and portability.\nHuman capital is an intangible asset, and it is not owned by the firm that employs it and is generally not fungible. Specifically, individuals arrive at 9am and leave at 5pm (in the conventional office model) taking most of their knowledge and relationships with them.\nHuman capital when viewed from a time perspective consumes time in one of these key activities:\nDespite the lack of formal ownership, firms can and do gain from high levels of training, in part because it creates a corporate culture or vocabulary teams use to create cohesion.\nIn recent economic writings the concept of firm-specific human capital, which includes those social relationships, individual instincts, and instructional details that are of value within one firm (but not in general), appears by way of explaining some labour mobility issues and such phenomena as golden handcuffs. Workers can be more valuable where they are simply for having acquired this knowledge, these skills and these instincts. Accordingly, the firm gains for their unwillingness to leave and market talents elsewhere.\nMarxist analysis.\nIn some way, the idea of \"human capital\" is similar to Karl Marx's concept of labor power: he thought in capitalism workers sold their labor power in order to receive income (wages and salaries). But long before Mincer or Becker wrote, Marx pointed to \"two disagreeably frustrating facts\" with theories that equate wages or salaries with the interest on human capital.\nAn employer must be receiving a profit from his operations, so that workers must be producing what Marx described as surplus-value, i.e., doing work beyond that necessary to maintain their labor power. Though having \"human capital\" gives workers some benefits, they are still dependent on the owners of non-human wealth for their livelihood.\nThe term appears in Marx's article in the \"New-York Daily Tribune\" \"The Emancipation Question\", January 17 and 22, 1859, although there the term is used to describe humans who act like a capital to the producers, rather than in the modern sense of \"knowledge capital\" endowed to or acquired by humans.\nNeo-Marxist economists have argued that education leads to higher wages not by increasing human capital, but rather by making workers more compliant and reliable in a corporate environment. The reasoning of which being that higher education creates the illusion of a meritocracy, thus justifying economic inequality to the benefit of capitalists, regardless of whether the educated human capital actually provides additional labor value.\nRisk.\nWhen human capital is assessed by activity-based costing via time allocations it becomes possible to assess human capital risk. Human capital risks can be identified if HR processes in organizations are studied in detail. Human capital risk occurs when the organization operates below attainable operational excellence levels. For example, if a firm could reasonably reduce errors and rework (the process component of human capital) from 10,000 hours per annum to 2,000 hours with attainable technology, the difference of 8,000 hours is human capital risk. When wage costs are applied to this difference (the 8,000 hours) it becomes possible to financially value human capital risk within an organizational perspective.\nRisk accumulates in four primary categories:\nCorporate management.\nIn corporate management, human capital is one of the three primary components of intellectual capital (which, in addition to tangible assets, comprise the entire value of a company). Human capital is the value that the employees of a business provide through the application of skills, know-how and expertise. It is an organization's combined human capability for solving business problems. Human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization. Therefore, human capital leaves an organization when people leave. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its people resources as measured by creativity and innovation. A company's reputation as an employer affects the human capital it draws.\nCriticism.\nSome labor economists have criticized the Chicago-school theory, claiming that it tries to explain all differences in wages and salaries in terms of human capital. One of the leading alternatives, advanced by Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz, is \"signaling theory\". According to signaling theory, education does not lead to increased human capital, but rather acts as a mechanism by which workers with superior innate abilities can signal those abilities to prospective employers and so gain above average wages.\nThe concept of human capital can be infinitely elastic, including unmeasurable variables such as personal character or connections with insiders (via family or fraternity). This theory has had a significant share of study in the field proving that wages can be higher for employees on aspects other than human capital. Some variables that have been identified in the literature of the past few decades include, gender and nativity wage differentials, discrimination in the work place, and socioeconomic status.\nThe prestige of a credential may be as important as the knowledge gained in determining the value of an education. This points to the existence of market imperfections such as non-competing groups and labor-market segmentation. In segmented labor markets, the \"return on human capital\" differs between comparably skilled labor-market groups or segments.\nFollowing Becker, the human capital literature often distinguishes between \"specific\" and \"general\" human capital. Specific human capital refers to skills or knowledge that is useful only to a single employer or industry, whereas general human capital (such as literacy) is useful to all employers. Economists view firm-specific human capital as risky, since firm closure or industry decline leads to skills that cannot be transferred (the evidence on the quantitative importance of firm specific capital is unresolved).\nHuman capital is central to debates about welfare, education, health care, and retirement.\nIn 2004, \"human capital\" () was named the German Un-Word of the Year by a jury of linguistic scholars, who considered the term inappropriate and inhumane, as individuals would be degraded and their abilities classified according to economically relevant quantities.\n\"Human capital\" is often confused with human development. The UN suggests \"Human development denotes both the process of widening people's choices and improving their well-being\". The UN Human Development indices suggest that human capital is merely a means to the end of human development: \"Theories of human capital formation and human resource development view human beings as means to increased income and wealth rather than as ends. These theories are concerned with human beings as inputs to increasing production\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This divine creature is mentioned in the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain faiths. Garuda is also the half-brother of the Devas, Gandharvas, Daityas, Danavas, N\u0101gas, Vanara and Yakshas. He is the son of the sage Kashyapa and Vinata. He is the younger brother of Aruna, the charioteer of the Sun. Garuda is mentioned in several other texts such as the Puranas and the Vedas.\nGaruda is described as the king of the birds and a kite-like figure. He is shown either in a zoomorphic form (a giant bird with partially open wings) or an anthropomorphic form (a man with wings and some ornithic features). Garuda is generally portrayed as a protector with the power to swiftly travel anywhere, ever vigilant and an enemy of every serpent. He is also known as Tarkshya and Vainateya.\nGaruda is a part of state insignia of India, Indonesia and Thailand. Both Indonesia and Thailand have Garuda as their coat of arms, the Indian Army uses the Garuda on their Guards Brigade Regimental Insignia. The Indian Air Force named their special operations unit after him as the Garud Commando Force. It is often associated with the Greater adjutant stork (\"Leptoptilos dubius\").\nHinduism.\nIn Hinduism, is a divine eagle-like sun bird and the king of birds. A \"Garutman\" is mentioned in the \"Rigveda\" who is described as celestial deva with wings. The \"Shatapatha Brahmana\" embedded inside the \"Yajurveda\" text mentions Garuda as the personification of courage. In the \"Mahabharata\", Garutman is stated to be same as Garuda, then described as the one who is fast, who can shapeshift into any form and enter anywhere. He is a powerful creature in the epics, whose wing flapping can stop the spinning of heaven, earth and hell. He is described to be the vehicle mount of the Hindu god Vishnu, and typically they are shown together. He is the younger brother of Aruna, who is a charioteer of the sun god, Surya.\nAccording to George Williams, Garuda has roots in the verb \"gri\", or speak. He is a metaphor in the Vedic literature for \"Rik\" (rhythms), \"Saman\" (sounds), \"Yajna\" (sacrifices), and the \"atman\" (Self, deepest level of consciousness). In the Puranas, states Williams, Garuda becomes a literal embodiment of the idea, and the Self who attached to and inseparable from the Supreme Self (Vishnu). Though Garuda is an essential part of the Vaishnavism, he also features prominently in Shaivism, Shaiva texts such as the \"Garuda Tantra\" and \"Kirana Tantra\", and Shiva temples as a bird and as a metaphor of \"atman\".\nIconography.\nThe Hindu texts on Garuda iconography vary in their details. If in the bird form, he is eagle-like, typically with the wings slightly open as if ready and willing to fly wherever he needs to. In part human-form, he may have an eagle-like nose, beak or legs, his eyes are open and big, his body is the color of emerald, and his wings are golden-yellow. He may be shown with either two or four hands. If he is not carrying Vishnu, he holds a jar of \"amrita\" (immortality nectar) in one hand in the rear and an umbrella in the other, while the front pair of hands are in \"anjali\" (namaste) posture. If he is carrying Vishnu, the rear hands provide the support for Vishnu's feet.\nAccording to the text \"Silparatna\", states Rao, Garuda is best depicted with only two hands and with four bands of colours: \"golden yellow colour from feet to knees, white from knees to the navel, scarlet from navel to neck, and black above the neck\". His hands, recommends the text, should be in \"abhaya\" (nothing to fear) posture. In \"Sritatvanidhi\" text, the recommended iconography for Garuda is a kneeling figure, who wears one or more serpents, pointed bird-beak like nose, his two hands in \"namaste\" posture. This style is commonly found in Hindu temples dedicated to Vishnu.\nIn some iconography, Garuda carries Vishnu and his two consorts by his side: Sridevi and Bhudevi.\nGaruda iconography is found in early temples of India, such as on the underside of the eave at Cave 3 entrance of the Badami cave temples (6th-century).\nBeliefs.\nGaruda's mythology is linked to that of Aruna, the charioteer of the Hindu sun god Surya. Both Aruna and Garuda developed from an egg. According to one version related by George Williams, Kashyapa Prajapati's two wives Vinata and Kadru wanted to have children, and Kashyapa granted each of them a boon. Kadru asked for one thousand N\u0101ga sons, while Vinata asked for just two, but each an equal to all of Kadru's thousand sons. Kashyapa blessed them, and then retreated to a forest to meditate. Later, Kadru gave birth to one thousand eggs, while Vinata gave birth to two eggs. After incubating them for five hundred years, Kadru's eggs hatched and out came her 1,000 sons. Vinata, eager for her own sons, impatiently broke one of her eggs. From this egg emerged the partially formed Aruna, looking radiant and reddish as the morning sun, but not as bright as the midday sun as he was promised to be. Aruna chided his mother Vinata for her impatience, and warned her to not break open the second egg, cursing her to be a slave until his brother rescued her. Aruna then left to become the charioteer of Surya, the sun god.\nVinata waited, and after many years, the second egg hatched and Garuda was born. After losing a bet to Kadru through trickery, Vinata was forced to become her slave. Garuda later asked his brothers to free his mother from her slavery, to which they demanded Amrita from heaven. Garuda waged a war against gods with his extraordinary might and abilities, and defeated all of them, including Indra. He then took Indra's nectar vessel and flew back to earth. Vishnu then came to Garuda, and asked him to be his ride, to which he agreed. Indra requested that Garuda not give the Amrita to the Nagas though, as it would bring great trouble later, so they forged a plan. Upon reaching his brothers Garuda placed the vessel before them, and asked them to first purify themselves before drinking. Meanwhile, Jayanta (the son of Indra) stole the vessel back. On returning, the nagas were all devoured by Garuda.\nSome myths present Garuda as so massive that he can block out the sun. The text \"Garuda Purana\" is named after him.\nGaruda is presented in the Mahabharata as one who eats snake meat, such as the story about him planning to kill and eat Sumukha snake, where Indra intervenes. Garuda in anger, vaunt about his feats and compares himself to Indra's equal. Vishnu teaches a lesson to Garuda and cured his pride on might. Garudas are also a race of birds who devour snakes in the epic.\nThe \"Supar\u1e47\u0101khy\u0101na\", a late Vedic period poem considered to be among the \"earliest traces of epic poetry in India,\" relates the legend of Garuda, and provides the basis for a later, expanded version which appears within the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\".\nSymbolism.\nGaruda's links to Vishnu \u2013 the Hindu god who fights injustice and destroys evil in his various avatars to preserve dharma \u2013 have made him an iconic symbol of kings' duty and power, an insignia of royalty or dharma. His eagle-like form is shown either alone or with Vishnu, signifying divine approval of the power of the state. He is found on the faces of many early Hindu kingdom coins with this symbolism, either as a single-headed bird or a three-headed bird that watches all sides.\nThroughout the Mahabharata, Garuda is invoked as a symbol of impetuous violent force, speed, and martial prowess. Powerful warriors advancing rapidly on doomed foes are likened to Garuda swooping down on a serpent. Defeated warriors are like snakes beaten down by Garuda. The Mahabharata character Drona uses a military formation named after Garuda. Krishna carries the image of Garuda on his banner.\nTemples.\nThough Garuda stautues and iconography can be seen in many Vishnu temples, there are very few temples dedicated to Garuda as a deity in India.\nVellamassery Garuda Temple, Triprangode, Tirur, Malappuram, Kerala.\nA 1800 year old ancient kavu dedicated to Garuda, it is famous in the state for the alleviation of 'sarpa dosham'. Nearby the main temple is a rare subsidiary shrine dedicated to the Kurma avatar of Lord Vishnu.\nChemmanadu Sri Krishna Garuda Mahavishnu Temple, Tiruvaniyoor, Ernakulam, Kerala.\nThis temple was believed to have been constructed after Garuda himself manifested in eagle form in front of the devotees during the consecration ceremony. Lord Vishnu is present in his Mohini \"swaroopam\" in this temple, adding to its rarity.\nBuddhism.\nGaruda, also referred to as \"Garula\", are golden-winged birds in Buddhist texts. Under the Buddhist concept of \"sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\", they are one of the A\u1e63\u1e6dagatya\u1e25, the eight classes of inhuman beings. In Buddhist art, they are shown as sitting and listening to the sermons of the Buddha. They are enemies of the N\u0101gas (snakes) and are sometimes depicted with a serpent held between their claws. Like the Hindu art, both zoomorphic (giant eagle-like bird) and partially anthropomorphic (part bird, part human) iconography is common across Buddhist traditions.\nIn Buddhism, the Garuda (Sanskrit; P\u0101li: ) are enormous predatory birds with a wingspan of 330 yojanas. They are described as beings with intelligence and social organisation. They are also sometimes known as (Sanskrit; P\u0101li: ), meaning \"well-winged, having good wings\". Like the N\u0101gas, they combine the characteristics of animals and divine beings, and may be considered to be among the lowest of the devas. The Garudas have kings and cities, and at least some of them have the magical power of changing into human form when they wish to have dealings with people. On some occasions Garuda kings have had romances with human women in this form. Their dwellings are in groves of the \"simbal\u012b\", or silk-cotton tree.\nJataka stories describe them to be residents of Nagadipa or Seruma.\nThe Garuda are enemies to the n\u0101ga, a race of intelligent serpent- or dragon-like beings, whom they hunt. The Garudas at one time caught the n\u0101gas by seizing them by their heads; but the n\u0101gas learned that by swallowing large stones, they could make themselves too heavy to be carried by the Garudas, wearing them out and killing them from exhaustion. This secret was divulged to one of the Garudas by the ascetic Karambiya, who taught him how to seize a n\u0101ga by the tail and force him to vomit up his stone (Pandara J\u0101taka, J.518).\nThe Garudas were among the beings appointed by \u015aakra to guard Mount Sumeru and the heaven from the attacks of the asuras.\nIn the Maha-samaya Sutta (Digha Nikaya 20), the Buddha is shown making temporary peace between the Nagas and the Garudas.\nIn the Qing dynasty fiction \"The Story of Yue Fei\" (1684), Garuda sits at the head of the Buddha's throne. But when a celestial bat (an embodiment of the Aquarius constellation) flatulates during the Buddha's expounding of the Lotus Sutra, Garuda kills her and is exiled from paradise. He is later reborn as Song dynasty General Yue Fei. The bat is reborn as Lady Wang, wife of the traitor Prime Minister Qin Hui, and is instrumental in formulating the \"Eastern Window\" plot that leads to Yue's eventual political execution. \"The Story of Yue Fei\" plays on the legendary animosity between Garuda and the Nagas when the celestial bird-born Yue Fei defeats a magic serpent who transforms into the unearthly spear he uses throughout his military career. Literary critic C. T. Hsia explains the reason why Qian Cai, the book's author, linked Yue with Garuda is because of the homology in their Chinese names. Yue Fei's courtesy name is Pengju (). A Peng () is a giant mythological bird likened to the Middle Eastern roc. Garuda's Chinese name is Great Peng, the Golden-Winged Illumination King ().\nJainism.\nThe Garuda is a yaksha or guardian for Shantinatha in Jain iconography and mythology. Jain iconography shows Garuda as a human figure with wings and a strand-circle.\nAs a cultural and national symbol.\nIn India and the rest of Southeast Asia the eagle symbolism is represented by Garuda, a large bird with eagle-like features that appears in both Hindu and Buddhist epic as the vahana (vehicle) of the god Vishnu. Garuda became the national emblem of Thailand and Indonesia; Thailand's Garuda is rendered in a more traditional anthropomorphic style, while that of Indonesia is rendered in heraldic style with traits similar to the real Javan hawk-eagle.\nCambodia.\nThe word Garuda ( \u2013 \" \"Krud\" \") is literally derived from Sanskrit.\nIndia.\nIndia primarily uses Garuda as a martial motif:\nAs an art form\nIndonesia.\nIndonesia uses the Garuda in a form called the \"Garuda Pancasila\" as its national symbol. The Garuda Pancasila is coloured black or gilded, symbolising both the greatness of the nation and the \"elang Jawa\" (Javan hawk-eagle \"Nisaetus bartelsi\"). The black color represents nature. There are 17 feathers on each wing, 8 on the lower tail, 19 on the upper tail and 45 on the neck, which together make up the date 17 August 1945, when Indonesia proclaimed its independence. The shield it carries bears the motto \"Panca Sila\", which symbolises self-defense and protection in struggle.\nMalaysia.\nIn the northern Peninsular state of Kelantan, the \"Geroda\" () often appears in stories of \"Wayang Kulit Kelantan\" as well as becoming the main motif of Burung Petala Indera boat-chariot made for special royal processions in the early 20th century.\nThailand.\nThailand uses the Garuda () as its national symbol, known as the \"Phra Khrut Pha\", meaning \"Garuda, the vehicle (of Vishnu),\" also used as the symbol of royalty. It adorns the banknote of their currency - the Baht - as well.\nUnited States.\nThe Electronic Attack Squadron 134 (VAQ-134) of the United States Navy is named after and uses the Garuda Insignia.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In other words, financial capital is internal retained earnings generated by the entity or funds provided by lenders (and investors) to businesses in order to purchase real capital equipment or services for producing new goods or services.\nIn contrast, real capital comprises physical goods that assist in the production of other goods and services (e.g. shovels for gravediggers, sewing machines for tailors, or machinery and tooling for factories).\nIFRS concepts of capital maintenance.\n\"Financial capital\" generally refers to saved-up financial wealth, especially that used in order to start or maintain a business. A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial reports. Under a financial concept of capital, such as \"invested money\" or \"invested purchasing power\", capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity. Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day.\nFinancial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of constant purchasing power. Accordingly, there are three concepts of capital maintenance in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS):\nFinancial capital is provided by lenders for a price: interest. Also see time value of money for a more detailed description of how financial capital may be analyzed. Furthermore, financial capital, is any liquid medium or mechanism that represents wealth, or other styles of capital. It is, however, usually purchasing power in the form of money available for the production or purchasing of goods, etcetera. Capital can also be obtained by producing more than what is immediately required and saving the surplus.\nFinancial capital can also be in the form of purchasable items such as computers or books that can contribute directly or indirectly to obtaining various other types of capital. Financial capital has been subcategorized by some academics as economic or \"productive capital\" necessary for operations, signaling capital which signals a company's financial strength to shareholders, and regulatory capital which fulfills capital requirements.\nTypes of capital.\nFixed capital.\nFixed capital is money firms use to purchase assets that will remain permanently in the business and help it make a profit. Factors determining fixed capital requirements:\nWorking capital.\nFirms use working capital to run their business. For example, money that they use to buy stock, pay expenses and finance credit. Factors determining working capital requirements:\nOwn and borrowed capital.\nCapital contributed by the owner or entrepreneur of a business, and obtained, for example, by means of savings or inheritance, is known as own capital or equity, whereas that which is granted by another person or institution via debt instruments is called borrowed capital, and this must usually be paid back with interest. The ratio between debt and equity is named leverage. It has to be optimized as a high leverage can bring a higher profit but create solvency risk.\nBorrowed capital is capital that the business borrows from institutions or people, and includes debentures:\nOwn capital is private capital that owners of a business (shareholders and partners, for example) provide, sometimes called owners equity. The ownership interest is typically represented in preferred shares, and may be of various types, for example:\nThese typically have preference over the common shares. This means the payments made to the shareholders are first paid to the preference shareholder(s) and then to the equity shareholders.\nInstruments.\nA contract regarding any combination of capital assets is called a financial instrument, and may serve as a \nMost indigenous forms of money (wampum, shells, tally sticks and such) and the modern fiat money are only a \"symbolic\" storage of value and not a real storage of value like commodity money.\nValuation.\nNormally, a financial instrument is priced accordingly to the perception by capital market players of its expected return and risk. Unit of account functions may come into question if valuations of complex financial instruments vary drastically based on timing. The \"book value\", \"mark-to-market\" and \"mark-to-future\" conventions are three different approaches to reconciling financial capital value units of account.\nIssuing and trading.\nLike money, financial instruments may be \"backed\" by state military fiat, credit (i.e. social capital held by banks and their depositors), or precious metals resources. Governments generally closely control the supply of it and usually require some \"reserve\" be held by institutions granting credit. Trading between various national currency instruments is conducted on a money market. Such trading reveals differences in probability of debt collection or store of value function of that currency, as assigned by traders.\nWhen in forms other than money, financial capital may be traded on bond markets or reinsurance markets with varying degrees of trust in the social capital (not just credits) of bond-issuers, insurers, and others who issue and trade in financial instruments. When payment is deferred on any such instrument, typically an interest rate is higher than the standard interest rates paid by banks, or charged by the central bank on its money. Often such instruments are called fixed-income instruments if they have reliable payment schedules associated with the uniform rate of interest. A variable-rate instrument, such as many consumer mortgages, will reflect the standard rate for deferred payment set by the central bank prime rate, increasing it by some fixed percentage. Other instruments, such as citizen entitlements, e.g. \"U.S. Social Security\", or other pensions, may be indexed to the rate of inflation, to provide a reliable value stream.\nTypically commodity markets depend on politics that affect international trade, e.g. boycotts and embargoes, or factors that influence natural capital, e.g. weather that affects food crops. Meanwhile, stock markets are more influenced by trust in corporate leaders, i.e. individual capital, by consumers, i.e. social capital or \"brand capital\" (in some analyses), and internal organizational efficiency, i.e. instructional capital and infrastructural capital. Some enterprises issue instruments to specifically track one limited division or brand. \"Financial futures\", \"Short selling\" and \"financial options\" apply to these markets, and are typically pure financial bets on outcomes, rather than being a direct representation of any underlying asset.\nBroadening the notion.\nThe relationship between financial capital, money, and all other styles of capital, especially human capital or labor, is assumed in central bank policy and regulations regarding instruments as above. Such relationships and policies are characterized by a political economy \u2013 feudalist, socialist, capitalist, green, anarchist or otherwise. In effect, the means of money supply and other regulations on financial capital represent the economic sense of the value system of the society itself, as they determine the allocation of labor in that society.\nSo, for instance, rules for increasing or reducing the money supply based on perceived inflation, or on measuring well-being, reflect some such values, reflect the importance of using (all forms of) financial capital as a stable store of value. If this is very important, inflation control is key - any amount of money inflation reduces the value of financial capital with respect to all other types.\nIf, however, the medium of exchange function is more critical, new money may be more freely issued regardless of impact on either inflation or well-being.\nEconomic role.\nSocialism, capitalism, feudalism, anarchism, and other civic theories take markedly different views of the role of financial capital in social life, and propose various political restrictions to deal with that.\nFinancial capitalism is the production of profit from the manipulation of financial capital. It is held in contrast to industrial capitalism, where profit is made from the manufacture of goods.\nMarxist perspectives.\nIt is common in Marxist theory to refer to the role of finance capital as the determining and ruling class interest in capitalist society, particularly in the latter stages.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.\nDijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a given source node to every other node. It can be used to find the shortest path to a specific destination node, by terminating the algorithm after determining the shortest path to the destination node. For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities, and the costs of edges represent the distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, then Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. A common application of shortest path algorithms is network routing protocols, most notably IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First). It is also employed as a subroutine in algorithms such as Johnson's algorithm.\nThe algorithm uses a min-priority queue data structure for selecting the shortest paths known so far. Before more advanced priority queue structures were discovered, Dijkstra's original algorithm ran in formula_1 time, where formula_2 is the number of nodes. proposed a Fibonacci heap priority queue to optimize the running time complexity to formula_3. This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights. However, specialized cases (such as bounded/integer weights, directed acyclic graphs etc.) can be improved further. If preprocessing is allowed, algorithms such as contraction hierarchies can be up to seven orders of magnitude faster.\nDijkstra's algorithm is commonly used on graphs where the edge weights are positive integers or real numbers. It can be generalized to any graph where the edge weights are partially ordered, provided the subsequent labels (a subsequent label is produced when traversing an edge) are monotonically non-decreasing.\nIn many fields, particularly artificial intelligence, Dijkstra's algorithm or a variant offers a uniform cost search and is formulated as an instance of the more general idea of best-first search.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is the shortest way to travel from Rotterdam to Groningen, in general: from given city to given city. It is the algorithm for the shortest path, which I designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in Amsterdam with my young fianc\u00e9e, and tired, we sat down on the caf\u00e9 terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute invention. In fact, it was published in '59, three years later. The publication is still readable, it is, in fact, quite nice. One of the reasons that it is so nice was that I designed it without pencil and paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities. Eventually, that algorithm became to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame.\nDijkstra thought about the shortest path problem while working as a programmer at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam in 1956. He wanted to demonstrate the capabilities of the new ARMAC computer. His objective was to choose a problem and a computer solution that non-computing people could understand. He designed the shortest path algorithm and later implemented it for ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in the Netherlands (he limited it to 64, so that 6 bits would be sufficient to encode the city number). A year later, he came across another problem advanced by hardware engineers working on the institute's next computer: minimize the amount of wire needed to connect the pins on the machine's back panel. As a solution, he re-discovered Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm (known earlier to Jarn\u00edk, and also rediscovered by Prim). Dijkstra published the algorithm in 1959, two years after Prim and 29 years after Jarn\u00edk.\nAlgorithm.\nThe algorithm requires a starting node, and computes the shortest distance from that starting node to each other node. Dijkstra's algorithm starts with infinite distances and tries to improve them step by step:\nDescription.\nThe shortest path between two intersections on a city map can be found by this algorithm using pencil and paper. Every intersection is listed on a separate line: one is the starting point and is labeled (given a distance of) 0. Every other intersection is initially labeled with a distance of infinity. This is done to note that no path to these intersections has yet been established. At each iteration one intersection becomes the current intersection. For the first iteration, this is the starting point.\nFrom the current intersection, the distance to every neighbor (directly-connected) intersection is assessed by summing the label (value) of the current intersection and the distance to the neighbor and then relabeling the neighbor with the lesser of that sum and the neighbor's existing label. I.e., the neighbor is relabeled if the path to it through the current intersection is shorter than previously assessed paths. If so, mark the road to the neighbor with an arrow pointing to it, and erase any other arrow that points to it. After the distances to each of the current intersection's neighbors have been assessed, the current intersection is marked as visited. The unvisited intersection with the smallest label becomes the current intersection and the process repeats until all nodes with labels less than the destination's label have been visited.\nOnce no unvisited nodes remain with a label smaller than the destination's label, the remaining arrows show the shortest path.\nPseudocode.\nIn the following pseudocode, dist is an array that contains the current distances from the source to other vertices, i.e. dist[u] is the current distance from the source to the vertex u. The prev array contains pointers to previous-hop nodes on the shortest path from source to the given vertex (equivalently, it is the \"next-hop\" on the path \"from\" the given vertex \"to\" the source). The code u \u2190 vertex in \"Q\" with min dist[u], searches for the vertex u in the vertex set Q that has the least dist[u] value. Graph.Edges(u, v) returns the length of the edge joining (i.e. the distance between) the two neighbor-nodes u and v. The variable alt on line 14 is the length of the path from the source node to the neighbor node v if it were to go through u. If this path is shorter than the current shortest path recorded for v, then the distance of v is updated to alt.\n 1 function Dijkstra(\"Graph\", \"source\"):\n 2 \n 3 for each vertex \"v\" in \"Graph.Vertices\":\n 4 dist[\"v\"] \u2190 INFINITY\n 5 prev[\"v\"] \u2190 UNDEFINED\n 6 add \"v\" to \"Q\"\n 7 dist[\"source\"] \u2190 0\n 8 \n 9 while \"Q\" is not empty:\n 10 \"u\" \u2190 vertex in \"Q\" with minimum dist[u]\n 11 Q.remove(u)\n 12 \n 13 for each arc (u, v) in \"Q\":\n 14 \"alt\" \u2190 dist[\"u\"] + Graph.Edges(\"u\", \"v\")\n 15 if \"alt\" &lt; dist[\"v\"]:\n 16 dist[\"v\"] \u2190 \"alt\"\n 17 prev[\"v\"] \u2190 \"u\"\n 18\n 19 return dist[], prev[]\nTo find the shortest path between vertices source and target, the search terminates after line 10 if u \n target. The shortest path from source to target can be obtained by reverse iteration:\n 1 \"S\" \u2190 empty sequence\n 2 \"u\" \u2190 \"target\"\n 3 if prev[\"u\"] is defined or \"u\" = \"source\": \"// Proceed if the vertex is reachable\"\n 4 while \"u\" is defined: \"// Construct the shortest path with a stack S\"\n 5 S.push(u) \"// Push the vertex onto the stack\"\n 6 \"u\" \u2190 prev[\"u\"] \"// Traverse from target to source\"\nNow sequence S is the list of vertices constituting one of the shortest paths from source to target, or the empty sequence if no path exists.\nA more general problem is to find all the shortest paths between source and target (there might be several of the same length). Then instead of storing only a single node in each entry of prev[] all nodes satisfying the relaxation condition can be stored. For example, if both r and source connect to target and they lie on different shortest paths through target (because the edge cost is the same in both cases), then both r and source are added to prev[target]. When the algorithm completes, prev[] data structure describes a graph that is a subset of the original graph with some edges removed. Its key property is that if the algorithm was run with some starting node, then every path from that node to any other node in the new graph is the shortest path between those nodes graph, and all paths of that length from the original graph are present in the new graph. Then to actually find all these shortest paths between two given nodes, a path finding algorithm on the new graph, such as depth-first search would work.\nUsing a priority queue.\nA min-priority queue is an abstract data type that provides 3 basic operations: add_with_priority(), decrease_priority() and extract_min(). As mentioned earlier, using such a data structure can lead to faster computing times than using a basic queue. Notably, Fibonacci heap or Brodal queue offer optimal implementations for those 3 operations. As the algorithm is slightly different in appearance, it is mentioned here, in pseudocode as well:\n 1 function Dijkstra(\"Graph\", \"source\"):\n 2 Q \u2190 Queue storing vertex priority\n 3 \n 4 dist[\"source\"] \u2190 0 \"// Initialization\"\n 5 \"Q\".add_with_priority(\"source\", 0) \"// associated priority equals dist[\u00b7]\"\n 6\n 7 for each vertex \"v\" in \"Graph.Vertices\":\n 8 if \"v\" \u2260 \"source\"\n 9 prev[\"v\"] \u2190 UNDEFINED \"// Predecessor of v\"\n 10 dist[\"v\"] \u2190 INFINITY \"// Unknown distance from source to v\"\n 11 Q.add_with_priority(v, INFINITY)\n 12\n 13\n 14 while \"Q\" is not empty: \"// The main loop\"\n 15 \"u\" \u2190 \"Q\".extract_min() \"// Remove and return best vertex\"\n 16 for each arc (u, v) : \"// Go through all v neighbors of u\"\n 17 \"alt\" \u2190 dist[\"u\"] + Graph.Edges(\"u\", \"v\")\n 18 if \"alt\" &lt; dist[\"v\"]:\n 19 prev[\"v\"] \u2190 \"u\"\n 20 dist[\"v\"] \u2190 \"alt\"\n 21 \"Q\".decrease_priority(\"v\", \"alt\")\n 22\n 23 return (dist, prev)\nInstead of filling the priority queue with all nodes in the initialization phase, it is possible to initialize it to contain only \"source\"; then, inside the codice_1 block, the decrease_priority() becomes an add_with_priority() operation.\nYet another alternative is to add nodes unconditionally to the priority queue and to instead check after extraction (codice_2) that it isn't revisiting, or that no shorter connection was found yet in the codice_3 block. This can be done by additionally extracting the associated priority codice_4 from the queue and only processing further codice_5 inside the codice_6 loop.\nThese alternatives can use entirely array-based priority queues without decrease-key functionality, which have been found to achieve even faster computing times in practice. However, the difference in performance was found to be narrower for denser graphs.\nProof.\nTo prove the correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm, mathematical induction can be used on the number of visited nodes.\n\"Invariant hypothesis\": For each visited node v, is the shortest distance from source to v, and for each unvisited node u, is the shortest distance from source to u when traveling via visited nodes only, or infinity if no such path exists. (Note: we do not assume is the actual shortest distance for unvisited nodes, while is the actual shortest distance)\nBase case.\nThe base case is when there is just one visited node, source. Its distance is defined to be zero, which is the shortest distance, since negative weights are not allowed. Hence, the hypothesis holds.\nInduction.\nAssuming that the hypothesis holds for formula_4 visited nodes, to show it holds for formula_5 nodes, let u be the next visited node, i.e. the node with minimum . The claim is that is the shortest distance from source to u.\nThe proof is by contradiction. If a shorter path were available, then this shorter path either contains another unvisited node or not.\nFor all other visited nodes v, the is already known to be the shortest distance from source already, because of the inductive hypothesis, and these values are unchanged.\nAfter processing u, it is still true that for each unvisited node w, is the shortest distance from source to w using visited nodes only. Any shorter path that did not use u, would already have been found, and if a shorter path used u it would have been updated when processing u.\nAfter all nodes are visited, the shortest path from source to any node v consists only of visited nodes. Therefore, is the shortest distance.\nRunning time.\nBounds of the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with edges \"E\" and vertices \"V\" can be expressed as a function of the number of edges, denoted formula_6, and the number of vertices, denoted formula_2, using big-O notation. The complexity bound depends mainly on the data structure used to represent the set \"Q\". In the following, upper bounds can be simplified because formula_6 is formula_9 for any simple graph, but that simplification disregards the fact that in some problems, other upper bounds on formula_6 may hold.\nFor any data structure for the vertex set \"Q\", the running time is:\n formula_11\nwhere formula_12 and formula_13 are the complexities of the \"decrease-key\" and \"extract-minimum\" operations in \"Q\", respectively.\nThe simplest version of Dijkstra's algorithm stores the vertex set \"Q\" as a linked list or array, and edges as an adjacency list or matrix. In this case, extract-minimum is simply a linear search through all vertices in \"Q\", so the running time is formula_14.\nFor sparse graphs, that is, graphs with far fewer than formula_15 edges, Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented more efficiently by storing the graph in the form of adjacency lists and using a self-balancing binary search tree, binary heap, pairing heap, Fibonacci heap or a priority heap as a priority queue to implement extracting minimum efficiently. To perform decrease-key steps in a binary heap efficiently, it is necessary to use an auxiliary data structure that maps each vertex to its position in the heap, and to update this structure as the priority queue \"Q\" changes. With a self-balancing binary search tree or binary heap, the algorithm requires\n formula_16\ntime in the worst case; for connected graphs this time bound can be simplified to formula_17. The Fibonacci heap improves this to\n formula_18\nWhen using binary heaps, the average case time complexity is lower than the worst-case: assuming edge costs are drawn independently from a common probability distribution, the expected number of \"decrease-key\" operations is bounded by formula_19, giving a total running time of\n formula_20\nPractical optimizations and infinite graphs.\nIn common presentations of Dijkstra's algorithm, initially all nodes are entered into the priority queue. This is, however, not necessary: the algorithm can start with a priority queue that contains only one item, and insert new items as they are discovered (instead of doing a decrease-key, check whether the key is in the queue; if it is, decrease its key, otherwise insert it). This variant has the same worst-case bounds as the common variant, but maintains a smaller priority queue in practice, speeding up queue operations.\nMoreover, not inserting all nodes in a graph makes it possible to extend the algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source to the closest of a set of target nodes on infinite graphs or those too large to represent in memory. The resulting algorithm is called \"uniform-cost search\" (UCS) in the artificial intelligence literature and can be expressed in pseudocode as\n procedure uniform_cost_search(start) is\n node \u2190 start\n frontier \u2190 priority queue containing node only\n expanded \u2190 empty set\n do\n if frontier is empty then\n return failure\n node \u2190 frontier.pop()\n if node is a goal state then\n return solution(node)\n expanded.add(node)\n for each of node's neighbors \"n\" do\n if \"n\" is not in expanded and not in frontier then\n frontier.add(\"n\")\n else if \"n\" is in frontier with higher cost\n replace existing node with \"n\"\nIts complexity can be expressed in an alternative way for very large graphs: when \"C\"* is the length of the shortest path from the start node to any node satisfying the \"goal\" predicate, each edge has cost at least \"\u03b5\", and the number of neighbors per node is bounded by \"b\", then the algorithm's worst-case time and space complexity are both in \"O\"(\"b\"1+\u230a\"C\"* &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2044 \"\u03b5\"\u230b).\nFurther optimizations for the single-target case include bidirectional variants, goal-directed variants such as the A* algorithm (see ), graph pruning to determine which nodes are likely to form the middle segment of shortest paths (reach-based routing), and hierarchical decompositions of the input graph that reduce \"s\"\u2013\"t\" routing to connecting \"s\" and \"t\" to their respective \"transit nodes\" followed by shortest-path computation between these transit nodes using a \"highway\". Combinations of such techniques may be needed for optimal practical performance on specific problems.\nBidirectional Dijkstra.\nBidirectional Dijkstra is a variant of Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm designed to efficiently compute the shortest path between a given source vertex \"s\" and target vertex \"t\", rather than all vertices. The key idea is to run two simultaneous searches: one forward from \"s\" on the original graph and one backward from \"t\" on the graph with edges reversed. Each search maintains its own tentative distance estimates, priority queue, and set of \u201csettled\u201d vertices. The two frontiers advance toward each other and meet somewhere along the shortest \"s\u2013t\" path.\nTwo distance arrays are maintained: \"df[v]\" (distance from \"s\" to \"v\") and \"db[v]\" (distance from \"v\" to \"t\"), initialized to \u221e except \"df[s] = 0\" and \"db[t] = 0\". Two priority queues \"Qf\" and \"Qb\" hold vertices not yet fully processed, and two sets \"Sf\" and \"Sb\" store vertices whose shortest-path distance is finalized in each direction. A variable \u03bc stores the length of the best full \"s\u2013t\" path found so far, initially \u221e.\nThe algorithm repeatedly extracts the minimum-distance vertex from whichever queue currently has the smaller key, relaxes its outgoing (or incoming) edges, and updates \u03bc whenever it discovers a connection between the two settled sets:\n formula_21 when relaxing edge \"(u,x)\" in the forward search and \"x \u2208 Sb\",\nand symmetrically for the backward search.\nA key feature is the stopping condition: once the sum of the current minimum priorities in both queues is at least \u03bc, no yet-unsettled path can improve upon \u03bc. At this point \u03bc equals the true shortest-path distance \u03b4(\"s\",\"t\"), and the search terminates.\nThis criterion avoids a common mistake of halting as soon as the two frontiers touch, which may overlook a shorter alternative crossing elsewhere.\nBecause each search only needs to explore roughly half of the search space in typical graphs, the bidirectional method often visits far fewer vertices and relaxes far fewer edges than one-directional Dijkstra on single-pair queries. In road-network\u2013like graphs the savings can be dramatic, sometimes reducing the explored region from an exponential-size ball to two smaller half-balls.\nThe method is widely used in point-to-point routing for maps and navigation software and serves as a base for many speed-up techniques such as the ALT, contraction hierarchies, and reach-based routing.\nIf the actual shortest path (not just its distance) is desired, predecessor pointers can be stored in both searches. When \u03bc is updated through some crossing vertex \"x\", the algorithm records this meeting point and reconstructs the final route as the forward path from \"s\" to \"x\" concatenated with the backward path from \"x\" to \"t\".\nTheoretical research shows that an optimized bidirectional approach can be instance-optimal, meaning no correct algorithm can asymptotically relax fewer edges on the same graph instance.\nOptimality for comparison-sorting by distance.\nAs well as simply computing distances and paths, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to sort vertices by their distances from a given starting vertex.\nIn 2023, Haeupler, Rozho\u0148, T\u011btek, Hlad\u00edk, and Tarjan (one of the inventors of the 1984 heap), proved that, for this sorting problem on a positively-weighted directed graph, a version of Dijkstra's algorithm with a special heap data structure has a runtime and number of comparisons that is within a constant factor of optimal among comparison-based algorithms for the same sorting problem on the same graph and starting vertex but with variable edge weights. To achieve this, they use a comparison-based heap whose cost of returning/removing the minimum element from the heap is logarithmic in the number of elements inserted after it rather than in the number of elements in the heap.\nSpecialized variants.\nWhen arc weights are small integers (bounded by a parameter formula_22), specialized queues can be used for increased speed. The first algorithm of this type was Dial's algorithm for graphs with positive integer edge weights, which uses a bucket queue to obtain a running time formula_23. The use of a Van Emde Boas tree as the priority queue brings the complexity to formula_24 . Another interesting variant based on a combination of a new radix heap and the well-known Fibonacci heap runs in time formula_25 . Finally, the best algorithms in this special case run in formula_26 time and formula_27 time.\nRelated problems and algorithms.\nDijkstra's original algorithm can be extended with modifications. For example, sometimes it is desirable to present solutions which are less than mathematically optimal. To obtain a ranked list of less-than-optimal solutions, the optimal solution is first calculated. A single edge appearing in the optimal solution is removed from the graph, and the optimum solution to this new graph is calculated. Each edge of the original solution is suppressed in turn and a new shortest-path calculated. The secondary solutions are then ranked and presented after the first optimal solution.\nDijkstra's algorithm is usually the working principle behind link-state routing protocols. OSPF and IS-IS are the most common.\nUnlike Dijkstra's algorithm, the Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm can be used on graphs with negative edge weights, as long as the graph contains no negative cycle reachable from the source vertex \"s\". The presence of such cycles means that no shortest path can be found, since the label becomes lower each time the cycle is traversed. (This statement assumes that a \"path\" is allowed to repeat vertices. In graph theory that is normally not allowed. In theoretical computer science it often is allowed.) It is possible to adapt Dijkstra's algorithm to handle negative weights by combining it with the Bellman-Ford algorithm (to remove negative edges and detect negative cycles): Johnson's algorithm.\nThe A* algorithm is a generalization of Dijkstra's algorithm that reduces the size of the subgraph that must be explored, if additional information is available that provides a lower bound on the distance to the target.\nThe process that underlies Dijkstra's algorithm is similar to the greedy process used in Prim's algorithm. Prim's purpose is to find a minimum spanning tree that connects all nodes in the graph; Dijkstra is concerned with only two nodes. Prim's does not evaluate the total weight of the path from the starting node, only the individual edges.\nBreadth-first search can be viewed as a special-case of Dijkstra's algorithm on unweighted graphs, where the priority queue degenerates into a FIFO queue.\nThe fast marching method can be viewed as a continuous version of Dijkstra's algorithm which computes the geodesic distance on a triangle mesh.\nDynamic programming perspective.\nFrom a dynamic programming point of view, Dijkstra's algorithm is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the Reaching method.\nIn fact, Dijkstra's explanation of the logic behind the algorithm: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Problem 2. Find the path of minimum total length between two given nodes P and Q.\nWe use the fact that, if R is a node on the minimal path from P to Q, knowledge of the latter implies the knowledge of the minimal path from P to R.\nis a paraphrasing of Bellman's principle of optimality in the context of the shortest path problem."}

The typical frequency range that is covered by a subwoofer is about 20\u2013200 Hz for consumer products, below 100 Hz for professional live sound, and below 80 Hz in THX-certified systems. Thus, one or more subwoofers are important for high-quality sound reproduction as they are responsible for the lowest two to three octaves of the ten octaves that are audible. This very low-frequency (VLF) range reproduces the natural fundamental tones of the bass drum, electric bass, double bass, grand piano, contrabassoon, tuba, in addition to thunder, gunshots, explosions, etc.\nSubwoofers are never used alone, as they are intended to substitute the VLF sounds of \"main\" loudspeakers that cover the higher frequency bands. VLF and higher-frequency signals are sent separately to the subwoofer(s) and the mains by a \"crossover\" network, typically using active electronics, including digital signal processing (DSP). Additionally, subwoofers are fed their own low-frequency effects (LFE) signals that are reproduced at 10 dB higher than standard peak level.\nSubwoofers can be positioned more favorably than the main speakers' woofers in the typical listening room acoustic, as the very low frequencies they reproduce are nearly omnidirectional and their direction is hard to determine. However, much digitally recorded content contains lifelike binaural cues that human hearing may be able to detect in the VLF range, reproduced by a stereo crossover and two or more subwoofers. Subwoofers are not acceptable to all audiophiles, likely due to distortion artifacts produced by the subwoofer driver after the crossover and at frequencies above the crossover.\nWhile the term \"subwoofer\" technically only refers to the speaker driver, in common parlance, the term often refers to a subwoofer driver mounted in a speaker enclosure (cabinet), often with a built-in amplifier.\nSubwoofers are made up of one or more woofers mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure\u2014often made of wood\u2014capable of withstanding air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures come in a variety of designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, tapped horn, transmission line, bandpass or isobaric designs. Each design has unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low-frequency range, loudness, cabinet size, and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure, but they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.\nThe first home audio subwoofers were developed in the 1960s to add bass response to home stereo systems. Subwoofers came into greater popular consciousness in the 1970s with the introduction of Sensurround in movies such as \"Earthquake\", which produced loud low-frequency sounds through large subwoofers. With the advent of the compact cassette and the compact disc in the 1980s, the reproduction of deep \"and\" loud bass was no longer limited by the ability of a phonograph record stylus to track a groove, and producers could add more low-frequency content to recordings. As well, during the 1990s, DVDs were increasingly recorded with \"surround sound\" processes that included a low-frequency effects (LFE) channel, which could be heard using the subwoofer in home-cinema (also called \"home theater\") systems. During the 1990s, subwoofers also became increasingly popular in home stereo systems, custom car audio installations, and in PA systems. By the 2000s, subwoofers became almost universal in sound reinforcement systems in nightclubs and concert venues.\nUnlike a system's main loudspeakers, subwoofers can be positioned more optimally in a listening room's acoustic. However, subwoofers are not universally accepted by audiophiles amid complaints of the difficulty of \"splicing\" the sound with that of the main speakers around the crossover frequency. This is largely due to the subwoofer driver's non-linearity producing harmonic and intermodulation distortion products well above the crossover frequency, and into the range where human hearing can \"localize\" them, wrecking the stereo \"image\".\nHistory.\n1920s to 1950s precursors.\nFrom about 1900 to the 1950s, the \"lowest frequency in practical use\" in recordings, broadcasting and music playback was 100 Hz. When sound was developed for motion pictures, the basic RCA sound system was a single 8-inch (20 cm) speaker mounted in straight horn, an approach which was deemed unsatisfactory by Hollywood decisionmakers, who hired Western Electric engineers to develop a better speaker system. The early Western Electric experiments added a set of 18-inch drivers for the low end in a large, open-backed baffle (extending the range down to 40 Hz) and a high-frequency unit, but MGM was not pleased with the sound of the three-way system, as they had concerns about the delay between the different drivers.\nIn 1933, the head of MGM's sound department, Douglas Shearer, worked with John Hilliard and James B. Lansing (who would later found Altec Lansing in 1941 and JBL in 1946) to develop a new speaker system that used a two-way enclosure with a W-shaped bass horn that could go as low as 40 Hz. The Shearing-Lansing 500-A ended up being used in \"screening rooms, dubbing theaters, and early sound reinforcement\". In the late 1930s, Lansing created a smaller two-way speaker with a woofer in a vented enclosure, which he called the Iconic system; it was used as a studio monitor and in high-end home hi-fi set-ups.\nDuring the 1940s swing era, to get deeper bass, \"pipelike opening[s]\" were cut into speaker enclosures, creating bass reflex enclosures, as it was found that even a fairly inexpensive speaker enclosure, once modified in this way, could \"transmit the driving power of a heavy...drumbeat\u2014and sometimes not much else\u2014to a crowded dancefloor.\" Prior to the development of the first subwoofers, woofers were used to reproduce bass frequencies, usually with a crossover point set at 200 Hz and a loudspeaker in an infinite baffle or in professional sound applications, a \"hybrid horn-loaded\" bass reflex enclosure (such as the 15-inch Altec Lansing A-7 enclosure nicknamed the \"Voice of the Theater\", which was introduced in 1946). In the mid-1950s, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences selected the \"big, boxy\" Altec A-7 as the industry standard for movie sound reproduction in theaters.\n1960s: first subwoofers.\nIn September 1964, Raymon Dones, of El Cerrito, California, received the first patent for a subwoofer specifically designed to augment omnidirectionally the low frequency range of modern stereo systems (US patent 3150739). It was able to reproduce distortion-free low frequencies down to 15 cycles per second (15\u00a0Hz). A specific objective of Dones's invention was to provide portable sound enclosures capable of high fidelity reproduction of low frequency sound waves without giving an audible indication of the direction from which they emanated. Dones's loudspeaker was marketed in the US under the trade name \"The Octavium\" from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s. The Octavium was utilized by several recording artists of that era, most notably the Grateful Dead, bassist Monk Montgomery, bassist Nathan East, and the Pointer Sisters. The Octavium speaker and Dones's subwoofer technology were also utilized, in a few select theaters, to reproduce low pitch frequencies for the 1974 blockbuster movie \"Earthquake\". During the late 1960s, Dones's Octavium was favorably reviewed by audiophile publications including \"Hi-Fi News\" and \"Audio Magazine\".\nAnother early subwoofer enclosure made for home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin-Vega 18-inch (45\u00a0cm) driver to provide servo control information to the amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at \"Stereo Review\". In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in \"Stereophile\" magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from \"High Fidelity\" magazine.\nAnother of the early subwoofers was developed during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, the former president of the Miller &amp; Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.\n1970s to 1980s.\nThe first use of a subwoofer in a recording session was in 1973 for mixing the Steely Dan album \"Pretzel Logic\", when recording engineer Roger Nichols arranged for Kreisel to bring a prototype of his subwoofer to Village Recorders. Further design modifications were made by Kreisel over the next ten years, and in the 1970s and 1980s by engineer John P. D'Arcy; record producer Daniel Levitin served as a consultant and \"golden ears\" for the design of the crossover network (used to partition the frequency spectrum so that the subwoofer would not attempt to reproduce frequencies too high for its effective range, and so that the main speakers would not need to handle frequencies too low for their effective range). In 1976, Kreisel created the first satellite speakers and subwoofer system, named \"David and Goliath\".\nSubwoofers received a great deal of publicity in 1974 with the movie \"Earthquake\", which was released in Sensurround. Initially installed in 17 U.S. theaters, the Cerwin-Vega \"Sensurround\" system used large subwoofers that were driven by racks of 500 watt amplifiers, triggered by control tones printed on one of the audio tracks on the film. Four of the subwoofers were positioned in front of the audience under (or behind) the film screen and two more were placed together at the rear of the audience on a platform. Powerful noise energy and loud rumbling in the range of 17 to 120\u00a0Hz were generated at the level of 110\u2013120 decibels of sound pressure level, abbreviated dB(SPL). The new low frequency entertainment method helped the film become a box office success. More Sensurround systems were assembled and installed. By 1976, there were almost 300 Sensurround systems leapfrogging through select theaters. Other films to use the effect include the WW II naval battle epic \"Midway\" in 1976 and \"Rollercoaster\" in 1977.\nFor owners of 33\u00a0rpm LPs and 45\u00a0rpm singles, loud \"and\" deep bass was limited by the ability of the phonograph record stylus to track the groove. While some hi-fi aficionados had solved the problem by using other playback sources, such as reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature, with the popular introduction of the compact cassette in the late 1960s it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings. By the mid-1970s, 12-inch vinyl singles, which allowed for \"more bass volume\", were used to record disco, reggae, dub and hip-hop tracks; dance club DJs played these records in clubs with subwoofers to achieve \"physical and emotional\" reactions from dancers.\nIn the early 1970s, David Mancuso hired sound engineer Alex Rosner to design additional subwoofers for his disco dance events, along with \"tweeter arrays\" to \"boost the treble and bass at opportune moments\" at his private, underground parties at The Loft. The demand for sub-bass sound reinforcement in the 1970s was driven by the important role of \"powerful bass drum\" in disco, as compared with rock and pop; to provide this deeper range, a third crossover point from 40 to 120\u00a0Hz (centering on 80\u00a0Hz) was added. The Paradise Garage discotheque in New York City, which operated from 1977 to 1987, had \"custom designed 'sub-bass' speakers\" developed by Alex Rosner's disciple, sound engineer Richard (\"Dick\") Long that were called \"Levan Horns\" (in honor of resident DJ Larry Levan).\nBy the end of the 1970s, subwoofers were used in dance venue sound systems to enable the playing of \"[b]ass-heavy dance music\" that we \"do not 'hear' with our ears but with our entire body\". At the club, Long used four Levan bass horns, one in each corner of the dancefloor, to create a \"haptic and tactile quality\" in the sub-bass that you could feel in your body. To overcome the lack of sub-bass frequencies on 1970s disco records (sub-bass frequencies below 60\u00a0Hz were removed during mastering), Long added a DBX 100 \"Boom Box\" subharmonic pitch generator into his system to synthesize 25 to 50\u00a0Hz sub-bass from the 50 to 100\u00a0Hz bass on the records.\nBy the later 1970s, disco club sound engineers were using the same large Cerwin-Vega Sensurround-style folded horn subwoofers that were used in \"Earthquake\" and similar movies in dance club system installations. In the early 1980s, Long designed a sound system for the Warehouse dance club, with \"huge stacks of subwoofers\" which created \"deep and intense\" bass frequencies that \"pound[ed] through your system\" and \"entire body\", enabling clubgoers to \"viscerally experience\" the DJs' house music mixes.\nIn Jamaica in the 1970s and 1980s, sound engineers for reggae sound systems began creating \"heavily customized\" subwoofer enclosures by adding foam and tuning the cabinets to achieve \"rich and articulate speaker output below 100\u00a0Hz\". The sound engineers who developed the \"bass-heavy signature sound\" of sound reinforcement systems have been called \"deserving as much credit for the sound of Jamaican music as their better-known music producer cousins\". The sound engineers for Stone Love Movement (a sound system crew), for example, modified folded horn subwoofers they imported from the US to get more of a bass reflex sound that suited local tone preferences for dancehall audiences, as the unmodified folded horn was found to be \"too aggressive\" sounding and \"not deep enough for Jamaican listeners\".\nIn sound system culture, there are both \"low and high bass bins\" in \"towering piles\" that are \"delivered in large trucks\" and set up by a crew of \"box boys\", and then positioned and adjusted by the sound engineer in a process known as \"stringing up\", all to create the \"sound of reggae music you can literally feel as it comes off these big speakers\". Sound system crews hold 'sound clash' competitions, where each sound system is set up and then the two crews try to outdo each other, both in terms of loudness and the \"bass it produced\".\nIn the 1980s, the Bose Acoustimass AM-5 became a popular subwoofer and small high-range satellite speaker system for home listening. Steve Feinstein stated that with the AM-5, the system's \"appearance mattered as much as, if not more than, great sound\" to consumers of this era, as it was considered to be a \"cool\" look. The success of the AM-5 led to other makers launching subwoofer-satellite speaker systems, including Boston Acoustics Sub Sat 6 and 7, and the Cambridge SoundWorks Ensemble systems (by Kloss). Claims that these sub-satellite systems showed manufacturers and designers that home-cinema systems with a hidden subwoofer could be \"feasible and workable in a normal living room\" for mainstream consumers. Despite criticism of the AM-5 from audio experts, regarding a lack of bass range below 60\u00a0Hz, an \"acoustic hole\" in the 120 to 200\u00a0Hz range and a lack of upper range above 13\u00a0kHz for the satellites, the AM-5 system represented 30% of the US speaker market in the early 1990s.\nIn the 1980s, Origin Acoustics developed the first residential in-wall subwoofer named Composer. It used an aluminum 10-inch (25.4\u00a0cm) driver and a foam-lined enclosure designed to be mounted directly into wall studs during the construction of a new home. The frequency response for the Composer is 30 to 250\u00a0Hz.\n1990s to 2010s.\nWhile in the 1960s and 1970s deep bass speakers were once an exotic commodity owned by audiophiles, by the mid-1990s they were much more popular and widely used, with different sizes and capabilities of sound output. An example of 1990s subwoofer use in sound reinforcement is the Ministry of Sound dance club which opened in 1991 in London. The dancefloor's sound system was based on Richard Long's design at Paradise Garage. The club spent about \u00a3500,000 on a sound system that used Martin Audio components in custom-built cabinets, including twelve 21\" 9,500 watt active subwoofers, twelve 18-inch subwoofers and twelve Martin Audio W8C mid-high speakers.\nThe popularity of the CD made it possible to add more low frequency content to recordings and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.\nIn 2015, Damon Krukowski wrote an article entitled \"Drop the Bass: A Case Against Subwoofers\" for \"Pitchfork\" magazine, based on his performing experience with Galaxie 500; he argues that \"for certain styles of music\", especially acoustic music genres, \"these low-end behemoths are actually ruining our listening experience\" by reducing the clarity of the low end. In 2015, John Hunter from REL Acoustics stated that audiophiles tend to \"have a love/hate relationship with subwoofers\" because most subs have \"awful\", \"entry-level\" sound quality and they are used in an \"inappropriate way\", without integrating the bass seamlessly.\nIn 2018, some electronic dance music (EDM) sound systems for venues that play hardcore bass have multiple subwoofer arrays to deal with upper-bass (80\u2013100 Hz), mid-bass (40\u201380 Hz), and \"sub-bass\" (20\u201340 Hz).\nConstruction and features.\nLoudspeaker and enclosure design\nSubwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) typically between 8-inch (20\u00a0cm) and 21-inch (53\u00a0cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, and single prototype subwoofers as large as 60-inch (152\u00a0cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10\u00a0cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home-cinema subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends on the design of the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25\u00a0cm, 30\u00a0cm, 38\u00a0cm, and 45\u00a0cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53\u00a0cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.\nThe reference efficiency of a loudspeaker system in its passband is given by:\n formula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the speed of sound in air and the variables are Thiele/Small parameters: formula_3 is the resonance frequency of the driver, formula_4 is the volume of air having the same acoustic compliance as the driver suspension, and formula_5 is the driver formula_6 at formula_3 considering the electrical DC resistance of the driver voice coil. Deep low-frequency extension is a common goal for a subwoofer and small box volumes are also considered desirable, to save space and reduce the size for ease of transportation (in the case of sound reinforcement and DJ subwoofers). Hofmann's \"Iron Law\" therefore mandates low efficiency under those constraints, and indeed most subwoofers require considerable power, much more than other individual drivers.\nSo, for the example of a closed-box loudspeaker system, the box volume formula_8 to achieve a given total formula_6 of the system formula_10 is proportional to formula_4:\n formula_12\nwhere formula_13 is the system compliance ratio given by the ratio of the driver compliance and the enclosure compliance, which can be written as:\n formula_14\nwhere formula_15 is the system resonance frequency.\nTherefore, a decrease in box volume (i.e., a smaller speaker cabinet) and the same formula_16 will decrease the efficiency of the subwoofer. The normalized half-power frequency of a closed-box loudspeaker system is given by:\n formula_17\nHere we note that if formula_18, then formula_19.\nAs the efficiency is proportional to formula_20, small improvements in low-frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase the efficiency of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements. Vented-box loudspeaker systems have a maximum theoretical efficiency that is 2.9\u00a0dB greater than that of the closed-box system.\nSubwoofers are typically constructed by mounting one or more woofers in a cabinet of medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, fiberglass, aluminum or other stiff materials. Because of the high air pressure that they produce in the cabinet, subwoofer enclosures often require internal bracing to distribute the resulting forces.\nSubwoofers have been designed using a number of enclosure approaches: bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, tapped horn, transmission line and bandpass. Each enclosure type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency increase, bass extension, cabinet size, distortion, and cost.\nMultiple enclosure types may even be combined in a single design, such as in computer audio with the subwoofer design of the Labtec LCS-2424 (later acquired by Logitech and used for their Z340/Z540/Z640/Z3/Z4), which is a (primitive) passive radiator bandpass enclosure with a bass reflex dividing chamber.\nWhile not necessarily an enclosure type, isobaric (such as push-pull) coupled loading of two drivers has sometimes been used in subwoofer products of computer, home cinema and sound reinforcement class, and also DIY versions in automotive applications, to provide relatively deep bass for their size. Self-contained \"isobaric-like\" driver assemblies have been manufactured since the 2010s.\nThe smallest subwoofers are typically those designed for desktop multimedia systems. The largest common subwoofer enclosures are those used for concert sound reinforcement systems or dance club sound systems. An example of a large concert subwoofer enclosure is the 1980s-era Electro-Voice MT-4 \"Bass Cube\" system, which used four 18-inch (45\u00a0cm) drivers. An example of a subwoofer that uses a bass horn is the Bassmaxx B-Two, which loads an 18-inch (45\u00a0cm) driver onto an long folded horn. Folded horn-type subwoofers can typically produce a deeper range with greater efficiency than the same driver in an enclosure that lacks a horn. However, folded horn cabinets are typically larger and heavier than front-firing enclosures, so folded horns are less commonly used. Some experimental fixed-installation subwoofer horns have been constructed using brick and concrete to produce a very long horn that allows a very deep sub-bass extension.\nSubwoofer output level can be increased by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs necessarily involve tradeoffs and compromises. Hofmann's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume (as in size) and to the cube of its cutoff frequency, that is how low in pitch it will go) applies to subwoofers just as it does to all loudspeakers. Thus, a subwoofer enclosure designer aiming at the deepest-pitched bass will probably have to consider using a large enclosure size; a subwoofer enclosure designer instructed to create the smallest possible cabinet (to make transportation easier) will need to compromise how low in pitch their cabinet will go.\nFrequency range and frequency response.\nThe frequency response specification of a speaker describes the range of frequencies or musical tones a speaker can reproduce, measured in hertz (Hz). The typical frequency range for a subwoofer is between 20\u2013200 Hz. Professional concert sound system subwoofers typically operate below 100 Hz, and THX-certified systems operate below 80 Hz. Subwoofers vary in terms of the range of pitches that they can reproduce, depending on a number of factors such as the size of the cabinet and the construction and design of the enclosure and driver(s). Specifications of frequency response depend wholly for relevance on an accompanying amplitude value\u2014measurements taken with a wider amplitude tolerance will give any loudspeaker a wider frequency response. For example, the JBL 4688 TCB Subwoofer System, a now-discontinued system which was designed for movie theaters, had a frequency response of 23\u2013350 Hz when measured within a 10-decibel boundary (0\u00a0dB to \u221210\u00a0dB) and a narrower frequency response of 28\u2013120 Hz when measured within a 6-decibel boundary (\u00b13\u00a0dB).\nSubwoofers also vary in regard to the sound pressure levels achievable and the distortion levels that they produce over their range. Some subwoofers, such as The Abyss by MartinLogan for example, can reproduce pitches down to around 18 Hz (which is about the pitch of the lowest rumbling notes on a huge pipe organ with 16 Hz bass pipes) to 100 Hz (\u00b13\u00a0dB). Nevertheless, even though the Abyss subwoofer can go down to 18 Hz, its lowest frequency and maximum SPL with a limit of 10% distortion is 35.5 Hz and 79.8 dB at 2 meters. This means that a person choosing a subwoofer needs to consider more than just the lowest pitch that the subwoofer can reproduce.\nAmplification.\n'Active subwoofers' include their own dedicated amplifiers within the cabinet. Some also include user-adjustable equalization that allows boosted or reduced output at particular frequencies; these vary from a simple \"boost\" switch, to fully parametric equalizers meant for detailed speaker and room correction. Some such systems are even supplied with a calibrated microphone to measure the subwoofer's in-room response, so the automatic equalizer can correct the combination of subwoofer, subwoofer location, and room response to minimize the effects of room modes and improve low-frequency performance.\n'Passive subwoofers' have a subwoofer driver and enclosure, but they do not include an amplifier. They sometimes incorporate internal passive crossovers, with the filter frequency determined at the factory. These are generally used with third-party power amplifiers, taking their inputs from active crossovers earlier in the signal chain. Inexpensive home-theater-in-a-box (HTIB) packages often come with a passive subwoofer cabinet that is amplified by the multi-channel amplifier. While few high-end home-cinema systems use passive subwoofers, this format is still popular in the professional sound industry.\nEqualization.\nEqualization can be used to adjust the in-room response of a subwoofer system. Designers of active subwoofers sometimes include a degree of corrective equalization to compensate for known performance issues (e.g., a steeper than desired low end roll-off rate). In addition, many amplifiers include an adjustable low-pass filter, which prevents undesired higher frequencies from reaching the subwoofer driver. For example, if a listener's main speakers are usable down to 100 Hz, then the subwoofer filter can be set so the subwoofer only works below 100 Hz. Typical filters involve some overlap in frequency ranges; a steep 4th-order 24\u00a0dB/octave low-pass filter is generally desired for subwoofers in order to minimize the overlap region. The filter section may also include a high-pass \"infrasonic\" or \"subsonic\" filter, which prevents the subwoofer driver from attempting to reproduce frequencies below its safe capabilities. Setting an infrasonic filter is important on bass reflex subwoofer cabinets, as the bass reflex design tends to create the risk of cone overexcursion at pitches below those of the port tuning, which can cause distortion and damage the subwoofer driver. For example, in a ported subwoofer enclosure tuned to 30 Hz, one may wish to filter out pitches below the tuning frequency; that is, frequencies below 30 Hz.\nSome systems use parametric equalization in an attempt to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations, in part because of the resonance (i.e. standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.\nPhase control.\nChanging the relative phase of the subwoofer with respect to the woofers in other speakers may or may not help to minimize unwanted destructive acoustic interference in the frequency region covered by both the subwoofer and the main speakers. It may not help at all frequencies, and may create further problems with frequency response, but even so is generally provided as an adjustment for subwoofer amplifiers. Phase control circuits may be a simple polarity reversal switch or a more complex continuously variable circuit.\nContinuously variable phase control circuits are common in subwoofer amplifiers, and may be found in crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e. at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home-cinema receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.\nThe subwoofer phase can still be changed by moving the subwoofer closer to or further from the listening position, however this may not be always practical.\nServo subwoofers.\nSome active subwoofers use a servo feedback mechanism based on cone movement that modifies the signal sent to the voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from a comparison of the input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.\nServo-controlled subwoofers are not the same as Tom Danley's ServoDrive subwoofers, whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The ServoDrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates power compression, the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil. This feature allows high-power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its ServoDrive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.\nApplications.\nHome audio.\nThe use of a subwoofer augments the bass capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low-frequency capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of very low frequency content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low-frequency content that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle without the help of a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32-foot (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16 Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass tests or bass songs.\nFrequencies which are sufficiently low are not easily localized by humans, hence many stereo and multichannel audio systems feature only one subwoofer channel and a single subwoofer can be placed off-center without affecting the perceived sound stage, since the sound that it produces will be difficult to localize. The intention in a system with a subwoofer is often to use small main speakers (of which there are two for stereo and five or more for surround sound or movie tracks) and to hide the subwoofer elsewhere (e.g., behind furniture or under a table), or to augment an existing speaker to save it from having to handle woofer-destroying low frequencies at high levels. This effect is possible only if the subwoofer is restricted to quite low frequencies, usually taken to be, say, 100 Hz and below\u2014still less localization is possible if restricted to even lower maximum frequencies. Higher upper limits for the subwoofer (e.g., 120 Hz) are much more easily localized, making a single subwoofer impractical. Home-cinema systems typically use one subwoofer cabinet (the \"1\" in 5.1 surround sound). However, to \"improve bass distribution in a room that has multiple seating locations, and prevent nulls with weakened bass response, some home-cinema enthusiasts use 5.2- or 7.2- or 9.2-channel surround sound systems with two subwoofer cabinets in the same room.\nSome users add a subwoofer because high levels of low-frequency bass are desired, even beyond what is in the original recording, as in the case of house music enthusiasts. Thus, subwoofers may be part of a package that includes satellite speakers, may be purchased separately, or may be built into the same cabinet as a conventional speaker system. For instance, some floor-standing tower speakers include a subwoofer driver in the lower portion of the same cabinet. Physical separation of subwoofer and satellite speakers not only allows placement in an inconspicuous location, but since sub-bass frequencies are particularly sensitive to room location (due to room resonances and reverberation 'modes'), the best position for the subwoofer is not likely to be where the satellite speakers are located.\nHigher end home-cinema systems and enthusiasts may also opt to take low-frequency bass reproduction even further by incorporating two or more external subwoofers. Having two subwoofers placed around the room ensures even distribution of bass, reducing subwoofer localization and pressurizing the room with low frequency notes that can be felt, just like the cinemas.\nFor greatest efficiency and best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers can be placed in a corner of the room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low-frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it is possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel's speaker is out of phase with another.\nThe physically separate subwoofer/satellite arrangement, with small satellite speakers and a large subwoofer cabinet that can be hidden behind furniture, has been popularized by multimedia speaker systems such as Bose Acoustimass Home Entertainment Systems, Polk Audio RM2008 Series and Klipsch Audio Technologies ProMedia, among many others.\nLow-cost HTIB systems advertise their integration and simplicity. Particularly among lower-cost HTIB systems and with boomboxes, however, the inclusion of a subwoofer may be little more than a marketing technique. It is unlikely that a small woofer in an inexpensively built compact plastic cabinet will have better bass performance than well-designed conventional (and typically larger) speakers in a plywood or MDF cabinet. Mere use of the term \"subwoofer\" is no guarantee of good or extended bass performance. Many multimedia subwoofers might better be termed \"mid-bass cabinets\" (80 to 200 Hz), as they are too small to produce deep bass in the typical 20 to 100 Hz range.\nFurther, poorly designed systems often leave everything below about 120 Hz (or even higher) to the subwoofer, meaning that the subwoofer handles frequencies which the ear can use for sound source localization, thus introducing an undesirable subwoofer \"localization effect\". This is usually due to poor crossover designs or choices (too high a crossover point or insufficient crossover slope) used in many computer and home-cinema systems; localization also comes from port noise and from typically large amounts of harmonic distortion in the subwoofer design. Home subwoofers sold individually usually include crossover circuitry to assist with the integration of the subwoofer into an existing system.\nCar audio.\nAutomobiles are not well suited for the \"hidden\" subwoofer approach due to space limitations in the passenger compartments. It is not possible, in most circumstances, to fit such large drivers and enclosures into doors or dashboards, so subwoofers are installed in the trunk or back seat space. This became a powerful reason behind teenager adoption. Having a vehicle with a system equipped with powerful subwoofers would become both, a source of pride for the owner and a nuisance for the rest of the people on the road. Some car audio enthusiasts compete to produce very high sound pressure levels in the confines of their vehicle's cabin; sometimes dangerously high sound pressure levels. At first, sound pressure levels ranging from 130 decibels and 150 decibels were common during the 1980's. When the 1990's rolled around, the 170 decibel barrier was broken. Today, readings higher than 180 decibels are common in sound pressure competitions. The \"SPL wars\" have drawn much attention to subwoofers in general, but subjective competitions in sound quality (\"SQ\") have not gained equivalent popularity. Top SPL cars are not able to play normal music, or perhaps even to drive normally as they are designed solely for competition. Many non-competition subwoofers are also capable of generating high levels in cars due to the small volume of a typical car interior. High sound levels can cause hearing loss and tinnitus if one is exposed to them for an extended period of time.\nIn the 2000s, several car audio manufacturers produced subwoofers using non-circular shapes, including Boston Acoustic, Kicker, Sony, Bazooka, and X-Tant. Other major car audio manufacturers like Rockford Fosgate did not follow suit since non-circular subwoofer shapes typically carry some sort of distortion penalties. In situations of limited mounting space they provide a greater cone area and assuming all other variables are constant, greater maximum output. An important factor in the \"square sub vs round sub\" argument is the effects of the enclosure used. In a sealed enclosure, the maximum displacement is determined by\nformula_21\nwhere\nThese are some of the Thiele/Small parameters which can either be measured or found with the driver specifications.\nCinema sound.\nAfter the introduction of Sensurround, movie theater owners began installing permanent subwoofer systems. Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track was a six-channel film sound format introduced in 1976 that used two subwoofer channels for stereo reproduction of low frequencies. In 1981, Altec introduced a dedicated cinema subwoofer model tuned to around 20 Hz: the 8182. Starting in 1983, THX certification of the cinema sound experience quantified the parameters of good audio for watching films, including requirements for subwoofer performance levels and enough isolation from outside sounds so that noise did not interfere with the listening experience. This helped provide guidelines for multiplex cinema owners who wanted to isolate each individual cinema from its neighbors, even as louder subwoofers were making isolation more difficult. Specific cinema subwoofer models appeared from JBL, Electro-Voice, Eastern Acoustic Works, Kintek, Meyer Sound Laboratories and BGW Systems in the early 1990s. In 1992, Dolby Digital's six-channel film sound format incorporated a single LFE channel, the \"point one\" in 5.1 surround sound systems.\nTom Horral, a Boston-based acoustician, blames complaints about modern movies being too loud on subwoofers. He says that before subwoofers made it possible to have loud, relatively undistorted bass, movie sound levels were limited by the distortion in less capable systems at low frequency and high levels.\nSound reinforcement.\nProfessional audio subwoofers used in rock concerts in stadia, DJ performances at dance music venues (e.g., electronic dance music) and similar events must be capable of very high bass output levels, at very low frequencies, with low distortion. This is reflected in the design attention given in the 2010s to the subwoofer applications for sound reinforcement, public address systems, dance club systems and concert systems. Cerwin-Vega states that when a subwoofer cabinet is added to an existing full-range speaker system, this is advantageous, as it moves the \"...lowest frequencies from your main [full-range] PA speakers\" thus \"...eliminat[ing] a large amount of the excess work that your main top [full-range] box was trying to reproduce. As a result, your main [full-range] cabinets will run more efficiently and at higher volumes.\" A different argument for adding subwoofer cabinets is that they may increase the \"level of clarity\" and \"perceived loudness\" of an overall PA system, even if the SPL is not actually increased. \"Sound on Sound\" states that adding a subwoofer enclosure to a full-range system will reduce \"cone excursion\", thus lowering distortion, leading to an overall cleaner sound.\nConsumer applications (as in home use) are considerably less demanding due to much smaller listening space and lower playback levels. Subwoofers are now almost universal in professional sound applications such as live concert sound, churches, nightclubs, and theme parks. Movie theaters certified to the THX standard for playback always include high-capability subwoofers. Some professional applications require subwoofers designed for very high sound levels, using multiple 12-, 15-, 18- or 21-inch drivers (30\u00a0cm, 40\u00a0cm, 45\u00a0cm, 53\u00a0cm respectively). Drivers as small as 10-inch (25\u00a0cm) are occasionally used, generally in horn-loaded enclosures.\nThe number of subwoofer enclosures used in a concert depends on a number of factors, including the size of the venue, whether it is indoors or outdoors, the amount of low-frequency content in the band's sound, the desired volume of the concert, and the design and construction of the enclosures (e.g., direct-radiating versus horn-loaded). A tiny coffeehouse may only need a single 10-inch subwoofer cabinet to augment the bass provided by the full-range speakers. A small bar may use one or two direct-radiating 15-inch (40\u00a0cm) subwoofer cabinets. A large dance club may have a row of four or five twin 18-inch (45\u00a0cm) subwoofer cabinets, or more. In the largest stadium venues, there may be a very large number of subwoofer enclosures. For example, the 2009\u20132010 U2 360\u00b0 Tour used 24 Clair Brothers BT-218 subwoofers (a double 18-inch (45\u00a0cm) box) around the perimeter of the central circular stage, and 72 proprietary Clair Brothers cardioid S4 subwoofers placed underneath the ring-shaped \"B\" stage which encircles the central main stage.\nThe main speakers may be 'flown' from the ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e. attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. One of the reasons subwoofers may be installed on the ground is that on-the-ground installation can increase the bass performance, particularly if the subwoofer is placed in the corner of a room (conversely, if a subwoofer cabinet is perceived as too loud, alternatives to on-the-ground or in-corner installation may be considered). There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45\u00a0cm) cabinets in a typical rock concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28\u00a0mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18\u201320\u00a0mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.\nTouring subwoofer cabinets are typically designed with features that facilitate moving the enclosure (e.g., wheels, a \"towel bar\" handle and recessed handles), a protective grille for the speaker (in direct radiating-style cabinets), metal or plastic protection for the cabinets to protect the finish as the cabinets are being slid one on top of another, and hardware to facilitate stacking the cabinets (e.g., interlocking corners) and for \"flying\" the cabinets from stage rigging. In the 2000s, many small- to mid-size subwoofers designed for bands' live sound use and DJ applications are \"powered subs\"; that is, they have an integrated power amplifier. These models typically have a built-in crossover. Some models have a metal-reinforced hole in which a speaker pole can be mounted for elevating full-frequency range cabinets.\nUse in a full-range system.\nIn professional concert sound system design, subwoofers can be incorporated seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. The audio engineer typically adjusts the frequency point at which lower frequency sounds are routed to the subwoofer speaker(s), and mid-frequency and higher frequency sounds are sent to the full-range speakers. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model. While 2010-era subwoofer cabinet manufacturers suggest placing subwoofers on either side of a stage (as implied by the inclusion of pole cups for the full-range PA cabinets), Dave Purton argues that for club gigs, having two subwoofer cabinets on either side of a stage will lead to gaps in bass coverage in the venue; he states that putting the two subwoofer cabinets together will create a more even, omnidirectional sub-bass tone.\nAux-fed subwoofers.\nInstead of being incorporated into a full-range system, concert subwoofers can be supplied with their own signal from a separate mix bus on the mixing console; often one of the auxiliary sends (\"aux\" or \"auxes\") is used. This configuration is called \"aux-fed subwoofers\", and has been observed to significantly reduce low-frequency \"muddiness\" that can build up in a concert sound system which has on stage a number of microphones each picking up low frequencies and each having different phase relationships of those low frequencies. The aux-fed subwoofers method greatly reduces the number of sources feeding the subwoofers to include only those instruments that have desired low-frequency information; sources such as kick drum, bass guitar, samplers and keyboard instruments. This simplifies the signal sent to the subwoofers and makes for greater clarity and low punch. Aux-fed subwoofers can even be stereo, if desired, using two auxiliary mix buses.\nDirectional bass.\nTo keep low-frequency sound focused on the audience area and not on the stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are: music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing at the same time in different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theaters, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include: setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in front of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds. The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.\nVertical array.\nStacking or rigging the subwoofers in a vertical array focuses the low frequencies forward to a greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low-frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.\nRear delay array.\nAnother cardioid subwoofer array pattern can be used horizontally, one which takes few channels of processing and no change in required physical space. This method is often called \"cardioid subwoofer array\" or \"CSA\" even though the pattern of \"all\" directional subwoofer methods is cardioid. The CSA method reverses the enclosure orientation and inverts the polarity of one out of every three subwoofers across the front of the stage, and delays those enclosures for maximum cancellation of the target frequency on stage. Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically, by reversing the wiring polarity, or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward. This method reduces forward output relative to a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of subwoofers, but can solve problems of unwanted low-frequency energy coming into microphones on stage. Compared to the end-fire array, this method has less on-axis energy but more even pattern control throughout the audience, and more predictable cancellation rearward. The effect spans a range of slightly more than one octave.\nA second method of rear delay array combines end-fire topology with polarity reversal, using two subwoofers positioned front to back, the drivers spaced one-quarter wavelength apart, the rear enclosure inverted in polarity and delayed by a few milliseconds for maximum cancellation on stage of the target frequency. This method has the least output power directed toward the audience, compared to other directional methods.\nEnd-fire array.\nThe end-fire subwoofer method, also called \"forward steered arrays\", places subwoofer drivers co-axially in one or more rows, using destructive interference to reduce emissions to the sides and rear. This can be done with separate subwoofer enclosures positioned front to back with a spacing between them of one-quarter wavelength of the target frequency, the frequency that is least wanted on stage or most desired in the audience. Each row is delayed beyond the first row by an amount related to the speed of sound in air; the delay is typically a few milliseconds. The arrival time of sound energy from all the subwoofers is near-simultaneous from the audience's perspective, but is canceled out to a large degree behind the subwoofers because of offset sound wave arrival times. Directionality of the target frequency can achieve as much as 25\u00a0dB rear attenuation, and the forward sound is coherently summed in line with the subwoofers. The positional technique of end-fire subwoofers came into widespread use in European live concert sound in 2006.\nThe end-fire array trades a few decibels of output power for directionality, so it requires more enclosures for the same output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures. Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 at one of the stages of the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce low-frequency interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.\nDelay-shaded array.\nA long line of subwoofers placed horizontally along the front edge of the stage can be delayed such that the center subwoofers fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to \"their\" neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of the horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.\nDirectional enclosure.\nSome subwoofer enclosure designs rely on drivers facing to the sides or to the rear in order to achieve a degree of directionality. End-fire drivers can be positioned within a single enclosure that houses more than one driver.\nVariants.\nSome less commonly used bass enclosures are variants of the subwoofer enclosure's normal range, such as the upper-bass cabinet (80\u2013200 Hz) and the infrasonic (extra low) subwoofer (below 20 Hz).\nEnclosure designs.\nFront-loaded subwoofers have one or more subwoofer speakers in a cabinet, typically with a grille to protect the speakers. In practice, many front-loaded subwoofer cabinets have a vent or port in the speaker cabinet, thus creating a bass reflex enclosure. Even though a bass reflex port or vent creates some additional phase delay, it adds SPL, which is often a key factor in PA and sound reinforcement system applications. As such, non-vented front-firing subwoofer cabinets are rare in pro audio applications.\nHorn-loaded subwoofers have a subwoofer speaker that has a pathway following the loudspeaker. To save space, the pathway is often folded, so that the folded pathway will fit into a box-style cabinet. Cerwin-Vega states that its folded horn subwoofer cabinets, \"...on average, produce 6dB more output at 1 watt than a dual 18[-inch] vented box\" giving \"four times the output with half the number of drivers\". The Cerwin-Vega JE-36C has a five feet long folded horn chamber length in the wooden cabinet.\nManifold subwoofers have two or more subwoofer speakers that feed the throat of a single horn. This increases SPL for the subwoofer, at the cost of increased distortion. EV has a manifold speaker cabinet in which four drivers are mounted as close together as practical. This is a different design than the \"multiple drivers in one throat\" approach. An unusual example of manifold subwoofer design is the Thomas Mundorf (TM) approach of having four subwoofers facing each other and sitting close together, which is used for theater in the round shows, where the audience surrounds the performers in a big circle (e.g., Metallica has used this in some concerts). The TM approach produces an omnidirectional bass sound. Cerwin-Vega defines a manifold enclosure as one in which \"...the driver faces into a tuned ported cavity. You hear sound directly from the back of the driver in addition to the sound that emanates out of the port. This type of enclosure design extends the frequency capability of the driver lower than it would reproduce by itself.\"\nBandpass subwoofers have a sealed cabinet within another cabinet, with the \"outer\" cabinet typically having a vent or port.\nBass instrument amplification.\nIn rare cases, sound reinforcement subwoofer enclosures are also used for bass instrument amplification by electric bass players and synth bass players. For most bands and most small- to mid-size venues (e.g., nightclubs and bars), standard bass guitar speaker enclosures or keyboard amplifiers will provide sufficient sound pressure levels for onstage monitoring. Since a regular electric bass has a low \"E\" (41\u00a0Hz) as its lowest note, most standard bass guitar cabinets are only designed with a range that goes down to about 40\u00a0Hz. However, in some cases, performers wish to have extended sub-bass response that is not available from standard instrument speaker enclosures, so they use subwoofer cabinets. Just as some electric guitarists add huge stacks of guitar cabinets mainly for show, some bassists will add immense subwoofer cabinets with 18-inch woofers mainly for show, and the extension subwoofer cabinets will be operated at a lower volume than the main bass cabinets.\nBass guitar players who may use subwoofer cabinets include performers who play with extended range basses that include a low \"B\" string (about 31\u00a0Hz), bassists who play in styles where a very powerful sub-bass response is an important part of the sound (e.g., funk, Latin, gospel, R &amp; B, etc.), and/or bass players who perform in stadium-size venues or large outdoor venues. Keyboard players who use subwoofers for on-stage monitoring include electric organ players who use bass pedal keyboards (which go down to a low \"C\" which is about 33\u00a0Hz) and synth bass players who play rumbling sub-bass parts that go as low as 18\u00a0Hz. Of all of the keyboard instruments that are amplified onstage, synthesizers can produce some of the lowest pitches, because unlike a traditional electric piano or electric organ, which have as their lowest notes a low \"A\" and a low \"C\", respectively, a synth does not have a fixed lowest octave. A synth player can add lower octaves to a patch by pressing an \"octave down\" button, which can produce pitches that are at the limits of human hearing.\nSeveral concert sound subwoofer manufacturers suggest that their subs can be used for bass instrument amplification. Meyer Sound suggests that its 650-R2 Concert Series Subwoofer, a enclosure with two 18-inch drivers (45\u00a0cm), can be used for bass instrument amplification. While performers who use concert sound subwoofers for onstage monitoring may like the powerful sub-bass sound that they get onstage, sound engineers may find the use of large subwoofers (e.g., two 18-inch drivers (45\u00a0cm)) for onstage instrument monitoring to be problematic, because it may interfere with the \"Front of House\" sub-bass sound.\nBass shakers.\nSince infrasonic bass is felt, sub-bass can be augmented using tactile transducers. Unlike a typical subwoofer driver, which produces audible vibrations, tactile transducers produce low-frequency vibrations that are designed to be felt by individuals who are touching the transducer or indirectly through a piece of furniture or a wooden floor. Tactile transducers have recently emerged as a device class, called variously \"bass shakers\", \"butt shakers\" and \"throne shakers\". They are attached to a seat, for instance a drummer's stool (\"throne\") or gamer's chair, car seat or home-cinema seating, and the vibrations of the driver are transmitted to the body then to the ear in a manner similar to bone conduction. They connect to an amplifier like a normal subwoofer. They can be attached to a large flat surface (for instance a floor or platform) to create a large low- frequency conduction area, although the transmission of low frequencies through the feet is not as efficient as through the seat.\nThe advantage of tactile transducers used for low frequencies is that they allow a listening environment that is not filled with loud low-frequency sound waves in the air. This helps the drummer in a rock music band to monitor their kick drum performance without filling the stage with powerful, loud low-frequency sound from a 15-inch (40\u00a0cm) subwoofer monitor and an amplifier, which can \"leak\" into other drum mics and lower the quality of the sound mix. By not having a large, powerful subwoofer monitor, a bass shaker also enables a drummer to lower the sound pressure levels that they are exposed to during a performance, reducing the risk of hearing damage. For home cinema or video game use, bass shakers help the user avoid disturbing others in nearby apartments or rooms, because even powerful sound effects such as explosion sounds in a war video game or the simulated rumbling of an earthquake in an adventure film will not be heard by others. However, some critics argue that the felt vibrations are disconnected from the auditory experience, and they claim that that music is less satisfying with the \"butt shaker\" than sound effects. As well, critics have claimed that the bass shaker itself can rattle during loud sound effects, which can distract the listener.\nWorld record claims.\nWith varying measures upon which to base claims, several subwoofers have been said to be the world's largest, loudest or lowest.\nMatterhorn.\nThe Matterhorn is a subwoofer model completed in March 2007 by Danley Sound Labs in Gainesville, Georgia after a U.S. military request for a loudspeaker that could project infrasonic waves over a distance. The Matterhorn was designed to reproduce a continuous sine wave from 15 to 20\u00a0Hz, and generate 94\u00a0dB at a distance of , and more than 140\u00a0dB for music playback measured at the horn mouth. It can generate a constant 15\u00a0Hz sine wave tone at 140\u00a0dB for 24 hours a day, seven days a week with extremely low harmonic distortion. The subwoofer has a flat frequency response from 15 to 100\u00a0Hz, and is down 3\u00a0dB at 12\u00a0Hz. It was built within an intermodal container long and square. The container doors swing open to reveal a tapped horn driven by 40 long-throw 15-inch (40\u00a0cm) MTX speaker drivers each powered by its own 1000-watt amplifier. The manufacturer claims that 53 13-ply 18\u00a0mm sheets of plywood were used in its construction, although one of the fabricators wrote that double-thickness 26-ply sheets were used for convenience.\nA diesel generator is housed within the enclosure to supply electricity when external power is unavailable. At the annual National Systems Contractors Association (NSCA) convention in March 2007, the Matterhorn was barred from making any loud demonstrations of its power because of concerns about damaging the building of the Orange County Convention Center. Instead, using only a single 20 amp electrical circuit for safety, visitors were allowed to step inside the horn of the subwoofer for an \"acoustic massage\" as the fractionally powered Matterhorn reproduced low level 10\u201315\u00a0Hz waves.\nRoyal Device custom installation.\nAnother subwoofer claimed to be the world's biggest is a custom installation in Italy made by Royal Device primarily of bricks, concrete and sound-deadening material consisting of two subwoofers embedded in the foundation of a listening room. The horn-loaded subwoofers each have a floor mouth that is , and a horn length that is , in a cavity under the floor of the listening room. Each subwoofer is driven by eight 18-inch subwoofer drivers with voice coils. The designers assert that the floor mouths of the horns are additionally loaded acoustically by a vertical wooden horn expansion and the room's ceiling to create a 10\u00a0Hz \"full power\" wave at the listening position.\nConcept Design 60-inch.\nA single diameter subwoofer driver was designed by Richard Clark and David Navone with the help of Eugene Patronis of the Georgia Institute of Technology. The driver was intended to break sound pressure level records when mounted in a road vehicle, calculated to be able to achieve more than 180\u00a0dBSPL. It was built in 1997, driven by DC motors connected to a rotary crankshaft somewhat like in a piston engine. The cone diameter was and was held in place with a surround. With a peak-to-peak stroke, it created a one-way air displacement of . It was capable of generating 5\u201320\u00a0Hz sine waves at various DC motor speeds\u2014not as a response to audio signal\u2014it could not play music. The driver was mounted in a stepvan owned by Tim Maynor but was too powerful for the amount of applied reinforcement and damaged the vehicle. MTX's Loyd Ivey helped underwrite the project and the driver was then called the MTX \"Thunder 1000000\" (one million).\nStill unfinished, the vehicle was entered in an SPL competition in 1997 at which a complaint was lodged against the computer control of the DC motor. Instead of using the controller, two leads were touched together in the hope that the motor speed was set correctly. The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162\u00a0dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.\nMTX Jackhammer.\nThe heaviest production subwoofer intended for use in automobiles is the MTX Jackhammer by MTX Audio, which features a diameter cone. The Jackhammer has been known to take upwards of 6000 watts sent to a dual voice coil moving within a strontium ferrite magnet. The Jackhammer weighs in at and has an aluminum heat sink. The Jackhammer has been featured on the reality TV show \"Pimp My Ride\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Adjectives derived from the word \"eponym\" include \"eponymous\" and \"eponymic\".\nEponyms are commonly used for time periods, places, innovations, biological nomenclature, astronomical objects, works of art and media, and tribal names. Various orthographic conventions are used for eponyms.\nUsage of the word.\nThe term \"eponym\" functions in multiple related ways, all based on an explicit relationship between named people, places or things. \"Eponym\" refers to a person, a place or a thing for which someone or something is named; or that someone or something. Such things share an eponymous relationship. In this way, Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era, but the Elizabethan era can also be referred to as the eponym of Elizabeth I of England. Eponyms may be named for things or places, for example 10 Downing Street, a building named after its street address. Adjectives and verbs may be eponyms, for example \"bowdlerize\".\nAdjectives derived from the word eponym include \"eponymous\" and \"eponymic\". When Henry Ford is referred to as \"the \"eponymous\" founder of the Ford Motor Company\", his surname \"Ford\" and the name of the motor company have an eponymous relationship. The word \"eponym\" can also refer to the title character of a fictional work (such as Rocky Balboa of the \"Rocky\" film series), as well as to self-titled works named after their creators (such as the album \"The Doors\" by the band the Doors). \nWalt Disney created the eponymous Walt Disney Company, with his name similarly extended to theme parks such as Walt Disney World.

{"id": "45812", "revid": "33226152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45812", "title": "Pim Fortuyn", "text": "Dutch politician (1948\u20132002)\nWilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, known as Pim Fortuyn (; 19 February 1948 \u2013 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, author, civil servant, businessman, sociologist and academic who founded the party Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002.\nFortuyn worked as a professor at the Erasmus University of Rotterdam before branching into a business career and was an advisor to the Dutch government on social infrastructure. He then became prominent in the Netherlands as a press columnist, writer and media commentator.\nInitially a Marxist who was sympathetic to the Communist Party of the Netherlands, and later a member of the Dutch Labour Party in the 1970s, Fortuyn's beliefs began to shift to the right in the 1990s, especially related to the immigration policies of the Netherlands. Fortuyn criticised multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands. He called Islam \"a backward culture\", and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants. Fortuyn also supported tougher measures against crime and opposed state bureaucracy, wanting to reduce the Dutch financial contribution to the European Union. He was labelled a far-right populist by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label. Fortuyn was openly gay and a supporter of gay rights.\nFortuyn explicitly distanced himself from \"far-right\" politicians such as the Belgian Filip Dewinter, Austrian J\u00f6rg Haider, or Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Pen whenever compared to them. While he compared his own politics to centre-right politicians such as Silvio Berlusconi of Italy and Edmund Stoiber of Germany, he also admired former Dutch Prime Minister Joop den Uyl, a social democrat, and Democratic U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Fortuyn also criticised the polder model and the policies of the outgoing government of Wim Kok and repeatedly described himself and LPF's ideology as pragmatic and not populistic. He also became known for his unconventional and flamboyant way of debating which was considered unique in Dutch politics at the time. In March 2002, his newly created LPF became the largest party in Fortuyn's hometown Rotterdam during the Dutch municipal elections held that year.\nFortuyn was assassinated during the 2002 Dutch national election campaign by Volkert van der Graaf, a left-wing environmentalist and animal rights activist. In court at his trial, Van der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as \"scapegoats\" and targeting \"the weak members of society\" in seeking political power. The LPF went on to poll in second place during the election but went into decline soon after before it was ultimately disbanded at a national level in 2008. Despite this, Fortuyn's ideas and legacy continued to have an impact upon Dutch politics. Observers have described his ideological influence as \"Fortuynism\" or the \"Fortuyn revolt.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nWilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn was born on 19 February 1948 in Driehuis within the Dutch municipality of Velsen, as the third child to a middle class Catholic family. His father was a sales representative for a envelopes and paper company and was involved in local Catholic associations while his mother was a housewife. Fortuyn was raised primarily by his mother as his father was often away for his work. He first attended a Catholic primary school, where Fortuyn later described his time as \"terrible,\" before graduating from the Mendelcollege secondary school in Haarlem where he was described as an academically gifted pupil. \nAs a youth, Fortuyn initially wanted to train as a priest, but in 1967 he began to study sociology at the University of Amsterdam and also attended lectures in history, economics and law. He then transferred after a few months to the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam where he continued his degree in sociology and took joint honours classes in public administration. In 1971 he ended his study with the Academic degree Doctorandus. In 1981 he received a doctorate in sociology at the University of Groningen as a Doctor of Philosophy. \nCareer.\nProfessional career.\nFortuyn worked as a lecturer at the Nyenrode Business Universiteit and as an associate professor at the University of Groningen, where he taught Marxist sociology. He was also an employee of the Groningen University Newspaper for which he wrote columns. He was a Marxist at the time and sympathized with the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN), although he never became a full member. Later, he joined the Labour Party. In 1989 Fortuyn became director of a government organisation administering student transport cards and worked as a research assistant and advisor to the Social and Economic Council (SER). In 1990 he moved to Rotterdam. From 1991 to 1995, he was an extraordinary professor at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, appointed to the Albeda-chair in \"employment conditions in public service\" and ran an education consultancy business.\nWhen his teaching contract in Rotterdam ended, Fortuyn made a career of public speaking, writing books and press columns, and worked as a weekly columnist for \"Elsevier.\" He gradually involved himself in politics through regularly appearing on televised debate shows and became a familiar public figure for his charismatic and flamboyant speaking style. In 1994 he began hosting his own radio program on \"RTV Rijnmond\" and often appeared on the political debate show \"Buitenhof\" and later as a commentator on the business current affairs program \"Business Class\" on RTL Nederland. Fortuyn was openly gay, and said in a 2002 interview that he was Catholic.\nPolitical career.\nFortuyn began his political career on the left and was initially a Marxist due to an aversion to the Dutch political establishment which he described as dominated by pillarization and a \"regent mentality.\" He was sympathetic to the Dutch Communist Party but chose not to become a member due to personal disagreements with the party leadership and self-identified as a Marxist without becoming active in any communist organisations. In the 1970s he joined the Labour Party and became a social democrat. In 1986, his views shifted towards neoliberalism in the hope that the free market would lead to further individual emancipation, ending a perceived oppression by state bureaucracy. In 1991, he proposed firing half of all civil servants and promoted privatisation and decentralisation. In 1992, Fortuyn wrote \"Aan het volk van Nederland\" (\"To the people of the Netherlands\"), in which he declared himself to be the spiritual successor of the charismatic but controversial 18th-century Dutch patriot politician Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol. The book urges the already culturally emancipated citizen to use the free market to also liberate himself economically, from the welfare state. In 1989, Fortuyn left the Labour Party and during the 1990s became a member of the centre-right VVD and was briefly a political consultant to the Christian Democratic Appeal in the early 2000s.\nThough on economic matters Fortuyn would largely remain a neoliberal, culturally he soon became strongly influenced by the neoconservative political philosopher and chief editor of the weekly \"Elsevier\" Hendrik Jan Schoo who made him a columnist in 1993. Schoo deplored that a progressive new class would have promoted multiculturalism, founding an anti-racist civil religion on article 1 of the Dutch constitution, forbidding discrimination. Whereas in the early 1990s Fortuyn had held liberal views on immigration, this changed under the influence of Schoo.\nDutch neocons understood that in the evermore secularising Netherlands a change on the lines of the Reagan Revolution had become highly improbable. Women's rights, gay rights, abortion and euthanasia had been generally accepted. In his 1995 book \"De verweesde samenleving\" (\"The orphaned society\"), Fortuyn claimed that the progressive movement of the 1960s had eroded traditional norms and values. Both the roles of the \"symbolic father\" and the \"caring mother\" had been lost, leaving an orphaned population without guidance, to live out a meaningless decadent existence. However, Fortuyn did not propose a return to old socially conservative or Dutch Calvinist and iconoclastic values and argued that the media, schools and artists should provide a moral leadership, explicitly promoting and defending the new values of modern Western society, constantly recreating the Dutch identity. Fortuyn consistently retained a liberal stance on matters such as LGBT rights throughout his political career.\nAdopting the philosophical analysis by Carl Schmitt, it was assumed that such an identity could only be defined in antithesis to some actually existing concrete enemy. Inspired by Samuel Huntington's \"The Clash of Civilizations\", Dutch ethnicity was to be re-invented by identifying that enemy as Islam. In his 1997 book \"Tegen de islamisering van onze cultuur\" (\"Against the islamisation of our culture\"), Fortuyn proposed that after the fall of communism a new adversary would be found in Muslim culture. Fortuyn explained the global fundamentalist wave of the 1990s as a backlash against the insecurities caused by globalisation. The Dutch should counter Islamic fundamentalism by promoting and defending their own \"fundament\", Dutch culture, especially modernism and the Enlightenment values. These should not yet be imposed on the Dutch population as a whole, with the exception of immigrants. Whereas American neoconservatives promoted hard power policies in relation to the Muslim world, Dutch neocons favoured a soft power approach. Shortly before the September 11 attacks, Fortuyn called for a Cold War against Islam, meaning a non-military defensive enmity. The attacks and the war on terror made Islam a main issue in Dutch politics for the first time.\nFortuyn announced his intention to run for parliament in a television interview with \"EenVandaag\" in 2001, although he did not specify which party he would seek to stand as a candidate with. Although he was already in contact with the newly formed Livable Netherlands (LN) party, he also considered running for the Christian Democratic Appeal which he had worked as a consultant for, or even creating his own list. Livable Netherlands founder Jan Nagel subsequently invited him to run as party leader and Fortuyn was elected \"lijsttrekker\" (lead candidate) by a large majority of party members at the LN conference on 26 November 2001, prior to the Dutch general election of 2002. In his leadership bid and general election campaign, Fortuyn attacked the mainstream parties on multiculturalism, immigration and law &amp; order. He also called for less government interference and for a reform of the Dutch public health and education systems. Fortuyn concluded his speech by stating \"at your service\" in English which he later adopted as his campaign slogan during the general election. Support for LN rose dramatically during Fortuyn's brief leadership, climbing from 2% in opinion polls to about 17%.\nOn 9 February 2002, Fortuyn gave an interview to \"Volkskrant\", a Dutch newspaper (see below) regarding his beliefs on immigration and Islam. His statements were considered so controversial that the LN summoned him to an emergency meeting and then dismissed him as \"lijsttrekker\" the next day after Fortuyn refused to retract his statements. Against the advice of his campaign team, Fortuyn said in the interview that he favoured closing borders to Muslim immigrants and if possible he would abolish the \"peculiar article\" of the Dutch constitution forbidding discrimination (at the time it was generally assumed that he referred to Article 1, the equality before the law; it has been argued, however, that Fortuyn and the interviewer had confused this with Article 137 of the Penal Code, incitement to hatred).\nFounding the LPF.\nHaving been rejected by Livable Netherlands, Fortuyn founded his own party Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) on 14 February 2002, taking many former LN members and supporters with him. Heading the list of the Livable Rotterdam party, considered to be the local counterpart of the LPF, he achieved a major victory in the Rotterdam municipal council elections in early March 2002 where Fortuyn was elected to Rotterdam's municipal council. The new party won about 36% of the seats, making it the largest party in the council. For the first time since the Second World War, the Labour Party was out of power in Rotterdam.\nFortuyn's victory made him the subject of hundreds of interviews during the next three months, and he made many statements about his political ideology. In March he released his book \"The Mess of Eight Purple Years\" (\"De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars\"), which criticised the current political system in the Netherlands and was used as his political agenda for the upcoming general election. Purple is the colour to indicate a coalition government consisting of left parties (red) and conservative-liberal parties (blue). The Netherlands had been governed by such a coalition for eight years at that time.\nOn 14 March 2002, Fortuyn was pied by a left-wing activist from the Biotic Baking Brigade in The Hague. The incident sparked a debate about Fortuyn's security. Fortuyn also received anonymous letters and phone calls containing death threats during the election campaign. As a result, Fortuyn began to express a fear of being injured or assassinated and accused members of the Dutch political establishment of encouraging violence against him. He described Dutch society as tolerant in appearance, not in reality.\nDeath.\nOn 6 May 2002, at age 54, Fortuyn was assassinated by gunshot in Hilversum, North Holland, by Volkert van der Graaf. The attack took place in a car park outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview. This was nine days before the general election, in which he was running. The attacker was pursued by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's driver, and was arrested by the police shortly afterward, still in possession of a handgun. Months later, Van der Graaf confessed in court to the first notable political assassination in the Netherlands since 1672 (excluding World War II). On 15 April 2003, he was convicted of assassinating Fortuyn and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving two-thirds of his sentence, the standard procedure under the Dutch penal system.\nThe assassination shocked many residents of the Netherlands and highlighted the cultural clashes within the country. Various conspiracy theories arose after Pim Fortuyn's murder and deeply affected Dutch politics and society. Politicians from all parties suspended campaigning. After consultation with LPF, the government decided not to postpone the elections. As Dutch law did not permit modifying the ballots, Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. The LPF made an unprecedented debut in the House of Representatives by winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). The LPF joined a cabinet with the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, but conflicts in the rudderless LPF quickly collapsed the cabinet, forcing new elections. By the following year, the party had lost support, winning only eight seats in the 2003 elections. It won no seats in the 2006 elections, by which time the Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, had emerged as a successor.\nDuring the last months of his life, Fortuyn had become closer to the Catholic Church. To the surprise of many commentators and Dutch TV hosts, Fortuyn insisted on Fr. Louis Berger, a parish priest from The Hague, accompanying him in some of his last TV appearances. According to \"The New York Times\", Berger had become his \"friend and confessor\" during the last weeks of his life.\nBurial.\nFortuyn was initially buried in Driehuis in the Netherlands. He was re-interred on 20 July 2002, at San Giorgio della Richinvelda, in the province of Pordenone in Italy, where he had owned a house.\nViews.\nIslam and immigration.\nFortuyn was critical of Islamic culture and argued that gradual Islamization was occurring in Dutch society as a consequence of immigration and multicultural policies in the Netherlands. When asked about his opposition to Muslim immigration, Fortuyn explained that, \"I have no desire to go through the emancipation of women and homosexuals all over again.\" In August 2001, Fortuyn was quoted in the \"Rotterdams Dagblad\" newspaper saying, \"I am also in favour of a cold war with Islam. I see Islam as an extraordinary threat, as a hostile religion.\" In the TV program \"Business Class\", Fortuyn said that Muslims in the Netherlands did not accept Dutch society; he believed that the religion of Islam was fundamentally intolerant and incompatible with Western values. He said that Muslims in the Netherlands needed to accept living \"together\" with the Dutch, and that if this was unacceptable for them, then they were free to leave. His concluding words in the TV program were \"...\u00a0I want to live together with the Muslim people, but it takes two to tango.\" Fortuyn also strongly maintained that he did not object to Muslim immigrants because of their race or ethnicity, and was not against a multiracial society, but opposed what he saw as lack of integration and unwillingness to adapt to Dutch standards of modernity and social liberalism within Muslim communities. \nOn 9 February 2002, additional statements made by him were carried in an interview with \"Volkskrant\" during his leadership of the Livable Netherlands party. Fortuyn argued that Islamic culture would deem him \"less than a pig\" for being a Christian and a homosexual. He said that the Netherlands, with a population of 16 million, had enough inhabitants, and the practice of allowing as many as 40,000 asylum-seekers into the country each year had to be stopped. The actual number for 2001 was 27,000, down slightly on the previous year. Fortuyn also argued that he would not allow any more Muslim immigrants into the Netherlands if it were legally possible. He claimed that if he became part of the next government, he would pursue a restrictive immigration policy while also granting citizenship to a large group of illegal immigrants, saying that he did not intend to \"unload our Moroccan hooligans\" onto the Moroccan King Hassan. Hassan had died three years earlier. He considered Article 7 of the constitution, which asserts freedom of speech, of more importance than Article 1, which forbids discrimination on the basis of religion, life principles, political inclination, race, or sexual preference. Fortuyn also distanced himself from Hans Janmaat of the Centrum Democraten, who in the 1980s wanted to remove all foreigners from the country and was repeatedly convicted for discrimination and hate speech.\nFortuyn proposed that all people who already resided in the Netherlands would be allowed to stay, provided the immigrants adopted the Dutch society's consensus on human rights as their own. He stated: \"not integrating means leaving\" and \"the borders have to be hermetically closed\". He said \"If it were legally possible, I'd say no more Muslims will get in here\", claiming that the influx of Muslims would threaten freedoms in the liberal Dutch society. He thought Muslim culture had never undergone a process of modernisation and therefore still lacked acceptance of democracy and women's, gays', lesbians' and minorities' rights. \nWhen asked by the Dutch newspaper \"Volkskrant\" whether he hated Islam, he replied:\nI don't hate Islam. I consider it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like to keep it that way, thank you very much.\nFortuyn used the word \"achterlijk\", literally meaning \"backward\", but commonly used as an insult in the sense of \"retarded\". After his use of \"achterlijk\" caused an uproar, Fortuyn said he had used the word with its literal meaning of \"backward\".\nFortuyn wrote \"Against the Islamization of Our Culture\" (1997) (in Dutch).\nDuring its brief time in government, Fortuyn's party the LPF attempted to introduce a new proposal on immigration under LPF minister Hilbrand Nawijn called the \"One-Off Regulation 2003\" which would grant a general pardon to asylum seekers who had been in the Netherlands for more than five years combined with a temporary freeze on migration and new restrictions on further immigration.\nFortuynism.\nThe ideology or political style that is derived from Pim Fortuyn, and in turn the LPF, is often called Fortuynism. Observers variously saw him as a political protest targeting the alleged elitism and bureaucratic style of the Dutch purple coalitions or as offering an appealing political style. The style was characterized variously as one \"of openness, directness and clearness\", populism or simply as charisma. Another school holds Fortuynism as a distinct ideology, with an alternative vision of society. Some argued that Fortuynism was not just \"one\" ideology, but contained liberalism, populism and nationalism.\nDuring the 2002 campaign, Fortuyn was accused by some of being on the \"extreme right\", although others saw only certain similarities. While he employed anti-immigration rhetoric, he considered himself neither a radical nationalist nor a defender of traditional authoritarian values. Fortuyn stated that he did not view himself as a far-right politician, nor as a libertarian populist, and disputed these labels when they were employed by the press to describe him. On the contrary, Fortuyn claimed he wanted to protect the socio-culturally liberal values of the Netherlands, women's rights and sexual minorities (he was openly gay himself), from the \"backward\" Islamic culture. He held liberal views favouring the drug policy of the Netherlands, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and related positions. Fortuyn was also a member of the Republican Society, and favoured a system with an elected president, elected mayors and police commissioners. He also expressed support for the state of Israel throughout his political career.\nThe LPF also won support from some ethnic minorities; one of Fortuyn's closest associates was of Cape Verdean origin, and one of the party's MPs was a young woman of Turkish descent.\nHis ideology comprised the following positions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCriticism.\nFortuyn was compared with the politicians J\u00f6rg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen in the foreign press. These comparisons were often referred to by Dutch reporters and politicians. An explicit comparison with Le Pen was made by Ad Melkert, then \"lijsttrekker\" of the Labour Party, who said in Emmen on 24 April 2002: \"If you flirt with Fortuyn, then in the Netherlands the same thing will happen as happened in France. There they woke up with Le Pen, soon we will wake up with Fortuyn.\"\nOn 5 May, the day before the assassination, Fortuyn in a debate with Melkert organized by the \"Algemeen Dagblad\" newspaper claimed that he was demonized. In it he said that he often had to tell journalists that the image created of him in the media was incorrect.\nColumnist Jan Blokker wrote that \"[a]fter reading [...] I realized once again that Professor Pim may really be called the Jean-Marie Le Pen, the Filip Dewinter, the J\u00f6rg Haider and the new Hans Janmaat of the Netherlands.\" Prime Minister Wim Kok accused Fortuyn of stirring up fear and stimulating xenophobia among the Dutch people. In the run-up to the 2002 election, GroenLinks leader Paul Rosenm\u00f6ller claimed Fortuyn's policies were \"not just right but extreme right\".\nFortuyn often responded to criticism by maintaining that his views were misunderstood or distorted by the media, and in turn rejected comparisons and expressed personal distaste for radical far-right politicians in other European countries. He explicitly distanced himself from Jean-Marie Le Pen and criticised some of his policies, including Le Pen's downplaying of the Holocaust. During an interview with BBC News journalist Kirsty Lang, Fortuyn stated that his opposition to Muslim immigration was mistakenly demonized as racism by journalists and his opponents, and instead argued that it was based on his desire to preserve Dutch tolerance towards sexual minorities and women and to prevent cultural clashes within Western society. In domestic politics, Fortuyn also distanced his views from hard-right Dutch politicians such as Hans Janmaat and Joop Glimmerveen (who called for the mass expulsion of foreigners from the Netherlands) by maintaining that if he came to power, he would pardon existing illegal immigrants if they had lived in the Netherlands for over five years and offer them a path to citizenship if they could be assimilated into society.\nIn an interview on the Dutch talk show \"Jensen!\" that was broadcast shortly before his death, Fortuyn accused members of the Dutch government and political establishment of putting his life in danger through repeatedly demonizing him and his beliefs.\nLegacy.\nFortuyn changed the Dutch political landscape. The 2002 elections, only weeks after Fortuyn's death, were marked by large losses for the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and especially the social democratic Labour Party (whose parliamentary group was halved in size); both parties replaced their leaders shortly after their losses. The election winners were the Pim Fortuyn List, and the Christian democratic Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) whose leader Jan Peter Balkenende went on to become prime minister. Some commentators in the mainstream political class speculated that Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom created greater support for the LPF, hence that party's brief surge to 17% of the electoral vote and 26 of the 150 seats in the Dutch Parliament. Others opined that voters who would have otherwise supported the LPF had Fortuyn not been murdered voted for the CDA as Balkenende had not joined in with other party leaders in attacking Fortuyn. Balkenende later claimed to have shared some of Fortuyn's opinions and pledged to implement some of his policy ideas. Although the LPF was able to form a coalition with the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, it was bereft with internal strife and quickly lost steam. The coalition cabinet of Jan Peter Balkenende fell within three months, due to infighting within the LPF. In the following elections, the LPF was left with only eight seats in parliament (out of 150) and was not included in the new government. Many of the LPF's successive leaders were not regarded as charismatic as Fortuyn and as the next cabinet under Balkenende continued many of the former coalition's policies, it became harder for the LPF to present an alternative image to the government. However, political commentators speculated that discontented voters might vote for a non-traditional party, if a viable alternative was at hand. Later, the right-wing Party for Freedom led by Geert Wilders, which has a strong stance on immigration and cultural integration, proposing to deport criminal, unemployed or not assimilated non-western immigrants, won nine (out of 150) seats in the 2006 elections and became the largest party in the 2023 elections, reaching 37 seats.\nThe Netherlands has made its asylum policy more strict. Opponents of Fortuynism, such as Paul Rosenm\u00f6ller, Thom de Graaf, and Ad Melkert (all labelling Fortuyn as a right-wing extremist), have objected to what they think is a harsher political and social climate, especially towards immigrants and Muslims.\nHowever, other commentators such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali, David Starkey and Douglas Murray have retrospectively defended some of Fortuyn's beliefs. Former Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende also stated that he later agreed with some of Fortuyn's criticisms of multiculturalism and the purple coalition under Wim Kok.\nContemporary Dutch politics is more polarized than it has been in recent years, especially on the issues for which Fortuyn was best known. People debate the success of their multicultural society, and whether they need to better assimilate newcomers. The government's decision in 2004 to more strictly expel asylum seekers whose applications had failed was controversial. Fortuyn had advocated for a one-time amnesty for those asylum seekers who had resided in the Netherlands for an extended period.\nIn 2004, in a TV show, Fortuyn was chosen as De Grootste Nederlander (\"Greatest Dutchman of all-time\"), followed closely by William of Orange, the leader of the independence war that established the precursor to the present-day Netherlands. The election was not considered representative, as it was held by viewers' voting through the internet and by phoning in. Theo van Gogh had been murdered a few days before by a Muslim, which likely affected people's voting in the TV contest for Fortuyn. The program later revealed that William of Orange had received the most votes, but many could not be counted until after the official closing time of the television show (and the proclamation of the winner), due to technical problems. The official rules of the show said that votes counted before the end of the show would be decisive, but it was suggested that all votes correctly cast before the closing of the vote would be counted. Following the official rules, the outcome was not changed.\nRight-wing politicians gained greater public influence after Fortuyn's death, such as former Minister for Integration &amp; Immigration Rita Verdonk, the prominent critic of Islam, Member of the House of Representatives Geert Wilders who in 2006 formed the Party for Freedom (which became the largest party in the House of Representatives in 2023). These politicians often focus on the debate over cultural assimilation and integration.\nBetween 2003 and 2004, Fortuyn's family donated the condolence letters, cards, objects and register books that were placed at various locations associated with Fortuyn such as his home, Rotterdam city hall, the Homomonument in Amsterdam, Media Park in Hilversum and the House of Representatives to the Meertens Institute. They are currently housed in the Institute's archive and can be consulted for research.\nSupporters of Fortuyn went on to set up the annual \"Pim Fortuyn Prize\" which is awarded to opinion makers, politicians or commentators who best convey the ideas of Pim Fortuyn. Winners have included Ebru Umar, John van den Heuvel and Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever.\nIn 2012, exactly ten years after Fortuyn's murder, a section of the Korte Hoogstraat (city centre) of Rotterdam was renamed \"Pim Fortuynplaats.\" Around a thousand people attended the ceremony. \nIn 2023, a meeting room was named after Fortuyn in the temporary House of Representatives which contains a memorial window.\nTo mark the 22nd anniversary of his death in May 2024, a crowdfunding campaign was started with the approval of Fortuyn's family with the aim of having a number of Fortuyn's books narrated with an AI -generated voice of Fortuyn.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45829", "revid": "50498964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45829", "title": "Structural engineering", "text": "Sub-discipline of civil engineering dealing with the creation of man made structures\nStructural engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering in which structural engineers are trained to design the 'bones and joints' that create the form and shape of human-made structures. Structural engineers also must understand and calculate the stability, strength, rigidity and earthquake-susceptibility of built structures for buildings and nonbuilding structures. The structural designs are integrated with those of other designers such as architects and building services engineer and often supervise the construction of projects by contractors on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, and vehicles where structural integrity affects functioning and safety. See glossary of structural engineering.\nStructural engineering theory is based upon applied physical laws and empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. Structural engineering design uses a number of relatively simple structural concepts to build complex structural systems. Structural engineers are responsible for making creative and efficient use of funds, structural elements and materials to achieve these goals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nStructural engineering dates back to 2700 B.C. when the step pyramid for Pharaoh Djoser was built by Imhotep, the first engineer in history known by name. Pyramids were the most common major structures built by ancient civilizations because the structural form of a pyramid is inherently stable and can be almost infinitely scaled (as opposed to most other structural forms, which cannot be linearly increased in size in proportion to increased loads).\nThe structural stability of the pyramid, whilst primarily gained from its shape, relies also on the strength of the stone from which it is constructed, and its ability to support the weight of the stone above it. The limestone blocks were often taken from a quarry near the building site and have a compressive strength from 30 to 250 MPa (MPa = Pa \u00d7 106). Therefore, the structural strength of the pyramid stems from the material properties of the stones from which it was built rather than the pyramid's geometry.\nThroughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction were carried out by artisans, such as stonemasons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. No theory of structures existed, and understanding of how structures stood up was extremely limited, and based almost entirely on empirical evidence of 'what had worked before' and intuition. Knowledge was retained by guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.\nNo record exists of the first calculations of the strength of structural members or the behavior of structural material, but the profession of a structural engineer only really took shape with the Industrial Revolution and the re-invention of concrete (see History of Concrete). The physical sciences underlying structural engineering began to be understood in the Renaissance and have since developed into computer-based applications pioneered in the 1970s.\nStructural failure.\nThe history of structural engineering contains many collapses and failures. Sometimes this is due to obvious negligence, as in the case of the P\u00e9tion-Ville school collapse, in which Rev. Fortin Augustin \" constructed the building all by himself, saying he didn't need an engineer as he had good knowledge of construction\" following a partial collapse of the three-story schoolhouse that sent neighbors fleeing. The final collapse killed 94 people, mostly children.\nIn other cases structural failures require careful study, and the results of these inquiries have resulted in improved practices and a greater understanding of the science of structural engineering. Some such studies are the result of forensic engineering investigations where the original engineer seems to have done everything in accordance with the state of the profession and acceptable practice yet a failure still eventuated. A famous case of structural knowledge and practice being advanced in this manner can be found in a series of failures involving box girders which collapsed in Australia during the 1970s.\nTheory.\nStructural engineering depends upon a detailed knowledge of applied mechanics, materials science, and applied mathematics to understand and predict how structures support and resist self-weight and imposed loads. To apply the knowledge successfully a structural engineer generally requires detailed knowledge of relevant empirical and theoretical design codes, the techniques of structural analysis, as well as some knowledge of the corrosion resistance of the materials and structures, especially when those structures are exposed to the external environment. Since the 1990s, specialist software has become available to aid in the design of structures, with the functionality to assist in the drawing, analyzing and designing of structures with maximum precision; examples include AutoCAD, StaadPro, ETABS, Prokon, Revit Structure, Inducta RCB, etc. Such software may also take into consideration environmental loads, such as earthquakes and winds.\nProfession.\nStructural engineers are responsible for engineering design and structural analysis. Entry-level structural engineers may design the individual structural elements of a structure, such as the beams and columns of a building. More experienced engineers may be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building.\nStructural engineers often specialize in particular types of structures, such as buildings, bridges, pipelines, industrial, tunnels, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft. Structural engineers who specialize in buildings may specialize in particular construction materials such as concrete, steel, wood, masonry, alloys and composites.\nStructural engineering has existed since humans first started to construct their structures. It became a more defined and formalized profession with the emergence of architecture as a distinct profession from engineering during the industrial revolution in the late 19th century. Until then, the architect and the structural engineer were usually one and the same thing \u2013 the master builder. Only with the development of specialized knowledge of structural theories that emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries, did the professional structural engineers come into existence.\nThe role of a structural engineer today involves a significant understanding of both static and dynamic loading and the structures that are available to resist them. The complexity of modern structures often requires a great deal of creativity from the engineer in order to ensure the structures support and resist the loads they are subjected to. A structural engineer will typically have a four or five-year undergraduate degree, followed by a minimum of three years of professional practice before being considered fully qualified.\nStructural engineers are licensed or accredited by different learned societies and regulatory bodies around the world (for example, the Institution of Structural Engineers in the UK). Depending on the degree course they have studied and/or the jurisdiction they are seeking licensure in, they may be accredited (or licensed) as just structural engineers, or as civil engineers, or as both civil and structural engineers.\nAnother international organisation is IABSE(International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering). The aim of that association is to exchange knowledge and to advance the practice of structural engineering worldwide in the service of the profession and society.\nSpecializations.\nBuilding structures.\nStructural building engineering is primarily driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms and the underlying mathematical and scientific ideas to achieve an end that fulfills its functional requirements and is structurally safe when subjected to all the loads it could reasonably be expected to experience. This is subtly different from architectural design, which is driven by the creative manipulation of materials and forms, mass, space, volume, texture, and light to achieve an end which is aesthetic, functional, and often artistic.\nThe structural design for a building must ensure that the building can stand up safely, able to function without excessive deflections or movements which may cause fatigue of structural elements, cracking or failure of fixtures, fittings or partitions, or discomfort for occupants. It must account for movements and forces due to temperature, creep, cracking, and imposed loads. It must also ensure that the design is practically buildable within acceptable manufacturing tolerances of the materials. It must allow the architecture to work, and the building services to fit within the building and function (air conditioning, ventilation, smoke extract, electrics, lighting, etc.). The structural design of a modern building can be extremely complex and often requires a large team to complete.\nStructural engineering specialties for buildings include:\nEarthquake engineering structures.\nEarthquake engineering structures are those engineered to withstand earthquakes.\nThe main objectives of earthquake engineering are to understand the interaction of structures with the shaking ground, foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes, and design and construct the structures to perform during an earthquake.\nEarthquake-proof structures are not necessarily extremely strong like the El Castillo pyramid at Chichen Itza shown above.\nOne important tool of earthquake engineering is base isolation, which allows the base of a structure to move freely with the ground.\nCivil engineering structures.\nCivil structural engineering includes all structural engineering related to the built environment. It includes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Bridges\nThe structural engineer is the lead designer on these structures, and often the sole designer. In the design of structures such as these, structural safety is of paramount importance (in the UK, designs for dams, nuclear power stations and bridges must be signed off by a chartered engineer).\nCivil engineering structures are often subjected to very extreme forces, such as large variations in temperature, dynamic loads such as waves or traffic, or high pressures from water or compressed gases. They are also often constructed in corrosive environments, such as at sea, in industrial facilities, or below ground.\nMechanical engineering structures.\nThe forces which parts of a machine are subjected to can vary significantly and can do so at a great rate. The forces which a boat or aircraft are subjected to vary enormously and will do so thousands of times over the structure's lifetime. The structural design must ensure that such structures can endure such loading for their entire design life without failing.\nThese works can require mechanical structural engineering:\nAerospace structures.\nAerospace structure types include launch vehicles, (Atlas, Delta, Titan), missiles (ALCM, Harpoon), Hypersonic vehicles (Space Shuttle), military aircraft (F-16, F-18) and commercial aircraft (Boeing 777, MD-11). Aerospace structures typically consist of thin plates with stiffeners for the external surfaces, bulkheads, and frames to support the shape and fasteners such as welds, rivets, screws, and bolts to hold the components together.\nNanoscale structures.\nA nanostructure is an object of intermediate size between molecular and microscopic (micrometer-sized) structures. In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the nanoscale. Nanotextured surfaces have one dimension on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100\u00a0nm. Nanotubes have two dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100\u00a0nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical nanoparticles have three dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100\u00a0nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and ultrafine particles (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometer range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology.\nStructural engineering for medical science.\nMedical equipment (also known as armamentarium) is designed to aid in the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of medical conditions. There are several basic types: diagnostic equipment includes medical imaging machines, used to aid in diagnosis; equipment includes infusion pumps, medical lasers, and LASIK surgical machines; medical monitors allow medical staff to measure a patient's medical state. Monitors may measure patient vital signs and other parameters including ECG, EEG, blood pressure, and dissolved gases in the blood; diagnostic medical equipment may also be used in the home for certain purposes, e.g. for the control of diabetes mellitus. A biomedical equipment technician (BMET) is a vital component of the healthcare delivery system. Employed primarily by hospitals, BMETs are the people responsible for maintaining a facility's medical equipment.\nStructural elements.\nAny structure is essentially made up of only a small number of different types of elements:\nMany of these elements can be classified according to form (straight, plane / curve) and dimensionality (one-dimensional / two-dimensional):\nColumns.\nColumns are elements that carry only axial force (compression) or both axial force and bending (which is technically called a beam-column but practically, just a column). The design of a column must check the axial capacity of the element and the buckling capacity.\nThe buckling capacity is the capacity of the element to withstand the propensity to buckle. Its capacity depends upon its geometry, material, and the effective length of the column, which depends upon the restraint conditions at the top and bottom of the column. The effective length is formula_1 where formula_2 is the real length of the column and K is the factor dependent on the restraint conditions.\nThe capacity of a column to carry axial load depends on the degree of bending it is subjected to, and vice versa. This is represented on an interaction chart and is a complex non-linear relationship.\nBeams.\nA beam may be defined as an element in which one dimension is much greater than the other two and the applied loads are usually normal to the main axis of the element. Beams and columns are called line elements and are often represented by simple lines in structural modeling.\nBeams are elements that carry pure bending only. Bending causes one part of the section of a beam (divided along its length) to go into compression and the other part into tension. The compression part must be designed to resist buckling and crushing, while the tension part must be able to adequately resist the tension.\nTrusses.\nA truss is a structure comprising members and connection points or nodes. When members are connected at nodes and forces are applied at nodes members can act in tension or compression. Members acting in compression are referred to as compression members or struts while members acting in tension are referred to as tension members or ties. Most trusses use gusset plates to connect intersecting elements. Gusset plates are relatively flexible and unable to transfer bending moments. The connection is usually arranged so that the lines of force in the members are coincident at the joint thus allowing the truss members to act in pure tension or compression.\nTrusses are usually used in large-span structures, where it would be uneconomical to use solid beams.\nPlates.\nPlates carry bending in two directions. A concrete flat slab is an example of a plate. Plate behavior is based on continuum mechanics. Due to the complexity involved they are most often analyzed using a finite element analysis. \nThey can also be designed with yield line theory, where an assumed collapse mechanism is analyzed to give an upper bound on the collapse load. This technique is used in practice but because the method provides an upper-bound (i.e. an unsafe prediction of the collapse load) for poorly conceived collapse mechanisms, great care is needed to ensure that the assumed collapse mechanism is realistic.\nShells.\nShells derive their strength from their form and carry forces in compression in two directions. A dome is an example of a shell. They can be designed by making a hanging-chain model, which will act as a catenary in pure tension and inverting the form to achieve pure compression.\nArches.\nArches carry forces in compression in one direction only, which is why it is appropriate to build arches out of masonry. They are designed by ensuring that the line of thrust of the force remains within the depth of the arch. It is mainly used to increase the bountifulness of any structure.\nCatenaries.\nCatenaries derive their strength from their form and carry transverse forces in pure tension by deflecting (just as a tightrope will sag when someone walks on it). They are almost always cable or fabric structures. A fabric structure acts as a catenary in two directions.\nMaterials.\nStructural engineering depends on the knowledge of materials and their properties, in order to understand how different materials support and resist loads. It also involves a knowledge of Corrosion engineering to avoid for example galvanic coupling of dissimilar materials.\nCommon structural materials are:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body. Each spasm usually lasts for a few minutes. Spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks. Some spasms may be severe enough to fracture bones. Other symptoms of tetanus may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate. The onset of symptoms is typically 3 to 21 days following infection. Recovery may take months; about 10% of cases prove to be fatal.\n\"C. tetani\" is commonly found in soil, saliva, dust, and manure. The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin, such as a cut or puncture wound caused by a contaminated object. They produce toxins that interfere with normal muscle contractions. Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms. The disease does not spread between people.\nTetanus can be prevented by immunization with the tetanus vaccine. In those who have a significant wound and have had fewer than three doses of the vaccine, both vaccination and tetanus immune globulin are recommended. The wound should be cleaned, and any dead tissue should be removed. In those who are infected, tetanus immune globulin, or, if unavailable, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used. Muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms. Mechanical ventilation may be required if a person's breathing is affected.\nTetanus occurs in all parts of the world but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil has a high organic content. In 2015, there were about 209,000 infections and about 59,000 deaths globally. This is down from 356,000 deaths in 1990. In the US, there are about 30 cases per year, almost all of which were in people who had not been vaccinated. An early description of the disease was made by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC. The cause of the disease was determined in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone at the University of Turin, and a vaccine was developed in 1924.\nSigns and symptoms.\nTetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles\u2014also known as lockjaw. Similar spasms can also be a feature of trismus. The spasms can also affect the facial muscles, resulting in an appearance called \"risus sardonicus\". Chest, neck, back, abdominal muscles, and buttocks may be affected. Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called opisthotonus. Sometimes, the spasms affect muscles utilized during inhalation and exhalation, which can lead to breathing problems.\nProlonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups, called tetany. These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears. Other symptoms include fever, headache, restlessness, irritability, feeding difficulties, breathing problems, burning sensation during urination, urinary retention, and loss of stool control.\nEven with treatment, about 10% of people who contract tetanus die. The mortality rate is higher in unvaccinated individuals, and in people over 60 years of age.\nIncubation period.\nThe incubation period of tetanus may be up to several months but is usually about ten days. In general, the farther the injury site is from the central nervous system, the longer the incubation period. Shorter incubation periods will have more severe symptoms. In \"trismus nascentium\" (i.e. neonatal tetanus), symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14 days after birth, averaging about 7 days. On the basis of clinical findings, four different forms of tetanus have been described.\nGeneralized tetanus.\nGeneralized tetanus is the most common type of tetanus, representing about 80% of cases. The generalized form usually presents with a descending pattern. The first sign is trismus or lockjaw, then facial spasms (called \"risus sardonicus),\" followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, and rigidity of pectoral and calf muscles. Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid heart rate. Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes, with the body shaped into a characteristic form called opisthotonos. Spasms continue for up to four weeks, and complete recovery may take months.\nNeonatal tetanus.\nNeonatal tetanus (\"trismus nascentium\") is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns, usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated. If the mother has been vaccinated against tetanus, the infants acquire passive immunity, and are thus protected. It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument. As of 1998, neonatal tetanus was common in many developing countries, and was responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all neonatal deaths. In 2010, the worldwide death toll was approximately 58,000 newborns. As the result of a public health campaign, the death toll from neonatal tetanus was reduced by 90% between 1990 and 2010, and by 2013, the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries. Neonatal tetanus is rare in developed countries.\nLocal tetanus.\nLocal tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease, in which people have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury. The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding. Local tetanus is generally milder; only about 1% of cases are fatal, but it may precede the onset of generalized tetanus.\nCephalic tetanus.\nCephalic tetanus is the rarest form of the disease (0.9\u20133% of cases), and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head. It usually occurs after trauma to the head area, including: skull fracture, laceration, eye injury, dental extraction, and otitis media, but it has been observed from injuries to other parts of the body. Paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated, which may cause lockjaw, facial palsy, or ptosis, but other cranial nerves can also be affected. Cephalic tetanus may progress to a more generalized form of the disease. Due to its rarity, clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation, and may not suspect tetanus as the illness. Treatment can be complicated, as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection. Cephalic tetanus is more likely than other forms of tetanus to be fatal, with the progression to generalized tetanus carrying a 15\u201330% case fatality rate.\nCause.\nTetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium, \"Clostridium tetani\". The disease is an international health problem, as \"C.\u00a0tetani\" endospores are ubiquitous. Endospores can be introduced into the body through a puncture wound (penetrating trauma). Due to \"C.\u00a0tetani\" being an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen, such as a puncture wound. With the changes in oxygen levels, the turkey drumstick-shaped endospore can quickly spread.\nThe disease occurs almost exclusively in people who are inadequately immunized. It is more common in hot, damp climates with soil rich in organic matter. Manure-treated soils may contain spores, as they are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many animals, such as horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens. In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism.\nThe spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin. Rarely, tetanus can be contracted through surgical procedures, intramuscular injections, compound fractures, and dental infections. Animal bites can transmit tetanus.\nTetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails. Although rust itself does not cause tetanus, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbor soil bacteria. Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides crevices for dirt containing \"C.\u00a0tetani\", while a nail affords a means to puncture the skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound. An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment may exist under the skin, and the puncturing object can deliver endospores to a suitable environment for growth. It is a common misconception that rust itself is the cause; a related misconception is that a puncture from a rust-free nail is not a risk.\nPathophysiology.\nTetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) binds to the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, is internalized, and is transported back through the axon until it reaches the central nervous system. Here, it selectively binds to and is transported into inhibitory neurons via endocytosis. It then leaves the vesicle for the neuron cytosol, where it cleaves vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) synaptobrevin, which is necessary for membrane fusion of small synaptic vesicles (SSV's). SSV's carry neurotransmitter to the membrane for release, so inhibition of this process blocks neurotransmitter release.\nTetanus toxin specifically blocks the release of the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine from inhibitory neurons. These neurotransmitters keep overactive motor neurons from firing and also play a role in the relaxation of muscles after contraction. When inhibitory neurons are unable to release their neurotransmitters, motor neurons fire out of control, and muscles have difficulty relaxing. This causes the muscle spasms and spastic paralysis seen in tetanus infection.\nThe tetanus toxin, tetanospasmin, is made up of a heavy chain and a light chain. There are three domains, each of which contributes to the pathophysiology of the toxin. The heavy chain has two of the domains. The N-terminal side of the heavy chain helps with membrane translocation, and the C-terminal side helps the toxin locate the specific receptor site on the correct neuron. The light chain domain cleaves the VAMP protein once it arrives in the inhibitory neuron cytosol.\nThere are four main steps in tetanus's mechanism of action: binding to the neuron, internalization of the toxin, membrane translocation, and cleavage of the target VAMP.\nNeurospecific binding.\nThe toxin travels from the wound site to the neuromuscular junction through the bloodstream, where it binds to the presynaptic membrane of a motor neuron. The heavy chain C-terminal domain aids in binding to the correct site, recognizing and binding to the correct glycoproteins and glycolipids in the presynaptic membrane. The toxin binds to a site that will be taken into the neuron as an endocytic vesicle that will travel down the axon, past the cell body, and down the dendrites to the dendritic terminal at the spine and central nervous system. Here, it will be released into the synaptic cleft, and allowed to bind with the presynaptic membrane of inhibitory neurons in a similar manner seen with the binding to the motor neuron.\nInternalization.\nTetanus toxin is then internalized again via endocytosis, this time, in an acidic vesicle. In a mechanism not well understood, depolarization caused by the firing of the inhibitory neuron causes the toxin to be pulled into the neuron inside vesicles.\nMembrane translocation.\nThe toxin then needs a way to get out of the vesicle and into the neuron cytosol for it to act on its target. The low pH of the vesicle lumen causes a conformational change in the toxin, shifting it from a water-soluble form to a hydrophobic form. With the hydrophobic patches exposed, the toxin can slide into the vesicle membrane. The toxin forms an ion channel in the membrane that is nonspecific for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl\u2212 ions. There is a consensus among experts that this new channel is involved in the translocation of the toxin's light chain from the inside of the vesicle to the neuron cytosol, but the mechanism is not well understood or agreed upon. It has been proposed that the channel could allow the light chain (unfolded from the low pH environment) to leave through the toxin pore, or that the pore could alter the electrochemical gradient enough, by letting in or out ions, to cause osmotic lysis of the vesicle, spilling the vesicle's contents.\nEnzymatic target cleavage.\nThe light chain of the tetanus toxin is zinc-dependent protease. It shares a common zinc protease motif (His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His) that researchers hypothesized was essential for target cleavage until this was more recently confirmed by experiment: when all zinc was removed from the neuron with heavy metal chelators, the toxin was inhibited, only to be reactivated when the zinc was added back in. The light chain binds to VAMP, and cleaves it between Gln76 and Phe77. Without VAMP, vesicles holding the neurotransmitters needed for motor neuron regulation (GABA and glycine) cannot be released, causing the above-mentioned deregulation of motor neurons and muscle tension.\nDiagnosis.\nThere are currently no blood tests for diagnosing tetanus. The diagnosis is based on the presentation of tetanus symptoms and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium, which is recovered from the wound in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from people without tetanus. Laboratory identification of \"C.\u00a0tetani\" can be demonstrated only by the production of tetanospasmin in mice. Having recently experienced head trauma may indicate cephalic tetanus--a rare form of tetanus resulting in weakened facial muscles and spasms--if no other diagnosis has been made.\nThe \"spatula test\" is a clinical test for tetanus that involves touching the posterior pharyngeal wall with a soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect. A positive test result is the involuntary contraction of the jaw (biting down on the \"spatula\"), and a negative test result would normally be a gag reflex attempting to expel the foreign object. A short report in \"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene\" states that, in an affected subject research study, the spatula test had a high specificity (zero false-positive test results) and a high sensitivity (94% of infected people produced a positive test).\nPrevention.\nUnlike many infectious diseases, recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in immunity. This is due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin. Tetanospasmin will likely be lethal before it will provoke an immune response.\nTetanus can be prevented by vaccination with tetanus toxoid. The CDC recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years, and standard care practice in many places is to give the booster to any person with a puncture wound who is uncertain of when they were last vaccinated, or if they have had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine. The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound, as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form.\nIn children under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis. For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used.\nThe World Health Organization certifies countries as having eliminated maternal or neonatal tetanus. Certification requires at least two years of rates of less than 1 case per 1,000 live births. In 1998 in Uganda, 3,433 tetanus cases were recorded in newborn babies; of these, 2,403 died. After a major public health effort, Uganda was certified as having eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus in 2011.\nPost-exposure prophylaxis.\nTetanus toxoid can be given in case of suspected exposure to tetanus. In such cases, it can be given with or without tetanus immunoglobulin (also called \"tetanus antibodies\" or \"tetanus antitoxin\"). It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.\nThe guidelines for such events in the United States for people at least 11 years old (and not pregnant) are as follows:\nTreatment.\nTreatment of adult tetanus was covered in a state-of-the-art review in 2025.\nMild tetanus.\nMild cases of tetanus can be treated with:\nSevere tetanus.\nSevere cases will require admission to intensive care. In addition to the measures listed above for mild tetanus:\nDrugs, such as diazepam or other muscle relaxants, can be given to control the muscle spasms. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to paralyze the person with curare-like drugs, and use a mechanical ventilator.\nTo survive a tetanus infection, the maintenance of an airway and proper nutrition are required. An intake of and at least 150\u00a0g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), or through a drip into a vein (parenteral nutrition). This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity. Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve axon terminals.\nThe antibiotic of choice is metronidazole. It can be given intravenously, by mouth, or by rectum. Of likewise efficiency is penicillin, but some raise the concern of provoking spasms because it inhibits GABA receptor, which is already affected by tetanospasmin.\nEpidemiology.\nIn 2013, it caused about 59,000 deaths\u2014down from 356,000 in 1990. Tetanus, notably the neonatal form, remains a significant public health problem in non-industrialized countries, with 59,000 newborns dying worldwide in 2008 as a result of neonatal tetanus. In the United States, from 2000 through 2007, an average of 31 cases were reported per year. Nearly all of the cases in the United States occur in unimmunized individuals, or individuals who have allowed their inoculations to lapse.\nOther animals.\nTetanus is found primarily in goats and sheep. The following are clinical symptoms found in affected goats and sheep. Extended head and neck, tail rigors \n(tail becomes rigid and straight), abnormal gait (walking becomes stiff and abnormal), arched back, stiffness of the jaw muscles, lockjaw,\ntwitching of eyes, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, difficulty or inability to eat and drink, abdominal bloat, spasms (uncontrolled muscular contractions) before death. \nDeath sometimes is due to asphyxiation, secondary to respiratory paralysis.\nHistory.\nTetanus was well known to ancient civilizations, who recognized the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms. In 1884, Arthur Nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria. The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, two pathologists of the University of Turin, who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time. They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a person with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves, and testing their reactions while tetanus was spreading.\nIn 1891, \"C.\u00a0tetani\" was isolated from a human victim by Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d, who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies. In 1897, Edmond Nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans, and could be used for prophylaxis and treatment. Tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed by P.\u00a0Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.\nEtymology.\nThe word tetanus comes from the , which is further from the .\nResearch.\nThere is insufficient evidence that tetanus can be treated or prevented by vitamin C. This is at least partially due to the fact that the historical trials that were conducted in attempts to look for a possible connection between vitamin C and alleviating tetanus patients were of poor quality.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A gyrocompass makes use of one of the seven fundamental ways to determine the heading of a vehicle. A gyroscope is an essential component of a gyrocompass, but they are different devices; a gyrocompass is built to use the effect of gyroscopic precession, which is a distinctive aspect of the general gyroscopic effect. Gyrocompasses, such as the fibre optic gyrocompass are widely used to provide a heading for navigation on ships. This is because they have two significant advantages over magnetic compasses:\nAircraft commonly use gyroscopic instruments (but not a gyrocompass) for navigation and attitude monitoring; for details, see flight instruments (specifically the heading indicator) and gyroscopic autopilot.\nHistory.\nThe first, not yet practical, form of gyrocompass was patented in 1885 by Marinus Gerardus van den Bos. A usable gyrocompass was invented in 1906 in Germany by Hermann Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe, and after successful tests in 1908 became widely used in the German Imperial Navy. Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe founded the company Ansch\u00fctz &amp; Co. in Kiel, to mass produce gyrocompasses; the company is today Raytheon Ansch\u00fctz GmbH. The gyrocompass was an important invention for nautical navigation because it allowed accurate determination of a vessel\u2019s location at all times regardless of the vessel\u2019s motion, the weather and the amount of steel used in the construction of the ship.\nIn the United States, Elmer Ambrose Sperry produced a workable gyrocompass system (1908: https://), and founded the Sperry Gyroscope Company. The unit was adopted by the U.S. Navy (1911), and played a major role in World War I. The Navy also began using Sperry's \"Metal Mike\": the first gyroscope-guided autopilot steering system. In the following decades, these and other Sperry devices were adopted by steamships such as the , airplanes, and the warships of World War II. After his death in 1930, the Navy named the after him.\nMeanwhile, in 1913, C. Plath (a Hamburg, Germany-based manufacturer of navigational equipment including sextants and magnetic compasses) developed the first gyrocompass to be installed on a commercial vessel. C. Plath sold many gyrocompasses to the Weems\u2019 School for Navigation in Annapolis, MD, and soon the founders of each organization formed an alliance and became Weems &amp; Plath.\nBefore the success of the gyrocompass, several attempts had been made in Europe to use a gyroscope instead. By 1880, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) tried to propose a gyrostat to the British Navy. In 1889, Arthur Krebs adapted an electric motor to the Dumoulin-Froment marine gyroscope, for the French Navy. That gave the \"Gymnote\" submarine the ability to keep a straight line while underwater for several hours, and it allowed her to http:// in 1890.\nIn 1923 Max Schuler published his paper containing his observation that if a gyrocompass possessed Schuler tuning such that it had an oscillation period of 84.4 minutes (which is the orbital period of a notional satellite orbiting around the Earth at sea level), then it could be rendered insensitive to lateral motion and maintain directional stability.\nOperation.\nA gyroscope, not to be confused with a gyrocompass, is a spinning wheel mounted on a set of gimbals so that its axis is free to orient itself in any way. When it is spun up to speed with its axis pointing in some direction, due to the law of conservation of angular momentum, such a wheel will normally maintain its original orientation to a fixed point in outer space (not to a fixed point on Earth). Since the Earth rotates, it appears to a stationary observer on Earth that a gyroscope's axis is completing a full rotation once every 24 hours. Such a rotating gyroscope is used for navigation in some cases, for example on aircraft, where it is known as heading indicator or directional gyro, but cannot ordinarily be used for long-term marine navigation. The crucial additional ingredient needed to turn a gyroscope into a gyrocompass, so it would automatically position to true north, is some mechanism that results in an application of torque whenever the compass's axis is not pointing north.\nOne method uses friction to apply the needed torque: the gyroscope in a gyrocompass is not completely free to reorient itself; if for instance a device connected to the axis is immersed in a viscous fluid, then that fluid will resist reorientation of the axis. This friction force caused by the fluid results in a torque acting on the axis, causing the axis to turn in a direction orthogonal to the torque (that is, to precess) along a line of longitude. Once the axis points toward the celestial pole, it will appear to be stationary and won't experience any more frictional forces. This is because true north (or true south) is the only direction for which the gyroscope can remain on the surface of the earth and not be required to change. This axis orientation is considered to be a point of minimum potential energy.\nAnother, more practical, method is to use weights to force the axis of the compass to remain horizontal (perpendicular to the direction of the center of the Earth), but otherwise allow it to rotate freely within the horizontal plane. In this case, gravity will apply a torque forcing the compass's axis toward true north. Because the weights will confine the compass's axis to be horizontal with respect to the Earth's surface, the axis can never align with the Earth's axis (except on the Equator) and must realign itself as the Earth rotates. But with respect to the Earth's surface, the compass will appear to be stationary and pointing along the Earth's surface toward the true North Pole.\nSince the gyrocompass's north-seeking function depends on the rotation around the axis of the Earth that causes torque-induced gyroscopic precession, it will not orient itself correctly to true north if it is moved very fast in an east to west direction, thus negating the Earth's rotation. However, aircraft commonly use heading indicators or directional gyros, which are not gyrocompasses and do not align themselves to north via precession, but are periodically aligned manually to magnetic north.\nErrors.\nA gyrocompass is subject to certain errors. These include steaming error, where rapid changes in course, speed and latitude cause deviation before the gyro can adjust itself. On most modern ships the GPS or other navigational aids feed data to the gyrocompass allowing a small computer to apply a correction.\nAlternatively a design based on a strapdown architecture (including a triad of fibre optic gyroscopes, ring laser gyroscopes or hemispherical resonator gyroscopes and a triad of accelerometers) will eliminate these errors, as they do not depend upon mechanical parts to determinate rate of rotation.\nMathematical model.\nWe consider a gyrocompass as a gyroscope which is free to rotate about one of its symmetry axes, also the whole rotating gyroscope is free to rotate on the horizontal plane about the local vertical. Therefore there are two independent local rotations. In addition to these rotations we consider the rotation of the Earth about its north-south (NS) axis, and we model the planet as a perfect sphere. We neglect friction and also the rotation of the Earth about the Sun.\nIn this case a non-rotating observer located at the center of the Earth can be approximated as being an inertial frame. We establish cartesian coordinates formula_1 for such an observer (whom we name as 1-O), and the barycenter of the gyroscope is located at a distance formula_2 from the center of the Earth.\nFirst time-dependent rotation.\nConsider another (non-inertial) observer (the 2-O) located at the center of the Earth but rotating about the NS-axis by formula_3 We establish coordinates attached to this observer as\nformula_4\nso that the unit formula_5 versor formula_6 is mapped to the point formula_7. For the 2-O neither the Earth nor the barycenter of the gyroscope is moving. The rotation of 2-O relative to 1-O is performed with angular velocity formula_8. We suppose that the formula_9 axis denotes points with zero longitude (the prime, or Greenwich, meridian).\nSecond and third fixed rotations.\nWe now rotate about the formula_10 axis, so that the formula_11-axis has the longitude of the barycenter. In this case we have\nformula_12\nWith the next rotation (about the axis formula_13 of an angle formula_14, the co-latitude) we bring the formula_15 axis along the local zenith (formula_16-axis) of the barycenter. This can be achieved by the following orthogonal matrix (with unit determinant)\nformula_17\nso that the formula_18 versor formula_19 is mapped to the point formula_20\nConstant translation.\nWe now choose another coordinate basis whose origin is located at the barycenter of the gyroscope. This can be performed by the following translation along the zenith axis\nformula_21\nso that the origin of the new system, formula_22 is located at the point formula_23 and formula_2 is the radius of the Earth. Now the formula_25-axis points towards the south direction.\nFourth time-dependent rotation.\nNow we rotate about the zenith formula_26-axis so that the new coordinate system is attached to the structure of the gyroscope, so that for an observer at rest in this coordinate system, the gyrocompass is only rotating about its own axis of symmetry. In this case we find\nformula_27\nThe axis of symmetry of the gyrocompass is now along the formula_28-axis.\nLast time-dependent rotation.\nThe last rotation is a rotation on the axis of symmetry of the gyroscope as in\nformula_29\nDynamics of the system.\nSince the height of the gyroscope's barycenter does not change (and the origin of the coordinate system is located at this same point), its gravitational potential energy is constant. Therefore its Lagrangian formula_30 corresponds to its kinetic energy formula_31 only. We have\nformula_32\nwhere formula_33 is the mass of the gyroscope, and\nformula_34\nis the squared inertial speed of the origin of the coordinates of the final coordinate system (i.e. the center of mass). This constant term does not affect the dynamics of the gyroscope and it can be neglected. On the other hand, the tensor of inertia is given by\nformula_35\nand\nformula_36\nTherefore we find\nformula_37\nThe Lagrangian can be rewritten as\nformula_38\nwhere\nformula_39\nis the part of the Lagrangian responsible for the dynamics of the system. Then, since formula_40, we find\nformula_41\nSince the angular momentum formula_42 of the gyrocompass is given by formula_43 we see that the constant formula_44 is the component of the angular momentum about the axis of symmetry. Furthermore, we find the equation of motion for the variable formula_45 as\nformula_46\nor\nformula_47\nParticular case: the poles.\nAt the poles we find formula_48 and the equations of motion become\nformula_49\nThis simple solution implies that the gyroscope is uniformly rotating with constant angular velocity in both the vertical and symmetrical axis.\nThe general and physically relevant case.\nLet us suppose now that formula_50 and that formula_51, that is the axis of the gyroscope is approximately along the north-south line, and let us find the parameter space (if it exists) for which the system admits stable small oscillations about this same line. If this situation occurs, the gyroscope will always be approximately aligned along the north-south line, giving direction.

{"id": "45833", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45833", "title": "Palatino", "text": "Serif typeface\nPalatino is an old-style serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf, initially released in 1949 by the Stempel foundry and later by other companies, most notably the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. Palatino is optimised for legibility with open counters, balanced proportions, moderate stroke contrast and flared serifs.\nBackground.\nNamed after the 16th-century Italian master of calligraphy Giambattista Palatino, Palatino is based on the humanist types of the Italian Renaissance, which mirror the letters formed by a broad nib pen reflecting Zapf's expertise as a calligrapher. Its capital 'Y' is in the unusual 'palm Y' style, inspired by the Greek letter upsilon, a trait found in some of the earliest versions of the letter such as that of Aldus Manutius. \nUnlike most Renaissance typeface revivals, which tend to have delicate proportions such as a low x-height (short lower-case letters and longer ascenders and descenders), Palatino has larger proportions, increasing legibility. Palatino was particularly intended as a design for trade or 'jobbing' use, such as headings, advertisements and display printing, and was created with a solid, wide structure and wide apertures that could appear clearly on poor-quality paper, when read at a distance or printed at small sizes. \nPalatino is one of several related typefaces by Zapf, which Stempel marketed as an \"extended family\". The group includes Palatino, Sistina, Michelangelo, and Aldus; Zapf's biographer Jerry Kelly describes them as forming \"the largest type family based on classic renaissance forms at the time.\" These designs were strongly influenced by Italian Renaissance letter forms and Roman square capitals, although Zapf was unable to visit Italy until after he had finished the Palatino roman. Palatino rapidly became popular for book body text use, overshadowing the narrower and lighter Aldus, which Zapf had designed for this role. It has been described as one of the ten most used serif typefaces. Since Palatino was not originally designed for body text, some of its characters were intended to stand out with quirky, calligraphic design features, and Zapf later redesigned them with more sober alternates, which have become the norm on most digital versions.\nLinotype licensed Palatino to Adobe and Apple who incorporated it into the PostScript digital printing technology as a standard font. This guaranteed its importance in digital and desktop publishing and made it (or a variant of it) a preinstalled font on most computers. As with many popular fonts, knockoff designs and rereleases under different names are common. Zapf retained an interest in the design, and continued to collaborate on new versions into his eighties.\nPalatino family.\nPalatino.\nPalatino itself, as previously noted, has a solid structure, intended to read clearly on poor-quality paper and printing. Zapf's friend Alexander Lawson wrote that \"the open counters that make Palatino such a legible letter were provided to overcome a then current printing problem in Germany, poor-quality paper. The weight of the type was also thickened beyond that of a normal roman in order to adapt to the lithographic and gravure printing processes of that period. Zapf has steadily maintained that he did not create Palatino as a book type but rather as a commercial face.\"\nDue to Palatino's increasing popularity in body text, multiple versions have been released for the changing technologies of handsetting, hot metal typesetting, phototypesetting and digital font design. Later versions often have regularised details such as a lower 't' and foot serifs on 'p' and 'q'. The italic in particular has gone through several redesigns, with the original for hand-set foundry type being distinctly narrow, the version for the Linotype machine distinctly wide to enable duplexing with the roman, and the versions for subsequent photosetting and digital technologies being in between the two extremes. Hutner and Kelly have described Palatino as \"distinctly modern... a modern type not copied from any specific early model.\"\nPalatino's italic in metal type included a set of swash capitals. These have not been found in digitisations, although digitisations of Zapf's Renaissance Antiqua design (discussed below) do include a (slightly different) set. Later versions alter the descenders on many letters; Zapf originally had to keep these short to fit on the German common line standard, optimised for blackletter typefaces; later versions escape this restriction.\nAldus.\nAldus is an old-style serif design, popular for use in book printing. Compared to Palatino, released some years earlier, it has a more condensed design lighter in colour, more graceful and refined and better suited to the high average quality of book printing. Aldus has a non-kerning roman and italic \"f\", allowing the typographer to avoid ligatures. It appeared in the D. Stempel AG catalog in 1954 and Zapf used it to set his own \"Manuale Typographicum\", a history of letter design.\nAldus is named for the Venetian Renaissance printer Aldus Manutius. The decision annoyed Zapf (who preferred the name \"Palatino Book\") since it bears little direct resemblance to Aldus's typefaces.\nLike Palatino, an upgraded digitisation, Aldus Nova, has been released by Linotype.\nMichelangelo.\nA set of titling capitals, based on Roman square capitals. The design has a 'U' with a foot serif at bottom right, a 'double-V'-style 'W' with four top terminals and a 'palm Y' similar to that on Palatino, inspired by the Greek letter upsilon. It was renamed \"Palatino Titling\" in the Palatino nova release (see below), since the rights to the name were held by Berthold who also published a digitisation.\nSistina.\nA slightly bolder set of titling capitals than Michaelangelo on the same basic structure. It was originally named 'Aurelia Titling' after the Roman road named Via Aurelia; Zapf would later use the name for another separate font. The Palatino nova version (see below) is renamed \"Palatino Imperial\" and has small capitals as a lower case. It was created following an artistically productive 1950 visit to Italy, which Zapf had been unable to visit before. Zapf was very interested in the quality of Italian art and lettering, and his sketches of stonecarving in Florence also inspired the humanist sans-serif Optima.\nKompakt.\nAn ultra-bold display type, with a slight slope but roman rather than italic letter forms. Unlike Palatino, it is very unlike the style of roman type printing used during the Renaissance, which did not use bold type.\nZapf Renaissance Antiqua (1984\u20131986).\nNot part of Stempel's metal Palatino family, Zapf Renaissance Antiqua is a separate interpretation by Zapf of the same Renaissance models dating to 1984\u20131986, initially created for Scangraphic and later digitised and sold by Linotype along with Palatino. Compared to Palatino, Zapf Renaissance Antiqua has greater stroke contrast, which carries through to the sharp serifs and wedge-like punctuation marks, but it also features smoother transitions between thick and thin strokes. It is also notable for including a full set of swash letterforms, with as many as five variants of each lowercase letter \u2013 something not included on digital versions of Palatino. According to Linotype the currently available digitisation is based on the versions prepared by Scangraphic for display use, with tight spacing and striking contrasts in stroke weight. A version marketed under the name \u201cZapf Renaissance Antiqua SB\u201d contains these same high-contrast letterforms, but with looser spacing for running text. However, some typographers have criticized the poor quality of the spacing in all available digitizations, attributing it to an inaccurate conversion from its original, proprietary digital format into PostScript.\nVariants and similar typefaces.\nDigitisations.\nPalatino's early digitisation intended for PostScript use is very widely used or cloned. Later Palatino digitisations have different features and spacing. In 1999, Zapf revised Palatino for Linotype and Microsoft, called Palatino Linotype. The revised family incorporated extended Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets. Linotype released a more complex redesign named Palatino Nova, together with digitisations of some of Zapf's other Renaissance-inspired designs and Aldus. Zapf also created a matching Palatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal design in 2006.\nPalatino Linotype.\nPalatino Linotype is the version of the Palatino family included with modern versions of Microsoft software. It incorporates extended Latin, Greek, Cyrillic characters, as well as currency signs, subscripts and superscripts, and fractions. The family includes roman and italic in text and bold weights.\nPalatino Linotype was notable as being the first western OpenType font that Microsoft shipped; Palatino Linotype was bundled with Windows 2000. The OpenType version showcased some (then new) alternate features, including ligatures, true small caps, proportional and tabular figures, text figures and a variety of special alternate characters, such as the swash Capital Qu combination. This marks it out from earlier digitisations such as the OS X system version, which do not include ligatures such as \"Th\" and \"Qu\". On release it was one of the few fonts to incorporate an interrobang.\nPalatino Nova.\nPalatino Nova is a redesigned version of Palatino, by Hermann Zapf and Akira Kobayashi. This Palatino Nova typeface family includes roman and italics in the light, text, medium, and bold weights, a new release of Aldus and versions of Michelangelo and Sistina under the name of \"Palatino Titling\" and \"Palatino Imperial\".\nThe font family was premiered on November 24, 2005, the same day as Hermann Zapf's 87th birthday celebration. A new digitisation of Aldus named Aldus nova was created at the same time.\nPalatino Sans.\nPalatino Sans is a sans-serif design with stroke width modulation, resembling Zapf's classic design Optima but with a softer, more organic feel. Unlike the serifed counterpart, the Sans families do not have full Greek or Cyrillic characters. Reviewing it for \"Typographica\" on release, font designer Hrant Papazian commented:\nThe confluence of competence, freedom and kiai... evident in Palatino Sans is breathtaking. The sober organicity, the bravado of the raised 'r', the confident flair of the italic; all done before, but never in such a usable, contemporary whole.\nPalatino Sans Informal.\nPalatino Sans Informal incorporates informal characteristics to the Palatino Sans, such as asymmetrical A, K, N, W, X, Y, w.\nPalatino Arabic.\nIt is a family designed by Lebanese designer Nadine Chahine and Hermann Zapf. The design is based on the Al-Ahram typeface designed by Zapf in 1956 but reworked and modified to fit the Palatino Nova family. The design is Naskh in style but with a strong influence of Thuluth style.\nThis family only comes in 1 font, with the Latin characters based on Palatino Nova Regular. It supports basic Latin, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu scripts. Chahine also created a version of Zapf's Zapfino.\nPalatino eText (2013).\nIt is a family designed by Toshi Omagari of Monotype Imaging, optimised for on-screen use. It includes a larger x-height and wider spacing. It is the standard four-font family, with bolds and italics.\nPalatino clones.\nAs one of the most iconic typefaces of the twentieth century, derivative designs based on Palatino were rapidly developed, taking advantage of the lack of practical copyright and the easy copying possible in the phototypesetting font market of the 1960s and 70s onwards. Many of these are almost indistinguishable from Palatino, and some even had Zapf's involvement as a consultant.\nPalazzo Original.\nSoftmaker's clone of Palatino, Palazzo Original, is unique for being based on the original metal type of Palatino: as a result, it contains many design features not seen in the digital versions of Palatino endorsed by Zapf and most clones. These include a 'p' and 'q' without foot serif and no serif on the centre stroke of the 'E' and 'F', as well as a slightly more delicate design with a lower x-height. It has also been released as Marathon Serial without italics.\nPostScript clones.\nMost modern Palatino clones are set to match the spacing and design of the PostScript version of Palatino that was a standard font in early digital publishing. In the Bitstream font collection, the Palatino equivalent is called \"Zapf Calligraphic\".\nURW++ sells its version as \"URW Palladio L\". A version of this font was later released by URW under a free and open-source licence as part of the Ghostscript project to develop an open-source alternative to PostScript. As a result, it (or a derivative) is used by much open-source software such as R as a system font. Palladio, however, lacks the subtle stroke modulation and rounded corners which can be found for example in Palatino Linotype.\nBook Antiqua.\nOne of the best-known Palatino PostScript clones is \"Book Antiqua\" (originally by Monotype), distributed with much Microsoft software, beginning with Microsoft Windows. It is one of many clone PostScript typefaces distributed by Microsoft and Monotype around this time, including Arial (similar to Helvetica), Century Gothic (ITC Avant Garde) and Bookman Old Style (ITC Bookman). Book Antiqua resembles Palatino extremely closely and is almost indistinguishable from the original apart from a few detail differences. (\"Antiqua\" is another word for the \"Roman\" style of typefaces that Palatino is based on, as opposed to blackletter. The genre, inspired by Italian traditions of handwriting and calligraphy, has been a dominant influence on most typefaces and lettering created in the Western world since the Renaissance.)\nIn 1993, Zapf resigned from l'Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI) over what he viewed as its hypocritical attitude toward unauthorized copying by prominent ATypI members (namely Monotype). In the United States, the abstract design of a typeface is not protected by copyright, and can be imitated freely (unless the typeface is protected by a design patent, which is of much more limited duration and rarely applied for). Copyright protection is available for the representation of a typeface in software (a computer font), and the names of typefaces can be protected by trademark.\nMicrosoft has since licensed and distributes Linotype's version of Zapf's original design called \"Palatino Linotype\" in all versions of Windows since Windows 2000. During the Palatino Linotype development process, Zapf and Linotype requested that Microsoft cease to include Book Antiqua with Office, but Microsoft concluded that this was impossible as too many documents had already been created using it. A custom version of Book Antiqua was created by Monotype as a corporate font for the Parliament of the UK.\nFree and open-source versions and derivatives.\nThe first legal free version of Palatino was URW Palladio L. The open-source community greatly extended the character sets of the fonts and releases new, updated versions under new names.\nAsana Math is an OpenType mathematical font designed to look like Palatino (so that math can visually match the text). It is based on the Type 1 \"pxfonts\" by Young Ryu.\nAwards.\nPalatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal won Type Directors Club Type Design Competition 2007 award under Type System / Superfamily category.\nPalatino Arabic won 2008 Type Directors Club TDC2 2008 award under Text / Type Family category.\nSee also.\nThe Aldine type of the Italian renaissance is one of the most influential typefaces in history. Copies based in it made by printers in Paris from the 1530s onwards by engravers such as Claude Garamond became the main style of type used in Europe, and influenced most successive type styles such as those of the Dutch renaissance. Other Aldine roman-influenced revivals include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45834", "revid": "1316908939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45834", "title": "Optima", "text": "Humanist sans-serif typeface\nOptima is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf and released by the D. Stempel AG foundry, Frankfurt, West Germany, in 1958.\nThough classified as a sans-serif, Optima has a subtle swelling at the terminals suggesting a glyphic serif. Optima was inspired by classical Roman capitals and the stonecarving on Renaissance-period tombstones Zapf saw in Florence on a 1950 holiday to Italy.\nZapf intended Optima to be a typeface that could serve for both body text and titling. To prove its versatility, Zapf set his entire book \"About Alphabets\" in the regular weight. Zapf retained an interest in the design, collaborating on variants and expansions into his eighties.\nHistory.\nInterested in calligraphy and the history of Italian printing and lettering, Zapf first visited Italy in 1950. While in Florence, Zapf was particularly interested in the design of the lettering in tombstones of the cemetery of the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, in which the strokes subtly widen as they reach stroke terminals without ending in a serif. He quickly sketched an early draft of the design on a 1000 lira banknote. Zapf was to work on the development of Optima during most of the following decade.\nIn his book \"About Alphabets\", Zapf commented that his key aim in designing Optima's capitals, inspired by the Roman capital model, was the desire to avoid the monotony of all capital letters having a roughly square footprint, as he felt was true of some early sans-serif designs. Like the Roman capitals, Optima's 'E' and 'R' occupy about a half-square, the 'M' is wide and its sides are splayed.\nOn the suggestion of Monroe Wheeler of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Zapf decided to adapt his typeface to be used as a book type. \"He thereupon changed the proportions of the lowercase, and by means of photography, he tested the suitability of the design for continuous reading application.\" Zapf designed the capital letters of Optima after the inscriptions on the Trajan Column (A.D. 113). Optima was the first German typeface not based on the standard baseline alignment. Zapf stated: \"This base line is not ideal for a roman, as it was designed for the high x-height of the Fraktur and Textura letters. Thus, too many German types have ascenders which are too long and descenders which are too short. The proportions of Optima Roman are now in the Golden Section: lowercase x-height equalling the minor and ascenders-descenders the major. However, the curved lines of the stems of each letter result from technical considerations of type manufacturing rather than purely esthetic considerations.\"\nThe development of Optima occurred during the period 1955\u20131958. Optima was first manufactured as a foundry version in 1958 by Stempel of Frankfurt, and by Mergenthaler in America shortly thereafter. It was released to the public at an exhibition in D\u00fcsseldorf the same year. Zapf himself wanted to name the new type face \"New Roman\", but the marketing staff insisted that it be named \"Optima\". In a memoir written for Linotype, Zapf commented: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The name \"Optima\" was not my idea at all. It is for me too presumptuous and was the invention of the sales people at Stempel.\nZapf wrote later in his life of his preference for Optima over all of his other typefaces, but he also mentioned \u201ca father should not have a favorite among his daughters.\u201d\nStructure.\nOptima's design follows humanist lines; its capitals (like those of Palatino, Hans Eduard Meier's Syntax and Carol Twombly's Trajan) originate from the classic Roman monumental capital model, reflecting a reverence for Roman capitals as an ideal form.\nOptima is an example of a modulated-stroke sans-serif, a design type where the strokes are variable in width. The design style has been intermittently favored since the late nineteenth century; Optima is one of the most lasting examples of the genre. Optima was originally targeted by Stempel's Walter Cunz as a competitor to Ludwig &amp; Mayer's Colonia design, which has not been digitised. Shaw also suggests the little-known 1948 design Romann Antiqua, as well as Stellar by Robert Hunter Middleton as predecessors, and notes the existence of Pascal by Jos\u00e9 Mendoza y Almeida (1962) as a design with a similar set of influences. Optima is however quite restrained in stroke width variation; more display-oriented predecessors such as Britannic show far more differentiation in stroke width than Optima does.\nOptima's sloped version was originally an oblique or sloped roman, in which the letters do not take on handwriting characteristics. For Optima nova (discussed below) Zapf decided to create a new true italic with a greater slant angle.\nDuring late development of Optima, Zapf also began working on a non-modulated sans for Linotype, to be named Magnus and intended to compete with Gill Sans. It has never been released.\nOptima Greek (1973).\nA Greek variant designed by Matthew Carter, based on sketches from Hermann Zapf. No digital versions have been produced.\nOptima Classified (1976).\nA variant designed by Matthew Carter, based closely on Optima Medium. No digital versions have been produced.\nOptima nova (2002).\n\"Optima nova\" is a redesign of the original font family, designed by Hermann Zapf and Linotype GmbH type director Akira Kobayashi. The new family contains seven font weights, adding light, demi, and heavy font weights, but removing extra black weight. Medium weight is readjusted to between medium and bold weights in the old family scale. Glyph sets are expanded to include Adobe CE and Latin Extended characters, with light to bold weight fonts supporting proportional lining figures, old style figures, and small caps.\nThe initial and most common release of Optima, like many sans-serif fonts, has an oblique style instead of an italic: the shapes are merely tilted to the right. In Optima nova, this is replaced by a true italic. (In interviews, Zapf has said that this was his original goal from the beginning, but the need to release Optima quickly forced him to settle for an oblique.)\nEven in Roman fonts, letters such as Q, a, f are redesigned. The overall bounding boxes were widened in Optima nova.\nReviewing it, John Berry wrote that \"its 'color' on the page comes much closer to that of the original metal version than any of the earlier photo/digital versions did\" but that \"ends of the strokes in the letters 'a', 'c', and 's' flare much more dramatically than they ever did in the older Optima \u2014 so much so that these letters almost look as though they have serifs...It\u2019s a subtle difference, but it\u2019s disturbing if you\u2019re used to the understated elegance of Optima\u2019s letterforms.\"\nOptima nova Condensed.\nA condensed variant which consists of light to bold weights, but no italic fonts. The glyph set does not support proportional lining figures, old style figures, or small caps.\nOptima nova Titling.\nA titling capitals variant, which contains only capital letters, with restyled letterform. The glyph set is the same as \"Optima nova Condensed\", but also includes extra ligatures. Berry writes in his review of the \"nova\" release: \"it has softly curved joins and interior angles. Instead of the added crispness of detail that you might expect of a face designed for display use, this one looks more sculptural.\"\nIn the tradition of hand lettering and lapidary inscription, the titling face shares similarities with the work of Zapf's friend Herb Lubalin, especially the exuberant ligatures (for which Lubalin's ITC Lubalin Graph and ITC Avant Garde are notable). Further influence of A.M. Cassandre and Rudolf Koch, whose work greatly inspired the young Zapf, can also be seen in Optima.\nOptima Pro Cyrillic (2010).\nIn April 2010, Linotype announced the release of Cyrillic version of the original Optima family, in OpenType Pro font formats. Released fonts include Optima Pro Cyrillic Roman, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique.\nDerivatives.\nAs with many commonly used fonts, knockoff designs and re-releases under different names have been released, some created by Zapf himself. These all tend to copy the original version, rather than the Optima nova design which represents Zapf's final thoughts on the design. In the Bitstream font collection, Zapf Humanist 601 is provided as an Optima clone. Other Optima clones include Optane from the WSI Fonts collection, Opulent by Rubicon Computer Labs Inc., Ottawa from Corel, CG Omega and Eterna. Freely available implementations include URW Classico (available with URW Font package from Ghostscript). Linux Biolinum and Libertinus Sans are libre fonts inspired by it. Zapf's Palatino Sans is a more informal typeface in the same style, with a design reminiscent of brushstrokes or calligraphy.\nKontour Type designed the Utile Display typeface, inspired from the Optima typeface.\nNotable usages.\n Optima is used for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington and used in the official logo and most publications associated with Expo 67 in Montreal. China Southern Airlines also used this typeface for its English name.\nOptima was chosen as the font to be used for the names of those who lost their lives in the September 11 attacks, carved into bronze parapets, at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum, which is named \"Reflecting Absence\". It was also used by U.S. politician John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.\nOpinions on the design have been variable, partly because of its extensive use. Erik Spiekermann described it as \"used on parking garages &amp; hospitals across the United States. Tired &amp; inappropriate. I don\u2019t blame the typeface but the designers.\" He also commented \"Optima is patronizing. It hasn't got the guts to be either a proper Sans or Serif, so it keeps all its options open and appeals to the middle...It suits everything and pleases nobody.\"\nJonathan Hoefler described it as \"signifying a very down-market notion of luxe...the font of choice for the hygiene aisle.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45835", "revid": "46065589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45835", "title": "Hermann Zapf", "text": "German type designer and calligrapher (1918\u20132015)\nHermann Zapf (; 8 November 1918\u00a0\u2013 4 June 2015) was a German type designer and calligrapher who lived in Darmstadt, Germany. He was married to the calligrapher and typeface designer Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse. Typefaces he designed include Palatino, Optima, and Zapfino. He is considered one of the greatest type designers of all time.\nEarly life.\nZapf was born in Nuremberg during turbulent times marked by the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 in Munich and Berlin, the end of World War I, the exile of Kaiser Wilhelm, and the establishment of Bavaria as a free state by Kurt Eisner. In addition, the Spanish flu pandemic took hold in Europe in 1918 and 1919. Two of Zapf's siblings died of the disease. Famine later struck Germany, and Zapf's mother was grateful to send him to school in 1925, where he received daily meals in a program organized by Herbert Hoover. In school, Zapf was mainly interested in technical subjects. One of his favorite books was the annual science journal \"Das neue Universum\" (The New Universe). He and his older brother experimented with electricity, building a crystal radio and an alarm system for his house. Even at this early age, Zapf was already getting involved with type, inventing cipher alphabets to exchange secret messages with his brother.\nZapf left school in 1933 with the ambition of pursuing a career in electrical engineering. However, his father had become unemployed and was in trouble with the newly established Third Reich, having been involved with trade unions, and was sent to the Dachau concentration camp for a short time.\nIntroduction to typography.\nUnder the new political regime, Zapf was not able to attend the Ohm Technical Institute in Nuremberg, and therefore he needed to find an apprenticeship. His teachers, aware of the new political difficulties, noticed Zapf's skill in drawing and suggested that he become a lithographer. Each company that interviewed him for an apprenticeship would ask him political questions, and every time he was interviewed, he was complimented on his work but was rejected. Ten months later, in 1934, he was interviewed by the last company in the telephone directory, and the company did not ask any political questions. They also complimented Zapf's work, but did not do lithography and did not need an apprentice lithographer. However, they allowed him to become a retoucher, and Zapf began his four-year apprenticeship in February 1934.\nIn 1935, Zapf attended an exhibition in Nuremberg in honor of the late typographer Rudolf Koch. This exhibition gave him his first interest in lettering. Zapf bought two books there, using them to teach himself calligraphy. He also studied examples of calligraphy in the Nuremberg city library. Soon, his master noticed his expertise in calligraphy, and Zapf's work shifted to retouching lettering and improving his colleagues' retouching.\nFrankfurt.\nA few days after finishing his apprenticeship, Zapf left for Frankfurt. He did not bear a journeyman's certificate and thus would not be able to get a work permit at another company in Nuremberg, as they would not have been able to check on his qualifications. Zapf went to the Werkstatt Haus zum F\u00fcrsteneck, a building run by Paul Koch, son of Rudolf Koch. He spent most of his time there working in typography and writing songbooks.\nThrough print historian Gustav Mori, Zapf came into contact with the type foundries D. Stempel, AG, and Linotype GmbH of Frankfurt. In 1938, he designed his first printed typeface for them, Gilgengart, a Fraktur.\nWar service.\nOn 1 April 1939, Zapf was conscripted and sent to Pirmasens to help reinforce the Siegfried Line against France. As a consequence of hard labor, he developed heart trouble in a few weeks and was given a desk job, writing camp records and sports certificates in Fraktur.\nWorld War II broke out in September, and Zapf's unit was to be taken into the Wehrmacht. However, because of his heart trouble, Zapf was not transferred to the Wehrmacht but was instead dismissed. On 1 April 1942, he was summoned again for the war effort. Zapf had been chosen for the Luftwaffe, but instead was sent to the artillery in Weimar. He did not perform well, confusing left and right during training and being too cautious and clumsy with his gun. His officers soon brought an unusually early end to his career in the artillery.\nZapf was sent back to the office and then to J\u00fcterbog to train as a cartographer. After that, he went to Dijon and then Bordeaux, joining the staff of the First Army. In the cartography unit at Bordeaux, Zapf drew maps of Spain, especially the railway system, which could have been used to transport artillery had Francisco Franco not used narrow-gauge tracks to repair bridges after the Spanish Civil War. Zapf was happy in the cartography unit. His eyesight was so good that he could write letters 1 millimeter in height without using a magnifying glass, and this skill probably prevented him from being commissioned back into the army.\nAfter the war had ended, Zapf was held by the French as a prisoner of war at a field hospital in T\u00fcbingen. He was treated with respect because of his artwork and, on account of his poor health, was sent home only four weeks after the end of the war. He went back to Nuremberg, which had suffered great damage in air raids.\nPostwar career.\nZapf taught calligraphy in Nuremberg in 1946. He returned to Frankfurt in 1947, where the type foundry Stempel offered him a position as artistic head of their printshop. They did not ask for qualifications, certificates, or references, but instead only required him to show them his sketchbooks from the war and a calligraphic piece he did in 1944 of Hans von Weber's \"Junggesellentext\".\nOne of Zapf's projects was the book \"Feder und Stichel\" (\"Pen and Graver\"), printed from metal plates designed by Zapf and cut by the punchcutter August Rosenberger during the war. It was printed at the Stempel printshop in 1949.\nFrom 1948 to 1950, Zapf taught calligraphy at the Arts and Crafts School in Offenbach, giving lettering lessons twice a week to two classes of graphics students. On 1 August 1951 he married Gudrun von Hesse, who taught at the school of St\u00e4del in Frankfurt.\nMost of Zapf's work as a graphic artist was in book design. He worked for various publishing houses, including Suhrkamp Verlag, Insel Verlag, B\u00fcchergilde Gutenberg, Hanser Verlag, Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, and Verlag Philipp von Zabern.\nType design.\nZapf's career in type design spanned the three most recent stages of printing: hot metal composition, phototypesetting (also called cold type), and digital typesetting. His two most famous typefaces, Palatino and Optima, were designed in 1948 and 1952, respectively. Palatino was designed in conjunction with August Rosenberger, with careful attention to detail. It was named after the 16th-century Italian writing master Giambattista Palatino. It became better known after it became one of the core 35 PostScript fonts in 1984, bundled with virtually all PostScript devices from laser printers to imagesetters. Optima, a flared sans-serif, was released by Stempel in 1958. Zapf intended the design to bridge serifs and sans serifs and to be suitable for both headings and continuous passages of text.\nZapf's work reached into a range of genres. Palatino is a warm, organic design inspired by Italian Renaissance calligraphy and printing. Melior suggests the work of the great German neoclassical printer Justus Erich Walbaum but also is based on the mathematical \"super-ellipse\". His sans serif series URW Grotesk was designed for newspaper use and presents a wide range of widths and weights, reminiscent of geometric sans serif fonts like Futura but in a more eccentric style. Dan Margulis commented on his death that \"you would have to say that his historical standing will be based on the first ten years of his professional career.\"\nZapf's later releases for Linotype in the 1990s and 2000s, often created in collaboration with Akira Kobayashi, were radical reformations of his previous work, often removing compromises that had been necessary in the manufacture of metal type. In this period he created Palatino Sans, a more informal modulated sans serif than Optima.\nZapf's typefaces have been widely copied, sometimes against his will. The best-known example may be Monotype's Book Antiqua, which was included in Microsoft Office and is often considered an imitation of Palatino. In 1993, Zapf resigned from ATypI (Association Typographique Internationale) over what he viewed as its hypocritical attitude toward unauthorized copying by prominent ATypI members. At a 1994 conference of the Raster Imaging and Digital Typography association in Darmstadt, Germany, a panel discussion on digital typefaces and designers' rights strongly criticized the alleged plagiarism of Zapf's Palatino, while several Microsoft attendees listened in the audience. In 1999, Microsoft worked with Zapf and Linotype to develop a new, authorized version of Palatino for Microsoft, called Palatino Linotype.\nSometimes, however, Zapf worked with a font maker to make new versions of his existing typefaces created for another company. For example, in the 1980s Zapf worked with Bitstream to make versions of many of his prior typefaces, including Palatino, Optima and Melior, all with \"Zapf\" in their new names.\nCalligraphy.\nZapf is considered one of the great calligraphers, but he did not work extensively doing commercial lettering and calligraphy. His largest calligraphic project was the \"Preamble to the United Nations Charter\", written in four languages, commissioned by the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York in 1960, for which he received $1000. But his ideas about calligraphy indirectly influenced the look of the mid-20th century as he served as a consultant to Hallmark Cards throughout the 1960s and 70s, helping them to develop a style manual for their lettering artists. His calligraphy was primarily limited to studies and personal works of art. He also taught calligraphy as a part of his workshops every summer at Rochester Institute of Technology during the 1980s.\nComputer typography.\nZapf worked on typography for computer programs from the 1960s onwards. His ideas were considered radical, not taken seriously in West Germany, and rejected by the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, where he lectured from 1972 to 1981. Because he had no success in Germany, Zapf went to the United States, where he lectured about computerized typesetting, and was invited to speak at Harvard University in 1964. The University of Texas at Austin was also interested in Zapf and offered him a professorship, which he did not take, because his wife opposed a move to that state.\nBecause Zapf's plans for the United States had come to nothing, and because their house in Frankfurt had become too small, Zapf and his wife moved to Darmstadt in 1972.\nIn 1976, Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) offered Zapf a professorship in typographic computer programming, the first of its kind in the world. He taught there from 1977 to 1987, flying between Darmstadt and Rochester. There he developed his ideas further, with the help of his connections in companies such as IBM and Xerox and his discussions with computer specialists at Rochester. A number of Zapf's students from this time at RIT went on to become influential type designers, including Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow, who together created the Lucida type family. Other prominent students include the calligrapher and type designer Julian Waters and book designer Jerry Kelly.\nIn 1977, Zapf and his friends Aaron Burns and Herb Lubalin founded Design Processing International, Inc., in New York and developed typographical computer software. It existed until 1986, when Lubalin died. Zapf and Burns founded Zapf, Burns &amp; Company in 1987. Burns, also an expert in typeface design and typography, was in charge of marketing until his death in 1992. Shortly before, two of their employees had stolen Zapf's ideas and founded a company of their own.\nZapf knew that he could not run an American company from Darmstadt and did not want to move to New York. Instead, he used his experience to begin the development of a typesetting program, the \"Hz-program\", building on the hyphenation and justification system in TeX.\nDuring financial problems and bankruptcy of URW++ in the mid-1990s, Adobe Systems acquired the Hz patent(s) and later made some use of the concepts in their InDesign program.\nZapfino.\nIn 1983, Zapf completed the typeface \"AMS Euler\" with Donald Knuth and graduate students in Knuth's and Charles Bigelow's digital typography program at Stanford University, including students Dan Mills, Carol Twombly, and David Siegel and Knuth's computer science PhD students Scott Kim and John Hobby, for the American Mathematical Society. Euler digital font production was eventually finished by Siegel as his M.S. thesis project in 1985. Euler is a typeface family for mathematical composition including Latin, Fraktur and Greek letters. After Siegel finished his studies at Stanford and was interested in entering the field of typography, he told Zapf his idea of making a typeface with a large number of glyph variations and wanted to start with an example of Zapf's calligraphy, which had been reproduced in a publication of the Society of Typographic Arts in Chicago.\nZapf was concerned that this was the wrong way to go, and while he was interested in creating a complicated program, he was worried about starting something new. However, Zapf remembered a page of calligraphy from his sketchbook from 1944 and considered the possibility of making a typeface from it. He had tried to create a calligraphic typeface for Stempel in 1948, but hot metal composition placed too many limits on the freedom of swash characters. Such a pleasing result could only be achieved using modern digital technology, and so Zapf and Siegel began work on the complicated software necessary. Siegel also hired Gino Lee, a programmer from Boston, Massachusetts, to work on the project.\nHowever, just before the project was completed, Siegel wrote a letter to Zapf, saying that his girlfriend had left him and that he had lost all interest in anything. Siegel abandoned the project and started a new life, working on bringing color to Macintosh computers and later becoming an Internet design expert.\nThe development of Zapfino had become seriously delayed until Zapf presented the project to Linotype. The company was prepared to complete it and reorganized the project. Zapf worked with Linotype to create four alphabets and various ornaments, flourishes, and other dingbats. Zapfino was released in 1998.\nLater versions of Zapfino using the Apple Advanced Typography and OpenType technologies were able to make automatic ligatures and glyph substitutions (especially contextual ones, in which the nature of ligatures and substituted glyphs is determined by other glyphs nearby or even in different words), to more accurately reflect the fluid and dynamic nature of Zapf's calligraphy.\nDeath.\nZapf died on 4 June 2015, at the age of 96 in Darmstadt, Germany.\nList of typefaces.\nZapf designed the following typefaces:\nAppearances in film.\nZapf starred in the film \"The Art of Hermann Zapf\", produced in 1967 at Hallmark Cards in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Zapf's design studio in Dreieichenhain, Germany. He was also featured in the 2007 documentary \"Helvetica\", by Gary Hustwit. The documentary \"Alphabet Magic\" about the life and work of Hermann Zapf and Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse, produced and conceived by their niece Professor Alexa Albrand and directed by Marita Neher, was shown in 2019 in Germany and at the Zapf Centennial celebrations that included an exhibit of their work and the Zapf Centennial Symposium at the Grolier Club in New York City.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Drum machines may imitate drum kits or other percussion instruments, or produce unique sounds, such as synthesized electronic tones. A drum machine often has pre-programmed beats and patterns for popular genres and styles, such as pop music, rock music, and dance music. Most modern drum machines made in the 2010s and 2020s also allow users to program their own rhythms and beats. Drum machines may create sounds using analog synthesis or play prerecorded samples.\nWhile a distinction is generally made between drum machines (which can play back pre-programmed or user-programmed beats or patterns) and electronic drums (which have pads that can be struck and played like an acoustic drum kit), there are some drum machines that have buttons or pads that allow the performer to play drum sounds \"live\", either on top of a programmed drum beat or as a standalone performance. Drum machines have a range of capabilities, which go from playing a short beat pattern in a loop, to being able to program or record complex song arrangements with changes of meter and style.\nDrum machines have had a lasting impact on popular music in the 20th century. The Roland TR-808, introduced in 1980, significantly influenced the development of dance music, especially electronic dance music, and hip hop. Its successor, the TR-909, introduced in 1983, heavily influenced techno and house music. The first drum machine to use samples of real drum kits, the Linn LM-1, was introduced in 1980 and was adopted by rock and pop artists including Prince and Michael Jackson. In the late 1990s, software emulations began to overtake the popularity of physical drum machines housed in a separate plastic or metal chassis.\nHistory.\nRhythmicon (1930\u20131932).\nIn 1930\u201332, the innovative and hard-to-use \"Rhythmicon\" was developed by L\u00e9on Theremin at the request of Henry Cowell, who wanted an instrument that could play compositions with multiple rhythmic patterns, based on the overtone series, that were far too hard to perform on existing keyboard instruments. The invention could produce sixteen different rhythms, each associated with a particular pitch, either individually or in any combination, including en masse, if desired. Received with considerable interest when it was publicly introduced in 1932, the Rhythmicon was soon set aside by Cowell.\nChamberlin Rhythmate (1957).\nIn 1957, Harry Chamberlin, an engineer from Iowa, created the Chamberlin Rhythmate, which allowed users to select between 14 tape loops of drum kits and percussion instruments performing various beats. Like the Chamberlin keyboard, the Rhythmate was intended for family singalongs. Around 100 units were sold.\nWurlitzer Side Man (1959).\nIn 1959, Wurlitzer released the Side Man, which generates sounds mechanically by a rotating disc, similar to a music box. A slider controls the tempo (between 34 and 150 beats per minute). Sounds can also be triggered individually through buttons on a control panel. The Side Man was a success and drew criticism from the American Federation of Musicians, which ruled in 1961 that its local jurisdictions could not prohibit Side Man use, though it could not be used for dancing. Wurlitzer ceased production of the Side Man in 1969.\nRaymond Scott (1960\u20131963).\nIn 1960, Raymond Scott constructed the \"Rhythm Synthesizer\" and, in 1963, a drum machine called \"Bandito the Bongo Artist\". Scott's machines were used for recording his album \"Soothing Sounds for Baby\" series (1964).\nFirst fully transistorized drum machines \u2013 Seeburg/Gulbransen (1964).\nDuring the 1960s, the implementation of rhythm machines had evolved into fully solid-state (transistorized) from early electro-mechanical with vacuum tubes, and also size was reduced to desktop size from earlier floor type. In the early 1960s, a home organ manufacturer, Gulbransen (later acquired by Fender) cooperated with an automatic musical equipment manufacturer Seeburg Corporation, and released early compact rhythm machines \"Rhythm Prince\" (PRP), although, at that time, these sizes were still as large as small guitar amp head, due to the use of bulky electro-mechanical pattern generators. Then in 1964, Seeburg invented a compact electronic rhythm pattern generator using \"diode matrix\" (https:// in 1967), and fully transistorized electronic rhythm machine with pre-programmed patterns, \"Select-A-Rhythm\" (SAR1), was released. As a result of its robustness and enough compact size, these rhythm machines were gradually installed on the electronic organ as an accompaniment of organists and finally spread widely.\nKeio-Giken (Korg), Nippon Columbia, and Ace Tone (1963\u20131967).\nIn the early 1960s, a nightclub owner in Tokyo, Tsutomu Katoh, was consulted by a notable accordion player, Tadashi Osanai, about the rhythm machine he used for accompaniment in the club, a Wurlitzer Side Man. Osanai, a graduate of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Tokyo, convinced Katoh to finance his efforts to build a better one. In 1963, their new company Keio-Giken (later Korg) released their first rhythm machine, the Donca-Matic DA-20, using vacuum tube circuits for sounds and a mechanical wheel for rhythm patterns. It was a floor-type machine with a built-in speaker, and featured a keyboard for manual play, in addition to the multiple automatic rhythm patterns. Its price was comparable with the average annual income of Japanese at that time.\nNext, their effort was focused on the improvement of reliability and performance, along with size and cost reductions. Unstable vacuum tube circuits were replaced with reliable transistor circuits on the Donca-Matic DC-11 in the mid-1960s. In 1966, the bulky mechanical wheel was also replaced with a compact transistor circuit on the Donca-Matic DE-20 and DE-11. In 1967, the Mini Pops MP-2 was developed as an option for the Yamaha Electone (electric organ), and Mini Pops was established as a series of compact desktop rhythm machines. In the United States, Mini Pops MP-3, MP-7, etc. were sold under the Univox brand by the distributor at that time, Unicord Corporation.\nIn 1965, Nippon Columbia filed a patent for an automatic rhythm instrument. It described it as an \"automatic rhythm player which is simple but capable of electronically producing various rhythms in the characteristic tones of a drum, a piccolo and so on.\" It has some similarities to Seeburg's slightly earlier 1964 patent.\nIn 1967, Ace Tone founder Ikutaro Kakehashi (later founder of Roland Corporation) developed the preset rhythm-pattern generator using \"diode matrix\" circuit, which has some similarities to the earlier Seeburg and Nippon Columbia patents. Kakehashi's patent describes his device as a \"plurality of inverting circuits and/or clipper circuits\" which \"are connected to a counting circuit to synthesize the output signal of the counting circuit\" where the \"synthesized output signal becomes a desired rhythm.\"\nAce Tone commercialized its preset rhythm machine, called the FR-1 Rhythm Ace, in 1967. It offered 16 preset patterns, and four buttons to manually play each instrument sound (cymbal, claves, cowbell and bass drum). The rhythm patterns could also be cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously, and the possible combination of rhythm patterns were more than a hundred (on the later models of Rhythm Ace, the individual volumes of each instrument could be adjusted with the small knobs or faders). The FR-1 was adopted by the Hammond Organ Company for incorporation within their latest organ models. In the US, the units were also marketed under the Multivox brand by Peter Sorkin Music Company, and in the UK, marketed under the Bentley Rhythm Ace brand.\nEarly preset drum machine users.\nA number of other preset drum machines were released in the 1970s, but early examples of the use can be found on The United States of America's eponymous album from 1967\u20138. The first major pop song to use a drum machine was \"Saved by the Bell\" by Robin Gibb, which reached #2 in Britain in 1969. Drum machine tracks were also heavily used on the Sly &amp; the Family Stone album \"There's a Riot Goin' On\", released in 1971. Sly &amp; the Family Stone was the first group to have a number #1 pop single that used a drum machine: that single was \"Family Affair\".\nThe German krautrock band Can also used a drum machine on their songs \"Peking O\" and \"Spoon\". The 1972 Timmy Thomas single \"Why Can't We Live Together\"/\"Funky Me\" featured a distinctive use of a drum machine and keyboard arrangement on both tracks. Another early example of electronic drums used by a rock band is \"Obscured by Clouds\" by Pink Floyd in 1972. The first album on which a drum machine produced all the percussion was Kingdom Come's \"Journey\", recorded in November 1972 using a Bentley Rhythm Ace. French singer-songwriter L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9 mixed a drum machine with a symphonic orchestra in the song \"Je t'aimais bien, tu sais...\" in his album \"L'Espoir\", released in 1974. Miles Davis' live band began to use a drum machine in 1974 (played by percussionist James Mtume), which can be heard on \"Dark Magus\" (1977). Osamu Kitajima's progressive psychedelic rock album \"Benzaiten\" (1974) also used drum machines.\nProgrammable drum machines.\nIn 1972, Eko released the ComputeRhythm, which was one of the first programmable drum machines. It had a 6-row push-button matrix that allowed the user to enter a pattern manually. The user could also push punch cards with pre-programmed rhythms through a reader slot on the unit.\nAnother stand-alone drum machine released in 1975, the PAiA Programmable Drum Set was also one of the first programmable drum machines, and was sold as a kit with parts and instructions which the buyer would use to build the machine.\nIn 1975, Ace Tone released the Rhythm Producer FR-15 that enables the modification of the pre-programmed rhythm patterns. In 1978, Roland released the Roland CR-78, the first microprocessor-based programmable rhythm machine, with four memory storage for user patterns. In 1979, a simpler version with four sounds, Boss DR-55, was released.\nSteely Dan recording engineer Roger Nichols developed a 125kHz/12bit sampling drum machine and audio sampler in 1978 that he named Wendel, which was used on the \u201cGaucho\u201d album in January 1979 for drums and percussion.\nDrum sound synthesis.\nA key difference between such early machines and more modern equipment is that they use sound synthesis rather than digital sampling in order to generate their sounds. For example, a snare drum or maraca sound would typically be created using a burst of white noise whereas a bass drum sound would be made using sine waves or other basic waveforms. This meant that while the resulting sound was not very close to that of the real instrument, each model tended to have a unique character. For this reason, many of these early machines have achieved a certain \"cult status\" and are now sought after by producers for use in production of modern electronic music, most notably the Roland TR-808.\nDigital sampling.\nThe Linn LM-1 Drum Computer, released in 1980 at $4,995 (), was the first drum machine to use digital samples. It also featured rhythmic concepts such as swing factors, shuffle, accent, and real-time programming. Only about 500 were ever made, but its effect on the music industry was extensive. Its distinctive sound almost defines 1980s pop, and it can be heard on hundreds of hit records from the era, including The Human League's \"Dare\", Gary Numan's \"Dance\", Devo's \"New Traditionalists\", and Ric Ocasek's \"Beatitude\". Prince bought one of the first LM-1s and used it on nearly all of his most popular albums, including \"1999\" and \"Purple Rain\".\nMany of the drum sounds on the LM-1 were composed of two chips that were triggered at the same time, and each voice was individually tunable with individual outputs. Due to memory limitations, a crash cymbal sound was not available except as an expensive third-party modification. A cheaper version of the LM-1 was released in 1982 called the LinnDrum. Priced at $2,995 (), not all of its voices were tunable, but crash cymbal was included as a standard sound. Like its predecessor the LM-1, it featured swappable sound chips. The LinnDrum can be heard on records such as The Cars' \"Heartbeat City\" and Giorgio Moroder's soundtrack for the film \"Scarface\".\nIt was feared the LM-1 would put every session drummer in Los Angeles out of work and it caused many of L.A.'s top session drummers (Jeff Porcaro is one example) to purchase their own drum machines and learn to program them themselves in order to stay employed. Linn even marketed the LinnDrum specifically to drummers.\nFollowing the success of the LM-1, Oberheim introduced the DMX, which also featured digitally sampled sounds and a \"swing\" feature similar to the one found on the Linn machines. It became very popular in its own right, becoming a staple of the nascent hip-hop scene.\nOther manufacturers soon began to produce machines, e.g. the Sequential Circuits Drumtraks and Tom, the E-mu Drumulator and the Yamaha RX11.\nIn 1986, the SpecDrum by Cheetah Marketing, an inexpensive 8-bit sampling drum external module for the ZX Spectrum, was introduced, with a price less than \u00a330, when similar models cost around \u00a3250.\nRoland TR-808 and TR-909.\nIn 1980, the Roland Corporation launched the TR-808 Rhythm Composer. It was one of the earliest programmable drum machines, with which users could create their own rhythms rather than having to use preset patterns. Unlike the more expensive LM-1, the 808 is completely analog, meaning its sounds are generated non-digitally via hardware rather than samples (prerecorded sounds). The 808 was nevertheless the first fully programmable drum machine with which users could program a complete percussion track from beginning to end, complete with breaks and rolls.\nLaunched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream, the 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure. Having built approximately 12,000 units, Roland discontinued the 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock.\nOver the course of the 1980s, the 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market, ease of use, and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, \"booming\" bass drum. It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, dance, and hip hop genres, popularized by early hits such as Marvin Gaye's \"Sexual Healing\" and Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force's \"Planet Rock\". The 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine; its popularity with hip hop in particular has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the Fender Stratocaster's influence on rock. Its sounds continue to be used as samples included with music software and modern drum machines.\nThe 808 was followed in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use MIDI, which synchronizes devices built by different manufacturers. It was also the first Roland drum machine to use samples for some sounds. Like the 808, the 909 was a commercial failure, but had a lasting influence on popular music after cheap units circulated on the used market; alongside the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, it influenced the development of electronic genres such as techno, house and acid.\nLater machines.\nBy 2000, standalone drum machines had become less common, partly supplanted by general-purpose hardware samplers controlled by sequencers (built-in or external), software-based sequencing and sampling and the use of loops, and music workstations with integrated sequencing and drum sounds. TR-808 and other digitized drum machine sounds can be found in archives on the Internet. However, traditional drum machines are still being made by companies such as Roland Corporation (under the name Boss), Zoom, Korg and Alesis, whose SR-16 drum machine has remained popular since it was introduced in 1991.\nThere are percussion-specific sound modules that can be triggered by pickups, trigger pads, or through MIDI. These are called drum modules; the Alesis D4 and Roland TD-8 are popular examples. Unless such a sound module also features a sequencer, it is, strictly speaking, not a drum machine.\nIn the 2010s a revival of interest in analogue synthesis resulted in a new wave of analogue drum machines, ranging from the budget-priced Korg Volca Beats and Akai Rhythm Wolf to the mid-priced Arturia DrumBrute, and the high-end MFB Tanzb\u00e4r and Dave Smith Instruments Tempest. Roland's TR-08 and TR-09 Rhythm Composers were digital recreations of the original TR-808 and 909, while Behringer released an analogue clone of the 808 as the Behringer RD-8 Rhythm Designer. Korg released an analog drum machine, the Volca Beats, in 2013.\nProgramming.\nProgramming of drum machines varies from product to product. On most products, it can be done in real time: the user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a drum kit were being played; or using step-sequencing: the pattern is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by placing them, as with the TR-808 and TR-909, along a 16-step bar. For example, a generic 4-on-the-floor dance pattern could be made by placing a closed high hat on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th steps, then a kick drum on the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th steps, and a clap or snare on the 5th and 13th. This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain fills, breakdowns and other elements that the programmer sees fit, which in turn could be sequenced with song-sequence\u2014essentially the drum machine plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the programmer has chosen. The machine will quantize entries that are slightly off-beat in order to make them exactly in time.\nIf the drum machine has MIDI connectivity, then one could program the drum machine with a computer or another MIDI device.\nComparison with live drumming.\nWhile drum machines have been used much in popular music since the 1980s, \"...scientific studies show there are certain aspects of human-created rhythm that machines cannot replicate, or can only replicate poorly\" such as the \"feel\" of human drumming and the ability of a human drummer to respond to changes in a song as it is being played live onstage. Human drummers also have the ability to make slight variations in their playing, such as playing \"ahead of the beat\" or \"behind the beat\" for sections of a song, in contrast to a drum machine that plays a pre-programmed rhythm. Additionally, human drummers can play a \"tremendously wide variety of rhythmic variations\" that drum machines cannot reproduce.\nLabor costs.\nIncreasingly, drum machines and drum programming are used by major record labels to undercut the costly expense of studio drummers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404\u20131438). Stylistic analysis has indicated the manuscript may have been composed in Italy during the Italian Renaissance. The origins, authorship, and purpose of the manuscript are still debated, but currently scholars lack the translation(s) and context needed to either properly entertain or eliminate any of the possibilities. Hypotheses range from a script for a natural language or constructed language, an unreadable code, cypher, or other form of cryptography, or perhaps a hoax, reference work (i.e. folkloric index or compendium), glossolalia or work of fiction (e.g. science fantasy or mythopoeia, metafiction, speculative fiction).\nThe first confirmed owner was Georg Baresch, a 17th-century alchemist from Prague. The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish book dealer who purchased it in 1912. The manuscript consists of around 240 pages, but there is evidence that some of the pages are missing. The text is written from left to right, and some pages are foldable sheets of varying sizes. Most of the pages have fantastical illustrations and diagrams, some crudely coloured, with sections of the manuscript showing people, unidentified plants and astrological symbols. Since 1969, it has been held in Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. In 2020, Yale University published the manuscript online in its entirety in their digital library.\nThe Voynich manuscript has been studied by both professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II. Codebreakers Prescott Currier, William Friedman, Elizebeth Friedman, and John Tiltman were unsuccessful.\nThe manuscript has never been demonstrably deciphered, and none of the proposed hypotheses have been independently verified. The mystery of its meaning and origin has excited speculation and provoked study.\nDescription.\nCodicology.\nThe codicology, or physical characteristics of the manuscript, have been studied by many researchers. The manuscript measures , with hundreds of vellum pages collected into 18 quires. The total number of pages is around 240, but the exact number depends on how the manuscript's unusual foldouts are counted. The quires have been numbered from 1 to 20 in various locations, using a style of numerals consistent with those used in the 15th century, and the top righthand corner of each \"recto\" (righthand) page has been numbered from 1 to 116, using a style of numerals that originated at a later date. From the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages, it seems likely that in the past, the manuscript had at least 272 pages in 20 quires, some of which were already missing when Wilfrid Voynich acquired the manuscript in 1912. There is strong evidence that many of the book's bifolios were reordered at various points in the book's history, and that its pages were originally in a different order than the order they are in today.\nParchment, covers, and binding.\nSamples from various parts of the manuscript were radiocarbon dated at the University of Arizona in 2009. The results were consistent for all samples tested and indicated a date for the parchment between 1404 and 1438. Protein testing in 2014 revealed that the parchment was made from calfskin, and multispectral analysis showed that it had not been written on before the manuscript was created (i.e., it is not a palimpsest). The quality of the parchment is average and has deficiencies, such as holes and tears, common in parchment codices, but was also prepared with so much care that the skin side is largely indistinguishable from the flesh side. The parchment is made from \"at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins\".\nSome folios (such as 42 and 47) are thicker than the usual parchment.\nThe goat skin binding and covers are not original to the book, but date to its possession by the Collegio Romano. Insect holes are present on the first and last folios of the manuscript in the current order and suggest that a wooden cover was present before the later covers. Discolouring on the edges points to a tanned leather inside cover.\nMedievalist Lisa Fagan Davis describes the parchment as soft, a texture found in books that have been \"heavily thumbed\", indicating the manuscript was handled/paged through a great deal and likely served some routine function, as a medical manual or celestial almanac might; also suggesting it had a workmanlike role, rather than anything sacred or ceremonial, are the holes in the parchment from scabs, wounds, or insect bites, and the lack of any luxurious touches such as gold leaf.\nInk.\nMany pages contain substantial drawings or charts which are coloured with paint. Based on modern analysis using polarized light microscopy (PLM), it has been determined that a quill pen and iron gall ink were used for the text and figure outlines. The ink of the drawings, text, and page and quire numbers have similar microscopic characteristics. In 2009, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that the inks contained major amounts of carbon, iron, sulphur, potassium and calcium with trace amounts of copper and occasionally zinc. EDS did not show the presence of lead, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) identified potassium lead oxide, potassium hydrogen sulphate, and syngenite in one of the samples tested. The similarity between the drawing inks and text inks suggested a contemporaneous origin. \nPaint.\nColoured paint was applied (somewhat crudely) to the ink-outlined figures, possibly at a later date. The blue, white, red-brown, and green paints of the manuscript have been analysed using PLM, XRD, EDS, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).\nThe pigments used were deemed inexpensive.\nRetouching.\nComputer scientist Jorge Stolfi of the University of Campinas highlighted that parts of the text and drawings have been modified, using darker ink over a fainter, earlier script. Evidence for this is visible in various folios, for example \"f1r\", \"f3v\", \"f26v\", \"f57v\", \"f67r2\", \"f71r\", \"f72v1\", \"f72v3\" and \"f73r\".\nText.\nThe manuscript has roughly 38,000 words, of which 9,000 are unique.\nEvery page in the manuscript contains text, mostly in an unidentified language, but some have extraneous writing in Latin script. The bulk of the text in the 240-page manuscript is written in an unknown script, running left to right. Most of the characters are composed of one or two simple pen strokes. There exists some dispute as to whether certain characters are distinct, but a script of 20\u201325 characters would account for virtually all of the text; the exceptions are a few dozen rarer characters that occur only once or twice each. There is no obvious punctuation.\nMuch of the text is written in a single column in the body of a page, with a slightly ragged right margin and paragraph divisions and sometimes with stars in the left margin. Other text occurs in charts or as labels associated with illustrations. The ductus flows smoothly, giving the impression that the symbols were not enciphered; there is no delay between characters, as would normally be expected in written encoded text.\nExtraneous writing.\nOnly a few of the words in the manuscript are thought to have not been written in the unknown script:\nTranscription.\nVarious transcription alphabets have been created to encode Voynich characters as Latin characters, to help with cryptanalysis, such as the Extensible (originally: European) Voynich Alphabet (EVA). The first major one was created by the \"First Study Group\", led by cryptographer William F. Friedman in the 1940s, where each line of the manuscript was transcribed to an IBM punch card to make it machine readable.\nStatistical patterns.\nThe text consists of over 170,000 characters, with spaces dividing the text into about 35,000 groups of varying length, usually referred to as \"words\" or \"word tokens\" (37,919); 8,114 of those words are considered unique \"word types\". The structure of these words seems to follow phonological or orthographic laws of some sort; for example, certain characters must appear in each word (like English vowels), some characters never follow others, or some may be doubled or tripled, but others may not. The distribution of letters within words is also rather peculiar: Some characters occur only at the beginning of a word, some only at the end (like Greek \u03c2), and some always in the middle section.\nThere are a number of patterns of word length, frequency, etc. found in the manuscript that are consistent with natural language (i.e. languages that occurs organically in a human community). The word found most frequently in the manuscript appears roughly twice as often as the second-most-common word, and three times as often as the third-most-common, (following Zipf\u2019s law). The mix of word lengths and the ratio of unique words to total words are similar to languages found around the world. Certain words seem to follow one another in predictable order, as if following rules of grammar.\nJust as one would expect in a normal book whose chapters focused on different subjects, the different sections of the manuscript (based on the drawings of plants, stars, bathing women, etc., accompanying them) have different sets of overrepresented words. The language of the manuscript differs from other known human languages in spelling; with \"too many ... letters repeated in the same order, both within words and across neighboring words\".\nMany researchers have commented upon the highly regular structure of the words. Professor Gonzalo Rubio, an expert in ancient languages at Pennsylvania State University, stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The things we know as grammatical markers \u2013 things that occur commonly at the beginning or end of words, such as 's' or 'd' in our language, and that are used to express grammar, never appear in the middle of 'words' in the Voynich manuscript. That's unheard of for any Indo-European, Hungarian, or Finnish language.\nStephan Vonfelt studied statistical properties of the distribution of letters and their correlations (properties which can be vaguely characterised as rhythmic resonance, alliteration, or assonance) and found that under that respect Voynichese is more similar to the Mandarin Chinese text of the \"Records of the Grand Historian\" than to the text of works from European languages, although the numerical differences between Voynichese and Mandarin Chinese pinyin look larger than those between Mandarin Chinese pinyin and European languages.\nPractically no words have fewer than two letters or more than ten. Some words occur in only certain sections, or in only a few pages; others occur throughout the manuscript. Few repetitions occur among the thousand or so labels attached to the illustrations. There are instances where the same common word appears up to five times in a row (see Zipf's law). Words that differ by only one letter also repeat with unusual frequency, causing single-substitution alphabet decipherings to yield babble-like text. In 1962, cryptanalyst Elizebeth Friedman described such statistical analyses as \"doomed to utter frustration\".\nIn 2014, a team led by Diego Amancio of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo published a study using statistical methods to analyse the relationships of the words in the text. Instead of trying to find the meaning, Amancio's team looked for connections and clusters of words. By measuring the frequency and intermittence of words, Amancio claimed to identify the text's keywords and produced three-dimensional models of the text's structure and word frequencies. The team concluded that, in 90% of cases, the Voynich systems are similar to those of other known books, indicating that the text is in an actual language, not random gibberish.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLinguists Claire Bowern and Luke Lindemann have applied statistical methods to the Voynich manuscript, comparing it to other languages and encodings of languages, and have found both similarities and differences in statistical properties. Character sequences in languages are measured using a metric called h2, or second-order conditional entropy. Natural languages tend to have an h2 between 3 and 4, but Voynichese has much more predictable character sequences, and an h2 around 2. However, at higher levels of organisation, the Voynich manuscript displays properties similar to those of natural languages. Based on this, Bowern dismisses theories that the manuscript is gibberish, but rather is likely to be an encoded natural language or a constructed language. Bowern also concludes that the statistical properties of the Voynich manuscript are not consistent with the use of a substitution cipher or polyalphabetic cipher.\nAs noted in Bowern's review, the writer or writers of the manuscript may have used two methods of encoding at least one natural language. The \"language\" Voynich A appears in the herbal and pharmaceutical parts of the manuscript. The \"language\" known as Voynich B appears in the balneological section, some parts of the medicinal and herbal sections, and the astrological section. The most common vocabulary items of Voynich A and Voynich B are substantially different. Topic modeling of the manuscript suggests that pages identified as written by a particular scribe may relate to a different topic.\nIn terms of morphology, if visual spaces in the manuscript are assumed to indicate word breaks, there are consistent patterns that suggest a three-part word structure of prefix, root or midfix, and suffix. Certain characters and character combinations are more likely to appear in particular fields. There are minor variations between Voynich A and Voynich B. The predictability of certain letters in a relatively small number of combinations in certain parts of words appears to explain the low entropy (h2) of Voynichese. In the absence of obvious punctuation, some variants of the same word appear to be specific to typographical positions, such as the beginning of a paragraph, line, or sentence.\nThe Voynich word frequencies of both variants appear to conform to a Zipfian distribution, supporting the idea that the text has linguistic meaning. This has implications for the encoding methods most likely to have been used, since some forms of encoding interfere with the Zipfian distribution. Measures of the proportional frequency of the ten most common words is similar to those of the Semitic, Iranian, and Germanic languages. Another measure of morphological complexity, lexical diversity, is similar to Iranian, Germanic, and Romance languages.\nHandwriting.\nAccording to journalist Ariel Sabar, the handwriting of the manuscript has \"the easy flow of a long-established script\". Sabar and scholar Lisa Fagin Davis note that using the handwriting style, letterforms, abbreviations, and punctuation of the manuscript to determine its place or date is not feasible because there is \"nothing in history to compare it to\". However Davis did look for and find \"small, stylistic tells\" in the manuscripts writing indicating it highly likely that more than one scribe had worked on writing the manuscript. While the handwriting is consistent, Davis found that in tracking particular letters, she found slight variations in style \u2014 \"larger or smaller loops, straighter or curvier crossbars, longer or shorter feet\" \u2014 and that the variations occurred \"between\" sections of the book but not \"within\" those sections, suggesting that the differences came from \"different scribes rather than of one scribe writing the same letter in different ways\". Davis believes the manuscript was the work of five different scribes, suggesting that it was likely the product of a community, rather than the work of an unwell mind, hoax or other concoction by a single person. \nBowern's review also notes that multiple scribes or \"hands\" may have written the manuscript.\nIllustrations.\nBecause the text cannot be read, the manuscript is conventionally divided into sections based on its illustrations. Most of the manuscript forms six different sections, each typified by illustrations with different styles and supposed subject matter except for the last section, in which the only drawings are small stars in the margin. The conventional sections are:\nEight pages contain only text, and therefore cannot be classifed in any of those categories. At least 14 folios (28 pages) are missing from the manuscript.\nPurpose.\nThe overall impression given by the surviving leaves of the manuscript is that it was meant to serve as a pharmacopoeia or to address topics in medieval or early modern medicine. However, the puzzling details of the illustrations have fuelled many theories about the book's origin, the contents of its text, and the purpose for which it was intended.\nThe first section of the book is almost certainly herbal, but attempts have failed to identify the plants, either with actual specimens or with the stylised drawings of contemporaneous herbals. Only a few of the plant drawings can be identified with reasonable certainty, such as a wild pansy and the maidenhair fern. The herbal pictures that match pharmacological sketches appear to be clean copies of them, except that missing parts were completed with improbable details. In fact, many of the plant drawings in the herbal section seem to be composite: the roots of one species have been fastened to the leaves of another, with flowers from a third.\nAstrological considerations frequently played a prominent role in herb gathering, bloodletting, and other medical procedures common during the likeliest dates of the manuscript. However, interpretation remains speculative, apart from the obvious Zodiac symbols and one diagram possibly showing the classical planets.\nHistory.\nMuch of the book's early provenance is unknown, though the text and illustrations are all characteristically European. In 2009, University of Arizona researchers radiocarbon dated the manuscript's vellum to between 1404 and 1438. In addition, McCrone Associates in Westmont, Illinois, found that the paints in the manuscript were of materials to be expected from that period of European history. There have been erroneous reports that McCrone Associates indicated that much of the ink was added not long after the creation of the parchment, but their official report contains no such statement.\nThe first confirmed owner was Georg Baresch, a 17th-century alchemist from Prague. Baresch was apparently puzzled about this \"Sphynx\" that had been \"taking up space uselessly in his library\" for many years. He learned that Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher from the Collegio Romano had published a Coptic (Egyptian) dictionary and claimed to have deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs; Baresch twice sent a sample copy of the script to Kircher in Rome, asking for clues. The 1639 letter from Baresch to Kircher is the earliest known mention of the manuscript to have been confirmed.\nWhether Kircher answered the request or not is not known, but he was apparently interested enough to try to acquire the book, which Baresch refused to yield. Upon Baresch's death, the manuscript passed to his friend Jan Marek Marci (also known as Johannes Marcus Marci), then rector of Charles University in Prague. A few years later, Marci sent the book to Kircher, his longtime friend and correspondent.\nMarci also sent Kircher a cover letter (in Latin, dated 19 August 1665 or 1666) that was still attached to the book when Voynich acquired it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Reverend and Distinguished Sir, Father in Christ:\nThis book, bequeathed to me by an intimate friend, I destined for you, my very dear Athanasius, as soon as it came into my possession, for I was convinced that it could be read by no one except yourself.\nThe former owner of this book asked your opinion by letter, copying and sending you a portion of the book from which he believed you would be able to read the remainder, but he at that time refused to send the book itself. To its deciphering he devoted unflagging toil, as is apparent from attempts of his which I send you herewith, and he relinquished hope only with his life. But his toil was in vain, for such Sphinxes as these obey no one but their master, Kircher. Accept now this token, such as it is and long overdue though it be, of my affection for you, and burst through its bars, if there are any, with your wonted success.\nDr. Raphael, a tutor in the Bohemian language to Ferdinand III, then King of Bohemia, told me the said book belonged to the Emperor Rudolf and that he presented to the bearer who brought him the book 600 ducats. He believed the author was Roger Bacon, the Englishman. On this point I suspend judgement; it is your place to define for us what view we should take thereon, to whose favor and kindness I unreservedly commit myself and remain\nAt the command of your Reverence,\nJoannes Marcus Marci of Cronland\nPrague, 19th August, 1665 [or 1666]\nThe \"Dr. Raphael\" is believed to be Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky, and the sum of 600 ducats is of actual gold weight. The only matching transaction in Rudolf's records is the 1599 purchase of \"a couple of remarkable/rare books\" from Carl Widemann for the sum of 600 florins. Widemann was a prolific collector of esoteric and alchemical manuscripts, so his ownership of the manuscript is plausible, but unproven.\nWhile Wilfrid Voynich took Raphael's claims at face value, the Bacon authorship theory has been largely discredited. However, a piece of evidence supporting Rudolf's ownership is the now almost invisible name or signature, on the first page of the book, of Jacobus Horcicky de Tepenecz, the head of Rudolf's botanical gardens in Prague. Rudolf died still owing money to de Tepenecz, and it is possible that de Tepenecz may have been given the book (or simply taken it) in partial payment of that debt.\nNo records of the book for the next 200 years have been found, but in all likelihood, it was stored with the rest of Kircher's correspondence in the library of the Collegio Romano (now the Pontifical Gregorian University). It probably remained there until the troops of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy captured the city in 1870 and annexed the Papal States. The new Italian government decided to confiscate many properties of the Church, including the library of the Collegio. Many books of the university's library were hastily transferred to the personal libraries of its faculty just before this happened, according to investigations by Xavier Ceccaldi and others, and those books were exempt from confiscation. Kircher's correspondence was among those books, and so, apparently, was the Voynich manuscript, as it still bears the \"ex libris\" of Petrus Beckx, head of the Jesuit order and the university's rector at the time.\nBeckx's private library was moved to the Villa Mondragone, Frascati, a large country palace near Rome that had been bought by the Society of Jesus in 1866 and housed the headquarters of the Jesuits' Ghislieri College.\nIn 1903, the Society of Jesus (Collegio Romano) was short of money and decided to sell some of its holdings discreetly to the Vatican Library. The sale took place in 1912, but not all of the manuscripts listed for sale ended up going to the Vatican. Wilfrid Voynich acquired 30 of these manuscripts, among them the one which now bears his name. He spent the next seven years attempting to interest scholars in deciphering the script, while he worked to determine the origins of the manuscript.\nIn 1930, the manuscript was inherited after Wilfrid's death by his widow Ethel Voynich, author of the novel \"The Gadfly\" and daughter of mathematician George Boole. She died in 1960 and left the manuscript to her close friend Anne Nill. In 1961, Nill sold the book to antique book dealer Hans P. Kraus. Kraus was unable to find a buyer and donated the manuscript to Yale University in 1969, where it was catalogued as \"MS 408\", sometimes also referred to as \"Beinecke MS 408\".\nTimeline of ownership.\nThe timeline of ownership of the Voynich manuscript is given below. The time when it was possibly created is shown in green (early 1400s), based on carbon dating of the vellum. Periods of unknown ownership are indicated in white. The commonly accepted owners of the 17th century are shown in orange; the long period of storage in the Collegio Romano is yellow. The location where Wilfrid Voynich allegedly acquired the manuscript (Frascati) is shown in green (late 1800s); Voynich's ownership is shown in red, and modern owners are highlighted blue.\nAuthorship hypotheses.\nMany people have been proposed as possible authors of the Voynich manuscript, among them Roger Bacon, John Dee or Edward Kelley, Giovanni Fontana, and Voynich.\nEarly history.\nMarci's 1665/1666 cover letter to Kircher says that, according to his friend the late Raphael Mnishovsky, the book had once been bought by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia for 600\u00a0ducats, of actual gold weight. (Mnishovsky had died in 1644, more than 20\u00a0years earlier, and the deal must have occurred before Rudolf's abdication in 1611, at least 55\u00a0years before Marci's letter. However, Karl Widemann sold books to Rudolf\u00a0II in March\u00a01599.)\nAccording to the letter, Mnishovsky (but not necessarily Rudolf) speculated that the author was 13th-century Franciscan friar and polymath Roger Bacon.&lt;ref name=\"Bacon/Mnishovsky\"&gt;\n&lt;/ref&gt; Marci said that he was suspending judgment about this claim, but it was taken quite seriously by Wilfrid Voynich, who did his best to confirm it. Voynich contemplated the possibility that the author was Albertus Magnus if not Roger Bacon.\nThe assumption that Bacon was the author led Voynich to conclude that John Dee sold the manuscript to Rudolf. Dee was a mathematician and astrologer at the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England who was known to have owned a large collection of Bacon's manuscripts.\nDee and his \"scryer\" (spirit medium) Edward Kelley lived in Bohemia for several years, where they had hoped to sell their services to the emperor. However, this sale seems quite unlikely, according to John Schuster, because Dee's meticulously kept diaries do not mention it.\nIf Bacon did not create the Voynich manuscript, a supposed connection to Dee is much weakened. It was thought possible, prior to the carbon dating of the manuscript, that Dee or Kelley might have written it and spread the rumour that it was originally a work of Bacon's in the hopes of later selling it.249\nFabrication by Voynich.\nSome suspect Voynich of having fabricated the manuscript himself. As an antique book dealer, he probably had the necessary knowledge and means, and a lost book by Roger Bacon would have been worth a fortune. Furthermore, Baresch's letter and Marci's letter only establish the existence of a manuscript, not that the Voynich manuscript is the same one mentioned. These letters could possibly have been the motivation for Voynich to fabricate the manuscript, assuming that he was aware of them. However, many consider the expert internal dating of the manuscript and the June\u00a01999 discovery of Baresch's letter to Kircher as having eliminated this possibility.\nEamon Duffy says that the radiocarbon dating of the parchment (or, more accurately, vellum) \"effectively rules out any possibility that the manuscript is a post-medieval forgery\", as the consistency of the pages indicates origin from a single source, and \"it is inconceivable\" that a quantity of unused parchment comprising \"at least fourteen or fifteen entire calfskins\" could have survived from the early 15th\u00a0century.\nGiovanni Fontana.\nIt has been suggested that some illustrations in the books of an Italian engineer, Giovanni Fontana, slightly resemble Voynich illustrations. Fontana was familiar with cryptography and used it in his books, although he did not use the Voynich script but a simple substitution cipher. In the book \"Secretum de thesauro experimentorum ymaginationis hominum\" (Secret of the treasure-room of experiments in man's imagination), written c.\u00a01430, Fontana described mnemonic machines, written in his cypher. That book and his \"Bellicorum instrumentorum liber\" both used a cryptographic system, described as a simple, rational cipher, based on signs without letters or numbers.\nOther theories.\nSometime before 1921, Voynich was able to read a name faintly written at the foot of the manuscript's first page: \"Jacobj \u00e0 Tepenecz\". This is taken to be a reference to Jakub Ho\u0159\u010dick\u00fd of Tepenec, also known by his Latin name Jacobus Sinapius. Rudolf II had ennobled him in 1607, had appointed him his Imperial Distiller, and had made him curator of his botanical gardens as well as one of his personal physicians. Voynich (and many other people after him) concluded that Jacobus owned the Voynich manuscript prior to Baresch, and he drew a link from that to Rudolf's court, in confirmation of Mnishovsky's story.\nJacobus's name has faded further since Voynich saw it, but is still legible under ultraviolet light. It does not match the copy of his signature in a document located by Jan Hurych in 2003. As a result, it has been suggested that the signature was added later, possibly even fraudulently by Voynich himself. \nBaresch's letter bears some resemblance to a hoax that orientalist Andreas M\u00fcller once played on Athanasius Kircher. M\u00fcller sent some unintelligible text to Kircher with a note explaining that it had come from Egypt, and asking him for a translation. Kircher reportedly solved it. It has been speculated that these were both cryptographic tricks played on Kircher to make him look foolish. \nRaphael Mnishovsky, the friend of Marci who was the reputed source of the Bacon story, was himself a cryptographer and apparently invented a cipher which he claimed was uncrackable (c.\u00a01618). This has led to the speculation that Mnishovsky might have produced the Voynich manuscript as a practical demonstration of his cipher and made Baresch his unwitting test subject. Indeed, the disclaimer in the Voynich manuscript cover letter could mean that Marci suspected some kind of deception.\nIn his 2006 book, Nick Pelling proposed that the Voynich manuscript was written by 15th-century North Italian architect Antonio Averlino (also known as \"Filarete\"), a theory broadly consistent with the radiocarbon dating.\nJules Janick and Arthur O. Tucker, based on plant and animal identification, and the kabbalah map of central Mexico (folio 86v), argued that it was composed in Mexico between 1562 and 1572.\nLanguage hypotheses.\nMany hypotheses have been developed about the Voynich manuscript's \"language\", called \"Voynichese\".\nCiphers.\nAccording to the \"letter-based cipher\" theory, the Voynich manuscript contains a meaningful text in some European language that was intentionally rendered obscure by mapping it to the Voynich manuscript \"alphabet\" through a cipher of some sort\u2014an algorithm that operated on individual letters. This was the working hypothesis for most 20th-century deciphering attempts, including an informal team of NSA cryptographers led by William F. Friedman in the early 1950s.\nThe counterargument is that almost all cipher systems consistent with that era fail to match what is seen in the Voynich manuscript. For example, simple substitution ciphers would be excluded because the distribution of letter frequencies does not resemble that of any known language, while the small number of different letter shapes used implies that nomenclator and homophonic ciphers should be ruled out, because these typically employ larger cipher alphabets. Polyalphabetic ciphers were invented by Alberti in the 1460s and included the later Vigen\u00e8re cipher, but they usually yield ciphertexts where all cipher shapes occur with roughly equal probability, quite unlike the language-like letter distribution which the Voynich manuscript appears to have.\nHowever, the presence of many tightly grouped shapes in the Voynich manuscript (such as \"or\", \"ar\", \"ol\", \"al\", \"an\", \"ain\", \"aiin\", \"air\", \"aiir\", \"am\", \"ee\", \"eee\", among others) does suggest that its cipher system may make use of a \"verbose cipher\", where single letters in a plaintext get enciphered into groups of fake letters. For example, the first two lines of page \"f15v\" contain \"oror or\" and \"or or oro r\", which strongly resemble how Roman numerals such as \"CCC\" or \"XXXX\" would look if verbosely enciphered.\nShorthand.\nIn 1943, Joseph Martin Feely suggested that the manuscript might be a scientific diary, written in a private shorthand system, using abbreviations, for a language such as Latin. However, according to Mary D'Imperio, \"other scholars ... unanimously rejected\" Feely's proposed readings of the text and the hypothesis that the text was composed using a \"system of abbreviated forms\" was \"not considered acceptable\".\nSteganography.\nThis theory holds that the text of the Voynich manuscript is mostly meaningless, but contains meaningful information hidden in inconspicuous details\u2014e.g., the second letter of every word, or the number of letters in each line. This technique, called steganography, is very old and was described by Johannes Trithemius in 1499. Though the plain text was speculated to have been extracted by a Cardan grille (an overlay with cut-outs for the meaningful text) of some sort, this seems somewhat unlikely because the words and letters are not arranged on anything like a regular grid. Still, steganographic claims are hard to prove or disprove, because stegotexts can be arbitrarily hard to find.\nIt has been suggested that the meaningful text could be encoded in the length or shape of certain pen strokes.\nNatural language.\nStatistical analysis of the text reveals patterns similar to those of natural languages. For instance, the word entropy (about 10\u00a0bits per word) is similar to that of English or Latin texts.\nAmancio \"et al.\" (2013) argued that the Voynich manuscript \"is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with random texts\".\nThe linguist Jacques Guy once suggested that the Voynich manuscript text could be some little-known natural language, written plaintext with an invented alphabet. He suggested Chinese in jest, but later comparison of word length statistics with Vietnamese and Chinese made him view that hypothesis seriously.\nIn many language families of East and Central Asia, mainly Sino-Tibetan (Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese), Austroasiatic (Vietnamese, Khmer, etc.) and possibly Tai (Thai, Lao, etc.), morphemes generally have only one syllable.\nChild (1976), a linguist of Indo-European languages for the U.S. National Security Agency, proposed that the manuscript was written in a \"hitherto unknown North Germanic dialect\".\nHe identified in the manuscript a \"skeletal syntax several elements of which are reminiscent of certain Germanic languages\", while the content is expressed using \"a great deal of obscurity\".\nIn January\u00a02014, Stephen Bax of the University of Bedfordshire made public his research into using \"bottom up\" methodology to understand the manuscript. His method involved looking for and translating proper nouns, in association with relevant illustrations, in the context of other languages of the same time period. A paper he posted online offers tentative translation of 14\u00a0characters and 10\u00a0words.\nHe suggested the text is a treatise on nature written in a natural language, rather than a code, but no further work has been done since Bax's death in 2017.\nDeep learning has been proposed as a computing method for analysing language families to which the manuscript's alphabet could be related. In 2023, researchers used deep learning algorithms to demonstrate that, out of a representative sample of seven ancient Indian scripts, the strongest resemblance was to Khojki.\nTucker &amp; Talbert (2014) published a paper claiming a positive identification of 37\u00a0plants, 6\u00a0animals, and one mineral referenced in the manuscript to plant drawings in the \"Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis\" or Badianus manuscript, an Aztec herbal written in 1552.\nTogether with the presence of atacamite in the paint, they argue that the plants were from colonial New Spain and the text represented Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. They date the manuscript to between 1521 (the date of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire) and \"circa\" 1576. These dates contradict the earlier radiocarbon date of the vellum and other elements of the manuscript. However, they argued that the vellum could have been stored and used at a later date. The analysis has been criticised by other Voynich manuscript researchers,\nwho argued that a skilled forger could construct plants that coincidentally have a passing resemblance to theretofore undiscovered existing plants.\nNahuatl specialist M. Pharao\u00a0Hansen has rejected their proposed readings as resting on \"pure speculation\".\nConstructed language.\nThe peculiar internal structure of Voynich manuscript words led William F. Friedman to conjecture that the text could be a constructed language. In 1950, Friedman asked the British army officer John Tiltman to analyse a few pages of the text, but Tiltman did not share this conclusion. In a paper in 1967, Brigadier Tiltman said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe concept of a constructed language is quite old, as attested by John Wilkins's \"Philosophical Language\" (1668), but still postdates the generally accepted origin of the Voynich manuscript by two centuries. In most known examples, categories are subdivided by adding suffixes (fusional languages); as a consequence, a text in a particular subject would have many words with similar prefixes\u2014for example, all plant names would begin with similar letters, and likewise for all diseases, etc. This feature could then explain the repetitive nature of the Voynich text. However, no one has been able yet to assign a plausible meaning to any prefix or suffix in the Voynich manuscript.\nHoax.\nThe fact that the manuscript has defied decipherment thus far has led various scholars to propose that the text does not contain meaningful content in the first place, implying that it may be a medieval hoax.\nIn 2003, computer scientist Gordon Rugg showed that text with characteristics similar to the Voynich manuscript could have been produced using a table of word prefixes, stems, and suffixes, which would have been selected and combined by means of a perforated paper overlay. The latter device, known as a Cardan grille, was invented around 1550 as an encryption tool, more than 100\u00a0years after the estimated creation date of the Voynich manuscript. Some maintain that the similarity between the pseudo-texts generated in Gordon Rugg's experiments and the Voynich manuscript is superficial, and the grille method could be used to emulate any language to a certain degree.\nIn April 2007, a study by Austrian researcher Andreas Schinner published in \"Cryptologia\" supported the hoax hypothesis. Schinner posited that the statistical properties of the manuscript's text were more consistent with meaningless gibberish produced using a quasi-stochastic method, such as the one described by Rugg, than with Latin and medieval German texts.\nSome scholars have claimed that the manuscript's text appears too sophisticated to be a hoax. In 2013, Marcelo Montemurro, a theoretical physicist from the University of Manchester, published findings claiming that semantic networks exist in the text of the manuscript, such as content-bearing words occurring in a clustered pattern, or new words being used when there was a shift in topic. With this evidence, he believes it unlikely that these features were intentionally \"incorporated\" into the text to make a hoax more realistic, as most of the required academic knowledge of these structures did not exist at the time the Voynich manuscript would have been written. In 2021, researchers at Yale University, using the tf\u2013idf analysis, further investigated the relation between clusters of subjects in the text and topics as they could be identified by illustrations and paleography analysis. Their conclusion is that clusters derived by computation match with the topics of the illustrations to some degree, thus providing evidence that the Voynich manuscript contains meaningful text.\nHowever, other scholars have argued that such sophisticated patterns could also appear in hoaxed documents. In 2016, Gordon Rugg and Gavin Taylor published another article in \"Cryptologia\" demonstrating that the grille method could reproduce many larger-scale features of the text. In 2019, Torsten Timm and Andreas Schinner published a paper arguing that the text was produced by a process of \"self-citation\" in which scribes copied and modified meaningless words from earlier in the text. Using a computer simulation of this process, they demonstrated that it could reproduce many of the statistical characteristics of the Voynich manuscript. In 2022, Yale University researchers Daniel Gaskell and Claire Bowern published the results of an experiment in which human participants intentionally tried to write meaningless text. They found that the resulting text was often highly non-random and exhibited many of the same unusual statistical properties as the Voynich manuscript, supporting the idea that some features of the text could have been produced in a hoax.\nGlossolalia.\nIn their 2004 book, Gerry Kennedy and Rob Churchill suggest the possibility that the Voynich manuscript may be a case of glossolalia (speaking-in-tongues), channelling, or outsider art. If so, the author felt compelled to write large amounts of text in a manner which resembles stream of consciousness, either because of voices heard or because of an urge. This often takes place in an invented language in glossolalia, usually made up of fragments of the author's own language, although invented scripts for this purpose are rare.\nKennedy and Churchill use Hildegard von Bingen's works to point out similarities between the Voynich manuscript and the illustrations that she drew when she was suffering from severe bouts of migraine, which can induce a trance-like state prone to glossolalia. Prominent features found in both are abundant \"streams of stars\", and the repetitive nature of the \"nymphs\" in the balneological section.\nThe theory is controversial, and it is virtually impossible to prove or disprove it, short of deciphering the text. Kennedy and Churchill are themselves not convinced of the hypothesis, but consider it plausible. In the culminating chapter of their work, Kennedy states his belief that it is a hoax or forgery. Churchill acknowledges the possibility that the manuscript is either a synthetic forgotten language (as advanced by Friedman), or else a forgery, as the preeminent theory. However, he concludes that, if the manuscript is a genuine creation, mental illness or delusion seems to have affected the author.\nDecipherment claims.\nSince the manuscript's modern rediscovery in 1912, there have been a number of claimed decipherings.\nWilliam Romaine Newbold.\nOne of the earliest efforts to decode the book's code was made in 1921 by William Romaine Newbold from the University of Pennsylvania. His singular hypothesis held that the visible text is meaningless, but that each apparent \"letter\" is in fact constructed of a series of tiny markings discernible only under magnification. These markings were supposed to be based on ancient Greek shorthand, forming a second level of script that held the real content of the writing. Newbold claimed to have used this knowledge to work out entire paragraphs proving the authorship of Bacon and recording his use of a compound microscope four hundred years before van Leeuwenhoek. A circular drawing in the astronomical section depicts an irregularly shaped object with four curved arms, which Newbold interpreted as a picture of a galaxy, which could be obtained only with a telescope.\nNewbold's analysis has since been dismissed as overly speculative after John Matthews Manly of the University of Chicago pointed out serious flaws in his theory in 1931. For example, each shorthand character was assumed to have multiple interpretations, and as a result there was no reliable way to determine which was intended for any given case. Newbold's method also required rearranging letters at will until intelligible Latin was produced. These factors alone ensure the system enough flexibility that nearly anything at all could be discerned from the microscopic markings. Although evidence of micrography using the Hebrew language can be traced as far back as the ninth century, it is nowhere near as compact or complex as the shapes Newbold made out. Close study of the manuscript revealed the markings to be artefacts caused by the way ink cracks as it dries on rough vellum. Perceiving significance in these artefacts can be attributed to pareidolia. Thanks to Manly's thorough refutation, the micrography theory is now generally disregarded.\nJoseph Martin Feely.\nIn 1943, Joseph Martin Feely published \"Roger Bacon's Cipher: The Right Key Found\", in which he claimed that the book was a scientific diary written by Roger Bacon. Feely's method posited that the text was a highly abbreviated medieval Latin written in a simple substitution cipher.\nLeonell C. Strong.\nLeonell C. Strong, a cancer research scientist and amateur cryptographer, claimed that the solution to the Voynich manuscript was a \"peculiar double system of arithmetical progressions of a multiple alphabet\". Strong published a translation of two pages in 1947, and claimed that the plaintext revealed the Voynich manuscript to be written by the 16th-century English author Anthony Ascham, whose works include \"A Little Herbal\", published in 1550. Notes released after his death reveal that the last stages of his analysis, in which he selected words to combine into phrases, were questionably subjective.252\nRobert S. Brumbaugh.\nIn 1978, Robert Brumbaugh, a professor of classical and medieval philosophy at Yale University, claimed that the manuscript was a forgery intended to fool Emperor Rudolf II into purchasing it, and that the text is Latin enciphered with a complex, two-step method.\nJohn Stojko.\nIn 1978, John Stojko published \"Letters to God's Eye\", in which he claimed that the Voynich Manuscript was a series of letters written in vowelless Ukrainian. The theory caused some sensation among the Ukrainian diaspora at the time, and then in independent Ukraine after 1991. However, the date Stojko gives for the letters, the lack of relation between the text and the images, and the general looseness in the method of decryption have all been criticised.\nStephen Bax.\nIn January 2014, applied linguistics Professor Stephen Bax self-published a paper proposing a \"provisional, partial decoding\" of the Voynich Manuscript, proposing a translation for ten proper nouns and fourteen letters from the manuscript using techniques similar to those used to successfully translate Egyptian hieroglyphs. He claimed the manuscript to be a treatise on nature, in a Near Eastern or Asian language, but no full translation was made before Bax's death in November 2017.\nGreg Kondrak.\nGreg Kondrak, a professor of natural language processing at the University of Alberta, and his graduate student Bradley Hauer used computational linguistics in an attempt to decode the manuscript. Their findings were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in August 2017 in the form of an article suggesting that the manuscript's language is most likely Hebrew, but encoded using alphagrams, i.e. alphabetically ordered anagrams. However, the team admitted that experts in medieval manuscripts who reviewed the work were not convinced.\nNicholas Gibbs.\nIn September 2017, television writer Nicholas Gibbs claimed to have decoded the manuscript as idiosyncratically abbreviated Latin. He declared the manuscript to be a mostly plagiarised guide to women's health. Scholars would go on to criticise Gibbs for patching together already-existing scholarship with a highly speculative and incorrect translation; Lisa Fagin Davis, director of the Medieval Academy of America, stated that Gibbs' decipherment \"doesn't result in Latin that makes sense.\" Davis added that she was \"surprised the TLS published it.\" Other researchers concurred.\nAhmet Ard\u0131\u00e7.\nIn February 2018, Ahmet Ard\u0131\u00e7, a Turkish Canadian electrical engineer with an interest in Turkic linguistics, claimed that the manuscript is written in a language variety derived from Old Turkic. The text was written using \"phonemic orthography\", meaning the manuscript's author spelled out words as they were heard phonetically. The findings were presented at a conference related to Turkish World Studies. Ard\u0131\u00e7 began deciphering the manuscript four years earlier with the help of his two sons. \"Ahmet noticed that the words in the book appeared to be built of repetitive roots with prefixes and suffixes added. It reminded him of his native Turkish [...] At first he found seven characters that were the same as Old Turkic, and slowly the language revealed itself [...] Other illustrations allowed them to match up Old Turkic words with the images pictured\", reported The Canadian Press. Ard\u0131\u00e7's team claimed to have deciphered and translated at least 300 words \"and is confident there is now sufficient vocabulary to read at least 30% of the manuscript.\" His submission to the journal \"Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures\" was rejected in 2019. Following criticism from linguist Koen Gheuens on the grounds of it being reminiscent of https:// akin to Sun Language Theory, Ard\u0131\u00e7 released a 195-page paper attempting to clarify his position and accusing Gheuens of bias and ad hominem attacks.\nGerard Cheshire.\nIn May 2019, Gerard Cheshire, a biology research assistant at the University of Bristol, claimed that the manuscript is written in a \"calligraphic proto-Romance\" language. He claimed to have deciphered the manuscript in two weeks using a combination of \"lateral thinking and ingenuity.\" Cheshire has suggested that the manuscript is \"a compendium of information on herbal remedies, therapeutic bathing, and astrological readings\"; that it contains numerous descriptions of medicinal plants and passages that focus on female physical and mental health, reproduction, and parenting; and that the manuscript is the only known text written in proto-Romance. He further claimed: \"The manuscript was compiled by Dominican nuns as a source of reference for Maria of Castile, Queen of Aragon.\"\nIn June 2023, Cheshire published his translation of the foldout illustration on page 158.\nHe claims that it depicts a volcano, and theorises that it places the manuscript's creators near the island of Vulcano which was an active volcano during the 15th century. However, experts in medieval documents disputed this interpretation vigorously. Approached for comment, Lisa Fagin Davis gave this explanation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As with most would-be Voynich interpreters, the logic of this proposal is circular and aspirational: he starts with a theory about what a particular series of glyphs might mean, usually because of the word's proximity to an image that he believes he can interpret. He then investigates any number of medieval Romance-language dictionaries until he finds a word that seems to suit his theory. Then he argues that because he has found a Romance-language word that fits his hypothesis, his hypothesis must be right. His \"translations\" from what is essentially gibberish, an amalgam of multiple languages, are themselves aspirational rather than being actual translations.\u2014\u200a\nThe University of Bristol subsequently removed a reference to Cheshire's claims from its website, referring, in a statement, to concerns about the validity of the research and stating: \"This research was entirely the author's own work and is not affiliated with the University of Bristol, the School of Arts nor the Centre for Medieval Studies\". \nFacsimiles.\nMany books and articles have been written about the manuscript. Copies of the manuscript pages were made by alchemist Georg Baresch in 1637 and sent to Athanasius Kircher, and later by Wilfrid Voynich.\nIn 2004, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library made high-resolution digital scans publicly available online, and several printed facsimiles appeared. In 2016, the Beinecke Library and Yale University Press co-published a facsimile, \"The Voynich Manuscript\", with scholarly essays.\nThe Beinecke Library also authorised the production of a print run of 898 replicas by the Spanish publisher Silo\u00e9 in 2017.\nIn September 2024, multispectral scans of ten selected pages were made public, revealing details unseen with visible light.\nCultural influence.\nThe manuscript has inspired various works of fiction, including:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45846", "revid": "40609524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45846", "title": "Ferrara", "text": "Ferrara (; ; ) is a city and \"comune\" (municipality) in Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy, capital of the province of Ferrara. As of 2016,[ [update]] it had 132,009 inhabitants. It is situated northeast of Bologna, on the Po di Volano, a branch channel of the main stream of the Po River, located north. The town has broad streets and numerous palaces dating from the Renaissance, when it hosted the court of the House of Este. For its beauty and cultural importance, it has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\nHistory.\nAntiquity and Middle Ages.\nThe first documented settlements in the area of the present-day Province of Ferrara date from the 6th century BC. The ruins of the Etruscan town of Spina, established along the lagoons at the ancient mouth of the Po river, were lost until modern times, when drainage schemes in the Valli di Comacchio marshes in 1922 first officially revealed a necropolis with over 4,000 tombs, evidence of a population centre that in Antiquity must have played a major role.\nThere is uncertainty among scholars about the proposed Roman origin of the settlement in its current location (Tacitus and Boccaccio refer to a \"Forum Alieni\"), for little is known of this period, but some archeologic evidence points to the hypothesis that Ferrara could have been originated from two small Byzantine settlements: a cluster of facilities around the Cathedral of St. George, on the right bank of the main branch of the Po, which then ran much closer to the city than today, and a castrum, a fortified complex built on the left bank of the river to defend against the Lombards.\nFerrara appears first in a document of the Lombard king Desiderius of 753 AD, when he captured the town from the Exarchate of Ravenna. Later the Franks, after routing the Lombards, presented Ferrara to the Papacy in 754 or 756. In 988 Ferrara was ceded by the Church to the House of Canossa, but at the death of Matilda of Tuscany in 1115 it became a free commune. During the 12th century the history of the town was marked by the wrestling for power between two preeminent families, the Guelph Adelardi and the Ghibelline Salinguerra. The powerful Imperial House of Este threw their decisive weight behind the Salinguerra and eventually reaped the benefits of victory for themselves. Thus, in 1264 Obizzo II d'Este was proclaimed lifelong ruler of Ferrara, taking the additional titles of Lord of Modena in 1288 and of Reggio in 1289. His rule marked the end of the communal period in Ferrara and the beginning of the Este rule, which lasted until 1598.\nEarly modern.\nIn 1452 Borso d'Este was created duke of Modena and Reggio by Emperor Frederick III and in 1471 duke of Ferrara by Pope Paul II. Lionello and, especially, Ercole I were among the most important patrons of the arts in late 15th- and early 16th-century Italy. During this time, Ferrara grew into an international cultural centre, renowned for its architecture, music, literature and visual arts.\nThe architecture of Ferrara greatly benefited from the genius of Biagio Rossetti, who was requested in 1484 by Ercole I to draft a masterplan for the expansion of the town. The resulting \"Erculean Addition\" is considered one of the most important examples of Renaissance urban planning and contributed to the selection of Ferrara as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn spite of having entered its golden age, Ferrara was severely hit by a war against Venice fought and lost in 1482\u201384. Alfonso I succeeded to the throne in 1505 and married the notorious Lucrezia Borgia. He again fought Venice in the Italian Wars after joining the League of Cambrai. In 1509 he was excommunicated by Pope Julius II, but was able to overcome the Papal and Spanish armies in 1512 at the Battle of Ravenna. These successes were based on Ferrara's artillery, produced in his own foundry which was the best of its time.\nUpon his death in 1534, Alfonso I was succeeded by his son Ercole II, whose marriage in 1528 to the second daughter of Louis XII, Ren\u00e9e of France, brought great prestige to the court of Ferrara. Under his reign, the Duchy remained an affluent country and a cultural powerhouse. However, an earthquake struck the town in 1570, causing the economy to collapse, and when Ercole II's son Alfonso II died without heirs in 1597, the House of Este lost Ferrara to the Papal States.\nLate modern and contemporary.\nFerrara, a university city second only to Bologna, remained a part of the Papal States for almost 300 years, an era marked by a steady decline; in 1792 the population of the town was only 27,000, less than in the 17th century. In 1805\u20131814 it was briefly part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, a client-state of the French Empire. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Ferrara was given back to the Pope, now guaranteed by the Empire of Austria. A bastion fort was erected in the 1600s by Pope Paul V on the site the Castel Tedaldo, an old castle at the south-west angle of the town, this was occupied by an Austrian garrison from 1832 until 1859. The fortress was completely dismantled following the birth of the Kingdom of Italy and the bricks were used for new constructions throughout the town.\nDuring the last decades of the 1800s and the early 1900s, Ferrara remained a modest trade centre for its large rural hinterland that relied on commercial crops such as sugar beet and industrial hemp. Large land reclamation works were carried out for decades with the aim to expand the available arable land and eradicate malaria from the wetlands along the Po delta. Mass industrialisation came to Ferrara only at the end of the 1930s with the set-up of a chemical plant by the Fascist regime that should have supplied the regime with synthetic rubber. During the Second World War Ferrara was repeatedly bombed by Allied warplanes that targeted and destroyed railway links and industrial facilities. After the war, the industrial area in Pontelagoscuro was expanded to become a giant petrochemical compound operated by Montecatini and other companies, that at its peak employed 7,000 workers and produced 20% of plastics in Italy. In recent decades, as part of a general trend in Italy and Europe, Ferrara has come to rely more on tertiary and tourism, while the heavy industry, still present in the town, has been largely phased out.\nAfter almost 450 years, another earthquake struck Ferrara in May 2012 causing only limited damage to the historic buildings of the town and no victims.\nGeography.\nThe town of Ferrara lies on the southern shores of the Po river, about north-east of the regional capital, Bologna, and south of Venice. The territory of the municipality, entirely part of the Padan plain, is overwhelmingly flat, situated on average just above sea-level. The proximity to the largest Italian river has been a constant concern in the history of Ferrara, that has been affected by recurrent, disastrous floods, the latest occurring as recently as 1951. The Idrovia Ferrarese links the river Po from Ferrara to the Adriatic at Porto Garibaldi.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Po valley is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, a type of climate commonly referred to as \"warm temperate\" that features mild winters and hot summers, heavy rains in spring and autumn but there is also a lot of rain even in the driest month of January for Ferrara.\nGovernment.\nThe legislative body of the Italian communes is the City Council (\"Consiglio Comunale\"), which, in towns having between 100,000 and 250,000 population, is composed by 32 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (\"Giunta Comunale\"), composed by 12 assessors, that is nominated and presided over by a directly elected mayor. The current mayor of Ferrara is Alan Fabbri of the . The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114), the Municipal Statute and several laws, notably the Legislative Decree 267/2000 or Unified Text on Local Administration (\"Testo Unico degli Enti Locali\").\nThe current division of the seats in the city council, after the 2019 local election, is the following:\nTransport.\nAir.\nThe city does not have its own airport. The nearest airports are:\nRail.\nFerrara is served by Ferrara railway station. Opened in 1862, it forms part of the Padua\u2013Bologna railway, and is also a terminus of three secondary railways, linking Ferrara with Ravenna, Rimini, Suzzara, and Codigoro.\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nThe imposing Este Castle, sited in the very centre of the town, is iconic of Ferrara. A very large manor house featuring four massive bastions and a moat, it was erected in 1385 by architect Bartolino da Novara with the function to protect the town from external threats and to serve as a fortified residence for the Este family. It was extensively renovated in the 15th and 16th centuries.\nThe Cathedral of Saint George, designed by Wiligelmus and consecrated in 1135, is one of the finest examples of Romanesque architecture. The duomo has been renovated many times through the centuries, thus its resulting eclectic style is a harmonious combination of the Romanesque central structure and portal, the Gothic upper part of the fa\u00e7ade and the Renaissance campanile. The sculptures of the main portal are attributed to Nicholaus. The upper part of the main fa\u00e7ade, with arcades of pointed arches, dates from the 13th century. The recumbent marble lions guarding the portals are copies of the originals, now in the cathedral's museum. An elaborated 13th-century relief depicting the Last Judgement is found in the second storey of the porch. The interior was restored in baroque style in 1712. The marble campanile attributed to Leon Battista Alberti was initiated in 1412 but is still incomplete, missing one projected additional storey and a dome, as it can be observed from numerous historical prints and paintings on the subject.\nNear the cathedral and the castle also lies the 15th-century city hall, that served as an earlier residence of the Este family, featuring a grandiose marble flight of stairs and two ancient bronze statues of Niccol\u00f2 III and Borso of Este.\nThe southern district is the town's oldest, crossed by a myriad of narrow alleys that date back to the Early Middle Ages. Casa Romei is perhaps the best-preserved medieval building in Ferrara. It was the private residence of merchant Giovanni Romei, related by marriage to the Este family, and likely the work of the court architect Pietrobono Brasavola. Thanks to the nuns of the Corpus Domini order, much of the original decorations in the inner rooms have been saved. The house features fresco cycles in the \"Sala delle Sibille\" (\"room of sibyls\"), an original \"terracotta\" fireplace bearing the coat of arms of Giovanni Romei in the adjoining Saletta dei Profeti (\"room of the prophets\"), depicting allegories from the Bible, and in other rooms, some of which were commissioned by cardinal Ippolito d'Este, paintings by the school of Camillo and Cesare Filippi (16th century).\nPalazzo Schifanoia was built in 1385 for Alberto V d'Este. The palazzo includes frescoes depicting the life of Borso d'Este, the signs of the zodiac and allegorical representations of the months. The vestibule was decorated with \"stucco\" mouldings by Domenico di Paris. The building also contains fine choir-books with miniatures and a collection of coins and Renaissance medals. The Renaissance Palazzo Paradiso, part of the Ferrara University library system, displays part of the manuscript of \"Orlando furioso\" and letters by Tasso as well as Ludovico Ariosto's grave. Its famous alumni include Nicolaus Copernicus and Paracelsus.\nThe northern quarter, which was added by Ercole I in 1492\u20131505 thanks to the master plan of Biagio Rossetti, and hence called the \"Addizione Erculea\", features a number of Renaissance \"palazzi\". Among the finest is Palazzo dei Diamanti (\"Diamond Palace\"), named after the diamond points into which the fa\u00e7ade's stone blocks are cut. The \"palazzo\" houses the National Picture Gallery, with a large collection of the school of Ferrara, which first rose to prominence in the latter half of the 15th century, with Cosimo Tura, Francesco Cossa and Ercole dei Roberti. Noted masters of the 16th-century School of Ferrara include Lorenzo Costa and Dosso Dossi, the most eminent of all, Girolamo da Carpi and Benvenuto Tisi (il Garofalo). The district is also home to University of Ferrara Botanic Garden.\nParks and gardens.\nThe town is still almost totally encircled by of ancient brick walls, mostly built between 1492 and 1520. Today the walls, after a careful restoration, make up a large urban park around the town and are a popular destination for joggers and cyclists.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;In 2007, there were 135,369 people residing in Ferrara, of whom 46.8% were male and 53.2% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 12.28% of the population compared to pensioners who number 26.41%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Ferrara residents is 49, compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Ferrara grew by 2.28%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%. The current birth rate of Ferrara is 7.02 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births. Ferrara is known as the oldest Italian city with a population over 100,000, as well the city with lowest birth rate.\nAs of 2006[ [update]], 95.59% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group was other European nations with Ukraine and Albania: 2.59% followed by North Africa: 0.51%, and East Asia: 0.39%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, with small Orthodox Christian adherents. The historical Jewish community is still surviving.\nCulture.\nJewish community.\nThe Jewish community of Ferrara is the only one in Emilia Romagna with a continuous presence from the Middle Ages to the present day. It played an important role when Ferrara enjoyed its greatest splendor in the 15th and 16th century, with the duke Ercole I d'Este. The situation of the Jews deteriorated in 1598, when the Este dynasty moved to Modena and the city came under papal control. The Jewish settlement, located in three streets forming a triangle near the cathedral, became a ghetto in 1627. Apart from a few years under Napoleon and during the 1848 revolution, the ghetto lasted until Italian unification in 1859.\nIn 1799, the Jewish community saved the city from sacking by troops of the Holy Roman Empire. During the spring of 1799, the city had fallen into the hands of the Republic of France, which established a small garrison there. On 15\u00a0April, Lieutenant Field Marshal Johann von Klenau approached the fortress with a modest mixed force of Austrian cavalry, artillery and infantry augmented by Italian peasant rebels, commanded by Count Antonio Bardaniand and demanded its capitulation. The commander refused. Klenau blockaded the city, leaving a small group of artillery and troops to continue the siege. For the next three days, Klenau patrolled the countryside, capturing the surrounding strategic points of Lagoscuro, Borgoforte and the Mirandola fortress. The besieged garrison made several sorties from the Saint Paul's Gate, which were repulsed by the insurgent peasants. The French attempted two rescues of the beleaguered fortress: the first, on 24\u00a0April, when a force of 400\u00a0Modenese was repulsed at Mirandola and the second, General Montrichard tried to raise the city-blockade by advancing with a force of 4,000. Finally, at the end of the month, a column led by Pierre-Augustin Hulin reached and relieved the fortress.\nKlenau took possession of the town on 21\u00a0May, and garrisoned it with a light battalion. The Jewish residents of Ferrara paid 30,000\u00a0ducats to prevent the pillage of the city by Klenau's forces; this was used to pay the wages of Gardani's troops. Although Klenau held the town, the French still possessed the town's fortress. After making the standard request for surrender at 08:00, which was refused, Klenau ordered a barrage from his mortars and howitzers. After two magazines caught fire, the commandant was summoned again to surrender; there was some delay, but a flag of truce was sent at 21:00, and the capitulation was concluded at 01:00 the next day. Upon taking possession of the fortress, Klenau found 75\u00a0new artillery pieces, plus ammunition and six months worth of provisions.\nIn 1938, Mussolini's fascist government instituted racial laws reintroducing segregation of Jews which lasted until the end of the German occupation. During the Second World War, 96 of Ferrara's 300 Jews were deported to German concentration and death camps; five survived. The Italian Jewish writer, Giorgio Bassani, was from Ferrara. His celebrated book, \"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\", was published in Italian as Giardino dei Finzi-Contini, 1962, by Giulio Einaudi editore s.p.a. It was made into a film by Vittorio de Sica in 1970.\nDuring WWII, the Este Castle, adjacent to the Corso Roma, now known as the Corso Martiri della Libert\u00e0, was the site of an infamous massacre in 1943.\nOn 13 December 2017, the first day of Hanukkah, Italy's Museum of Italian Judaism and the Shoah opened on the site of a restored two-story brick prison built in 1912 that counted Jews among its detainees during the Fascist period. This is the initial phase of a project\u2014known as MEIS, after its initials in Italian\u2014to be completed in 2021, with additional buildings that will create a major Jewish cultural hub and add exhibits focusing on the Jews in the Italian Renaissance and the Shoah.\nVisual art.\nDuring the Renaissance the Este family, well known for its patronage of the arts, welcomed a great number of artists, especially painters, that formed the so-called School of Ferrara. The astounding list of painters and artists includes the names of Andrea Mantegna, Vicino da Ferrara, Giovanni Bellini, Leon Battista Alberti, Pisanello, Piero della Francesca, Battista Dossi, Dosso Dossi, Cosm\u00e9 Tura, Francesco del Cossa and Titian. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Ferrara again hosted and inspired numerous painters who grew fond of its eerie atmosphere. Among them Giovanni Boldini, Filippo de Pisis and Giorgio de Chirico. A large collection of paintings is displayed in the National Gallery of Palazzo dei Diamanti.\nLiterature.\nThe Renaissance literary men and poets Torquato Tasso (author of \"Jerusalem Delivered\"), Ludovico Ariosto (author of the romantic epic poem \"Orlando Furioso\") and Matteo Maria Boiardo (author of the grandiose poem of chivalry and romance \"Orlando Innamorato\") lived and worked at the court of Ferrara during the 15th and 16th century.\nThe \"Ferrara Bible\" was a 1553 publication of the Ladino version of the Tanakh used by Sephardi Jews. It was paid for and made by Yom-Tob ben Levi Athias (the Spanish Marrano \"Jer\u00f3nimo de Vargas\", as typographer) and Abraham ben Salomon Usque (the Portuguese Jew \"Duarte Pinhel\", as translator), and was dedicated to Ercole II d'Este. In the 20th century, Ferrara was the home and workplace of writer Giorgio Bassani, well known for his novels that were often adapted for cinema (\"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\", \"Long Night in 1943\"). In historical fiction, British author Sarah Dunant set her 2009 novel \"Sacred Hearts\" in a convent in Ferrara.\nReligion.\nFerrara gave birth to Girolamo Savonarola, the famous medieval Dominican priest and leader of Florence from 1494 until his execution in 1498. He was known for his book burning, destruction of what he considered immoral art, and hostility to the Renaissance. He vehemently preached against the moral corruption of much of the clergy at the time, and his main opponent was Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia).\nDuring the time that Ren\u00e9e of France was Duchess of Ferrara, her court attracted Protestant thinkers such as John Calvin and Olympia Fulvia Morata. The court became hostile to Protestant sympathizers after the marriage of Ren\u00e9e's daughter Anna d'Este to the fervently Catholic Duke of Guise.\nMusic.\nThe Ferrarese musician Girolamo Frescobaldi was one of the most important composers of keyboard music in the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. His masterpiece \"Fiori musicali\" (\"Musical Flowers\") is a collection of liturgical organ music first published in 1635. It became the most famous of Frescobaldi's works and was studied centuries after his death by numerous composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach. Maurizio Moro (15??\u201316??) an Italian poet of the 16th century best known for madrigals is thought to have been born in Ferrara.\nCinema.\nFerrara is the birthplace of Italian film directors Michelangelo Antonioni and Florestano Vancini. The latter shot in Ferrara his 1960 film \"Long Night in 1943\". The town was also the setting of the famous 1970 movie \"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\" by Vittorio De Sica, that tells the vicissitudes of a rich Jewish family during the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini and World War II. Furthermore, Wim Wenders and Michelangelo Antonioni's \"Beyond the Clouds\" in (1995) and Ermanno Olmi's \"The Profession of Arms\" in (2001), a film about the last days of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, were also shot in Ferrara.\nIn the third season of \"Medici (TV Series)\", Girolamo Riario's men seize Ferrara, 100 miles from Florence and takes their salt. Based on the actions by Riario, Pope Sixtus IV condemns Riario and accepts Lorenzo's invitation to a peace conference in Bagnolo. The attack by Riario\u2019s men on Ferrara was filmed at Castle of Oliveto in Castelfiorentino, once the residence of the noble Pucci family of Florence.\nFestivals.\nThe Palio of St. George is a medieval-themed horse race held every last Sunday of May. Established in 1279, it is probably the oldest such competition in the world. The Ferrara Buskers Festival is a non-competitive parade of street musicians from all over the world. At the 2017 edition, more than 1,000 artists from 35 different nations took part in the festival, including dancers, clowns, equilibrists, jugglers and other original performers. Additionally, the town hosts the yearly Ferrara Balloons Festival, a large hot-air balloon show.\nSport.\nThe town's football team, SPAL, was established in 1907. In 2017 it was promoted to Serie A, Italy's top-level football league, after a 49-year absence. Its home ground is Paolo Mazza Memorial Stadium, with a capacity of 16,134. The club went into liquidation at the end of the 2024/2025 season, ans a new club Ars et Labor Ferrara was founded and currently competes in the regional Eccellenza Emilia-Romagna league, the fifth level in Italian football.\nFerrara's basketball team Kleb Basket Ferrara competes in the Serie A2 Basket and plays its home games at the Palasport di Ferrara.\nCuisine.\nThe culinary tradition of Ferrara features many typical dishes that can be traced back to the Middle Ages, and that sometimes reveals the influence of its important Jewish community.\nThe signature dish is \"cappellacci di zucca\", special ravioli with a filling of butternut squash, Parmesan and flavored with nutmeg. It is served with a sauce of butter and sage or bolognese sauce. Another peculiar dish, that was allegedly cooked by Renaissance chef Cristoforo di Messisbugo, is \"pasticcio di maccheroni\", a domed macaroni pie, consisting of a crust of sweet dough enclosing macaroni in a B\u00e9chamel sauce, studded with porcini mushrooms and \"rag\u00f9 alla bolognese\".\nThe traditional Christmas first course is \"cappelletti\", large meat filled ravioli served in chicken broth. It is often followed by \"salama da sugo\", a very big, cured sausage made from a selection of pork meats and spices kneaded with red wine.\nSeafood is also an important part of the local tradition, that boast rich fisheries in the Po delta lagoons and Adriatic sea. Pasta with clams and grilled or stewed eel dishes are especially well-known. Popular food items include also \"zia\" garlic salami and the traditional \"coppia\" bread, protected by the IGP (protected geographical status) label. Not unusual is the typical kosher salami made of goose meat stuffed in goose neck skin.\nLocal patisserie include spicy \"pampepato\" chocolate pie, \"tenerina\", a dark chocolate and butter cake, and \"zuppa inglese\", a chocolate and custard pudding on a bed of sponge cake soaked in Alchermes. The clay terroir of the area, an alluvial plain created by the river Po, is not ideal for wine; a notable exception is Bosco Eliceo (DOC) wine, made from grapes cultivated on the sandy coast line.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nFerrara is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It encompasses a wide range of activities, including direct-to-consumer sales such as farm stands and u-pick, agricultural education through school visits, hospitality services like overnight farm stays, recreational activities such as hunting and horseback riding, and entertainment events like hayrides and harvest dinners. These activities provide an additional source of income for farmers and help sustain small-scale farms.\nAgritourism benefits surrounding communities by drawing tourists to rural areas, stimulating local economies, and fostering a greater appreciation for agricultural practices and local food systems. Many countries have embraced agritourism, implementing programs and initiatives to support and promote this sector.\nTypes.\nA 2018 article published in the \"Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development\" classified agritourism activities as falling into one or more categories: direct-to-consumer sales (e.g., farm stands, u-pick), agricultural education (e.g., schools visits to a farm), hospitality (overnight farm stays), recreation (e.g., hunting, horseback riding), and entertainment (e.g., hayrides, harvest dinners). Most agritourists spent time visiting farm stands, picking fruit, or feeding animals; others may navigate a corn maze or do a farm stay, assisting with chores or agricultural or ranch work.\nEconomic benefits.\nAgricultural tourism has become a necessary means for many small farms\u2019 survival. By diversifying business operations, farm operators are able to ensure a more stable income. This is because agritourism activities can occur during times of the year that crops may not be in season, and by providing a completely separate stream of income. Some studies have found that agritourism operations often benefit their surrounding communities by drawing tourists to the area. The economic boost by the increase in traffic can be beneficial to rural areas in need of diversified streams of income.\nAgritourism in various countries.\nArmenia.\nThe development of agritourism was of high importance in the process of revitalization of rural life in Armenia. Apart from participation in agricultural activities and farming, some more notable activities specific to Armenia are winemaking and carpet weaving.\nThere are also agricultural festivals and farmer's fairs organized every year, like the \"Dolma\" festival, \"Barbeque (Khorovats)\" festival, \"Gata\" festival, and many more.\nIndia.\n85% of India's population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture and allied activities. Similarly, agriculture accounts for 26% of India's GDP. Maharashtra and Kerala are the states in India that are taking advantage of the potential of agritourism. In Maharashtra Agritourism is promoted by the Agri Tourism Development Corporation. Kuttanad, Wayanad, Palakkad and Idukki are some of the important agricultural areas in Kerala. The 'Green Farm' project launched by the Government of Kerala is aimed at promoting agro-tourism in Kerala. Apart from Kerala and Maharashtra, Nagaland and Sikkim are also successful agri-tourism states.\nItaly.\nSince 1985 agritourism in Italy is formally regulated by a state law, amended in 2006.\nStarting in 2013 Italy has used a sector trademark, \"Agriturismo Italia\", accompanied by a new system of classification of farms with accommodation.&lt;br&gt;The trademark, which distinguishes farms regularly operating in accordance with existing laws and regulations, shows a sunflower enclosing a farm.&lt;br&gt;\nThe classification (from 1 to 5 marks) represents the level of comfort, the variety of services and the quality of the natural environment that each farm is able to offer.&lt;br&gt;\nThis system was implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, in cooperation with all regional and national agritourism associations.&lt;br&gt;\nThe national system thus offers an overall guarantee which still takes account of specific regional characteristics.\nIsrael.\nIn Israel, historical agricultural practices attract visitors to sites such as Ein Yael, Neot Kedumim, and Kfar Kedem. These locations showcase traditional methods like terraced farming and ancient irrigation. Tourists can engage in activities such as grape stomping and olive pressing.\nIsrael's agriculture features crops like grapes, olives, dates, and wheat, which have historical significance. The Wine Route and Olive Route in the Mate Yehuda and Yoav regions allow visitors to explore small wineries and ancient and modern oil presses. The Dagon Museum in Haifa displays the history of grain cultivation from ancient times to the present. Binyamina, known for its citrus groves, and Kibbutz Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea, which demonstrates desert farming techniques, are also key agritourism sites.\nFor insights into the development of modern agriculture, tourists can visit the Dubrovin Farm museum and the Museum of Pioneer Settlement at Kibbutz Yifat. These sites depict the establishment of Israel's agricultural infrastructure in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nPakistan.\nPakistan is an agricultural country and agriculture is a vital sector of Pakistan's economy. About 65% of people live in rural areas and directly or indirectly relate to profession of agriculture. Agriculture in Pakistan accounts 21% of total GDP in the economy. Pakistan has natural resources for agriculture, like fertile land, four seasons, and a natural flow of water canals from north to south, including dams, barrages, headwork, canals, and distribution channels.\nUnited Arab Emirates.\nUAE unveiled a pioneering plan in 2023, aimed at revamping the agricultural industry, opening up an array of opportunities for farmers to diversify their income streams to promote agritourism. The 'UAE Agritourism Program' allows people to experience conventional and modern agricultural practices at animal and crop farms, whilst aiming to increase the demand for locally grown produce. A new agritourism hub is also expected to create thousands of new jobs.\nUnited States.\nThrough the Small Farm Center at the University of California, \"Agricultural tourism or agritourism, is one alternative for improving the incomes and potential economic viability of small farms and rural communities. Some forms of agritourism enterprises are well developed in California, including fairs and festivals. Other possibilities still offer potential for development\". The UC Small Farm Center has developed a California Agritourism Database that \"provides visitors and potential entrepreneurs with information about existing agritourism locations throughout the state\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nAccording to a 2011 article in the journal \"Tourism Planning and Development\", agritourism has become economically important to the agriculture sector in North West England, as farmers seek to diversify their income streams.\nThailand\nAgritourism in Thailand grows dramatically after 2021. People concern more on healthy food, wellness and community sustainable living. Agritourism can promote sustainable agricultural practice and raising awareness about the importance of environment.\nExamples of agritourism in Thailand:\nFarm Stays\nFarm Tours\nFarm Product Festival\nWorkshops\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45848", "revid": "46085058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45848", "title": "Deep Purple", "text": "English rock band\nDeep Purple are an English rock band formed in London in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical style has varied throughout their career. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album \"Deep Purple in Rock\". Deep Purple have been referred to as being part of the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-'70s\", alongside Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Listed in the 1975 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, they have sold over 100\u00a0million records worldwide. Deep Purple have also generated several successful spinoff bands, including Rainbow, Whitesnake, and Gillan.\nDeep Purple were founded by vocalist Rod Evans, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, bassist Nick Simper, keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice. After three studio albums, the \"Mark I\" line-up came to an end in 1969 when Evans and Simper were dismissed from the band and replaced by Ian Gillan and Roger Glover respectively, forming the classic \"Mark II\" line-up of Deep Purple. Following the orchestral collaboration \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\" (1969), the Mark II line-up recorded four studio albums \u2013 \"Deep Purple in Rock\" (1970), \"Fireball\" (1971), \"Machine Head\" (1972) and \"Who Do We Think We Are\" (1973) \u2013 and a live album \u2013 \"Made in Japan\" (1972) \u2013 that cemented their popularity and played a key role in shaping the emerging genres of hard rock and heavy metal. Gillan and Glover both left the band in 1973 and were replaced by David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes respectively. The \"Mark III\" line-up recorded two studio albums \u2013 \"Burn\" and \"Stormbringer\" (both 1974) \u2013 before Blackmore parted ways with the band in 1975 due to musical differences. He was replaced by Tommy Bolin, though after just one studio album with the \"Mark IV\" line-up \u2013 \"Come Taste the Band\" (1975) \u2013 Deep Purple disbanded in July 1976 and Bolin died from a drug overdose five months later.\nThe \"Mark II\" line-up reunited in 1984, and recorded two studio albums \u2013 \"Perfect Strangers\" (1984) and \"The House of Blue Light\" (1987) \u2013 before Gillan was fired from Deep Purple in 1989, due to creative and personal differences within the band. He was replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, who appeared on one album with Deep Purple \u2013 \"Slaves and Masters\" (1990) \u2013 before his dismissal from the band in 1992. After Gillan returned for their next album, \"The Battle Rages On...\" (1993), Blackmore left Deep Purple once again in 1993, and was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani and then permanently by Steve Morse. The \"Mark VII\" line-up (consisting of Paice, Lord, Gillan, Glover and Morse) lasted for nearly a decade, to which the band recorded two studio albums \u2013 \"Purpendicular\" (1996) and \"Abandon\" (1998) \u2013 before Lord retired from Deep Purple in 2002 and was replaced by Don Airey, leaving Paice as the only remaining original member. The \"Mark VIII\" line-up of Paice, Gillan, Glover, Morse and Airey was the longest line-up in the band's history, spanning twenty years and six studio albums. Their first line-up change in twenty years took place in 2022, when Morse left Deep Purple after twenty-eight years as their guitarist and was replaced by Simon McBride.\nDeep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's \"Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" programme, and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them fifth among the \"most influential bands ever\". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.\nHistory.\nBeginnings (1967\u20131968).\nIn 1967, former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis contacted London businessman Tony Edwards, in the hope he would manage a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. Curtis' vision was a \"supergroup\" where the band members would get on and off, like a musical roundabout. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance the venture with his two business partners John Coletta and Ron Hire, who composed Hire-Edwards-Coletta Enterprises (HEC).\nThe first recruit to the band was classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord, Curtis' flatmate, who had most notably played with the Artwoods (led by Art Wood, brother of future Faces and Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and including Keef Hartley). Lord was then performing in a backing band for the vocal group The Flower Pot Men, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little (Simper had previously been in Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, and survived the 1966 car crash that killed Kidd). Lord alerted the two that he had been recruited for the Roundabout project, after which Simper and Little suggested guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whom Lord had never met. Simper had known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted around the same time as one of Blackmore's early bands, the Dominators.\nHEC persuaded Blackmore to travel in from Hamburg to audition for the new group. He was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, and had also been a member of the Outlaws, Screaming Lord Sutch &amp; the Savages, and Neil Christian &amp; the Crusaders, the latter band prompting Blackmore's move to Germany. Curtis' erratic behaviour and lifestyle, fuelled by his use of LSD, caused him to display a sudden lack of interest in the project he had started, forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. However, HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and Blackmore brought and persuaded Blackmore to return from Hamburg a second time. Lord and Blackmore began the recruitment of additional members, retaining Tony Edwards as their manager. Lord convinced Nick Simper to join on bass, but Blackmore insisted they leave Carlo Little behind in favour of drummer Bobby Woodman. Woodman was the former drummer for Vince Taylor's Play-Boys (for whom he had played under the name Bobbie Clarke). The band, still calling themselves Roundabout, started rehearsing and writing in Cadogan Gardens in South Kensington.\nIn March 1968, Lord, Blackmore, Simper and Woodman moved into Deeves Hall, a country house in South Mimms, Hertfordshire. The band would live, write and rehearse at the house; it was fully kitted out with the latest Marshall amplification and, at Lord's request, a Hammond C3 organ. According to Simper, \"dozens\" of singers were auditioned (including Rod Stewart and Woodman's friend Dave Curtiss) until the group heard Rod Evans of club band the Maze, and thought his voice fitted their style well. Tagging along with Evans was his band's drummer Ian Paice. Blackmore had seen an 18-year-old Paice on tour with the Maze in Germany in 1966, and had been impressed by his drumming. The band hastily arranged an audition for Paice, given that Woodman was vocally unhappy with the direction of the band's music. Both Paice and Evans won their respective jobs, and the line-up was complete.\nDuring a brief tour of Denmark and Sweden in April, in which they were still billed as Roundabout, Blackmore suggested a new name: Deep Purple, after his grandmother's favourite song, \"Deep Purple\" by Peter DeRose. The group had resolved to choose a name after everyone had posted one on a board in rehearsal. Second to Deep Purple was \"Concrete God\", which the band thought was too harsh to take on, while other names suggested included \"Orpheus\" and \"Sugarlump\".\nMark I (1968\u20131969).\nIn May 1968, the band moved into Pye Studios in London's Marble Arch to record their debut album, \"Shades of Deep Purple\", which was released in America in July by Tetragrammaton Records, and in Britain in September by EMI Records. Vanilla Fudge was a notable influence on the band, with Blackmore claiming that the group started out wanting to be a \"Vanilla Fudge clone\". The group had success in North America with a cover of Joe South's \"Hush\", and by September 1968, the song had reached No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the US and No. 2 in the Canadian \"RPM\" chart, pushing the \"Shades\" LP up to No. 24 on \"Billboard\"'s pop albums chart. The following month, Deep Purple were booked to support Cream on the US leg of their \"Goodbye\" tour.\nThe band's second album, \"The Book of Taliesyn\", was recorded quickly and released in North America in October 1968 to coincide with the tour. The album included Neil Diamond's \"Kentucky Woman\", which cracked the Top 40 in both the US (No. 38 on the \"Billboard\" chart) and Canada (No. 21 on the \"RPM\" chart), though sales for the album were not as strong (No. 54 in US, No. 48 in Canada). \"The Book of Taliesyn\" would not be released in the band's home country until the following year and, like its predecessor, it failed to have much impact on the UK Albums Chart. During the late 1968 US tour, the band made several high-profile television appearances, including \"Playboy After Dark\" and even \"The Dating Game\" (where, in addition to the band performing, Lord appeared as a contestant).\nEarly in 1969, the band released the non-album single \"Emmaretta\", named after Emmaretta Marks, at that time a cast member of the musical \"Hair\", whom Evans was trying to seduce. By March of that year, the band had completed recording for their third album, \"Deep Purple\". The album included the track \"April\", which featured strings and woodwind, showcasing Lord's classical antecedents such as Bach and Rimsky-Korsakov.\nDeep Purple's North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed production of the \"Deep Purple\" album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended. This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the \"Billboard\" Top 100. Soon after \"Deep Purple\" was finally released in late June 1969, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. Tetragrammaton's assets were eventually assumed by Warner Bros. Records, who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.\nDuring the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to progress the heavy rock side of the band further. Having decided that Evans and Simper would not fit well with the style they envisioned, both were replaced that summer. Paice stated, \"A change had to come. If they hadn't left, the band would have totally disintegrated.\" Both Simper and Blackmore noted that Rod Evans already had one foot out of the door. Simper said that Evans had met a girl in Hollywood and had eyes on being an actor, while Blackmore explained, \"Rod just wanted to go to America and live in America.\" Evans and Simper would go on to co-form the bands Captain Beyond and Warhorse respectively.\nMark II (1969\u20131973).\nDeep Purple Mark II was formed in Hanwell Community Centre in West London in the summer of 1969. In search of a new vocalist, Blackmore set his own sights on 19-year-old singer Terry Reid. Though he found the offer \"flattering\", Reid was still bound by an exclusive recording contract with his producer Mickie Most and more interested in his solo career. Blackmore had no other choice but to look elsewhere. The band sought out singer Ian Gillan from Episode Six, a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving any great commercial success. Six's drummer Mick Underwood \u2013 an old comrade of Blackmore's from his days in the Outlaws \u2013 introduced the band to Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. According to Nick Simper, \"Gillan would join only with Roger Glover.\" This effectively killed Episode Six, which gave Underwood a persistent feeling of guilt that lasted nearly a decade, until Gillan recruited him for his new post-Purple band in the late 1970s. According to Blackmore, Deep Purple was only interested in Gillan and not Glover, but Glover was retained on the advice of Ian Paice.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"He turned up for the session...he was their bass player. We weren't originally going to take him until Paicey said, 'he's a good bass player, let's keep him.' So I said okay.\"\n\u2014 Ritchie Blackmore on the hiring of Roger Glover.\nMark II's first release was a Roger Greenaway\u2013Roger Cook tune titled \"Hallelujah\". At the time of its recording, Nick Simper still thought he was in the band and had called John Coletta to inquire about the recording dates for the song. He then found that the song had already been recorded with Glover on bass. The remaining original members of Deep Purple then instructed management to inform Simper that he had been officially replaced. Despite television appearances to promote the \"Hallelujah\" single in the UK, the song flopped. Blackmore had told the British weekly music newspaper \"Record Mirror\" that the band \"need to have a commercial record in Britain\", and described the song as \"an in-between sort of thing\"\u2014a compromise between the type of material the band would normally record, and openly commercial material.\nIn September 1969, the band gained some much-needed publicity in the UK with the \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\", a three-movement epic composed by Lord as a solo project and performed by the band at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Malcolm Arnold. Alongside \"Days of Future Passed\" by the Moody Blues and \"Five Bridges\" by the Nice, it was one of the first collaborations between a rock band and an orchestra. This live album became their first release with any kind of chart success in the UK. Gillan and Blackmore were less than happy at the band being tagged as \"a group who played with orchestras\", both feeling that the \"Concerto\" was a distraction that would get in the way of developing their desired hard-rocking style. Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance \"you could have put the five smiles together and spanned the Thames.\" Lord would also write the \"Gemini Suite\", another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970, although the band's recording of the piece would not be released until 1993. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\" was not bad but that the \"Gemini Suite\" was horrible and very disjointed. Roger Glover later noted that Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.\nShortly after the orchestral release, Mark II began a hectic touring and recording schedule that was to see little respite for the next four years. The second album, and first studio album, of the Mark II era, released in 1970, was \"In Rock\" (a name supported by the album's Mount Rushmore-inspired cover), which contained the then-concert staples \"Speed King\", \"Into The Fire\" and \"Child in Time\". The non-album single \"Black Night\", released around the same time, finally put Deep Purple into the UK Top 10. The interplay between Blackmore's guitar and Lord's distorted organ, coupled with Gillan's powerful, wide-ranging vocals and the rhythm section of Glover and Paice, now started to take on a unique identity that separated the band from its earlier albums. Along with Zeppelin's \"Led Zeppelin II\" and Sabbath's \"Paranoid\", \"In Rock\" codified the budding heavy metal genre.\nOn the album's development, Blackmore stated: \"I got fed up with playing with classical orchestras, and thought, 'well, this is my turn.' Jon was into more classical. I said, 'well you've done that, I'll do rock, and whatever turns out best we'll carry on with.'\" \"In Rock\" performed well, especially in the UK where it reached No. 4, while the \"Black Night\" single reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and the band performed the song live on the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\". In addition to increasing sales in the UK, the band were making a name for themselves as a live act, particularly with regard to the sheer volume of their shows and the improvisational skills of Blackmore and Lord. Said Lord, \"We took from jazz, we took from old fashioned rock and roll, we took from the classics. Ritchie and myself...used to swap musical jokes and attacks. He would play something, and I'd have to see if I could match it. That provided a sense of humour, a sense of tension to the band, a sense of, 'what the hell's going to happen next?' The audience didn't know, and nine times out of ten, neither did we!\"\nA second Mark II studio album, the creatively progressive \"Fireball\", was issued in the summer of 1971, reaching No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. The title track \"Fireball\" was released as a single, as was \"Strange Kind of Woman\", not from the album but recorded during the same sessions (although it replaced \"Demon's Eye\" on the US version of the album). \"Strange Kind of Woman\" became their second UK Top 10 single, reaching No. 8.\nWithin weeks of \"Fireball\"'s release, the band were already performing songs planned for the next album. One song (which later became \"Highway Star\") was performed at the first show of the \"Fireball\" tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: \"How do you go about writing songs?\" On 24 October 1971 during the US leg of the \"Fireball\" tour, the band was set to play the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago when Ian Gillan contracted hepatitis, forcing the band to play without him, with bassist Glover singing the set. After this, the rest of the US dates were cancelled and the band flew home.\nIn early December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record \"Machine Head\". The album was due to be recorded at the Montreux Casino using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, but a fire during a Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention concert, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song \"Smoke on the Water\". The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty Grand H\u00f4tel de Territet, with the exception of the music track to \"Smoke on the Water\". That was recorded at a vacant theatre called The Pavillon before the band was asked to leave. On recording \"Smoke on the Water\", Blackmore stated to BBC Radio 2: \"We did the whole thing in about four takes because we had to. The police were banging on the door. We knew it was the police, but we had such a good sound in this hall. We were waking up all the neighbours for about five miles in Montreux, because it was echo-ing through the mountains. I was just getting the last part of the riff down, we'd just finished it, when the police burst in and said 'you've got to stop'. We had the track down.\"\nContinuing to progress the musical direction of the previous two albums, \"Machine Head\" was released in late March 1972 and became one of the band's most famous releases. It was the band's second No. 1 album in the UK while re-establishing them in North America, hitting No. 7 in the US and No. 1 in Canada. It included tracks that became live classics, such as \"Highway Star\", \"Space Truckin'\", \"Lazy\" and \"Smoke on the Water\", the last of which remains Deep Purple's most famous song. They continued to tour and record at a rate that would be rare thirty years on; when \"Machine Head\" was recorded, the group had only been together three-and-a-half years, yet it was their sixth studio album and seventh album overall.\nIn January 1972, the band returned to tour the US once again. They then headed over to play Europe before resuming US dates in March. While in America, Blackmore contracted hepatitis, and the band attempted one show in Flint, Michigan, without a guitarist before attempting to acquire the services of Al Kooper, who rehearsed with the band before bowing out, suggesting Spirit guitarist Randy California instead. California played one show with the group, in Quebec City, Quebec on 6 April, but the rest of this tour was cancelled as well.\nThe band returned to the US in late May 1972 to undertake their third North America tour (of four total that year). A Japan tour in August of that year led to a double live album, \"Made in Japan\". Originally intended as a Japan-only release, its worldwide release became an instant hit, reaching platinum status in five countries, including the US. It remains one of rock music's most popular and highest selling live albums.\nMark II continued to work and released the album \"Who Do We Think We Are\" in 1973. Spawning the hit single \"Woman from Tokyo\", the album hit No. 4 in the UK charts and No. 15 in the US chart, while achieving gold record status faster than any Deep Purple album released up to that time. However, internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever. Following the successes of \"Machine Head\" and \"Made in Japan\", the addition of \"Who Do We Think We Are\" made Deep Purple the top-selling artists of 1973 in the US.\nGillan admitted in a 1984 interview that the band were pushed by management to complete the \"Who Do We Think We Are\" album on time and go on tour, although they badly needed a break. The bad feelings, including tensions with Blackmore, culminated in Gillan quitting the band after their second tour of Japan in the summer of 1973, followed by the dismissal of Glover, at Blackmore's insistence. In interviews later, Lord called the end of Mark II while the band was at its peak \"the biggest shame in rock and roll; God knows what we would have done over the next three or four years. We were writing so well.\"\nMark III (1973\u20131975).\nThe band hired Midlands bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, formerly of Trapeze. According to Paice, Glover told him and Lord a few months before his official termination that he wanted to leave the band, so they had started to drop in on Trapeze shows. After acquiring Hughes, they debated continuing as a four-piece, with Hughes as bassist and lead vocalist. According to Hughes, he was told the band was bringing in Paul Rodgers of Free as a co-lead vocalist, but by that time Rodgers had just started Bad Company. \"They did ask\", Rodgers recalled, \"and I spoke to all of them at length about the possibility. Purple had toured Australia with Free's final lineup. I didn't do it because I was very much into the idea of forming Bad Company.\" Instead, auditions were held for lead vocal replacements. They settled on David Coverdale, an unknown singer from Saltburn in north-east England, primarily because Blackmore liked his masculine, blues-tinged voice.\n\"Burn\", the first album by Deep Purple Mark III, was released in February 1974 to great success, reaching No. 3 in the UK and No. 9 in the US, and was followed by another world tour. The title track, which opens the album and would open most concerts during the Mark III and IV eras, was a conscious effort by the band to embrace the progressive rock movement, which was popularised at the time by bands such as Yes, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Genesis and Gentle Giant. Another notable song from the album was a slow-burning blues number called \"Mistreated\".\nMark III embarked on a spring tour that included shows at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 13 March, and Nassau Coliseum four days later. The band co-headlined (with Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer) the California Jam festival at Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, southern California, on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 250,000 fans, the festival also included 1970s rock giants Black Sabbath, Eagles, Seals &amp; Crofts and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider audience. During the show, Blackmore doused his amplifiers with petrol and set them on fire, blowing a hole in the stage. A month later, the band's 22 May performance at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, was recorded and later released in 1982 as \"Live in London\".\nHughes and Coverdale brought vocal harmonies and elements of funk and blues, respectively, to the band's music, a sound that was even more apparent on the late 1974 release \"Stormbringer\". Along with the title track, the \"Stormbringer\" album had a number of songs that received significant radio play, such as \"Lady Double Dealer\", \"The Gypsy\" and \"Soldier of Fortune\", and the album reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 20 on the US \"Billboard\" chart. Blackmore publicly disliked most of the album, however, derisively calling it \"shoeshine music\" out of distaste for its funk and soul elements. A new live album, \"Made in Europe\", culled from three shows on the \"Stormbringer\" tour, was assembled during the summer of 1975, but would not see release until late 1976. After the show in Stuttgart-B\u00f6blingen, Blackmore announced on 26 March 1975 to his co-musicians in a room of the Arabella Hotel in Munich that he was quitting the band. Lord, Paice, Coverdale and Hughes were speechless as a few weeks time later, the band were supposed to go into the studio to record their next album. Blackmore's departure from Deep Purple, and therefore the end of Mark III, was announced on 21 June 1975. Blackmore then formed his own band with Ronnie James Dio of Elf, called Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, shortened to Rainbow after the first album.\nMark IV (1975\u20131976).\nFollowing Blackmore's departure, the group considered disbanding but decided to continue and find another guitarist. Clem Clempson (Colosseum, Humble Pie), Zal Cleminson (The Sensational Alex Harvey Band), Mick Ronson (The Spiders From Mars) and Rory Gallagher were considered, and the final choice was American Tommy Bolin. There are at least two versions of the Bolin recruitment story: Coverdale claims to have been the one who suggested auditioning Bolin. \"He walked in, thin as a rake, his hair coloured green, yellow and blue with feathers in it. Slinking along beside him was this stunning Hawaiian girl in a crochet dress with nothing on underneath. He plugged into four Marshall 100-watt stacks and...the job was his.\" But in an interview published by \"Melody Maker\" in June 1975, Bolin claimed that he came to the audition following a recommendation from Blackmore. Bolin had been a member of many late-1960s bands \u2013 Denny &amp; The Triumphs, American Standard, and Zephyr, which released three albums from 1969 to 1972. Before he joined Deep Purple, Bolin's best-known recordings had been made as a session musician on Billy Cobham's 1973 jazz fusion album \"Spectrum\", and as lead guitarist on two post-Joe Walsh James Gang albums: \"Bang\" (1973) and \"Miami\" (1974). He had also played with Dr. John, Albert King, the Good Rats, Moxy and Alphonse Mouzon, and was busy working on his first solo album, \"Teaser\", when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.\nThe resulting album from Deep Purple Mark IV, \"Come Taste the Band\", was released in October 1975, one month before Bolin's \"Teaser\" album. Despite mixed reviews and middling sales (No. 19 in the UK and No. 43 in the US), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their hard rock sound. Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to surface. During the \"Come Taste the Band\" tour, many fans openly booed Bolin's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he admitted in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from cocaine addiction.\nThe last show on the tour was on 15 March 1976 at the Liverpool Empire Theatre. At the end of the concert, Coverdale walked off in tears and handed in his resignation. He was told there was no band left to quit, as Lord and Paice had already decided to break up the band. The break-up was made public in July 1976, with then-manager Rob Cooksey issuing a statement: \"The band will not record or perform together as Deep Purple again\". \"Last Concert in Japan\", a live album of the last concert on the Japanese leg of the \"Come Taste the Band\" tour, was issued in 1977.\nBolin went on to record his second solo album, \"Private Eyes\". On 4 December 1976, after a show in Miami supporting Jeff Beck, Bolin was found unconscious by his girlfriend and bandmates. Unable to wake him, she hurriedly called paramedics, but it was too late. The official cause of death was multiple-drug intoxication. Bolin was 25 years old.\nBand split (1976\u20131984).\nAfter the break-up, most of the members of Deep Purple went on to have considerable success in a number of other bands, including Rainbow (1975\u20131984, Ritchie Blackmore and, from 1979, Roger Glover), Whitesnake (1978\u2013present, David Coverdale, Jon Lord until 1984, and Ian Paice during 1979\u20131982) and Gillan (1978\u20131982, Ian Gillan). Ian Gillan also joined Black Sabbath from late 1982 to early 1984 (Glenn Hughes would also join Sabbath for a short time later in the 1980s). The then-defunct Deep Purple began to gain a type of mystical status, with fan-driven reissues and newly assembled live and compilation albums being released throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. This fuelled a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, a touring version of the band surfaced with Rod Evans, who had left Captain Beyond at the end of 1973, as the only member who had ever been in Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of US$672,000 for using the band name without permission.\nMark II reunion (1984\u20131989).\nIn April 1984, eight years after the demise of Deep Purple, a full-scale (and legal) reunion took place with the \"classic\" Mark II line-up of 1969\u20131973: Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan and Roger Glover. The reformed band signed a worldwide deal with PolyGram, with Mercury Records releasing their albums in the US, and Polydor Records in the UK and other countries. The album \"Perfect Strangers\" was recorded in Vermont and released in October 1984. The album was commercially successful, reaching No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart and No. 17 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the US. The album included the singles and concert staples \"Knocking at Your Back Door\" and \"Perfect Strangers\". \"Perfect Strangers\" became the second Deep Purple album to go platinum in the US, following \"Machine Head\" (\"Made in Japan\" would also finally hit platinum status in the US in 1986, the same year \"Machine Head\" increased to double platinum).\nThe reunion tour followed, starting in Australia and winding its way across the world to North America, then into Europe by the following summer. Financially, the tour was also a tremendous success. In the US, the 1985 tour out-grossed every other artist except Bruce Springsteen. The UK homecoming saw the band headline the 1985 Knebworth Fayre in June, where the weather was bad (torrential rain and of mud) in front of 80,000 fans. The gig was called the \"Return of the Knebworth Fayre\".\nMark II followed \"Perfect Strangers\" with \"The House of Blue Light\" in 1987, which was supported by another world tour (interrupted after Blackmore broke a finger on stage while trying to catch his guitar after throwing it in the air). A new live album \"Nobody's Perfect\", which was culled from several shows on this tour, was released in 1988. In the UK a new Mark II version of \"Hush\" was also released in 1988 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Deep Purple.\nMark V (1989\u20131992).\nGillan was fired in 1989; his relations with Blackmore had again soured, and their musical differences had diverged too far. Originally, the band intended to recruit Survivor frontman Jimi Jamison as Gillan's replacement. After two weeks of sessions with the band, however, Jamison announced he could not join Deep Purple owing to complications with Scotti Brothers Records, his record label. Eventually, after auditioning several high-profile candidates, including Brian Howe (White Spirit, Ted Nugent, Bad Company), Doug Pinnick (King's X), Australians Jimmy Barnes (Cold Chisel) and John Farnham (Little River Band), Terry Brock (Strangeways, Giant) and Norman \"Kal\" Swan (Tytan, Lion, Bad Moon Rising), the band agreed on Joe Lynn Turner, who had previously been a member of Rainbow with Blackmore and Glover.\nThis Mark V line-up recorded just one album, \"Slaves and Masters\" (1990), and undertook a world tour for most of 1991. The album achieved modest success, reaching No. 45 in the UK and No. 87 in the US \"Billboard\" chart, with some fans and critics feeling the music was closer in style to Rainbow than to Deep Purple.\nSecond Mark II reunion (1992\u20131993) and Mark VI (1993\u20131994).\nWith the tour complete, the band set to work on another album, the early sessions of which would see Turner being forced out. 1993 was going to be Deep Purple's 25th anniversary year, with Lord, Paice and Glover (and the record company) wanting Gillan back for another Mark II reunion to celebrate this milestone. Although Blackmore preferred Turner to remain in the group, he grudgingly relented, after requesting and eventually receiving $250,000 in his bank account and Mark II completed the aptly titled \"The Battle Rages On...\" in 1993.\nBlackmore still disagreed with the decision, which created more tension between himself and the rest of the band, especially Gillan. Of particular contention was that Gillan had reworked much of the material that had been written with Turner for the new album. Blackmore felt that Gillan's rewrites had made the songs less melodic than they had been in their original versions. The band began a European tour, which was documented on the live album \"Come Hell or High Water\", released in 1994. A live home video of the same name was also released, covering a show in Birmingham, England that displayed a very disgruntled Blackmore, who did not perform many of the guitar parts and who at one point threw a cup of water at a cameraman, for unknown reasons. The complete show was eventually released in 2006 as \"Live at the NEC\" but was quickly withdrawn after Gillan publicly complained, feeling it represented a bad time in the group's history: \"It was one of the lowest points of my life \u2013 all of our lives, actually\".\nBlackmore left Deep Purple for the second and final time after a show in Helsinki, Finland in November 1993. Joe Satriani was drafted to complete the Japanese dates in December and stayed on for a European summer tour in 1994. He was asked to join permanently, but his commitments to his contract with Epic Records prevented this. The band unanimously chose Dixie Dregs and former Kansas guitarist Steve Morse as Satriani's successor in August 1994.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Musically, it was very satisfying. The setlist was straight out of classic rock heaven. And the band were just great. Their timing was just fantastic.\"\n\u2014 Guitarist Joe Satriani on his brief period with Deep Purple.\nMark VII (1994\u20132002).\nMorse's arrival revitalised the band creatively, and in 1996 a new album titled \"Purpendicular\" was released, showing a wide variety of musical styles. Though in the post-grunge mid-1990s it was no surprise that it never made chart success on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the US. This Mark VII line-up then released a new live album \"Live at The Olympia '96\" in 1997. With a revamped set list to tour, Deep Purple enjoyed successful tours throughout the rest of the 1990s, releasing the harder-sounding \"Abandon\" in 1998, and touring with renewed enthusiasm.\n1999 marked the 30th anniversary of the \"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\". Lord, with the help of a Dutch fan, who was also a musicologist and composer, Marco de Goeij, painstakingly recreated the concerto, the original score having been lost. It was once again performed at the Royal Albert Hall in September 1999, this time with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Paul Mann. The concert also included songs from each member's solo careers, as well as a short Deep Purple set, and the occasion was released as the album \"In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra\" in 2000. 2001 saw the release of the box set \"The Soundboard Series\", containing concerts from the 2001 Australian Tour plus two from Tokyo, Japan. Much of the next few years was spent on the road touring. The group continued forward until 2002 when founding member Lord announced his amicable retirement from the band to pursue personal projects (especially orchestral work). His departure left Ian Paice as the band's sole remaining founder member. Lord left his Hammond organ to his replacement, rock keyboard veteran Don Airey, who had helped Deep Purple out when Lord's knee was injured in 2001. Airey had previously worked with Glover as a member of Rainbow from 1979 to 1982.\nMark VIII (2002\u20132022).\nIn 2003, the new Mark VIII line-up released \"Bananas\", their first studio album in five years, and began touring in support. EMI Records refused a contract extension with Deep Purple, possibly because of lower sales.\nThe band played at the Live 8 concert in Park Place (Barrie, Ontario) in July 2005, and in October released their next album, \"Rapture of the Deep\", which was followed by the Rapture of the Deep tour. Both \"Bananas\" and \"Rapture of the Deep\" were produced by Michael Bradford. In 2009 Ian Gillan said, \"Record sales have been steadily declining, but people are prepared to pay a lot for concert tickets.\" In addition, Gillan stated: \"I don't think happiness comes with money.\"\nDeep Purple did concert tours in 48 countries in 2011. The Songs That Built Rock Tour used a 38-piece orchestra, and included a performance at the O2 Arena in London. Until May 2011, the band members had disagreed about whether to make a new studio album, because it would not really make money any more. Roger Glover stated that Deep Purple should make a new studio album \"even if it costs us money.\" In early 2011, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes told VH1 they would like to reunite Mark III for the right opportunity, such as a benefit concert. This did not happen however, as Ritchie Blackmore was difficult to contact and was not interested, as he was busy with his current band Blackmore's Night. The band's chief sound engineer of nine years of tours, Moray McMillin, died in September 2011, aged 57. After a lot of songwriting sessions in Europe, Deep Purple decided to record through the summer of 2012, and the band announced they would release their new studio album in 2013. Steve Morse announced to French magazine \"Rock Hard\" that the new studio album would be produced by Bob Ezrin.\nOn 16 July 2012 the band's co-founding member and former organ player, Jon Lord, died in London, aged 71. In December 2012 Roger Glover stated that the band had completed work on 14 songs for a new studio album, with 11 or 12 tracks set to appear on the final album to be released in 2013. On 26 February 2013 the title of the band's nineteenth studio album was announced as \"Now What?!\", which was recorded and mixed in Nashville, Tennessee, and released on 26 April 2013. The album contains the track \"Vincent Price\", named after the horror actor who had worked with both Gillan and Glover earlier in their careers.\nOn 25 November 2016, Deep Purple announced \"Infinite\" as the title of their twentieth studio album, which was released on 7 April 2017. In support for the album, Deep Purple embarked on 13 May 2017 in Bucharest, Romania on The Long Goodbye Tour. At the time of the tour's announcement in December 2016, Paice told the Heavyworlds website it \"may be the last big tour\", adding that the band \"don't know\". He described the tour as being long in duration and said: \"We haven't made any hard, fast plans, but it becomes obvious that you cannot tour the same way you did when you were 21. It becomes more and more difficult. People have other things in their lives, which take time. But never say never.\" On 3 February 2017, Deep Purple released a video version of \"Time for Bedlam\", the first track taken from the new album and the first new Deep Purple track for almost four years.\nOn 29 February 2020, a new track, \"Throw My Bones\" was released online, with a new album \"Whoosh!\" planned for release in June. The release of the full-length album would later be postponed to 7 August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A review in \"NME\" said the album sounded nothing like contemporary music of 2020, but suggested that \"maybe that's a good thing\". Gillan confirmed in an interview on 4 August 2020 that he and the other members of Deep Purple have no immediate plans to retire.\nOn 6 October 2021, the band had announced the title of their covers album, \"Turning to Crime\", which was released on 26 November 2021.\nMark IX (2022\u2013present).\nIn March 2022, Morse announced that he had to take a hiatus from the band after his wife was diagnosed with cancer. The band, who had recently returned to live performances, continued touring with Simon McBride, formerly of Sweet Savage, standing in for Morse who at that point officially remained in the band. On 23 July 2022, it was announced that Morse would be leaving permanently in order to focus on caring for his wife as she battled cancer. Later that September, McBride was made an official member of the band.\nIn June 2022, Gillan announced that the band had planned to work on their 23rd studio album after the conclusion of the \"Whoosh!\" tour: \"Deep Purple has got a writing session booked in March 2023, which I believe is to get started on thinking about our next record.\"\nTitled \"=1 More Time\", a 2024 tour was announced on 19 March of that year. Jefferson Starship were special guests on the Europe dates, and Reef were special guests for the UK shows. On 24 April 2024, it was announced the forthcoming release of a new studio album - the first with McBride - whose title \"=1\" and track listing were revealed, and the release date stated as 19 July of that year. It was the fifth Deep Purple album that Bob Ezrin had produced. The first single \"Portable Door\" was released on 30 April. A second single, \"Pictures of You\", was released on 5 June 2024. A third single, \"Lazy Sod\" was released on 5 July 2024.\nIn a May 2025 interview with \"Rolling Stone Brasil\", Paice confirmed that Deep Purple have begun working on new material for their next album due for a possible 2026 release.\nIn a November 2025 interview with \"Uncut\", Gillan confirmed that he has only 30% vision and that his eyesight \"won't get better\". He also opened up about potentially retiring from Deep Purple: \"I think if I lose my energy I'm going to stop. I don't want to be an embarrassment to anyone. We're not far off that. It creeps up on you \u2013 you don't really notice.\"\nArtistry.\nDeep Purple are cited as one of the pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal, along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. The BBC states they \"made up the 'unholy trinity' of British hard rock and heavy metal during the genre's 1970s golden age.\"\nThe band have spanned many subgenres of rock, including acid rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, blues rock and funk rock, prompting Canadian journalist Martin Popoff to call the band \"a reference point of a genre in metal without categorisation.\" Jason Ankeny of AllMusic said the band \"made hard rock a fine art, and unleashed some of the greatest guitar riffs known to the world.\"\nMusical style.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"My interest in classical music overall is what led me in the direction of trying to combine blues, rock and classical ideas into the stylistic statement.\"\n\u2014 Ritchie Blackmore on early influences on Deep Purple\nDeep Purple's members were experienced musicians with different musical backgrounds: Lord had trained in classical music and played in jazz and blues rock ensembles, Blackmore and Simper came from session work in pop rock and Paice and Evans came from beat bands. This is evident on the band's debut album, \"Shades of Deep Purple\", a contemporary mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock and pop rock.\nTraces of the heavier sound that Deep Purple popularized in their Mark II line-up can be heard in the remaining albums with Rod Evans, mostly evident in Blackmore's guitar parts. He was replaced by Ian Gillan, initially influenced by Elvis Presley and similarly had roots in psychedelia and pop rock, as vocalist for Episode Six. His first three albums with the band have continued to attract critical praise as key early examples of the hard rock and heavy metal genres, while \"Who Do We Think We Are\" showed a move to a more blues-based sound, even featuring scat singing.\nCertain songs from the Mark II line-up, such as \"Speed King\", \"Hard Lovin' Man\", \"Fireball\" and \"Highway Star\", have been credited as early influences on speed metal and thrash metal. The latter song was called \"early speed metal\" by Robb Reiner of Canadian heavy metal band Anvil. \"Hard Lovin' Man\" has been referred to as the \"first proto-thrash song ever\", predating Queen's \"Stone Cold Crazy\" and Black Sabbath's \"Symptom of the Universe\" by a few years. Deep Purple have also experimented with funk and soul, mostly in the mid-1970s, but as recently as \"One Night in Vegas\" (2017), which has been described as funk metal.\nInfluences.\nAccording to Ritchie Blackmore, he was inspired by the Allman Brothers Band, Vanilla Fudge and Cream, but credits Jimi Hendrix as \"the real deal for him and Deep Purple\" and praising him as \"at least 20 years ahead of his time.\" Hendrix's songs, \"Stone Free\" and \"Fire\", were the inspirations for \"Speed King\". Blackmore had the chance to meet Hendrix at Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood, but they did not talk, he told SiriusXM's Guitar Greats in 2022.\nMountain was another major influence on Blackmore. After touring with them, Deep Purple was shocked by how heavy their sound was with just three members, making them want to pursue a heavier sound on \"Deep Purple In Rock\". \"I really loved Leslie West's playing, said Blackmore before reflecting on the first time hearing \"Mississippi Queen\".\"I remember being in a place in Germany, and Ian [Paice] and I were out drinking together. In those days, you could go to a club and listen to the new records in their entirety that had just come out. Paice and I heard, \u2018Mississippi Queen\u2019, and we both went white! We were thinking, 'Who the hell is that?!' It had such a big sound! For three guys, it was incredibly heavy.\"Other members of Deep Purple have credited Jimmy Smith, Buddy Rich, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Ella Fitzgerald, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, Buddy Holly Jimmy McGriff, The Beatles, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Free, the Who, Traffic, Neil Young, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie and Jeff Buckley as influences.\nLegacy and influence.\nDeep Purple have influenced a number of rock and metal acts including Accept, Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Bon Jovi, Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, Celtic Frost, the Charlatans, Def Leppard, Dinosaur Jr., Dio, Dokken, Dream Theater, Europe, Exciter, Exodus, Lita Ford, Heart, Helloween, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, King's X, Kiss, London, Yngwie Malmsteen, Megadeth, the Melvins, Mercyful Fate, Metallica, Ministry, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Mot\u00f6rhead, Overkill, Pantera, Prong, Queen, Rage Against the Machine, Rush, Saxon, Scorpions, Sepultura, Slayer, the Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Stryper, Stuck Mojo, Testament, UFO, Van Halen, Venom, and Wolfmother.\nDef Leppard vocalist Joe Elliot stated that \"in 1971, there were only three bands that mattered: Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple.\" Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter, Steve Harris, states that his band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\" Van Halen founder Eddie Van Halen named \"Burn\" one of his favourite ever guitar riffs. Queen guitarist Brian May referred to Ritchie Blackmore as \"a trail blazer and technically incredible \u2014 unpredictable in every possible way...you never knew what you were gonna see when you went to see Purple\". Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich states, \"When I was nine years old it was all about Deep Purple. My all time favourite [album] is still \"Made in Japan\"\". The band's 1974 album \"Stormbringer\" was the first record owned by Till Lindemann, vocalist of German Neue Deutsche H\u00e4rte band Rammstein.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlthough Deep Purple helped lay the foundation for the heavy metal, their consummate musicianship meant they also transcended the genre. Indeed, they began as a progressive rock group with their eyes, unusually, on the singles market. Yet they certainly rocked, as their shows from the earliest days conclusively proved.\nDavid Roberts in the book \"Rock Chronicles: Every Legend. Every Line-up. Every Look.\" (published October 25, 2019) Firefly Books. pp. 148.\nIn 2000, Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" programme. At the 2008 World Music Awards, the band received the Legend Award. In 2011, they received the Innovator Award at the 2011 \"Classic Rock\" Awards in London. A \"Rolling Stone\" readers' poll in 2012 ranked \"Made in Japan\" the sixth best live album of all time.\nAs part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of \"Machine Head\" (1972), \"\" was released in 2012. This tribute album included Iron Maiden, Metallica, Steve Vai, Carlos Santana, The Flaming Lips, Black Label Society, Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, Chickenfoot (former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony, guitarist Joe Satriani and Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers) and the supergroup Kings of Chaos (Def Leppard vocalist Joe Elliott, Steve Stevens, and former Guns N' Roses members Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum).\nIn 2007, Deep Purple were one of the featured artists in the fourth episode of the BBC/VH1 series \"Seven Ages of Rock\" \u2013 an episode focusing on heavy metal. In May 2019 the group received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nBefore October 2012, Deep Purple had never been nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013. Despite ranking second in the public's vote on the Rock Hall fans' ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, \"they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What's the first song every kid learns how to play? [\"Smoke on the Water\"]\u00a0... And they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?\u00a0... the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions.\" Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement regarding the non-induction of Deep Purple: \"The list of people who haven't even been nominated is mind-boggling\u00a0... [the] big one for me is Deep Purple. How could you not induct Deep Purple?\". Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett had also lobbied for the band's induction.\nIn an interview with \"Rolling Stone\" in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: \"I'm not going to get into the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language\u00a0... 'Deep Purple'! Did I say that already?\" In 2015, Chris Jericho, professional wrestler and vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: \"that Deep Purple are not in it [Hall of Fame]. It's bullshit. Obviously there's some politics against them from getting in there.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"With almost no exceptions, every hard rock band in the last 40 years, including mine, traces its lineage directly back to Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple. Where I grew up, and in the rest of the world outside of North America, all were equal in status, stature and influence. So in my heart\u00a0\u2013 and I know I speak for many of my fellow musicians and millions of Purple fans when I confess that\u00a0\u2013 I am somewhat bewildered that they are so late in getting in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\"\n\u2014Excerpt from Lars Ulrich's speech, inducting Deep Purple into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.\nIn response to these, a Hall of Fame chief executive said, \"The definition of 'rock and roll' means different things to different people, but as broad as the classifications may be, they all share a common love of the music.\" Roger Glover got an inside word in there and they were talking of us as not \"fashionable\" enough. \"One of the jurors said, 'You know, Deep Purple, they're just one-hit wonders.' How can you deal with that kind of Philistinism, you know?\".\nIan Gillan also commented, \"I've fought all my life against being institutionalised and I think you have to actively search these things out, in other words mingle with the right people, and we don't get invited to those kind of things.\" On 16 October 2013 Deep Purple were again announced as nominees for inclusion to the Hall, and once again they were not inducted.\nIn April 2015, Deep Purple topped the list in a \"Rolling Stone\" readers poll of acts that should be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2016. In October 2015, the band were nominated for induction for the third time. In December 2015, the band were announced as 2016 inductees into the Hall of Fame, with the Hall stating: \"Deep Purple's non-inclusion in the Hall is a gaping hole which must now be filled\", adding that along with fellow inductees Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, the band make up \"the Holy Trinity of hard rock and metal bands.\"\nThe band were officially inducted on 8 April 2016. The Hall of Fame announced that the following members were included as inductees: Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, Rod Evans, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. Excluded from induction were Nick Simper, Tommy Bolin, Joe Lynn Turner, Joe Satriani, Steve Morse and Don Airey.\nIt was reported that Ian Gillan announced that he was barring Hughes, Coverdale, Evans and Blackmore from playing with them onstage, as these members are not in the current \"living, breathing\" version of the band. When interviewed by Loudwire he stated however that this was not the case. An email was sent from his management to Blackmore's management but Blackmore claimed he never received said email. Of the seven living inducted members, five showed up. Blackmore did not attend; a posting on his Facebook page claimed he was honoured by the induction and had considered attending, until he received correspondence from Bruce Payne, manager from the current touring version of Deep Purple saying, \"No!\" Evans, who had disappeared from the music scene more than three decades prior, also did not appear. Since Lord had died in 2012, his wife Vickie accepted his award on his behalf. The current members of the band played \"Highway Star\" for the opening performance. After a brief interlude playing the Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s song \"Green Onions\" while photos of the late Jon Lord flashed on the screen behind them, the current Deep Purple members played two more songs: \"Hush\" and their signature tune \"Smoke on the Water\". Although barred from playing with Deep Purple, both David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes (as well as Roger Glover) joined fellow inductees Cheap Trick and an all-star cast to perform a cover of the Fats Domino song \"Ain't That a Shame\".\nBand members.\nCurrent members\nConcert tours.\nDeep Purple are considered to be one of the hardest touring bands in the world. They have toured the world since 1968 (with the exception of their 1976\u20131984 split). In 2007, the band received a special award for selling more than 150,000 tickets in France, with 40 dates in the country in 2007 alone. Also in 2007, Deep Purple's Rapture of the Deep tour was voted number 6 concert tour of the year (in all music genres) by Planet Rock listeners. The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang tour was voted number 5 and beat Purple's tour by only 1%. Deep Purple released a new live compilation DVD box, Around the World Live, in May 2008. In February 2008, the band made their first-ever appearance at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow, Russia at the personal request of Dmitry Medvedev who at the time was a chairman of the state owned Gazprom company, which sponsored the concert, and who was considered a shoo-in for the seat of the Presidency of Russia. Prior to that, Deep Purple has toured Russia several times starting as early as 1996 but has not been considered to have played such a significant venue previously. The band was part of the entertainment for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec, the Czech Republic.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Democracy Wall movement of November 1978 to spring 1981 is typically regarded as the beginning of contemporary Chinese democracy movement. In addition to the Democracy Wall movement, the events of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre are among the notable examples of Chinese democracy movements.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe beginning of China's democracy movements is usually regarded as the Democracy Wall movement of November 1978 to spring 1981. The Democracy Wall movement framed the key issue as the elimination of bureaucratism and the bureaucratic class. Former Red Guards from both rebel and conservative factions were the core of the movement. Democracy Wall participants agreed that \"democracy\" was the means to resolve the conflict between the bureaucratic class and the people, the nature of the proposed democratic institutions was a major source of disagreement. A majority of participants in the movement favored viewed the movement as part of a struggle between correct and incorrect notions of Marxism. Many participants advocated classical Marxist views that drew on the Paris Commune for inspiration. The Democracy Wall movement also included non-Marxists and anti-Marxists, although these participants were a minority. Demands for \"democracy\" were frequent but without an agreed-upon meaning. Participants in the movement variously associated the concept of democracy with socialism, communism, liberal democracy, capitalism, and Christianity. They drew on a diverse range of intellectual resources \"ranging from classical Marxist and socialist traditions to Enlightenment philosophers, [socialist] experiments in Yugoslavia, and Western liberal democracy.\"\nSignificant documents of the Democracy Wall Movement include The Fifth Modernization manifesto by Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for authoring the document. In it, Wei argued that political liberalization and the empowerment of the laboring masses was essential for modernization, that the CCP was controlled by reactionaries and that the people must struggle to overthrow the reactionaries via a long and possibly bloody fight.\nDevelopment.\nThroughout the 1980s, these ideas increased in popularity among college-educated Chinese, through the \"New Enlightenment movement\" led by intellectuals.\nOverseas pro-democracy organizations including the Chinese Alliance for Democracy were founded by Chinese activists. Student protests inspired by intellectuals broke out in 1986.\nIn the wake of growing corruption and economic dislocation, the Tiananmen Square protests erupted in 1989, which culminated in a military crackdown in June.\nGovernment's response.\nNarratives of a CCP-style democracy have evolved in CCP's language since its founding. The constitution of the People's Republic of China refers to the state as a people's democratic dictatorship, a term rooted in Mao Zedong's concept of new democracy formulated during the Chinese Civil War. During the general secretaryship of Xi Jinping, the CCP has utilized the term whole-process people's democracy to describe the PRC.\nAcademic interpretations.\nAcademic Lin Chun criticizes the phrase \"democracy movement\" as typically used in the scholarly and media discourse on China, noting that the term is often used exclusively to refer to the \"demands and activism of an urban, educated group of people seeking liberal more than democratic values\". She notes, for example, that the political turbulence in universities over the period 1986 to 1989 had specific flash points ranging from anger at the government's \"too soft\" position on China\u2013Japan relations to poor management of student welfare.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45851", "revid": "15482436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45851", "title": "Opeth", "text": "Swedish progressive metal band\nOpeth is a Swedish progressive metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1990. The band incorporates folk, blues, classical, and jazz elements into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Songs may include acoustic guitar passages, Mellotrons, death growls, and strong dynamic shifts. \nThe group have been through several personnel changes since early in their history, including the replacement of every original member. Lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt has been Opeth's driving force since the departure of founder and lead vocalist David Isberg in 1992. The band rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums, but since their first world tour in support of the 2001 album \"Blackwater Park\", they have performed several other major world tours. \nOpeth have released fourteen studio albums, four live DVDs, four live albums (three that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album \"Orchid\" in 1995. With their eighth studio album, \"Ghost Reveries\" (2005), the band achieved chart success in several dozen countries, including Top Ten in Sweden. Their ninth studio album, \"Watershed\" (2008), topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release, and reached 23 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. As of November 2009, the band have sold over 1.5 million copies of their albums and DVDs worldwide, including 300,000 collective SoundScans of their albums \"Blackwater Park\", \"Damnation\", and \"Deliverance\" in the United States. Their 14th studio album \"The Last Will and Testament\" (2024) won the Swedish Grammis award for the Best Hard Rock/Metal category.\nHistory.\nFormation (1990\u20131993).\nOpeth was formed as a death metal band in April 1990 in Stockholm, Sweden, by David Isberg, with some friends from T\u00e4by; Isberg was the lead vocalist. The band name was taken from the Wilbur Smith novel \"The Sunbird\", in which Opet is the name of a fictional city. Isberg asked former Eruption band member and guitarist Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt to join Opeth as a bassist, replacing Martin Persson. When \u00c5kerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that \u00c5kerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and \u00c5kerfeldt leaving to form a new project. At this time Opeth declared themselves to be the \"most evil band in the world\".\nIsberg and \u00c5kerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick D\u00f6ring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, D\u00f6ring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before \u00c5kerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with Stefan Guteklint taking over the role of bassist. In 1992, David Isberg left the band citing \"creative differences\".\nFollowing Isberg's departure, \u00c5kerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he went on to join on a full-time basis following the release of Opeth's debut album, \"Orchid\", in 1995.\n\"Orchid\", \"Morningrise\", and \"My Arms, Your Hearse\" (1994\u20131998).\nOpeth recorded its debut album, \"Orchid\", with producer Dan Swan\u00f6 in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until 15 May 1995, and only in Europe. \"Orchid\" tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.\nAfter a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swan\u00f6. The album, titled \"Morningrise\", was released in Europe on 24 June 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66\u00a0minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the 20-minute \"Black Rose Immortal\". Opeth toured the UK in support of \"Morningrise\", followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.\nIn 1997, after the tour, \u00c5kerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When \u00c5kerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former \"Eternal\" members, drummer Martin Lopez (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Mart\u00edn M\u00e9ndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by \u00c5kerfeldt. L\u00f3pez and M\u00e9ndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. \u00c5kerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martins to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. L\u00f3pez made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \"Remember Tomorrow\", which was included on the album \"\".\nWith a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m, at Studio Fredman in August 1997. Although Opeth had M\u00e9ndez, due to time constraints \u00c5kerfeldt played bass on the album. \"My Arms, Your Hearse\" was released to critical acclaim on 18 August 1998.\n\"Still Life\" and \"Blackwater Park\" (1999\u20132001).\nIn 1999, the ownership of Candlelight Records changed hands, as owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett left the company. Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe, which was distributed by Music For Nations. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and \"Still Life\" was released on 18 October 1999. Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. \"Still Life\" was the first album recorded with M\u00e9ndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo. Allmusic called \"Still Life\" a \"formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies.\" As explained by \u00c5kerfeldt, \"Still Life\" is a concept album: \"The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old 'babe.' The big bosses of the town know that he's back... A lot of bad things start happening.\"\nFollowing a few live dates in Europe, Opeth returned to Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson producing. The band sought to recreate the recording experience of \"Still Life\", and again entered the studio with minimal rehearsals, and no lyrics written. \"This time it was tough,\" \u00c5kerfeldt said, \"I feel pleasantly blown away by the immense result, though. It was indeed worth the effort.\" Wilson also pushed the band to expand its sound, incorporating new sounds and production techniques. \"Steve guided us into the realms of 'strange' noises for guitars and voice\", \u00c5kerfeldt said.\nOpeth released its fifth studio album, \"Blackwater Park\", on 21 February 2001. AllMusic has stated that the album \"keeps with Opeth's tradition by transcending the limits of death/black metal and repeatedly shattering the foundations of conventional songwriting\". In support of \"Blackwater Park\", Opeth embarked on its first world tour, headlined Europe for the first time, and made an appearance at the 2001 Wacken Open Air festival in Germany, playing to a crowd of 60,000.\n\"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\" (2002\u20132004).\nOpeth returned to Sweden after touring in support of \"Blackwater Park\", and began writing for the next album. At first, \u00c5kerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: \"I wanted to write something heavier than we'd ever done, still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't want to go to waste.\" Jonas Renkse of Katatonia, a long-time friend of \u00c5kerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums\u2014one heavy and one soft.\nExcited at the prospect, \u00c5kerfeldt agreed without consulting his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates liked the idea of recording two separate albums, \u00c5kerfeldt had to convince the label: \"I had to lie somewhat\u00a0... saying that we could do this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album.\" With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering Nacksving Studios in 2002, and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously, \u00c5kerfeldt said the recording process was \"the toughest test of our history.\" After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album, \"Deliverance\", with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. \"\"Deliverance\" was so poorly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever,\" \u00c5kerfeldt claimed, that Sneap \"is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording.\"\n\"Deliverance\" was released on 4 November 2002, and debuted at number\u00a019 on the US Top Independent Albums chart, marking the band's first US chart appearance. AllMusic stated, \"\"Deliverance\" is altogether more subtle than any of its predecessors, approaching listeners with haunting nuances and masterful dynamics rather than overwhelming them with sheer mass and complexity.\"\nOpeth performed a one-off concert in Stockholm, then returned to the UK to finish recording vocals for the second of the two albums, \"Damnation\", at Steven Wilson's No Man's Land Studios. Although \u00c5kerfeldt believed the band could not finish both albums, Opeth completed \"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\" in just seven weeks of studio time, which was the same amount spent on \"Blackwater Park\" alone. \"Damnation\" was released on 14 April 2003, and garnered the band its first appearance on the US \"Billboard\" 200 at number 192. The album also won the 2003 Swedish Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. On 1 January 2016, Opeth re-released both \"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\" in one package, containing CD and DVD versions, along with new mixing.\nThe band embarked on its biggest tour yet, playing nearly 200\u00a0shows in 2003 and 2004. Opeth performed three special shows in Europe with two song lists each\u2014one acoustic set and one heavy set. The band recorded its first DVD, \"Lamentations (Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire 2003)\", at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, England. The DVD features a two-hour performance, including the entire \"Damnation\" album, several songs from \"Deliverance\" and \"Blackwater Park\", and a one-hour documentary about the recording of \"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\". \"Lamentations\" was certified Gold (over 50,000 sales) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.\nOpeth was scheduled to perform in Jordan without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. Opeth's tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, drummer Lopez called \u00c5kerfeldt stating he was having an anxiety attack and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show. In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour. Opeth decided against cancelling the remainder of the tour, with Lopez's drum technician filling in for two concerts. Lopez promised that he would return to the tour as soon as he could, but two shows later Opeth asked Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan to fill in. Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the \"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\" tour.\n\"Ghost Reveries\" (2005\u20132007).\nOpeth returned home in 2004 to start writing new material for its eighth album; by the end of the year, they had finished writing it. European label, Music For Nations, closed its doors in 2005, and after negotiations with various labels, the band signed with Roadrunner Records. \u00c5kerfeldt said the primary reason for signing with Roadrunner was the label's wide distribution, ensuring the album would be available at larger-chain retailers. When news leaked that the band was signed to Roadrunner, who predominantly worked with trend-oriented rock and metal, some fans accused the band of selling out. \"To be honest,\" \u00c5kerfeldt said, \"that's such an insult after 15\u00a0years as a band and 8\u00a0records. I can't believe we haven't earned each and every Opeth fan's credibility after all these years. I mean, our songs are 10\u00a0minutes long!\" The band rehearsed for three weeks before entering the studio, the first time the band rehearsed since the 1998 album, \"My Arms, Your Hearse\". During rehearsal, keyboardist Wiberg joined Opeth as a full-time member after touring with the band on keyboards for more than a year. Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in \u00d6rebro, Sweden, from 18 March to 1 June 2005, and released the resulting \"Ghost Reveries\" on 30 August 2005, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album debuted at number\u00a064 in the US, and number nine in Sweden, higher than any previous Opeth release. Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the album ten out of ten, one of only 21\u00a0albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site. Rod Smith of \"Decibel\" magazine called \"Ghost Reveries\" \"achingly beautiful, sometimes unabashedly brutal, often a combination of both\".\nOn 12 May 2006, Martin Lopez announced that he had officially parted ways with Opeth due to health problems, and was replaced by Martin Axenrot. Opeth toured on the main stage of Gigantour in 2006, alongside Megadeth. \"Ghost Reveries\" was re-released on 31 October 2006, with a bonus cover song (Deep Purple's \"Soldier of Fortune\"), a DVD featuring a 5.1 surround sound mix of the album and a documentary on the making of the record. A recording of Opeth's live performance at the Camden Roundhouse, in London, on 9 November 2006, was released as the double live album \"The Roundhouse Tapes\", which topped the Finnish DVD chart.\nOn 17 May 2007, Peter Lindgren announced he would be leaving Opeth after 16\u00a0years. \"The decision has been the toughest I've ever made but it is the right one to make at this point in my life,\" Lindgren said. \"I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry.\" Ex-Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik \u00c5kesson replaced Lindgren, as \u00c5kerfeldt explained \"Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth.\"\n\"Watershed\" and \"In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall\" (2008\u20132010).\nOpeth entered Fascination Street Studios in November 2007 to record their ninth studio album, with \u00c5kerfeldt producing. By January 2008, Opeth had recorded 13\u00a0songs, including three cover songs. The finished album, \"Watershed\", features seven tracks, with cover songs used as bonus tracks on different versions of the album. \"Watershed\" was released on 3 June 2008. \u00c5kerfeldt described the songs on the album as \"a bit more energetic\". Opeth toured in support of \"Watershed\", including headlining the UK Defenders of the Faith tour with Arch Enemy, an appearance at Wacken Open Air, and the Progressive Nation tour with headliner Dream Theater. \"Watershed\" was Opeth's highest-charting album to date, debuting at number 23 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, on the Australian ARIA album charts at number seven and at number one on Finland's official album chart. Opeth went on a worldwide tour in support of \"Watershed\". In 2008, they played the UK Bloodstock festival alongside Dimmu Borgir. From September to October, the band toured North America backed by High on Fire, Baroness, and Nachtmystium. They returned to tour Europe for the rest of the year with Cynic and The Ocean.\nIn 2010, Opeth wrote and recorded the new track, \"The Throat of Winter\", which appeared on the digital EP soundtrack of the video game, \"God of War III\". \u00c5kerfeldt described the song as \"odd\" and \"not very metal.\" To celebrate their 20th anniversary, Opeth performed a six-show, worldwide tour called \"Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology\", from 30 March through 9 April 2010. \"Blackwater Park\" was performed in its entirety, along with several songs never before performed. The concert of 5 April 2010, at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England was filmed for a DVD and live album package titled \"In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall\". The set was released on 21 September 2010, in 2-DVD and 2-DVD/3-CD configurations. For the DVD the concert was split into two sets. The first set consists of the entire \"Blackwater Park\" album, while the second set contains one song from every album excluding \"Blackwater Park\", in chronological order representing the twenty years of \"evolution\" in their music. \u00c5kerfeldt stated, \"I can't believe it, but, fuck, we're celebrating 20 years. I've been in this band ever since I was 16. It's insane.\" A special edition of \"Blackwater Park\" was released in March 2010 to coincide with the tour.\n\"Heritage\" (2011\u20132013).\nIn September 2010, Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album. The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on 31 January 2011, at the Atlantis/Metronome studios in Stockholm, once again with Jens Bogren (engineering) and Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree as co-producer. Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011, Per Wiberg left the band. \u00c5kerfeldt said the band, \"came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this came as no surprise to Per. He had, in turn, been thinking about leaving, so you could say it was a mutual decision. There's no bad blood, just a relationship that came to an end, and that's that.\"\nOpeth's tenth album, \"Heritage\", was released on 14 September 2011, to generally favorable reviews. The album sold 19,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the \"Billboard 200\" chart. \"Heritage\" debuted at number four in the band's native country of Sweden. \"Heritage\" became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more progressive style than their previous albums, a direction that \u00c5kerfeldt was already interested in pursuing with Opeth.\nThe first two songs \u00c5kerfeldt wrote for \"Heritage\" were in the style of \"Watershed\". After hearing the songs for the first time, Mart\u00edn M\u00e9ndez told \u00c5kerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that M\u00e9ndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, \u00c5kerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for \"Heritage\", Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old. In a review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek called \"Heritage\" the band's most adventurous album, describing the songs as \"drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs\".\nOpeth supported \"Heritage\" with a tour that would last for over 200 tour dates. The tour was the band's first with new keyboardist, Joakim Svalberg, who played on the opening track of the album. During the tour, Opeth played with bands such as Katatonia, Pain of Salvation, Mastodon, Ghost and Anathema all over the world in countries such as the United States, Europe, Turkey, India, Japan, Greece, Israel, Latin America and Sweden. The tour concluded with \"Melloboat 2013\".\n\"Pale Communion\" (2014\u20132015).\nOn 26 August 2014, Opeth released its eleventh studio album, titled \"Pale Communion\". \u00c5kerfeldt began working on new material as far back as August 2012. In January 2014 he stated, \"We've been looking at [tracking the next album at] Rockfield Studios in Wales where Queen recorded \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", but we haven't made a decision yet, but it will be an expensive album. There's a lot going on, lots of string arrangements that we haven't had in the past.\" Despite fearing that the band's new musical direction would split Opeth's fanbase, when asked if it will it be heavier or softer than \"Heritage\", \u00c5kerfeldt said, \"Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, but hard rock/heavy metal heavy. There's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs.\" \u00c5kerfeldt also produced the new album which will include string instrumentation, something that he became interested in doing when working on \"Storm Corrosion\". The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating \"Heritage\" which resulted in closer relationships between them.\n\"The Guardian\" reviewed \"Pale Communion\" positively, calling it \"strange, intricate prog-metal genius\" somewhat flawed by \u00c5kerfeldt's indulgent vocal styling. The album saw Opeth's highest chart positions in the history of the band with \"Pale Communion\" debuting at number 19 in the US, number 3 in Sweden, and number 14 in the United Kingdom. It sold 13,000 copies in its first week of release in the US.\n\"Pale Communion\" was supported with more touring from Opeth. In 2015, Opeth played several concerts to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band. At these special shows, the band was doing two sets. The first set is 2005's \"Ghost Reveries\" as a ten-year anniversary celebration of the album. The second set spanned the rest of the band's career, celebrating their 25th anniversary. \u00c5kerfeldt expressed excitement for the concerts.\n\"Sorceress\", \"Garden of the Titans\" and \"In Cauda Venenum\" (2016\u20132020).\nOn 15 June 2016, Nuclear Blast Entertainment announced the signing of Opeth. Three days later, on 18 June, Opeth released a 30-second teaser for their new album, \"Sorceress\". A month later, on 18 July, the band confirmed the album would be released on 30 September, in addition to revealing the artwork and track list. Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt described it as, \"A fine little record. My favorite in our discography right now. Of course. That's how it should be, right? It's both fresh and old, both progressive and rehashed. Heavy and calm. Just the way we like it.\" The album was the first project under Moderbolaget Records, a joint venture between Opeth and Nuclear Blast. Moderbolaget means \"the parent company\" in Swedish.\nOn 25 July 2016, in the build up towards the album release, the band posted the first Sorceress: Studio Report on their YouTube channel. In the behind-the-scenes studio tour, it is confirmed that the band had returned to Rockfield Studios where they previously recorded \"Pale Communion\". At the end of the video, there is a 20-second excerpt of a track believed to be from the album featuring heavily down-tuned guitars. On 1 August 2016, the band released a lyric video for the title-track 'Sorceress' on their YouTube channel. On 5 September 2016, Opeth released a lyric video for the second single titled 'Will O the Wisp,' again through their YouTube channel and website Opeth's video for \"Era\" was nominated for \"Video of the Year\" at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards, where they ultimately won \"International Band of the Year\".\nOn 2 October 2017, \u00c5kerfeldt said he has been thinking about doing something \"twisted\" and different for the next studio album, which could be released by mid-to-late 2019. On 20 November 2017, guitarist Fredrik \u00c5kesson stated that the band will not have any gigs in the upcoming months, until the 2018 summer festivals. During this break the band will focus on writing songs for the new album. On 11 July 2018, during an interview with FaceCulture, \u00c5kesson said \"I've recorded a lot of solos so far. And Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt has almost already written 12 songs for the new album, so we have more material than enough for an album\". On 22 May 2019, the band announced their thirteenth studio album, \"In Cauda Venenum\", due for release on 27 September 2019. On 12 July 2019, Opeth released the first single from \"In Cauda Venenum\" entitled \"Heart in Hand\" in both English and Swedish.\nLineup changes and \"The Last Will and Testament\" (2021\u2013present).\nOn 16 November 2021, it was announced that longtime drummer Martin Axenrot had left the band due to conflict of interests and his refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and was replaced by Sami Karppinen for the North American tour. On 9 September 2022, it was announced Waltteri V\u00e4yrynen (formerly of Paradise Lost and Alexi Laiho's project Bodom After Midnight) was the band's new drummer.\nOn 1 August 2024, Opeth announced that their fourteenth studio album \"The Last Will and Testament\" would be released on 11 October, although the date was postponed to 22 November due to manufacturing delays. With the return of growl vocals after 16 years, last appearing on the album \"Watershed\", the album received positive feedback from many fans and music critics. It was also the band's first fully conceptual record since \"Still Life\" in 1999.\nMusical style and influences.\nAs Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. \u00c5kerfeldt considers Judas Priest's \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, \u00c5kerfeldt frequently sings \"Here Come the Tears\" from Judas Priest's third album \"Sin After Sin\" (1977). \u00c5kerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band. Jazz fusion was also an influence for Opeth, with Mahavishnu Orchestra, Billy Cobham, Alphonse Mouzon and Herbie Hancock's Head Hunters singled out in particular.\nOpeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \"epic, progressive death metal style\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album \"Blackwater Park\", AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies\u2014any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\" \u00c5kerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music:\nI don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.\nMore recently, Opeth have abandoned their death metal sound resulting in a mellower progressive rock sound. When talking about \"Heritage\", guitarist Fredrik \u00c5kesson stated:\nIn the beginning it took me a little while to get used to the new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done \"Heritage\". I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think \"Heritage\" is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.\nVocally, \u00c5kerfeldt shifts between traditional death metal vocals for heavy sections, and clean, sometimes whispered or soft-spoken vocals over mellower passages. While his death growls were dominant on early releases, later efforts incorporate more clean vocals, with \"Damnation\", \"Heritage\", \"Pale Communion\", \"Sorceress\" and \"In Cauda Venenum\" featuring only clean singing. Rivadavia noted that \"\u00c5kerfeldt's vocals run the gamut from bowel-churning grunts to melodies of chilling beauty\u2014depending on each movement section's mood.\"\nLegacy.\nA number of artists and bands have cited Opeth as an influence, among which are Mayan (a project of Mark Jansen from Epica), Luc Lemay of Gorguts, Soen (a band of former Opeth drummer Martin Lopez), Tor Oddmund Suhrke of Leprous, Disillusion, Caligula's Horse, Klimt 1918, Daniel Droste of Ahab, Becoming the Archetype, Nucleus Torn, Alex Vynogradoff of Kauan, Wastefall, Eric Guenther of The Contortionist, Thomas MacLean and To-Mera, The Man-Eating Tree, Nahemah, Vladimir Agafonkin of Obiymy Doshchu, Schizoid Lloyd, Native Construct, Maxime C\u00f4t\u00e9 of Catuvolcus, Bilocate, and Jinjer.\nIn addition, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for their work including Steven Wilson, Seven Lions, John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy, Ihsahn, Simone Simons of Epica, Oliver Palotai of Kamelot, Jim Matheos of Fates Warning, and Haken.\nBand members.\nCurrent\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45852", "revid": "8019410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45852", "title": "Charles Ponzi", "text": "Italian businessman and con artist (1882\u20131949)\nCharles Ponzi (; ; born Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo Ponzi; March 3, 1882 \u2013 January 18, 1949) was an Italian charlatan and con artist who operated in the United States and Canada. His aliases included \"Charles Ponci\", \"Carlo\", Benny Broncko and \"Charles P. Bianchi\".\nBorn in Lugo, Italy, he became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the U.S. as a form of arbitrage. In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a \"Ponzi scheme\". His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his \"investors\" $20 million.\nPonzi may have been inspired by the scheme of William W. Miller (also known as \"520% Miller\"), a Brooklyn bookkeeper who in 1899 used a similar deception to take in $1 million (approximately $ in 2024).\nEarly life.\nCharles Ponzi was born in Lugo, Emilia-Romagna, Kingdom of Italy on March 3, 1882. He told \"The New York Times\" he had come from a family in Parma. Ponzi's ancestors had been well-to-do, and his mother continued to use the title \"donna\", but the family had subsequently fallen upon difficult times and had little money. Ponzi took a job as a postal worker early on, but soon was accepted into the University of Rome La Sapienza. His richer friends considered the university a \"four-year vacation\", and he was inclined to follow them around to bars, caf\u00e9s, and the opera. This resulted in Ponzi spending all his money, and four years later he was broke and without a degree. During this time, a number of Italian boys were migrating to the U.S. and returning to Italy as wealthy individuals. Ponzi's family encouraged him to do the same, with the intention of returning his family to its former socio-economic status.\nArrival in the United States.\nOn November 15, 1903, Ponzi arrived in Boston aboard the S.S. \"Vancouver\". By his own account, Ponzi had $2.50 in his pocket (), having gambled away the rest of his life savings during the voyage. \"I landed in this country with $2.50 in cash and $1 million in hopes, and those hopes never left me,\" he later told a reporter for \"The New York Times\". He quickly learned English and spent the next few years doing odd jobs along the East Coast, eventually taking a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant, where he slept on the floor. Ponzi managed to work his way up to the position of waiter, but was fired for theft and shortchanging customers.\nMontreal and prison.\nIn 1907, after several years of failing to achieve success in the U.S., Ponzi moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and became an assistant teller in the newly opened Banco Zarossi, a bank located on Saint Jacques Street started by Luigi \"Louis\" Zarossi to service the influx of Italian immigrants arriving in the city. By this time, Ponzi had a winning personality and spoke English and French, as well as Italian, which Zuckoff says helped him get the job at the bank. While working there, Ponzi first saw the scheme of \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\", which later would be called a Ponzi scheme. Zarossi paid 6 percent interest on bank deposits\u2014double the going rate at the time\u2014and his bank was growing rapidly as a result. Ponzi eventually rose to the position of bank manager. However, he found out that the bank was in serious financial trouble, because of bad real estate loans, and that Zarossi was funding the high interest payments not through profit on investments, but by using money deposited in newly opened accounts. The bank eventually failed, and Zarossi fled to Mexico with a large portion of the money belonging to the bank's customers.\nPonzi stayed in Montreal and, for some time, lived at Zarossi's house, helping the man's abandoned family while planning to return to the U.S. and start over. As Ponzi was penniless, this proved to be very difficult. Eventually, he walked into the offices of a former Zarossi customer, Canadian Warehousing, and finding no one there, wrote himself a check for $423.58 in a checkbook he found, forging the signature of Damien Fournier, a director of the company. Confronted by police who had taken note of his large expenditures just after the forged check was cashed, Ponzi held out his wrist and said, \"I'm guilty\". He ended up spending three years as Inmate #6660 at St. Vincent-de-Paul Federal Penitentiary, a bleak facility located on the outskirts of Montreal. Rather than inform his mother of his imprisonment, he posted her a letter stating that he had found a job as a \"special assistant\" to a prison warden.\nAfter his release in 1911, Ponzi decided to return to the U.S., but became involved in a scheme to smuggle Italian illegal immigrants across the border. He was caught and spent two years in Atlanta Prison. Here he became a translator for the warden, who was intercepting letters from mobster Ignazio \"the Wolf\" Lupo. Ponzi ended up befriending Lupo. Another prisoner, Charles W. Morse, became a true role model to Ponzi. Morse, a wealthy Wall Street businessman and speculator, fooled doctors during medical exams by eating soap shavings to give the appearance of ill-health. Morse was soon released from prison. Ponzi completed his prison term following Morse's release, having an additional month added to his term due to his inability to pay a $50 fine.\nWork in a mining camp and in Boston.\nAfter Ponzi's release from prison, he made his way back to Boston. While working at a mining camp as a nurse, he came up with the idea of going to another mining camp, starting a utility there that would supply water and power, and selling its stock. During this time, a fellow nurse called Pearl Gosid had suffered severe burns in an accident. Despite not knowing her, Ponzi volunteered for two major operations to donate of skin from his back and legs to Pearl. This resulted in pleurisy and similar complications, and Ponzi's losing his job.\nThereafter Ponzi continued to travel around looking for work, and in Boston, he met Rose Maria Gnecco, a stenographer, to whom he proposed marriage. Gnecco came from a family of Italian-American immigrants who had a small fruit stall in downtown Boston. Though Ponzi did not tell Gnecco about his years in jail, his mother sent Gnecco a letter telling her of Ponzi's past. Nonetheless, she married him in 1918. For the next few months, Ponzi worked at a number of businesses, including his father-in-law's grocery, and the import-export company JR Poole before hitting upon an idea to sell advertising in a large business listing to be sent to various businesses. He was unable to sell this idea to businesses, and his company failed soon after. Ponzi took over his wife's family's fledgling fruit company for a short time, but to no avail, and it, too, failed shortly thereafter.\nOrigin of the term \"Ponzi scheme\" and IRC scheme.\nAn idea to trade IRCs.\nPonzi set up a small office at 27 School Street, Boston, in the summer of 1919 attempting to sell business ideas to contacts in Europe. He received a letter from a company in Spain asking about the advertising catalog which included an international reply coupon (IRC), leading Ponzi to find a weakness in the system which, at least in principle, gave him an opportunity to make money.\nPostal reply coupons allowed a person in one country to pay for the postage of a reply to a correspondent in another country. IRCs were priced at the cost of postage in the country of purchase, but could be exchanged for stamps to cover the cost of postage in the country where redeemed; if these values were different, there was a potential profit. Inflation after World War I had greatly decreased the cost of postage in Italy expressed in U.S. dollars, so that an IRC could be bought cheaply in Italy and exchanged for U.S. stamps of higher value, which could then be sold. Ponzi claimed that the net profit on these transactions, after expenses and exchange rates, was in excess of 400%. This was a form of arbitrage, or profiting by buying an asset at a lower price in one market and immediately selling it in a market where the price is higher, which is legal.\nSeeing an opportunity, Ponzi quit his job as a translator to execute his IRC scheme, but needed a large capital expense to buy IRCs at lower performing European currencies. He first tried to borrow money from several banks, including the Hanover Trust Company, but they were not convinced, and its manager, Henry H. Chmielinski, refused to lend him money.\nSubsequently, Ponzi set up a stock company to raise money from the public. He also went to several of his friends in Boston and promised that he would double their investment in 90 days, in an environment when banks were paying only 5% annual interest. The great returns from postal reply coupons, he explained to them, made such incredible profits easy to accomplish. Some people invested and were paid as promised, receiving $750 in interest on initial investments of $1,250.\nSecurities Exchange Company.\nIn January 1920, Ponzi started his own company, the \"Securities Exchange Company\", to promote the scheme. In the first month, 18 people invested in his company with a total of $1,800. He paid them promptly, the very next month, with money obtained from a newer set of investors.\nPonzi set up a larger office, this time in the Niles Building on School Street. Word spread, and investments increased rapidly. Ponzi hired agents and paid them generous commissions. Between February and March 1920, the total amount invested had risen from $5,000 to $25,000 ($ to $ in 2024, respectively). As the scheme grew, Ponzi hired agents to seek out new investors in New England and New Jersey. At that time, investors were being paid impressive rates, which subsequently encouraged others to invest. By May 1920, he had made $420,000 (). By June 1920, people had invested $2.5 million in Ponzi's scheme (). By July, he was approaching a million dollars per day.\nPonzi began depositing the money in the Hanover Trust Bank of Boston (a small bank on Hanover Street in the mostly Italian North End), in the hope that once his account was large enough he could impose his will on the bank or even be made its president; he bought a controlling interest in the bank through himself and several friends after depositing $3 million. By July 1920, Ponzi had made millions. Some of his investors had been mortgaging their homes and investing their life savings. Most did not take their profits but reinvested. Ponzi's company, meanwhile, had set up branches from Maine to New Jersey.\nEven though Ponzi's company was bringing in fantastic sums of money each day, the simplest financial analysis would have shown that the operation was running at a large loss. As long as money kept flowing in, existing investors could be paid with the new money. This was the only method Ponzi had to continue providing returns to existing investors, as he made no effort to generate legitimate profits.\nPonzi's initial investors consisted of working-class immigrants like himself. Gradually, news travelled upwards, and many well-to-do Boston Brahmins also invested in his scheme. In its heyday, nearly 75% of Boston's police force had invested in the scheme. Ponzi's investors even included those closest to him, like his chauffeur John Collins and his own brother-in-law. Ponzi was indiscriminate about whom he allowed to invest, from young newspaper boys investing a few dollars to high-net-worth individuals, like a banker from Lawrence, Kansas, who invested $10,000. \nInfeasibility of Ponzi's scheme.\nThough Ponzi was still paying back investors, mostly from money from subsequent investors, he had not yet figured out a way to actually change the IRCs to cash. He also subsequently realized that changing the coupons to money was logistically impossible. For example: for the initial 18 investors of January 1920, for their $1,800 investment, it would have taken 53,000 postal coupons to actually realize the arbitrage profits. For the subsequent 15,000 investors that Ponzi had, he would have had to fill \"Titanic\"-sized ships with postal coupons just to ship them to the U.S. from Europe. However, Ponzi found that all the interest payments returned to him, as investors continued to re-invest.\nPonzi's subsequent lifestyle.\nPonzi lived luxuriously: he bought a mansion in Lexington, Massachusetts, and maintained accounts in several banks across New England besides Hanover Trust. He bought a Locomobile, the finest car of that time. He had initially purchased two first-class tickets to Italy for a delayed honeymoon with Rose but instead decided to change them to bring his mother from Italy to the U.S. in a first-class stateroom on an ocean liner. She lived with Ponzi and Rose for some time in Lexington, but died soon after. On July 31, 1920, Ponzi told Father Pasquale Di Milla, the director of the Italian Children's Home in Jamaica Plain, that he would donate $100,000 in honor of his mother. Ponzi also bought a macaroni company and part of a wine company in an attempt to gain profits that could be used to repay the investors of his IRC scheme.\nSuspicion.\nPonzi's rapid rise naturally drew suspicion. When a Boston financial writer suggested there was no way Ponzi could legally deliver such high returns in a short period of time, Ponzi sued for libel and won $500,000 in damages. As libel law at the time placed the burden of proof on the writer and publisher, this effectively neutralized any serious probes into his dealings for some time.\nNonetheless, there were still signs of his eventual ruin. Joseph Daniels, a Boston furniture dealer who had given Ponzi furniture which he could not afford to pay for, sued Ponzi to cash in on the gold rush. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, but it did prompt people to begin asking how Ponzi could have gone from being penniless to being a millionaire in a short span of time. There was a run on the Securities Exchange Company, as some investors decided to pull out. Ponzi paid them and the run stopped.\nOn July 24, 1920, \"The Boston Post\" printed a favorable article on Ponzi and his scheme that brought in investors faster than ever. At that time, Ponzi was making $250,000 a day. Ponzi's good fortune was increased by the fact that just below this favorable article, which seemed to imply that Ponzi was indeed returning 50% return on an investment after only 45 days, was a bank advertisement that stated that the bank was paying 5% returns annually. The next business day after this article was published, Ponzi arrived at his office to find thousands of Bostonians waiting to give him their money.\nDespite this reprieve, \"Post\" acting publisher Richard Grozier (who was running the paper in the absence of his father Edwin, its owner and publisher) and city editor Eddie Dunn were suspicious and assigned investigative reporters to look into Ponzi. He was also under investigation by Massachusetts authorities, and, on the day the \"Post\" printed its article, Ponzi met with state officials. He managed to divert the officials from checking his books by offering to stop taking money during the investigation, a fortunate choice, as proper records were not being kept. Ponzi's offer temporarily calmed the suspicions of the state officials.\nCollapse of the scheme.\nOn July 26, the \"Post\" started a series of articles that asked hard questions about the operation of Ponzi's money machine. The paper contacted Clarence Barron, the financial journalist who headed Dow Jones &amp; Company, to examine Ponzi's scheme. Barron observed that though Ponzi was offering fantastic returns on investments, Ponzi himself was not investing with his own company.\nBarron then noted that to cover the investments made with the Securities Exchange Company, 160 million postal reply coupons would have to be in circulation. However, only about 27,000 actually were in circulation. The United States Post Office stated that postal reply coupons were not being bought in quantity at home or abroad. Despite the substantial gross profit margin in percent on buying and selling each IRC was colossal, the overhead required to handle the purchase and redemption of these items, which were of extremely low cost and were sold individually, would have exceeded the gross profit (see #Infeasibility of Ponzi's scheme). Barron added that even if Ponzi really was doing what he claimed to do, it would be immoral to invest with him since he would effectively be profiting at the expense of a government\u2014either the governments where he bought the coupons or the U.S. government.\nThe \"Post\" articles caused a panic run on the Securities Exchange Company. Ponzi paid out $2 million in three days to a wild crowd outside his office. He canvassed the crowd, passed out coffee and doughnuts, and cheerfully told them they had nothing to worry about. Many changed their minds and left their money with him. However, this attracted the attention of Daniel Gallagher, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. Gallagher commissioned Edwin Pride to audit the Securities Exchange Company's books\u2014an effort made difficult by the fact Ponzi's bookkeeping system consisted merely of index cards with investors' names.\nIn the meantime, Ponzi had hired a publicist, William McMasters. However, McMasters quickly became suspicious of Ponzi's endless talk of postal reply coupons, as well as the ongoing investigation against him. He later described Ponzi as a \"financial idiot\" who did not seem to know how to add. The investigation into Ponzi began in late July, when McMasters found several highly incriminating documents that indicated Ponzi was merely \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\". McMasters went to Grozier, his former employer, with this information. Grozier offered him $5,000 for his story, which was printed in the \"Post\" on August 2, 1920. McMaster's article declared Ponzi hopelessly insolvent, reporting that while he claimed $7 million in liquid funds, he was actually at least $2 million in debt. With interest factored in, McMasters wrote, Ponzi was as much as $4.5 million in the red. The story touched off a massive run, and Ponzi paid off in one day. He then sped up plans to build a massive conglomerate that would engage in banking and import/export operations.\nAt this point, further trouble came from an unexpected quarter. Massachusetts Bank Commissioner Joseph Allen became concerned that if major withdrawals exhausted Ponzi's reserves, it would bring Boston's banking system to its knees. Allen's suspicions were further aroused when he found out a large number of Ponzi-controlled accounts had received more than $250,000 in loans from Hanover Trust. This led Allen to speculate that Ponzi was not nearly as well-financed as he claimed, since he was getting large loans from the bank he effectively controlled. He ordered two bank examiners to keep an eye on Ponzi's accounts.\nOn August 9, the bank examiners reported that enough investors had cashed their checks on Ponzi's main account there that it was severely overdrawn. Allen then ordered Hanover Trust not to pay out any more checks from Ponzi's main account. He also orchestrated an involuntary bankruptcy filing by several small Ponzi investors. The move forced Massachusetts Attorney General J. Weston Allen to release a statement that there was little to support Ponzi's claims of large-scale dealings in postal coupons. State officials then invited Ponzi noteholders to come to the Massachusetts State House to furnish their names and addresses for the purpose of the investigation. On the same day, Ponzi received a preview of Pride's audit, which revealed Ponzi was at least $7 million in debt.\nOn August 11, the \"Post\" published with a front-page story about his criminal activities in Montreal 13 years earlier, including his forgery conviction and his role at Zarossi's scandal-ridden bank. That afternoon, Bank Commissioner Allen seized Hanover Trust due to numerous irregularities. The commissioner thus inadvertently foiled Ponzi's plan to borrow funds from the bank vaults as a last resort in the event all other efforts to obtain funds failed. The following day, Ponzi's certificate of deposit at Hanover Trust, which had been worth $1.5 million, was reduced to $1 million after bank officials tapped into it to cover the overdraft. Even if he had been able to convert it into cash, he would have had only $4 million in assets.\nAmid reports that he was about to be arrested any day, Ponzi surrendered to federal authorities and accepted Pride's figures. He was charged with mail fraud for sending letters to his marks telling them their notes had matured. He was originally released on $25,000 bail and was immediately re-arrested on state charges of larceny, for which he posted an additional $10,000 bond. After the \"Post\" released the results of the audit, the bail bondsman feared Ponzi might flee the country and withdrew the bail for the federal charges, sending Ponzi back to prison. Attorney General Allen declared that if Ponzi managed to regain his freedom, the state would seek additional charges and seek a bail high enough to ensure Ponzi would stay in custody.\nMagnitude of losses.\nThe news brought down five other banks in addition to Hanover Trust. Ponzi's investors were practically wiped out, receiving less than 30 cents to the dollar. They lost about $20 million in 1920 dollars (approximately $ million in 2024 dollars). By comparison, Bernie Madoff's similar scheme that collapsed in 2008 cost his investors about $18 billion, 53 times the losses of Ponzi's scheme.\nPrison and later life.\nIn two federal indictments, Ponzi was charged with 86 counts of mail fraud and faced life imprisonment. At the urging of his wife, Ponzi pleaded guilty on November 1, 1920, to a single count before Judge Clarence Hale, who declared before sentencing, \"Here was a man with all the duties of seeking large money. He concocted a scheme which, on his counsel's admission, did defraud men and women. It will not do to have the world understand that such a scheme as that can be carried out\u00a0... without receiving substantial punishment.\" Ponzi was sentenced to five years in federal prison.\nMassachusetts.\nPonzi was released after three-and-a-half years and was almost immediately indicted on 22 state charges of larceny, which came as a surprise to Ponzi; he thought he had a deal calling for the state to drop any charges against him if he pleaded guilty to the federal charges. He sued, claiming that he would be facing double jeopardy if Massachusetts essentially retried him for the same offenses spelled out in the federal indictment. The case, \"Ponzi v. Fessenden\", made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On March 27, 1922, the Supreme Court ruled that federal plea bargains have no standing regarding state charges. It also ruled that Ponzi was not facing double jeopardy because Massachusetts was charging him with larceny while the federal government charged him with mail fraud, even though the charges implicated the same criminal operation.\nIn October 1922, Ponzi was tried on the first 10 larceny counts. Since he was insolvent, Ponzi served as his own attorney and, speaking as persuasively as he had with his duped investors, was acquitted by the jury on all charges. He was tried a second time on five of the remaining charges, and the jury deadlocked. Ponzi was found guilty at a third trial, and was sentenced to an additional seven to nine years in prison as \"a common and notorious thief\". There were efforts to have him deported as an undesirable alien in 1922.\nFlorida.\nIn September 1925, Ponzi was released on bail as he appealed the state conviction. He fled to the Springfield neighborhood of Jacksonville, Florida, and launched the Charpon Land Syndicate (\"Charpon\" is an amalgamation of his name), seeking to capitalize on the Florida land boom. He offered investors tiny tracts of land, some underwater, and promised 200% returns in 60 days. In reality, it was a scam that sold swampland in Columbia County. Ponzi was indicted by a Duval County grand jury in February 1926 and charged with violating Florida trust and securities laws. A jury found him guilty on the securities charges, and the judge sentenced him to a year in the Florida State Prison. Ponzi appealed his conviction and was freed after posting a $1,500 bond.\nPonzi traveled to Tampa, where he shaved his head, grew a mustache, and tried to flee the country as a crewman on a merchant ship bound for Italy. However, he revealed his identity to a shipmate. Word spread to a deputy sheriff, who followed the ship to its last American port of call in New Orleans and placed Ponzi under arrest. After Ponzi's pleas to Calvin Coolidge and Benito Mussolini for deportation were ignored, he was sent back to Massachusetts to serve out his prison term. Ponzi served seven more years in prison.\nIn the meantime, government investigators tried to trace Ponzi's convoluted accounts to figure out how much money he had taken and where it had gone. They never managed to untangle it and could only conclude that millions of dollars had gone through his hands.\nItaly.\nPonzi was released in 1934. With the release came an immediate order to have him deported to Italy. He asked for a full pardon from Massachusetts Governor Joseph B. Ely. However, on July 13, Ely turned the appeal down. Ponzi's charismatic confidence had faded, and when he left the prison gates, he was met by an angry crowd. He told reporters before he left, \"I went looking for trouble, and I found it.\" On October 7, Ponzi was officially deported.\nRose stayed in the U.S. and divorced Ponzi in 1937. She had not wanted to leave Boston, and Ponzi was in no position to support her in any event.\nIn Italy, Ponzi jumped from scheme to scheme, but little came of them. He eventually got a job in Brazil as an agent for Ala Littoria, the Italian state airline. During World War II, however, the airline's operation in the country was shut down after the British intelligence services intervened and Brazil sided with the Allies. During that time, Ponzi also wrote his autobiography.\nDeath.\nPonzi spent the last years of his life in poverty, working occasionally as a translator. His health deteriorated and in 1941 a heart attack left him considerably weakened. His eyesight began failing, and by 1948 he was almost completely blind. A brain hemorrhage paralyzed his left leg and arm. Ponzi died in a charity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, the Hospital S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, on January 18, 1949.\nSupported by his last and only friend, Francisco Nonato Nunes, a barber who spoke English and had notions of Italian, Ponzi granted one last interview to an American reporter, telling him, \"Even if they never got anything for it, it was cheap at that price. Without malice aforethought, I had given them the best show that was ever staged in their territory since the landing of the Pilgrims! It was easily worth fifteen million bucks to watch me put the thing over.\"\nIn popular culture.\nJake Epstein portrays Ponzi in \"Home for the Holidays\", the third stand-alone Christmas special of the Canadian television period detective series \"Murdoch Mysteries\".\nIn 2016, Ponzi's international postal coupon scheme was a target of investigation by \"White Rabbit Project\" host Tory Belleci in the fourth episode, claiming first place for the episode among five other contenders due to its originality and amount gotten away with in modern currency, despite its short duration of eight months.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best-known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance.\nAfter the ruling House of Medici died out, their art collections were given to the city of Florence under the famous \"Patto di famiglia\" (\"family pact\") negotiated by Anna Maria Luisa, the last Medici heiress. The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1769 it was officially opened to the public, formally becoming a museum in 1865.\nHistory.\nThe building of the Uffizi complex was begun by Giorgio Vasari in 1560 for Cosimo I de' Medici as a means to consolidate his administrative control of the various committees, agencies, and guilds established in Florence's Republican past so as to accommodate them all in one place, hence the name , \"offices\". The construction was later continued by Alfonso Parigi and Bernardo Buontalenti; it was completed in 1581. The top floor was made into a gallery for the family and their guests and included their collection of Roman sculptures.\nThe \"cortile\" (internal courtyard) is so long, narrow, and open to the Arno at its far end through a Doric screen that articulates the space without blocking it, that architectural historians treat it as the first regularized streetscape of Europe. Vasari, a painter, and architect as well, emphasized its perspective length by adorning it with the matching facades' continuous roof cornices, and unbroken cornices between storeys, as well as the three continuous steps on which the museum fronts stand. The niches in the piers that alternate with columns of the Loggiato were filled with sculptures of famous artists in the 19th century.\nThe Uffizi brought together under one roof the administrative offices and the Archivio di Stato, the state archive. The project was intended to display prime artworks of the Medici collections on the piano nobile; the plan was carried out by his son, Grand Duke Francesco I. He commissioned the architect Buontalenti to design the Tribuna degli Uffizi that would display a series of masterpieces in one room, including jewels; it became a highly influential attraction of a Grand Tour. The octagonal room was completed in 1584.\nOver the years, more sections of the building were recruited to exhibit paintings and sculptures collected or commissioned by the Medici. For many years, 45 to 50 rooms were used to display paintings from the 13th to 18th century.\nModern times.\nBecause of its vast collection, some of the Uffizi's works have in the past been transferred to other museums in Florence\u2014for example, some famous statues to the Bargello. A project was finished in 2006 to expand the museum's exhibition space some 6,000 metres2 (64,000\u00a0ft2) to almost 13,000 metres2 (139,000\u00a0ft2), allowing public viewing of many artworks that had usually been in storage.\nThe Nuovi Uffizi (New Uffizi) renovation project which started in 1989 was progressing well from 2015 to 2017. It was intended to modernize all of the halls and more than double the display space. A new exit was also planned and the lighting, air conditioning and security systems were updated. During construction, the museum remained open, although rooms were closed as necessary with the artwork temporarily moved to another location. For example, the Botticelli rooms and two others with early Renaissance paintings were closed for 15 months but reopened in October 2016.\nOver two million people visited the Uffizi in 2016, making it the most visited art gallery in Italy. At peak periods (particularly in July), waiting times for entry can be up to five hours. Advance tickets can be bought online, to significantly reduce the waiting time. In 2018 a revised ticketing system was introduced to reduce queuing times to just minutes.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum was closed for 150 days in 2020, and attendance plunged by 72 percent to 659,043. Nonetheless the Uffizi was 27th in the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2020. Works from the Uffizi gallery collection are now available for remote viewing on Google Arts and Culture. The museum reopened in May 2021 following a renovation that included an addition of 14 new rooms and a display of additional 129 artworks, with the museum attempting to give more voice to historically under-represented groups including women and people of color.\nIncidents.\nOn 27 May 1993, the Sicilian Mafia carried out a car bomb explosion in Via dei Georgofili which damaged parts of the palace and killed five people. The blast destroyed five pieces of art and damaged another 30. Some of the paintings were fully protected by bulletproof glass. The most severe damage was to the Niobe room and classical sculptures and neoclassical interior, which have since been restored, although its frescoes were damaged beyond repair.\nOn 22 July 2022, members of the climate activist group Ultima Generazione (Last Generation) glued themselves to the glass protecting Sandro Botticelli's \"Primavera\" demanding an end to fossil fuel usage. The painting was undamaged.\nOn 13 February 2024, members of Ultima Generazione glued images of flooding in Tuscany in 2023 to the glass protecting Sandro Botticelli's \"Birth of Venus\" in protest over the Italian government's inaction on climate change. The painting was undamaged and the images were removed.\nKey works.\nThe collection also contains some ancient sculptures, such as the \"Arrotino\", the \"Two Wrestlers\", \"Venus de' Medici\", and the \"Bust of Severus Giovanni\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
