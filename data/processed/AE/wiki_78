In other words, clathrate hydrates are clathrate compounds in which the host molecule is water and the guest molecule is typically a gas or liquid. Without the support of the trapped molecules, the lattice structure of hydrate clathrates would collapse into conventional ice crystal structure or liquid water. Most low molecular weight gases, including , , , , , , , , , and as well as some higher hydrocarbons and freons, will form hydrates at suitable temperatures and pressures. Clathrate hydrates are not officially chemical compounds, as the enclathrated guest molecules are never bonded to the lattice. The formation and decomposition of clathrate hydrates are first order phase transitions, not chemical reactions. Their detailed formation and decomposition mechanisms on a molecular level are still not well understood.\nClathrate hydrates were first documented in 1810 by Sir Humphry Davy who found that water was a primary component of what was earlier thought to be solidified chlorine.\nClathrates have been found to occur naturally in large quantities. Around 6.4 trillion () tonnes of methane is trapped in deposits of methane clathrate on the deep ocean floor. Such deposits can be found on the Norwegian continental shelf in the northern headwall flank of the Storegga Slide. Clathrates can also exist as permafrost, as at the Mallik gas hydrate site in the Mackenzie Delta of northwestern Canadian Arctic. These natural gas hydrates are seen as a potentially vast energy resource and several countries have dedicated national programs to develop this energy resource. Clathrate hydrate has also been of great interest as technology enabler for many applications like seawater desalination, gas storage, carbon dioxide capture &amp; storage, cooling medium for data centre and district cooling etc. Hydrocarbon clathrates cause problems for the petroleum industry, because they can form inside gas pipelines, often resulting in obstructions. Deep sea deposition of carbon dioxide clathrate has been proposed as a method to remove this greenhouse gas from the atmosphere and control climate change. Clathrates are suspected to occur in large quantities on some outer planets, moons and trans-Neptunian objects, binding gas at fairly high temperatures.\nHistory and etymology.\nClathrate hydrates were discovered in 1810 by Humphry Davy. Clathrates were studied by P. Pfeiffer in 1927 and in 1930, E. Hertel defined \"molecular compounds\" as substances decomposed into individual components following the mass action law in solution or gas state. Clathrate hydrates were discovered to form blockages in gas pipelines in 1934 by Hammerschmidt that led to increase in research to avoid hydrate formation. In 1945, H. M. Powell analyzed the crystal structure of these compounds and named them \"clathrates\". Gas production through methane hydrates has since been realized and has been tested for energy production in Japan and China.\nThe word \"clathrate\" is derived from the Latin (), meaning 'with bars, latticed'.\nStructure.\nGas hydrates usually form two crystallographic cubic structures: structure (Type) I (named \"sI\") and structure (Type) II (named \"sII\") of space groups formula_1 and formula_2 respectively. A third hexagonal structure of space group formula_3 may also be observed (Type H).\nThe unit cell of Type I consists of 46 water molecules, forming two types of cages \u2013 small and large. The unit cell contains two small cages and six large ones. The small cage has the shape of a pentagonal dodecahedron (512) (which is not a regular dodecahedron) and the large one that of a tetradecahedron, specifically a hexagonal truncated trapezohedron (51262). Together, they form a version of the Weaire\u2013Phelan structure. Typical guests forming Type I hydrates are CO2 in carbon dioxide clathrate and CH4 in methane clathrate.\nThe unit cell of Type II consists of 136 water molecules, again forming two types of cages \u2013 small and large. In this case there are sixteen small cages and eight large ones in the unit cell. The small cage again has the shape of a pentagonal dodecahedron (512), but the large one is a hexadecahedron (51264). Type II hydrates are formed by gases like O2 and N2.\nThe unit cell of Type H consists of 34 water molecules, forming three types of cages \u2013 two small ones of different types, and one \"huge\". In this case, the unit cell consists of three small cages of type 512, two small ones of type 435663 and one huge of type 51268. The formation of Type H requires the cooperation of two guest gases (large and small) to be stable. It is the large cavity that allows structure H hydrates to fit in large molecules (e.g. butane, hydrocarbons), given the presence of other smaller help gases to fill and support the remaining cavities. Structure H hydrates were suggested to exist in the Gulf of Mexico. Thermogenically produced supplies of heavy hydrocarbons are common there.\nThe molar fraction of water of most clathrate hydrates is 85%. Clathrate hydrates are derived from organic hydrogen-bonded frameworks. These frameworks are prepared from molecules that \"self-associate\" by multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions. Small molecules or gases (i.e. methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen) can be encaged as a guest in hydrates. The ideal guest/host ratio for clathrate hydrates range from 0.8 to 0.9. The guest interaction with the host is limited to van der Waals forces. Certain exceptions exist in \"semiclathrates\" where guests incorporate into the host structure via hydrogen bonding with the host structure. Hydrates form often with partial guest filling and collapse in the absence of guests occupying the water cages. Like ice, clathrate hydrates are stable at low temperatures and high pressure and possess similar properties like electrical resistivity. Clathrate hydrates are naturally occurring and can be found in the permafrost and oceanic sediments. Hydrates can also be synthesized through seed crystallization or using amorphous precursors for nucleation.\nClathrates have been explored for many applications including: gas storage, gas production, gas separation, desalination, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and batteries.\nHydrates on Earth.\nNatural gas hydrates.\nNaturally on Earth gas hydrates can be found on the seabed, in ocean sediments, in deep lake sediments (e.g. Lake Baikal), as well as in the permafrost regions. The amount of methane potentially trapped in natural methane hydrate deposits may be significant (1015 to 1017 cubic metres), which makes them of major interest as a potential energy resource. Catastrophic release of methane from the decomposition of such deposits may lead to a global climate change, referred to as the \"clathrate gun hypothesis\", because CH4 is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 (see Atmospheric methane). The fast decomposition of such deposits is considered a geohazard, due to its potential to trigger landslides, earthquakes and tsunamis. However, natural gas hydrates do not contain only methane but also other hydrocarbon gases, as well as H2S and CO2. Air hydrates are frequently observed in polar ice samples.\nPingos are common structures in permafrost regions. Similar structures are found in deep water related to methane vents. Significantly, gas hydrates can even be formed in the absence of a liquid phase. Under that situation, water is dissolved in gas or in liquid hydrocarbon phase.\nIn 2017, both Japan and China announced that attempts at large-scale resource extraction of methane hydrates from under the seafloor were successful. However, commercial-scale production remains years away.\nThe 2020 Research Fronts report identified gas hydrate accumulation and mining technology as one of the top 10 research fronts in the geosciences.\nGas hydrates in pipelines.\nThermodynamic conditions favouring hydrate formation are often found in pipelines. This is highly undesirable, because the clathrate crystals might agglomerate and plug the line and cause flow assurance failure and damage valves and instrumentation. The results can range from flow reduction to equipment damage.\nHydrate formation, prevention and mitigation philosophy.\nHydrates have a strong tendency to agglomerate and to adhere to the pipe wall and thereby plug the pipeline. Once formed, they can be decomposed by increasing the temperature and/or decreasing the pressure. Even under these conditions, the clathrate dissociation is a slow process.\nTherefore, preventing hydrate formation appears to be the key to the problem. A hydrate prevention philosophy could typically be based on three levels of security, listed in order of priority:\nThe actual philosophy would depend on operational circumstances such as pressure, temperature, type of flow (gas, liquid, presences of water etc.).\nHydrate inhibitors.\nWhen operating within a set of parameters where hydrates could be formed, there are still ways to avoid their formation. Altering the gas composition by adding chemicals can lower the hydrate formation temperature and/or delay their formation. Two options generally exist:\nThe most common thermodynamic inhibitors are methanol, monoethylene glycol (MEG), and diethylene glycol (DEG), commonly referred to as glycol. All may be recovered and recirculated, but the economics of methanol recovery is not favourable in most cases. MEG is preferred over DEG for applications where the temperature is expected to be \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C or lower due to high viscosity at low temperatures. Triethylene glycol (TEG) has too low vapour pressure to be suited as an inhibitor injected into a gas stream. More methanol is lost in the gas phase when compared to MEG or DEG.\nThe use of kinetic inhibitors and anti-agglomerants in actual field operations is a new and evolving technology. It requires extensive tests and optimisation to the actual system. While kinetic inhibitors work by slowing down the kinetics of the nucleation, anti-agglomerants do not stop the nucleation, but stop the agglomeration (sticking together) of gas hydrate crystals. These two kinds of inhibitors are also known as low dosage hydrate inhibitors, because they require much smaller concentrations than the conventional thermodynamic inhibitors. Kinetic inhibitors, which do not require water and hydrocarbon mixture to be effective, are usually polymers or copolymers and anti-agglomerants (requires water and hydrocarbon mixture) are polymers or zwitterionic\u00a0\u2013 usually ammonium and COOH\u00a0\u2013 surfactants being both attracted to hydrates and hydrocarbons.\nEmpty clathrate hydrates.\nEmpty clathrate hydrates are thermodynamically unstable (guest molecules are of paramount importance to stabilize these structures) with respect to ice, and as such their study using experimental techniques is greatly limited to very specific formation conditions; however, their mechanical stability renders theoretical and computer simulation methods the ideal choice to address their thermodynamic properties. Starting from very cold samples (110\u2013145\u00a0K), Falenty et al. degassed Ne\u2013sII clathrates for several hours using vacuum pumping to obtain a so-called ice XVI, while employing neutron diffraction to observe that (i) the empty sII hydrate structure decomposes at \"T\" \u2265 145\u00a0K and, furthermore, (ii) the empty hydrate shows a negative thermal expansion at \"T\" &lt; 55\u00a0K, and it is mechanically more stable and has a larger lattice constant at low temperatures than the Ne-filled analogue. The existence of such a porous ice had been theoretically predicted before. From a theoretical perspective, empty hydrates can be probed using Molecular Dynamics or Monte Carlo techniques. Conde et al. used empty hydrates and a fully atomic description of the solid lattice to estimate the phase diagram of H2O at negative pressures and \"T\" \u2264 300\u00a0K, and obtain the differences in chemical potentials between ice Ih and the empty hydrates, central to the van der Waals\u2212Platteeuw theory. Jacobson et al. performed simulations using a monoatomic (coarse-grained) model developed for H2O that is capable of capturing the tetrahedral symmetry of hydrates. Their calculations revealed that, under 1 atm pressure, sI and sII empty hydrates are metastable regarding the ice phases up to their melting temperatures, \"T\" = 245 \u00b1 2\u00a0K and \"T\" = 252 \u00b1 2\u00a0K, respectively. Matsui et al. employed molecular dynamics to perform a thorough and systematic study of several ice polymorphs, namely space fullerene ices, zeolitic ices, and aeroices, and interpreted their relative stability in terms of geometrical considerations.\nThe thermodynamics of metastable empty sI clathrate hydrates have been probed over broad temperature and pressure ranges, 100\u00a0K \u2264 \"T\" \u2264 220\u00a0K and 100\u00a0kPa \u2264 \"p\" \u2264 500\u00a0MPa, by Cruz et al. using large-scale simulations and compared with experimental data at 100\u00a0kPa. The whole \"p\"\u2013\"V\"\u2013\"T\" surface obtained was fitted by the universal form of the Parsafar and Mason equation of state with an accuracy of 99.7\u201399.9%. Framework deformation caused by applied temperature followed a parabolic law, and there is a critical temperature above which the isobaric thermal expansion becomes negative, ranging from 194.7\u00a0K at 100\u00a0kPa to 166.2\u00a0K at 500\u00a0MPa. Response to the applied (\"p\",\u00a0\"T\") field was analyzed in terms of angle and distance descriptors of a classical tetrahedral structure and observed to occur essentially by means of angular alteration for (\"p\",\u00a0\"T\") &gt; (200\u00a0MPa,\u00a0200\u00a0K). The length of the hydrogen bonds responsible for framework integrity was insensitive to the thermodynamic conditions and its average value is r(\u0305O H) = 0.25\u00a0nm.\nCO2 hydrate.\nClathrate hydrate, which encaged CO2 as guest molecule is termed as CO2 hydrate. The term CO2 hydrates are more commonly used these days with its relevance in anthropogenic CO2 capture and sequestration. A nonstoichiometric compound, carbon dioxide hydrate, is composed of hydrogen-bonded water molecules arranged in ice-like frameworks that are occupied by molecules with appropriate sizes and regions. In structure I, the CO2 hydrate crystallizes as one of two cubic hydrates composed of 46 H2O molecules (or D2O) and eight CO2 molecules occupying both large cavities (tetrakaidecahedral) and small cavities (pentagonal dodecahedral). Researchers believed that oceans and permafrost have immense potential to capture anthropogenic CO2 in the form CO2 hydrates. The utilization of additives to shift the CO2 hydrate equilibrium curve in phase diagram towards higher temperature and lower pressures is still under scrutiny to make extensive large-scale storage of CO2 viable in shallower subsea depths.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Breadfruit was spread into Oceania via the Austronesian expansion and to further tropical areas during the Colonial Era. British and French navigators introduced a few Polynesian seedless varieties to Caribbean islands during the late 18th century.\nIt is grown in 90 countries throughout South and Southeast Asia, islands in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, Central America, and Africa. Its name is derived from the texture of the moderately ripe fruit when cooked, similar to freshly baked bread and having a potato-like flavor.\nThe trees have been widely planted in tropical regions, including lowland Central America, northern South America, and the Caribbean. In addition to the fruit serving as a staple food in many cultures, the light, sturdy timber of breadfruit has been used for making furniture, houses, and surfboards in the tropics.\nBreadfruit is closely related to \"A.\u00a0camansi\" (breadnut or seeded breadfruit) of New Guinea, the Maluku Islands, and the Philippines, \"A. blancoi\" (\"tipolo\" or \"antipolo\") of the Philippines, and slightly more distantly to \"A. mariannensis\" (\"dugdug\") of Micronesia, all of which are sometimes also referred to as \"breadfruit\". It is also closely related to the jackfruit.\nDescription.\nBreadfruit trees grow to a height of . The large and thick leaves are deeply cut into pinnate lobes. All parts of the tree yield latex, which is useful for boat caulking.\nThe trees are monoecious, with male and female flowers growing on the same tree. The male flowers emerge first, followed shortly afterward by the female flowers. The latter grow into capitula, which are capable of pollination just three days later. Pollination occurs mainly by fruit bats, but cultivated varieties produce fruit without pollination. The compound, false fruit develops from the swollen perianth, and originates from 1,500 to 2,000 flowers visible on the skin of the fruit as hexagon-like disks.\nBreadfruit is one of the highest-yielding food plants, with a single tree producing up to 200 or more grapefruit-sized fruits per season, requiring limited care. In the South Pacific, the trees yield 50 to 150 fruits per year, usually round, oval, or oblong, and weighing . Productivity varies between wet and dry areas. Studies in Barbados indicate a reasonable potential of . The ovoid fruit has a rough surface, and each fruit is divided into many achenes, each surrounded by a fleshy perianth and growing on a fleshy receptacle. Most selectively bred cultivars have seedless fruit, whereas seeded varieties are grown mainly for their edible seeds. Breadfruit is usually propagated using root cuttings.\nBreadfruit is closely related to the breadnut. It is similar in appearance to its relative of the same genus, the jackfruit (\"Artocarpus heterophyllus\"). The closely related \"Artocarpus camansi\" can be distinguished from \"A. altilis\" by having spinier fruits with numerous seeds. \"Artocarpus mariannensis\" can be distinguished by having dark green, elongated fruits with darker yellow flesh, as well as entire or shallowly lobed leaves.\nPropagation.\nBreadfruit is propagated mainly by seeds, though seedless breadfruit can be propagated by transplanting suckers that grow off the surface roots of the tree. The roots can be purposefully injured to induce the growth of suckers, which are then separated from the root and planted in a pot or directly transplanted into the ground. Pruning also induces sucker growth. Sucker cuttings are placed in plastic bags containing a mixture of soil, peat, and sand, and kept in the shade while moistened with liquid fertilizer. When roots are developed, the transplant is put in full sun until time for planting in the orchard.\nFor large-scale propagation, root cuttings are preferred, using segments about thick and long. Rooting may take up to 5 months to develop, with the young trees ready for planting when they are high.\nEtymology and common names.\nThe term \"breadfruit\" was first used in the 17th century to describe the bread-like texture of the fruit when baked. Breadfruit has hundreds of varieties and numerous common names varying by its geographic distribution.\nTaxonomy.\nAccording to DNA fingerprinting studies, the seeded wild ancestor of breadfruit is the breadnut (\"A.\u00a0camansi\"), which is native to New Guinea, the Maluku Islands, and the Philippines.\n\"A. camansi\" was domesticated and selectively bred in Polynesia, giving rise to the mostly seedless \"A.\u00a0altilis\". Micronesian breadfruit also show evidence of hybridization with the native \"A. mariannensis\", while most Polynesian and Melanesian cultivars do not. This indicates that Micronesia was initially colonized separately from Polynesia and Melanesia through two different migration events, later coinciding in eastern Micronesia.\nBreadfruit was one of the canoe plants spread by Austronesian voyagers around 3,000 years ago into Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia, where it was not native.\nDistribution and habitat.\nBreadfruit is an equatorial, lowland species. It has been spread from its Pacific source to many tropical regions.\nIn 1769, Joseph Banks was stationed in Tahiti as part of the expedition commanded by Captain James Cook. The late-18th-century quest for cheap, high-energy food sources for slaves in British colonies prompted colonial administrators and plantation owners to call for breadfruit to be brought to the Caribbean. As president of the Royal Society, Banks provided a cash bounty and gold medal for success in this endeavor and successfully lobbied for a British Naval expedition. After an unsuccessful voyage to the South Pacific to collect the plants as commander of , in 1791, William Bligh commanded a second expedition with and , which collected seedless breadfruit plants in Tahiti and transported these to St. Helena in the Atlantic and St.\u00a0Vincent and Jamaica in the West Indies.\nThe plant grows best below elevations below , but is found at elevations of . Its preferred soils are neutral to alkaline (pH of 6.1\u20137.4) and either sand, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Breadfruit is able to grow in coral sands and saline soils. The breadfruit is ultra-tropical, requiring a temperature range of and an annual rainfall of .\nNutrition.\nBreadfruit is 71% water, 27% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw breadfruit supplies 103 calories, is a rich source of vitamin C (32% of the Daily Value, DV), and provides a moderate source of potassium (16% DV), with no other nutrients in significant content.\nUses.\nFood.\nBreadfruit is a staple food in many tropical regions. Most breadfruit varieties produce fruit throughout the year. Both ripe and unripe fruit have culinary uses; unripe breadfruit is cooked before consumption. Before being eaten, the fruit is roasted, baked, fried, or boiled. When cooked, the taste of moderately ripe breadfruit is described as potato-like, or similar to freshly baked bread.\nOne breadfruit tree can produce each season. Because breadfruit trees usually produce large crops at certain times of the year, the preservation of harvested fruit is an issue. One traditional preservation technique known throughout Oceania is to bury peeled and washed fruits in a leaf-lined pit, where they ferment over several weeks and produce a sour, sticky paste. Stored in this way, the product may endure a year or more. Some pits are reported to have produced edible contents more than 20 years after burial. Remnants of pit-like formations with stone scattered around (presumed to line them) are often clues indicating prehistoric settlement to archaeologists studying precontact history of French Polynesia.\nIn addition to being edible raw, breadfruit can be dried and ground into flour and the seeds can be cooked for consumption.\nSoutheast Asia, Pacific Islands and Madagascar.\nThe seedless breadfruit is found in Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia, where it is called . It is commonly made into fritters and eaten as snacks. Breadfruit fritters are sold as local street food.\nIn the Philippines, breadfruit is known as in Tagalog and in the Visayan languages. It is also called (also spelled ), along with the closely related \"Artocarpus camansi\", and the endemic \"Artocarpus blancoi\" ( or ). All three species, as well as the closely related jackfruit, are commonly used much in the same way in savory dishes. The immature fruits are most commonly eaten as (cooked with coconut milk).\nIn the Hawaiian staple food called , the traditional ingredient of mashed taro root can be replaced by, or augmented with, mashed breadfruit ( in Hawaiian). The resulting \"breadfruit poi\" is called .\nSouth Asia.\nIn Sri Lanka, it is cooked as a curry using coconut milk and spices (which becomes a side dish) or boiled. Boiled breadfruit is a famous main meal. It is often consumed with scraped coconut or \"coconut sambol\", made of scraped coconut, red chili powder, and salt mixed with a dash of lime juice. A traditional sweet snack made of finely sliced, sun-dried breadfruit chips deep-fried in coconut oil and dipped in heated treacle or sugar syrup is known as \"rata del petti\". In India, fritters of breadfruit, called \"jeev kadge phodi\" in Konkani or \"kadachakka varuthath\" in Malayalam, are a local delicacy in coastal Karnataka and Kerala. In Seychelles, it was traditionally eaten as a substitute for rice, as an accompaniment to the mains. It would either be consumed boiled (\"friyapen bwi\") or grilled (\"friyapen griye\"), where it would be put whole in the wood fire used for cooking the main meal and then taken out when ready. It is also eaten as a dessert, called \"ladob friyapen\", where it is boiled in coconut milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.\nCaribbean and Latin America.\nIn Belize, the Mayan people call it \"masapan\". \nIn Puerto Rico, breadfruit is called \"panap\u00e9n\" or \"pana\", for short, although the name \"pana\" is often used to refer to breadnut, seeds of which have traditionally been boiled, peeled, and eaten whole. In some inland regions, it is also called \"map\u00e9n\" and used to make \"pasteles\" and \"alcapurrias\". Breadfruit is often served boiled with a mixture of sauteed \"bacalao\" (salted cod fish), olive oil, and onions, mostly as \"tostones\" where about 1-inch chunks are fried, lighty flattened, and fried again. \"Mofongo de panap\u00e9n\" is fried breadfruit mashed with olive oil, garlic, broth, and \"chicharr\u00f3n\". \"Rellenos de panap\u00e9n\" is the breadfruit version of \"papa rellena\". Dipping sauce can be made from boiled, ripe breadfruit, similar to chutney, using spices, sesame seeds, herbs, lentil, coconut milk, and fruit. Both ripe and unripe fruit are boiled together and mashed with milk and butter to make \"pastel\u00f3n de panap\u00e9n\", a dish similar to lasagna. Ripe breadfruit is used in desserts, including \"flan de pana\" (breadfruit custard). \"Cazuela\" is a crustless pie with ripe breadfruit, spices, raisins, coconut milk, and sweet potatoes. Breadfruit flour is sold all over Puerto Rico and used for making bread, pastries, cookies, pancakes, waffles, crepes, and \"almoj\u00e1bana\". \nIn the Dominican Republic, it is called \"buen pan\" or \"good bread\". Breadfruit is not popular in Dominican cookery and is used mainly for feeding pigs. \nIn Barbados, breadfruit is boiled with salted meat and mashed with butter to make breadfruit coucou. It is usually eaten with saucy meat dishes. \nIn Haiti, steamed breadfruit is mashed to make a dish called \"tonmtonm\" which is eaten with a sauce made with okra and other ingredients, such as fish and crab. \nIn Trinidad and Tobago, breadfruit is boiled, then fried and eaten with saucy meat dishes like curried duck.\nIn Jamaica, breadfruit is boiled in soups or roasted on stove top, in the oven or on wood coal. It is eaten with the national dish ackee and salt fish. The ripe fruit is used in salads or fried as a side dish.\nIn St. Vincent and the Grenadines, it is eaten boiled in soups, roasted, and fried. Roasted breadfruit, served with fried jackfish, is the country's national dish. The ripe fruit is used as a base to make drinks, cakes, and ice cream.\nTimber and other uses.\nBreadfruit was widely used in a variety of ways among Pacific Islanders. Its lightweight wood (specific gravity of 0.27) is resistant to termites and shipworms, so it is used as timber for structures and outrigger canoes. Its wood pulp can also be used to make paper, called breadfruit \"tapa\". The wood of the breadfruit tree was one of the most valuable timbers in the construction of traditional houses in Samoan architecture.\nBreadfruit contains phytochemicals having potential as an insect repellent. The parts of the fruits that are discarded can be used to feed livestock. The leaves of breadfruit trees can also be browsed by cattle.\nBreadfruit, however, exudes latex upon harvesting, causing the plant sap to adhere to the surface, leading to the staining of the epicarp. Proper methods of breadfruit harvesting usually include the process of draining the latex and disposing of it. Sticky white sap or latex is present in all parts of the breadfruit tree and has been used for glue, caulk, and even chewing gum. Native Hawaiians used its sticky latex to trap birds, whose feathers were made into cloaks. \nIn culture.\nOn Puluwat in the Caroline Islands, in the context of sacred \"yitang\" lore, breadfruit (\"poi\") is a figure of speech for knowledge. This lore is organized into five categories: war, magic, meetings, navigation, and \"breadfruit\".\nAccording to an etiological Hawaiian myth, the breadfruit originated from the sacrifice of the war god K\u016b. After deciding to live secretly among mortals as a farmer, K\u016b married and had children. He and his family lived happily until a famine seized their island. When he could no longer bear to watch his children suffer, K\u016b told his wife that he could deliver them from starvation, but to do so he would have to leave them. Reluctantly she agreed, and at her word, K\u016b descended into the ground right where he had stood until only the top of his head was visible. His family waited around the spot he had last been, day and night, watering it with their tears until suddenly, a small green shoot appeared where K\u016b had stood. Quickly, the shoot grew into a tall and leafy tree that was laden with heavy breadfruits that K\u016b's family and neighbors gratefully ate, joyfully saved from starvation. It also known as a symbol of abundance and famine relief\nMany breadfruit hybrids and cultivars are widely distributed throughout the Pacific though they are seedless or otherwise biologically incapable of naturally dispersing long distances. It is therefore clear that humans aided distribution of the plant in the Pacific, specifically prehistoric groups who colonized the Pacific Islands. To investigate the patterns of human migration throughout the Pacific, scientists have used molecular dating of breadfruit hybrids and cultivars in concert with anthropological data. Results support the west-to-east migration hypothesis, in which the Lapita people are thought to have traveled from Melanesia to numerous Polynesian islands.\nThe world's largest collection of breadfruit varieties was established by botanist Diane Ragone, from over 20 years' travel to 50 Pacific islands, on a plot outside of Hana, on the isolated east coast of Maui (Hawaii).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The moving particle loses kinetic energy, which is converted into radiation (i.e., photons), thus satisfying the law of conservation of energy. The term is also used to refer to the process of producing the radiation. Bremsstrahlung has a continuous spectrum, which becomes more intense and whose peak intensity shifts toward higher frequencies as the change of the energy of the decelerated particles increases.\nBroadly speaking, bremsstrahlung or braking radiation is any radiation produced due to the acceleration (positive or negative) of a charged particle. This includes synchrotron radiation (i.e., photon emission by a relativistic particle), cyclotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a non-relativistic particle), and the emission of electrons and positrons during beta decay. However, the term is frequently used in the more narrow sense of radiation produced when electrons (from whatever source) decelerate in matter.\nBremsstrahlung emitted from plasma is sometimes referred to as free\u2013free radiation\u00a0\u2013 that is, created by electrons that are free (i.e., not in an atomic or molecular bound state) before, and remain free after, the emission of a photon. In the same parlance, bound\u2013bound radiation refers to discrete spectral lines (an electron \"jumps\" between two bound states), while free\u2013bound radiation refers to the radiative combination process, in which a free electron recombines with an ion.\nThis article uses SI units, along with the scaled single-particle charge formula_1.\nClassical description.\nIf quantum effects are negligible, an accelerating charged particle radiates power as described by the Larmor formula and its relativistic generalization.\nTotal radiated power.\nThe total radiated power is\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 (the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light), formula_4 is the Lorentz factor, formula_5 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_6 signifies a time derivative of formula_7, and \"q\" is the charge of the particle.\nIn the case where velocity is parallel to acceleration (i.e., linear motion), the expression reduces to\nformula_8\nwhere formula_9 is the acceleration. For the case of acceleration perpendicular to the velocity (formula_10), for example in synchrotrons, the total power is\nformula_11\nPower radiated in the two limiting cases is proportional to formula_12 formula_13 or formula_14 formula_15. Since formula_16, we see that for particles with the same energy formula_17 the total radiated power goes as formula_18 or formula_19, which accounts for why electrons lose energy to bremsstrahlung radiation much more rapidly than heavier charged particles (e.g., muons, protons, alpha particles). This is the reason a TeV energy electron-positron collider (such as the proposed International Linear Collider) cannot use a circular tunnel (requiring constant acceleration), while a proton-proton collider (such as the Large Hadron Collider) can utilize a circular tunnel. The electrons lose energy due to bremsstrahlung at a rate formula_20 times higher than protons do.\nAngular distribution.\nThe most general formula for radiated power as a function of angle is:\nformula_21\nwhere formula_22 is a unit vector pointing from the particle towards the observer, and formula_23 is an infinitesimal solid angle.\nIn the case where velocity is parallel to acceleration (for example, linear motion), this simplifies to\nformula_24\nwhere formula_25 is the angle between formula_26 and the direction of observation formula_27.\nSimplified quantum-mechanical description.\nThe full quantum-mechanical treatment of bremsstrahlung is very involved. The \"vacuum case\" of the interaction of one electron, one ion, and one photon, using the pure Coulomb potential, has an exact solution that was probably first published by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1931. This analytical solution involves complicated mathematics, and several numerical calculations have been published, such as by Karzas and Latter. Other approximate formulas have been presented, such as in recent work by Weinberg and Pradler and Semmelrock.\nThis section gives a quantum-mechanical analog of the prior section, but with some simplifications to illustrate the important physics. We give a non-relativistic treatment of the special case of an electron of mass formula_28, charge formula_29, and initial speed formula_30 decelerating in the Coulomb field of a gas of heavy ions of charge formula_31 and number density formula_32. The emitted radiation is a photon of frequency formula_33 and energy formula_34. We wish to find the emissivity formula_35 which is the power emitted per (solid angle in photon velocity space * photon frequency), summed over both transverse photon polarizations. We express it as an approximate classical result times the free\u2212free emission Gaunt factor \"g\"ff accounting for quantum and other corrections:\nformula_36\nformula_37 if formula_38, that is, the electron does not have enough kinetic energy to emit the photon. A general, quantum-mechanical formula for formula_39 exists but is very complicated, and usually is found by numerical calculations. We present some approximate results with the following additional assumptions:\nWith these assumptions, two unitless parameters characterize the process: formula_44, which measures the strength of the electron-ion Coulomb interaction, and formula_45, which measures the photon \"softness\" and we assume is always small (the choice of the factor 2 is for later convenience). In the limit formula_46, the quantum-mechanical Born approximation gives:\nformula_47\nIn the opposite limit formula_48, the full quantum-mechanical result reduces to the purely classical result\nformula_49\nwhere formula_50 is the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant. Note that formula_51 which is a purely classical expression without the Planck constant formula_52.\nA semi-classical, heuristic way to understand the Gaunt factor is to write it as formula_53 where formula_54 and formula_55 are maximum and minimum \"impact parameters\" for the electron-ion collision, in the presence of the photon electric field. With our assumptions, formula_56: for larger impact parameters, the sinusoidal oscillation of the photon field provides \"phase mixing\" that strongly reduces the interaction. formula_57 is the larger of the quantum-mechanical de\u00a0Broglie wavelength formula_58 and the classical distance of closest approach formula_59 where the electron-ion Coulomb potential energy is comparable to the electron's initial kinetic energy.\nThe above approximations generally apply as long as the argument of the logarithm is large, and break down when it is less than unity. Namely, these forms for the Gaunt factor become negative, which is unphysical. A rough approximation to the full calculations, with the appropriate Born and classical limits, is\nformula_60\nThermal bremsstrahlung in a medium: emission and absorption.\nThis section discusses bremsstrahlung emission and the inverse absorption process (called inverse bremsstrahlung) in a macroscopic medium. We start with the equation of radiative transfer, which applies to general processes and not just bremsstrahlung:\nformula_61\nformula_62 is the radiation spectral intensity, or power per (area\u00a0\u00d7 solid angle in photon velocity space\u00d7 photon\u00a0frequency) summed over both polarizations. formula_63 is the emissivity, analogous to formula_35defined above, and formula_65 is the absorptivity. formula_63 and formula_65 are properties of the matter, not the radiation, and account for all the particles in the medium \u2013 not just a pair of one electron and one ion as in the prior section. If formula_68 is uniform in space and time, then the left-hand side of the transfer equation is zero, and we find\nformula_69\nIf the matter and radiation are also in thermal equilibrium at some temperature, then formula_68 must be the blackbody spectrum:\nformula_71\nSince formula_63 and formula_65 are independent of formula_68, this means that formula_75 must be the blackbody spectrum whenever the matter is in equilibrium at some temperature \u2013 regardless of the state of the radiation. This allows us to immediately know both formula_63 and formula_65 once one is known \u2013 for matter in equilibrium.\nIn plasma: approximate classical results.\nNOTE: this section currently gives formulas that apply in the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans limit formula_78, and does not use a quantized (Planck) treatment of radiation. Thus a usual factor like formula_79 does not appear. The appearance of formula_80 in formula_81 below is due to the quantum-mechanical treatment of collisions.\nIn a plasma, the free electrons continually collide with the ions, producing bremsstrahlung. A complete analysis requires accounting for both binary Coulomb collisions as well as collective (dielectric) behavior. A detailed treatment is given by Bekefi, while a simplified one is given by Ichimaru. In this section we follow Bekefi's dielectric treatment, with collisions included approximately via the cutoff wavenumber, formula_82.\nConsider a uniform plasma, with thermal electrons distributed according to the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution with the temperature formula_83. Following Bekefi, the power spectral density (power per angular frequency interval per volume, integrated over the whole formula_84 sr of solid angle and summed over the polarizations) of the bremsstrahlung radiated, is calculated to be\nformula_85\nwhere formula_86 is the electron plasma frequency, formula_87 is the photon frequency, formula_88 is the number density of electrons and ions, and other symbols are physical constants. The second bracketed factor is the index of refraction of a light wave in a plasma, and shows that emission is greatly suppressed for formula_89 (this is the cutoff condition for a light wave in a plasma; in this case the light wave is evanescent). This formula thus only applies for formula_90. This formula should be summed over ion species in a multi-species plasma.\nThe function formula_91 is the exponential integral, and the unitless quantity formula_81 is\nformula_93\nformula_82 is a maximum or cutoff wavenumber, arising due to binary collisions, and can vary with ion species. Roughly, formula_95 when formula_96 (typical in plasmas that are not too cold), where formula_97 eV is the Hartree energy, and formula_98 is the electron thermal de Broglie wavelength. Otherwise, formula_99 where formula_100 is the classical Coulomb distance of closest approach.\nFor the usual case formula_101, we find\nformula_102\nThe formula for formula_103 is approximate, in that it neglects enhanced emission occurring for formula_87 slightly above formula_105.\nIn the limit formula_106, we can approximate formula_107 as formula_108 where formula_109 is the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant. The leading, logarithmic term is frequently used, and resembles the Coulomb logarithm that occurs in other collisional plasma calculations. For formula_110 the log term is negative, and the approximation is clearly inadequate. Bekefi gives corrected expressions for the logarithmic term that match detailed binary-collision calculations.\nThe total emission power density, integrated over all frequencies, is\nformula_111\n formula_112 and decreases with formula_113; it is always positive. For formula_114, we find\nformula_115\nNote the appearance of formula_116 due to the quantum nature of formula_117. In practical units, a commonly used version of this formula for formula_118 is \nformula_119\nThis formula is 1.59 times the one given above, with the difference due to details of binary collisions. Such ambiguity is often expressed by introducing Gaunt factor formula_120, e.g. in one finds\nformula_121\nwhere everything is expressed in the CGS units.\nRelativistic corrections.\nFor very high temperatures there are relativistic corrections to this formula, that is, additional terms of the order of formula_122.\nBremsstrahlung cooling.\nIf the plasma is optically thin, the bremsstrahlung radiation leaves the plasma, carrying part of the internal plasma energy. This effect is known as the \"bremsstrahlung cooling\". It is a type of radiative cooling. The energy carried away by bremsstrahlung is called \"bremsstrahlung losses\" and represents a type of radiative losses. One generally uses the term \"bremsstrahlung losses\" in the context when the plasma cooling is undesired, as e.g. in fusion plasmas.\nPolarizational bremsstrahlung.\nPolarizational bremsstrahlung (sometimes referred to as \"atomic bremsstrahlung\") is the radiation emitted by the target's atomic electrons as the target atom is polarized by the Coulomb field of the incident charged particle. Polarizational bremsstrahlung contributions to the total bremsstrahlung spectrum have been observed in experiments involving relatively massive incident particles, resonance processes, and free atoms. However, there is still some debate as to whether or not there are significant polarizational bremsstrahlung contributions in experiments involving fast electrons incident on solid targets.\nIt is worth noting that the term \"polarizational\" is not meant to imply that the emitted bremsstrahlung is polarized. Also, the angular distribution of polarizational bremsstrahlung is theoretically quite different than ordinary bremsstrahlung.\nSources.\nX-ray tube.\nIn an X-ray tube, electrons are accelerated in a vacuum by an electric field towards a piece of material called the \"target\". X-rays are emitted as the electrons hit the target.\nAlready in the early 20th century physicists found out that X-rays consist of two components, one independent of the target material and another with characteristics of fluorescence. Now we say that the output spectrum consists of a continuous spectrum of X-rays with additional sharp peaks at certain energies. The former is due to bremsstrahlung, while the latter are characteristic X-rays associated with the atoms in the target. For this reason, bremsstrahlung in this context is also called continuous X-rays. The German term itself was introduced in 1909 by Arnold Sommerfeld in order to explain the nature of the first variety of X-rays.\nThe shape of this continuum spectrum is approximately described by Kramers' law.\nThe formula for Kramers' law is usually given as the distribution of intensity (photon count) formula_123 against the wavelength formula_124 of the emitted radiation:\nformula_125\nThe constant \"K\" is proportional to the atomic number of the target element, and formula_126 is the minimum wavelength given by the Duane\u2013Hunt law.\nThe spectrum has a sharp cutoff at formula_126, which is due to the limited energy of the incoming electrons. For example, if an electron in the tube is accelerated through 60 kV, then it will acquire a kinetic energy of 60 keV, and when it strikes the target it can create X-rays with energy of at most 60 keV, by conservation of energy. (This upper limit corresponds to the electron coming to a stop by emitting just one X-ray photon. Usually the electron emits many photons, and each has an energy less than 60 keV.) A photon with energy of at most 60\u00a0keV has wavelength of at least , so the continuous X-ray spectrum has exactly that cutoff, as seen in the graph. More generally the formula for the low-wavelength cutoff, the Duane\u2013Hunt law, is:\nformula_128\nwhere \"h\" is the Planck constant, \"c\" is the speed of light, V is the voltage that the electrons are accelerated through, \"e\" is the elementary charge, pm is picometre, and in the rightmost expression the voltage is in units of kilovolts (kV).\nBeta decay.\nBeta particle-emitting substances sometimes exhibit a weak radiation with continuous spectrum that is due to bremsstrahlung (see the \"outer bremsstrahlung\" below). In this context, bremsstrahlung is a type of \"secondary radiation\", in that it is produced as a result of stopping (or slowing) the primary radiation (beta particles). It is very similar to X-rays produced by bombarding metal targets with electrons in X-ray generators (as above) except that it is produced by high-speed electrons from beta radiation.\nInner and outer bremsstrahlung.\nThe \"inner\" bremsstrahlung (also known as \"internal bremsstrahlung\") arises from the creation of the electron and its loss of energy (due to the strong electric field in the region of the nucleus undergoing decay) as it leaves the nucleus. Such radiation is a feature of beta decay in nuclei, but it is occasionally (less commonly) seen in the beta decay of free neutrons to protons, where it is created as the beta electron leaves the proton.\nIn electron and positron emission by beta decay the photon's energy comes from the electron-nucleon pair, with the spectrum of the bremsstrahlung decreasing continuously with increasing energy of the beta particle. In electron capture, the energy comes at the expense of the neutrino, and the spectrum is greatest at about one third of the normal neutrino energy, decreasing to zero electromagnetic energy at normal neutrino energy. Note that in the case of electron capture, bremsstrahlung is emitted even though no charged particle is emitted. Instead, the bremsstrahlung radiation may be thought of as being created as the captured electron is accelerated toward being absorbed. Such radiation may be at frequencies that are the same as soft gamma radiation, but it exhibits none of the sharp spectral lines of gamma decay, and thus is not technically gamma radiation.\nThe internal process is to be contrasted with the \"outer\" bremsstrahlung due to the impingement on the nucleus of electrons coming from the outside (i.e., emitted by another nucleus), as discussed above.\nRadiation safety.\nIn some cases, such as the decay of 32P, the bremsstrahlung produced by shielding the beta radiation with the normally used dense materials (e.g. lead) is itself dangerous; in such cases, shielding must be accomplished with low density materials, such as Plexiglas (Lucite), plastic, wood, or water; as the atomic number is lower for these materials, the intensity of bremsstrahlung is significantly reduced, but a larger thickness of shielding is required to stop the electrons (beta radiation).\nIn astrophysics.\nThe dominant luminous component in a cluster of galaxies is the 107 to 108 kelvin intracluster medium. The emission from the intracluster medium is characterized by thermal bremsstrahlung. This radiation is in the energy range of X-rays and can be easily observed with space-based telescopes such as Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, ROSAT, ASCA, EXOSAT, Suzaku, RHESSI and future missions like IXO https:// and Astro-H https://.\nBremsstrahlung is also the dominant emission mechanism for H II regions at radio wavelengths.\nIn electric discharges.\nIn electric discharges, for example as laboratory discharges between two electrodes or as lightning discharges between cloud and ground or within clouds, electrons produce bremsstrahlung photons while scattering off air molecules. These photons become manifest in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and are the source for beams of electrons, positrons, neutrons and protons. The appearance of bremsstrahlung photons also influences the propagation and morphology of discharges in nitrogen\u2013oxygen mixtures with low percentages of oxygen.\nQuantum mechanical description.\nThe complete quantum mechanical description was first performed by Bethe and Heitler. They assumed plane waves for electrons which scatter at the nucleus of an atom, and derived a cross section which relates the complete geometry of that process to the frequency of the emitted photon. The quadruply differential cross section, which shows a quantum mechanical symmetry to pair production, is\n formula_129\nwhere formula_130 is the atomic number, formula_131 the fine-structure constant, formula_116 the reduced Planck constant and formula_133 the speed of light. The kinetic energy formula_134 of the electron in the initial and final state is connected to its total energy formula_135 or its momenta formula_136 via\nformula_137\nwhere formula_28 is the mass of an electron. Conservation of energy gives\nformula_139\nwhere formula_140 is the photon energy. The directions of the emitted photon and the scattered electron are given by\nformula_141\nwhere formula_142 is the momentum of the photon.\nThe differentials are given as\nformula_143\nThe absolute value of the virtual photon between the nucleus and electron is\n formula_144\nThe range of validity is given by the Born approximation\nformula_145\nwhere this relation has to be fulfilled for the velocity formula_146 of the electron in the initial and final state.\nFor practical applications (e.g. in Monte Carlo codes) it can be interesting to focus on the relation between the frequency formula_87 of the emitted photon and the angle between this photon and the incident electron. K\u00f6hn and Ebert integrated the quadruply differential cross section by Bethe and Heitler over formula_148 and formula_149 and obtained:\nformula_150\nwith\n formula_151\nand\n formula_152\nHowever, a much simpler expression for the same integral can be found in (Eq. 2BN) and in (Eq. 4.1).\nAn analysis of the doubly differential cross section above shows that electrons whose kinetic energy is larger than the rest energy (511\u00a0keV) emit photons in forward direction while electrons with a small energy emit photons isotropically.\nElectron\u2013electron bremsstrahlung.\nOne mechanism, considered important for small atomic numbers formula_130, is the scattering of a free electron at the shell electrons of an atom or molecule. Since electron\u2013electron bremsstrahlung is a function of formula_130 and the usual electron-nucleus bremsstrahlung is a function of formula_155, electron\u2013electron bremsstrahlung is negligible for metals. For air, however, it plays an important role in the production of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name refers to one of the typical characteristics of the group: namely, that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledons. There are around 200,000\u00a0species within this group. The other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledons (or monocots), typically each having one cotyledon. Historically, these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants.\nLargely from the 1990s onwards, molecular phylogenetic research confirmed what had already been suspected: that dicotyledons are not a group made up of all the descendants of a common ancestor (i.e., they are not a monophyletic group). Rather, a number of lineages, such as the magnoliids and groups now collectively known as the basal angiosperms, diverged earlier than the monocots did; in other words, monocots evolved from within the dicots, as traditionally defined. The traditional dicots are thus a paraphyletic group.\nThe eudicots are the largest monophyletic group within the dicotyledons. They are distinguished from all other flowering plants by the structure of their pollen. Other dicotyledons and the monocotyledons have monosulcate pollen (or derived forms): grains with a single sulcus. Contrastingly, eudicots have tricolpate pollen (or derived forms): grains with three or more pores set in furrows called colpi.\nComparison with monocotyledons.\nAside from cotyledon number, other broad differences have been noted between monocots and dicots, although these have proven to be differences primarily between monocots and eudicots. Many early-diverging dicot groups have monocot characteristics such as scattered vascular bundles, trimerous flowers, and non-tricolpate pollen. In addition, some monocots have dicot characteristics such as reticulated leaf veins.\nClassification.\nPhylogeny.\nThe consensus phylogenetic tree used in the APG IV system shows that the group traditionally treated as the dicots is paraphyletic to the monocots:\nHistorical.\nTraditionally, the dicots have been called the Dicotyledones (or \"Dicotyledoneae\"), at any rank. If treated as a class, as they are within the Cronquist system, they could be called the Magnoliopsida after the type genus \"Magnolia\". In some schemes, the eudicots were either treated as a separate class, the Rosopsida (type genus \"Rosa\"), or as several separate classes. The remaining dicots (palaeodicots or basal angiosperms) may be kept in a single paraphyletic class, called Magnoliopsida, or further divided. Some botanists prefer to retain the dicotyledons as a valid class, arguing its practicality and that it makes evolutionary sense.\nAPG vs. Cronquist.\nThe following lists show the orders in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group APG IV system traditionally called dicots, together with the older Cronquist system.\nDahlgren and Thorne systems.\nUnder the Dahlgren and Thorne systems, the subclass name \"Magnoliidae\" was used for the dicotyledons. This is also the case in some of the systems derived from the Cronquist system. These two systems are contrasted in the table below in terms of how each categorises by superorder; note that the sequence within each system has been altered in order to pair corresponding taxa\nThe Thorne system (1992) as depicted by Reveal is:\nThere exist variances between the superorders circumscribed from each system. Namely, although the systems share common names for many of the listed superorders, the specific list orders classified within each varies. For example, Thorne's \"Theanae\" corresponds to five distinct superorders under Dahlgren's system, only one of which is called \"Theanae.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the \"Catalogus Liberianus\", he was consecrated on 22 May as the successor to Julius I. He is not mentioned as a saint in the Roman Martyrology, making him the earliest pontiff not to be venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church and, along with Anastasius II, one of only two popes to be omitted from Catholic sainthood in the first 500 years of church history.\nLiberius is mentioned in the Greek Menology, the Eastern equivalent to the martyrologies of the Western Church and a measure of sainthood prior to the institution of the formal Western processes of canonization.\nPontificate.\nThe first recorded act of Liberius was, after a synod had been held at Rome, to write to Emperor Constantius II, then in quarters at Arles (353\u2013354), asking that a council might be called at Aquileia with reference to the affairs of Athanasius of Alexandria, but his messenger Vincentius of Capua was compelled by the emperor at a conciliabulum held in Arles to subscribe against his will to a condemnation of the orthodox patriarch of Alexandria.\nConstantius was sympathetic to the Arians, and when he could not persuade Liberius to his point of view sent the pope to a prison in Beroea. At the end of an exile of more than two years in Thrace, after which it seems he may have temporarily relented, or been set up to appear to have relented\u00a0\u2013 partially evidenced by three letters, quite possibly forgeries, ascribed to Liberius, the emperor recalled him under extreme pressure from the Roman population who refused to recognize his puppet, Felix II. As the Roman See was \"officially\" occupied by Felix, a year passed before Liberius was sent to Rome. It was the emperor's intention that Liberius should govern the Church jointly with Felix, but on the arrival of Liberius, Felix was expelled by the Roman people. Neither Liberius nor Felix took part in the Council of Rimini (359).\nThe return of the Pope from exile was met with joy from the Roman people but it was also met with criticism. The writer Philostorgius says that the Pope Liberius was restored to papacy only after he signed the Second Creed of Sirmium, and although Sozomen claimed that this story was a lie, Hilary of Poitiers reacted by writing concerning the pope: \"I know not whether it was with greater impiety that you exiled him than that you restored him\" (Contra Const., II). Some of those writers who accept the forged letters and testimonies of Arians, Semi-arians and Luciferians, concede Pope Liberius repented later for having signed the Arian Creed at Sirmium, but that he ever signed is highly doubtful on the basis of a critical examination of the original sources.\nAfter the death of the Emperor Constantius in 361, Liberius annulled the decrees of that assembly but, with the concurrence of bishops Athanasius and Hilary of Poitiers, retained the bishops who had signed and then withdrew their adherence. In 366, Liberius gave a favourable reception to a deputation of the Eastern episcopate, and admitted into his communion the more moderate of the old Arian party. He died on 24 September 366.\nSome historians have postulated that Liberius resigned the papacy in 365, in order to make sense of the pontificate of Felix II, who has since been regarded as an antipope.\nLegacy.\nPope Pius IX noted in his 1863 encyclical \"Quartus supra\" that Liberius was falsely accused by the Arians and he had refused to condemn Athanasius of Alexandria. However, Athanasius said that Pope Liberius condemned him after the Emperor Constantius II threatened to kill the Pope. In his 1920 encyclical \"Principi Apostolorum Petro\", Pope Benedict XV noted that Pope Liberius went fearlessly into exile in defence of the orthodox faith.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Liberius is a saint whose feast is celebrated on 27 August. In Coptic Christianity, the Departure of St Liberius the Bishop of Rome is commemorated on 4 Pi Kogi Enavot.\nThe Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome is sometimes referred to as the Liberian Basilica.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On 20 November 1858, \u00c9mile Peugeot applied for the lion trademark. Armand Peugeot (1849\u20131915) built the company's first vehicle, a steam-powered tricycle. In 1886, the company collaborated with L\u00e9on Serpollet, followed by the development of an internal combustion car in 1890, which used a Panhard-Daimler engine.\nThe Peugeot family and company are originally from Sochaux, where Peugeot still operates a large manufacturing facility and the Peugeot Museum.\nPeugeot vehicles have received numerous international accolades, including six European Car of the Year awards. The brand also boasts over a century of success in motorsport, with victories including the Indianapolis 500 in 1913, 1916, and 1919. Peugeot Sport has won the World Rally Championship five times (1985, 1986, 2000, 2001, 2002), the Dakar Rally seven times (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 2016, 2017, 2018), the 24 Hours of Le Mans three times (1992, 1993, 2009), the World Endurance Championship twice (1992, 1993), the Intercontinental Rally Challenge Championship three times, the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup twice (2010, 2011), and the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb three times (1988, 1989, 2013).\nHistory.\nEarly manufacturing.\nThe Peugeot family of Valentigney, Montb\u00e9liard, Franche-Comt\u00e9, France began in the manufacturing business in 1810 with a steel foundry, which quickly started manufacturing saws; then other hand tools and, circa 1840 to 1842, coffee grinders; then, in 1874, pepper grinders; and then, circa 1880, bicycles. The company's entry into the vehicle market was by means of stiff, structured petticoats or crinoline dresses, which used steel rods, leading to umbrella frames, chisels, wire wheels, and bicycles. Armand Peugeot introduced his \"Le Grand Bi\" penny-farthing in 1882, along with a range of other bicycles.\nThe company's logo, initially a lion walking on an arrow, symbolized the speed, strength, and flexibility of the Peugeot saw blades. The car and motorcycle company and the bicycle company parted ways in 1926, but the family-owned Cycles Peugeot continued to build bicycles throughout the 20th century until the brand name was sold off to unrelated firms. The family-owned firm Peugeot Saveurs continues to make and market grinders and other kitchen and table-service equipment.\nEarly motor vehicles.\nArmand Peugeot became interested in the automobile early on and, after meeting with Gottlieb Daimler and others were convinced of its viability. The first Peugeot automobile, a three-wheeled, steam-powered car designed by L\u00e9on Serpollet, was produced in 1889; only four examples were made. Steam power was heavy and bulky and required lengthy warm-up times. In 1890, after meeting Daimler and \u00c9mile Levassor, steam was abandoned in favour of a four-wheeled car with a petrol-fuelled internal combustion engine built by Panhard under Daimler licence. The car was more sophisticated than many of its contemporaries, with a three-point suspension and a sliding-gear transmission. An example was sold to the young Alberto Santos-Dumont, who exported it to Brazil.\nMore cars followed, 29 being built in 1892, 40 in 1894, 72 in 1895, 156 in 1898, and 300 in 1899. These early models were given \"type\" numbers. Peugeot became the first manufacturer to fit rubber tyres (solid, rather than pneumatic) to a petrol-powered car. Due to family discord, Armand Peugeot founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Automobiles Peugeot, in 1896, but in 1910 it was merged back with the family's Peugeot bicycle and motorcycle business.\nPeugeot was an early pioneer in motor racing, with Albert Lema\u00eetre winning the world's first motor race, the Paris\u2013Rouen, in a 3\u00a0hp Peugeot. Five Peugeots qualified for the main event, and all finished. Lema\u00eetre finished 3 min 30 sec behind the Comte de Dion whose steam-powered car was ineligible for the official competition. Three Peugeots were entered in the Paris\u2013Bordeaux\u2013Paris, where they were beaten by Panhard's car (despite an average speed of and taking the 31,500 franc prize). This also marked the debut of Michelin pneumatic tyres in racing, also on a Peugeot; they proved insufficiently durable. Nevertheless, the vehicles were still very much horseless carriages in appearance and were steered by a tiller.\nIn 1896, the first Peugeot engines were built; no longer were they reliant on Daimler. Designed by Rigoulot, the first engine was an horizontal twin fitted to the back of the Type 15. It also served as the basis of a nearly exact copy produced by Rochet-Schneider. Further improvements followed: the engine moved to the front on the Type 48 and was soon under a bonnet at the front of the car, instead of hidden underneath; the steering wheel was adopted on the Type 36, and they began to look more like the modern car.\nAlso in 1896, Armand Peugeot broke away from Les Fils de Peugeot Fr\u00e8res to form his own company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Automobiles Peugeot, building a new factory at Audincourt to focus entirely on cars. In 1899, sales hit 300; total car sales for all of France that year were 1,200. The same year, Lema\u00eetre won the Nice-Castellane-Nice Rally in a special racer.\nAt the 1901 Paris Salon, Peugeot debuted a tiny shaft-driven one-cylinder, dubbed \"B\u00e9b\u00e9\" (\"baby\"), and shed its conservative image, becoming a style leader. After placing 19th in the 1902 Paris-Vienna Rally with a racer, and failing to finish with two similar cars, Peugeot quit racing.\nIn 1898, Peugeot Motocycles presents at the Paris Motorshow the first motorcycle equipped with a Dion-Bouton motor. Peugeot Motocycles remains the oldest motorcycle manufacturer in the world.\nPeugeot added motorcycles to its range in 1901, and they have been built under the Peugeot name ever since. By 1903, Peugeot produced half of the cars built in France, and they offered the \"B\u00e9b\u00e9\", a four-seater, and an and resembling contemporary Mercedes models.\nThe 1907 salon showed Peugeot's first six-cylinder and marked Tony Huber joining as an engine builder. By 1910, Peugeot's product line included a two-cylinder and six four-cylinders, of between two and six liters. In addition, a new factory opened the same year at Sochaux, which became the main plant in 1928.\nA more famous name, Ettore Bugatti, designed the new four-cylinder \"B\u00e9b\u00e9\" of 1912. The same year, Peugeot returned to racing with a team of three driver-engineers (a breed typical of the pioneer period, exemplified by Enzo Ferrari among others): Jules Goux (graduate of \"Arts et Metiers\", Paris), Paolo Zuccarelli (formerly of Hispano-Suiza), and Georges Boillot (collectively called \"Les Charlatans\"), with 26-year-old Swiss engineer Ernest Henry to make their ideas reality. The company decided \"voiturette\" (light car) racing was not enough, and chose to try \"grandes \u00e9preuves\" (grand touring). They did so with an engineering \"tour de force\": a dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) 7.6-liter four-cylinder (110x200 mm) with four valves per cylinder. It proved faster than other cars of its time, and Boillot won the 1912 French Grand Prix at an average of , despite losing third gear and taking a 20-minute pit stop. In May 1913, Goux took one to Indianapolis, and won at an average of , recording straightaway speeds of . making Peugeot the first non-American-based auto company to win at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. In 1914, Boillot's 3-liter L5 set a new Indy lap record of , and Duray placed second (beaten by ex-Peugeot ace Ren\u00e9 Thomas in a Delage). Another (driven by Boillot's brother, Andr\u00e9) placed in 1915; similar models won in 1916 (Dario Resta) and 1919 (Howdy Wilcox).\nFor the 1913 French Grand Prix, an improved L5 (with engine) was produced with a pioneering ballbearing crankshaft, gear-driven camshafts, and dry sump lubrication, all of which soon became standard on racing cars; Zuccarelli was killed during testing on public roads, but Boillot easily won the event, making him (and Peugeot) the race's first double winner. For the 1914 French GP, Peugeot was overmatched by Mercedes, and despite a new innovation, four-wheel brakes (against the Mercedes' rear-only), Georges proved unable to match them and the car broke down. (Surprisingly, a 1914 model turned a lap in practice at Indy in 1949, yet it failed to qualify.) Peugeot was more fortunate in 1915, winning at the French GP and Vanderbilt Cup.\nDuring the First World War, Peugeot turned largely to arms production, becoming a major manufacturer of arms and military vehicles, from armoured cars and bicycles to shells. Between 1917 and 1920 the company produced 4,084 Type 1525 trucks. Peugeot also manufactured aircraft engines. The firm designed and built the Peugeot 8Aa engines, which equipped the 1,123 Voisin VIII bombers and cannon fighters used by the A\u00e9ronautique Militaire. Additionally, Peugeot was one of the major license producers of the Hispano-Suiza 8 aero engines which powered many French and British fighter aircraft during the second half of the conflict.\nInterwar years.\nAfter the war, car production resumed in earnest. Racing continued as well, with Boillot entering the 1919 Targa Florio in a 2.5-liter (150-in3) car designed for an event pre-empted by World War I; the car had on it, yet Boillot won with an impressive drive (the best of his career) Peugeots in his hands were third in the 1925 Targa, first in the 1922 and 1925 Coppa Florios, first in the 1923 and 1925 Touring Car Grands Prix, and first at the 1926 Spa 24 Hours. Peugeot introduced a five-valve-per-cylinder, triple-overhead-cam engine for the Grand Prix, conceived by Marcel Gremillon (who had criticised the early DOHC), but the engine was a failure.\nThe same year, Peugeot debuted and fours, the larger based on the Type 153, and a 6-liter sleeve valve six, as well as a new cyclecar, \"La Quadrilette\".\nDuring the 1920s, Peugeot expanded, in 1926 splitting the cycle (pedal and motor) business off to form Cycles Peugeot, the consistently profitable cycle division seeking to free itself from the rather more cyclical auto business, and taking over the defunct Bellanger and De Dion companies in 1927. In 1928, the Type 183 was introduced.\n\"Peugeot Sochaux production (units):\n* 1930 43,303\n* 1931 33,322\n* 1932 28,317\nSoon after the timely introduction of the Peugeot 201, the Great Depression hit all the French auto-makers: Peugeot sales slumped, but the company survived.\nNew for 1929 was the Peugeot 201, the cheapest car on the French market, and the first to use the later Peugeot trademark (and registered as such)\u2014three digits with a central zero. The 201 would get independent front suspension in 1931, Soon afterwards, the Depression hit; Peugeot sales decreased, but the company survived. The Peugeot system of using three-digit names with a central 0 was introduced in 1929. The first digit has always signified the car's size and the final digit has indicated the generation of the vehicle.\nIn 1933, attempting a revival of fortune, the company unveiled a new, aerodynamically styled range. In 1934, Peugeot introduced the 402 BL \u00c9clipse D\u00e9capotable, the first convertible with a retractable hardtop\u00a0\u2014 an idea followed later by the Ford Skyliner in the 1950s and revived in the modern era by the Mitsubishi 3000GT Spyder in 1995. More recently, many manufacturers have offered retractable hardtops, including Peugeot itself with the 206-cc.\nThree models of the 1930s were the Peugeot 202, Peugeot 302, and Peugeot 402. These cars had curvaceous designs, with headlights behind sloping grille bars, evidently inspired by the Chrysler Airflow. The 2.1-liter 402 entered production in 1935 and was produced until the end of 1941, despite France's occupation by the Nazis. For 1936, the new Airflow-inspired 302 (which ran until 1938) and a 402-based large model, designed by Andrean, featured a vertical fin and bumper, with the first high-mounted taillight. The entry-level 202 was built in series from 1938 to 1942, and about 20 more examples were built from existing stocks of supplies in February 1945. The 202 lifted Peugeot's sales in 1939 to 52,796, just behind Citro\u00ebn. Regular production began again in mid-1946, and lasted into 1949.\nDuring World War II.\nPeugeot assisted the Nazi German war effort by manufacturing armored vehicles.\nAfter World War II.\nIn 1946, the company restarted car production with the 202, delivering 14,000 copies. In 1947, Peugeot introduced the Peugeot 203, with coil springs, rack-and-pinion steering, and hydraulic brakes. The 203 set new Peugeot sales records, remaining in production until 1960.\nPeugeot took over Chenard-Walcker in 1950, having already been required to acquire a controlling interest in Automobiles Hotchkiss in 1942. A popular model introduced in 1955 was the Peugeot 403. With a 1.5-liter engine, it sold one million copies by the end of its production run in 1962.\nThe company began selling cars in the United States in 1958, and in 1960 introduced the Peugeot 404, which used a engine, tilted 45 degrees. The 404 proved rugged enough to win the East African Safari Rally four times, in 1963, 1966, 1967, and 1968.\nMore models followed, many styled by Pininfarina, such as the 504, one of Peugeot's most distinctive models. Like many European manufacturers, collaboration with other firms increased; Peugeot worked with Renault from 1966 and Volvo from 1972. The results of this cooperation included the development of the V6 PRV engine, which was first manufactured in 1974.\nSeveral Peugeot models were assembled in Australia, commencing with the 203 in 1953. These were followed by 403, 404 and 504 models with Australian assembly ending with the 505 in the early 1980s.\nTakeover of Citro\u00ebn and Chrysler Europe.\nIn 1974, Peugeot bought a 30% share of Citro\u00ebn and took over it completely in 1975 after the French government gave large sums of money to the new company. Citro\u00ebn was in financial trouble because it developed too many radical new models for its financial resources. Some of them, notably the Citro\u00ebn SM and the Comotor Wankel engine venture proved unprofitable. Others, the Citro\u00ebn CX and Citro\u00ebn GS for example, proved very successful in the marketplace.\nThe joint parent company became the PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn group, which aimed to keep separate identities for both the Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn brands while sharing engineering and technical resources. Peugeot thus briefly controlled the Italian Maserati marque, but disposed of it in May 1975.\nThe group then took over the European division of Chrysler (which were formerly Rootes and Simca) in 1978 as the American auto manufacturer struggled to survive. Soon, the whole Chrysler/Simca range was sold under the revived Talbot badge until the production of Talbot-branded passenger cars was shelved in 1987 and on commercial vehicles in 1992.\n1980s and 1990s.\nIn 1983, Peugeot launched the successful Peugeot 205 supermini, which is largely credited for turning the company's fortunes around. The 205 was regularly the bestselling car in France, and was also popular in other parts of Europe, including Britain, where sales regularly topped 50,000 a year by the late 1980s. It won plaudits for its styling, ride and handling. It remained on sale in many markets until 1998, overlapping with the introduction of the 106 in 1991, and ceasing production at the launch of the 206, the best-selling Peugeot model of all time, with 8,358,217 cars sold by 2012.\nAs part of the Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company (GPAC) joint venture, the Peugeot 504 and 505 were built in China from 1985 to 1997.\nBy 1987, the company had dropped the Talbot brand for passenger cars when it ceased production of the Simca-based Horizon, Alpine, and Solara models, as well as the Talbot Samba supermini which was based on the Peugeot 104. What was to be called the Talbot Arizona became the Peugeot 309, with the former Rootes plant in Ryton and Simca plant in Poissy being turned over for Peugeot assembly. Producing Peugeots in Ryton was significant, as it signalled the first time Peugeots would be built in Britain. The 309 was the first Peugeot-badged hatchback of its size, and sold well across Europe. The 309's successor, the 306, was also built at Ryton.\nThe 405 saloon was launched in 1987 to compete with the likes of the Ford Sierra, and was voted European Car of the Year. This, too, was a popular car across Europe, and continued to be available in Africa and Asia after it was replaced by the 406 nearly a decade later. Production of the 405 in Europe was divided between Britain and France, although its 406 successor was only produced in France. The 106, Peugeot's entry-level model from 1991, was also produced solely in France.\nThe Talbot name survived for a little longer on commercial vehicles until 1992 before being shelved completely. As experienced by other European volume car makers, Peugeot's United States and Canadian sales faltered and finally became uneconomical, as the Peugeot 505 design aged. For a time, distribution in the Canadian market was handled by Chrysler. Several ideas to turn around sales in the United States, such as including the Peugeot 205 in its lineup, were considered but not pursued. In the early 1990s, the newly introduced 405 proved uncompetitive with domestic and import models in the same market segment, and sold less than 1,000 units. Total sales fell to 4,261 units in 1990 and 2,240 through July 1991, which caused the company to cease its U.S. and Canada operations after 33 years.\nIn 1997, just six years after pulling out of both United States and Canadian markets, Peugeot returned to Mexico after a 36-year absence, under the Chile\u2013Mexico Free Trade Agreement. However, Peugeot models (1997\u2013present) are not to be bought or imported into the United States from Mexico.\n2000s to present.\nOn 18 April 2006, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn announced the closure of the Ryton manufacturing facility in Coventry, England. This announcement resulted in the loss of 2,300 jobs, as well as about 5,000 jobs in the supply chain. The plant produced its last Peugeot 206 on 12 December 2006, and finally closed down in January 2007.\nPeugeot set an ambitious target of selling 4 million units annually by the end of the decade. In 2008, its sales stayed below the 2 million mark. In mid-2009, \"adverse market and industry conditions\" were blamed for falls in sales and operating losses. Christian Streiff was replaced by Philippe Varin (CEO) and Jean-Pierre Plou\u00e9 (head of design) was transferred from his post at Citro\u00ebn. In 2009, Peugeot returned to the Canadian market with the scooter brand only.\nPeugeot still plans on developing new models to compete in segments where it currently does not compete. Collin said that the French automaker competed in 72% of market segments in 2007, but he wanted to get that figure up to 90%. Despite Peugeot's sportscar racing program, the company is not prepared to build a pure sportscar any more hardcore than the RC Z sports-coupe. It is also pursuing government funding to develop a diesel-hybrid drivetrain, which might be key to its expansion.\nBy 2010, Peugeot planned on pursuing new markets, mainly in China, Russia, and South America. In 2011 it decided to re-enter India after 14 years with a new factory at Sanand, Gujarat.\nPeugeot re-entered the Philippines in 2012 after having a short presence in 2005 with distribution done by the Alvarez Group.\nIn March 2012, General Motors purchased a 7% share in Peugeot for 320 million euros as part of a cooperation aimed at finding savings through joint purchasing and product development. In December 2013, GM sold its entire Peugeot stake, taking a loss of about 70 million euros.\nIn October 2013, Peugeot closed their production plant at Aulnay-sous-Bois as part of a restructuring plan to reduce overcapacity in the face of a shrinking domestic market. By December 2013, Chinese investors were rumoured to be potential investors. In February 2014, the Peugeot family agreed to give up control of the company by reducing its holdings from 25% to 14%. As part of this agreement, Dongfeng Motors and the French government were each to buy 14% stakes in the company, creating three partners with equal voting rights. The board of directors was to be composed of six independent members, two representatives of each Dongfeng, the French state and the Peugeot family, and two members representing employees and employees shareholders. The French government took the view the deal did not require approval by Brussels as EU competition rules do not count public investment in a company on the same terms as a private investor as state aid. The equity participation by Dongfeng expanded an already budding relationship with Peugeot. The pair at the time were jointly operating three car-manufacturing plants in China, with a capacity of producing 750,000 vehicles a year. In July 2014, the joint venture, Dongfeng Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn, disclosed they were building a fourth factory in China in Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, targeting the manufacture of 300,000 sport-utility and multipurpose vehicles a year, starting towards the end of 2016.\nIn January 2015, Indian multinational automotive giant Mahindra &amp; Mahindra purchased a major stake of 51% of Peugeot Motocycles for a price of 28 million euro.\nIn 2015, the Spanish National Commission on Markets and Competition fined Peugeot Espa\u00f1a, S.A. with over 15 million euros because it operated a cartel with other car builders and sellers controlling 91% of the Spanish market between 2006 and 2013. They shared information about sales and repairs anti-competitively.\nIn 2020, it was announced that a merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and PSA is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. The combined company will be called Stellantis. The merger was confirmed on 4 January 2021, after an overwhelming vote of shareholders from both companies and the deal officially closed on 16 January 2021.\nVehicles.\nAwards.\nEuropean Car of the Year.\nPeugeot has produced six winners of the European Car of the Year \nFour other Peugeot models got either second or third in the contest.\nWomen's World Car Of The Year\nSemperit Irish Car of the Year award.\nPeugeot has produced two Car of the Year award winners in Ireland since 1978. It is judged by the Irish Motoring Writers Association (IMWA).\nCar of the Year award in Italy.\nPeugeot has produced four \"\"Car of the Year\" Auto Europa\" award winners in Italy in 28 years, since 1987. \"Auto Europa\" is the prize awarded by the jury of the Italian Union of Automotive Journalists (UIGA), which annually celebrates the best car produced at least at 10,000 units in the 27 countries of the European Union, and sold between September and August the previous year.\nCar of the Year award in Spain.\nPeugeot has produced nine Car of the year award winners in Spain in 40 years, since 1974.\nElectric and hybrid vehicles.\nPeugeot presented a new concept hybrid electric sports sedan at the 2008 Paris Motor Show called the Peugeot RC HYmotion4. Similar to the drivetrain model used in the upcoming Chevrolet Volt, the RC concept promises the ability to run solely on electric power for extended periods, with a hybrid electric powertrain filling in the gaps when extra range is needed. The RC HYmotion4 includes a 70-kW electric motor at the front wheels. The Peugeot Prologue HYmotion4 was also shown at the 2008 Paris show and is in many ways the opposite of the RC HYmotion4 concept. The Prologue puts the internal combustion engine up front and runs on diesel instead of gasoline, with the electric motor going at the back.\nThe Peugeot BB1 is an electric concept car with in-wheel motors in its rear wheels first shown in September 2009 at the Frankfurt Motor Show.\nIn 2010, Peugeot started selling the electric Peugeot iOn, a rebadged and revised version of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV.\nPeugeot VELV electric concept car was presented on 26 September 2011.\nBy 2025, it is expected that 100% of Peugeot models would introduce an electrified variant. It is estimated that by 2030, 100% of Peugeot sold in Europe would be electrified. Along with adopting an all-electricity approach, Peugeot also aims to reduce its CO2 emissions. Peugeot's aim is to implement its brand shift to sustainable and environmental-friendly transport solutions.\nMotorsport.\nEarly.\nPeugeot was involved in motorsport from the earliest days and entered five cars for the Paris-Rouen Trials in 1894 with one of them, driven by Lema\u00eetre, finishing second (the winning car was a steam-powered car and was therefore disqualified meaning Lem\u00eetre was promoted to first). These trials are usually regarded as the first motor sporting competition. Participation in a variety of events continued until World War I, but in 1912, Peugeot made its most notable contribution to motor sporting history when one of their cars, driven by Georges Boillot, won the French Grand Prix at Dieppe. This revolutionary car was powered by a straight-4 engine designed by Ernest Henry under the guidance of the technically knowledgeable racing drivers Paul Zuccarelli and Georges Boillot. The design was very influential for racing engines as it featured for the first time DOHC and four valves per cylinder, providing for high engine speeds, a radical departure from previous racing engines which relied on huge displacement for power.\nIn 1913, Peugeots of similar design to the 1912 Grand Prix car won the French Grand Prix at Amiens and the Indianapolis 500. When one of the Peugeot racers remained in the United States during World War I and parts could not be acquired from France for the 1914 season, owner Bob Burman had it serviced in the shop of Harry Miller by a young mechanic named Fred Offenhauser. Their familiarity with the Peugeot engine was the basis of the famed Miller racing engine, which later developed into the Offenhauser.\nRallying.\nPeugeot Sport is one of the most successful winners in rallying, along with Citro\u00ebn Racing (eight-time WRC winner), by winning five times the World Rally Championship Manufacturer's Title (1985\u20131986, 2000\u20132002), seven times the Dakar Rally (1987\u20131990, 2016\u20132018), three times the European Rally Championship (2002\u20132003, 2008), three times the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (2007\u20132009).\nPeugeot's East African importers had an impressive record in rallying in the 1960s; Nick Nowicki and Paddy Cliff won the East African Safari in 1963 with a Marshall's-entered 404 sedan. In 1966 and 1967, Tanzania's Tanganyika Motors entered the winning 404 Injection sedan, piloted by the late Bert Shankland and Chris Rothwell. They might have won again in 1968, but while in second place, their engine blew and ultimately Nick Nowicki and Paddy Cliff upheld Peugeot's honour by winning the rally. Peugeot also won the Safari Rally in 1975 (Andersson in a 504 Injection sedan), then, in 1978 (Nicolas in a 504 Coup\u00e9 V6), both cars being factory team entries.\nPeugeot also had further success in international rallying, including in the World Rally Championship, with the four-wheel-drive turbo-charged versions of the Peugeot 205, and later the Peugeot 206. In 1981, Jean Todt, former co-driver for Hannu Mikkola, Timo M\u00e4kinen, and Guy Fr\u00e9quelin, among others, was asked by Jean Boillot, the head of Automobiles Peugeot, to create a competition department for PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn. The resulting Peugeot Talbot Sport, established at Bois de Boulogne near Paris, debuted its Group B 205 Turbo 16 at the 1984 Tour de Corse in May, and took its first world rally win that same year at the 1000 Lakes Rally in August, in the hands of Ari Vatanen. Excluding an endurance rally where Peugeot were not participating, Vatanen went on win five world rallies in a row.\nPeugeot's domination continued in the 1985 season. Despite Vatanen's nearly fatal accident in Argentina, in the middle of the season, his teammate and compatriot Timo Salonen led Peugeot to its first drivers' and manufacturers' world championship titles, well ahead of Audi and their Audi Sport Quattro. In the 1986 season, Vatanen's young replacement Juha Kankkunen beat Lancia's Markku Al\u00e9n to the drivers' title and Peugeot took its second manufacturers' title ahead of Lancia. Following FIA's banning of Group B cars for 1987, in May after Henri Toivonen's fatal accident, Todt was outraged and even (unsuccessfully) pursued legal action against the federation. Peugeot then switched to rally raids. Using the 205 and a 405, Peugeot won the Dakar Rally four times in a row from 1987 to 1990; three times with Vatanen and once with Kankkunen. In 2015 Peugeot again took part in the Rally Dakar with a newly constructed buggy. For the 2016 Paris-Dakar, Peugeot presented a new team of drivers including 9-time WRC-champion S\u00e9bastien Loeb and 12-time Dakar winner St\u00e9phane Peterhansel who managed to win the 2016 edition for the Peugeot factory team in the Peugeot 2008 DKR. The 2017 edition saw Peugeot make the switch to the new 3008 DKR where Peterhansel won the event for the 13th time in a row. On 31 October 2017, Peugeot announced that it would end its program in the Dakar Rally after the 2018 edition in order to focus on its FIA World Rallycross Championship career. The 2018 event would see Peugeot win for the seventh straight time with ex-World Rally Championship driver Carlos Sainz.\nIn 1999, Peugeot returned to the World Rally Championship with the 206 WRC. The car was immediately competitive against such opposition as the Subaru Impreza WRC, the Ford Focus WRC, and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. Marcus Gr\u00f6nholm gave the car its first win at the 2000 Swedish Rally, and Peugeot went on to win the manufacturers' title in their first full year since the return, and Gr\u00f6nholm the drivers' title in his first full WRC season. After successfully but narrowly defending their manufacturers' title in 2001, Peugeot Sport dominated the 2002 season, taking eight wins in the hands of Gr\u00f6nholm and Gilles Panizzi. Gr\u00f6nholm also took the drivers' title. For the 2004 season, Peugeot retired the 206 WRC in favour of the new 307 WRC. The 307 WRC did not match its predecessor in success, but Gr\u00f6nholm took three wins with the car, one in 2004 and two in 2005. PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn withdrew Peugeot from the WRC after the 2005 season, while Citro\u00ebn took a sabbatical year in 2006 and returned for the next season. Meanwhile, Gronholm departed Peugeot when they quit at the end of 2005 to partner young compatriot Mikko Hirvonen at Ford.\nPeugeot 207 S2000, winner of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge from 2007 to 2009.\nTouring car racing.\nIn 2013, the Peugeot 208GTi won a one-two-three at the 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring endurance race.\nThe Peugeot 306 GTi won the prestigious Spa 24 hours endurance race in 1999 and 2000.\nPeugeot has been racing successfully in the Asian Touring Car Series, winning the 2000, 2001, and 2002 championships with the Peugeot 306 GTi.\nPeugeot has been racing successfully in the Stock Car Brasil series since 2007 and won the 2008, 2009, and 2011 championships.\nPeugeot won five times the Danish Touringcar Championship, with both the Peugeot 306 -winner in 1999, 2000, and 2001- and the Peugeot 307 winner in 2002 and 2003.\nWith his Peugeot 406, Laurent Aiello won the 1997 Super Tourenwagen Cup season.\nThroughout the mid-1990s, the Peugeot 406 saloon (called a sedan in some countries) contested touring car championships across the world, enjoying success in France, Germany and Australia, yet failing to win a single race in the British Touring Car Championship despite a number of podium finishes under the command of 1992 British Touring Car Champion Tim Harvey. In Gran Turismo 2 the 406 saloon description sums its racing career up as \"a competitive touring car which raced throughout Europe\".\nThe British cars were initially prepared by Peugeot Sport; a team from the Peugeot UK factory in Coventry under the direction of team manager Mick Linford in 1996, with Total sponsorship. Peugeot Sport was not however a full professional race team akin to those of the competition, by now including Williams, Prodrive, Schnitzer and TWR; being as it was run from workshops within the Peugeot factory, largely by factory employees from 1992 to 1996, racing the 405 Mi16 from 1992 to 1995. Peugeot, therefore, contracted Motor Sport Development (MSD; who had developed and run the Honda Accord in the BTCC from 1995 to 1996) to build &amp; run the 406 for 1997\u201398, when they wore a distinctive green and gold-flame design in deference to new sponsor Esso.\nInitially, the 406's lack of success was blamed on suspension problems. During 1998 the 406 apparently lacked sufficient horsepower to compete with the front runners' Nissan Primeras and Honda Accords; this was mentioned during a particularly strong showing from Harvey's 406 at the Oulton Park BTCC meeting of 1998 when motorsport commentator Charlie Cox stated: \"some people say (the 406) is down on power\u00a0\u2013 you're kidding\". During the first BTCC meeting at Silverstone in the same year, Cox mentions that MSD re-designed the 406 touring car \"from the ground up\". It was however widely reported in publications like the now-defunct 'Super Touring' magazine that it was the aero package primarily developed for longer, faster tracks in Germany and France that led to its success there but hindered the 406 on the slower, twistier tracks of the UK.\nIn 2001, Peugeot entered three BTC-T Peugeot 406 Coup\u00e9s into the British Touring Car Championship to compete with the dominant Vauxhall Astra coupes. The 406 coupe was at the end of its product lifecycle and was not competitive, despite some promise towards the end of the year, notably when Peugeot's Steve Soper led a race only to suffer engine failure in the last few laps. The 406 coupes were retired at the end of the following year and replaced with the Peugeot 307\u2014again, uncompetitively in 2003. Alongside the BTC-C 406's; two works-supported 306 GTis were also raced in the BTC-P (Production) class by Simon Harrison and Roger Moen, with Harrison emerging class champion.\nSports car racing.\nIn the 1990s, the company competed in endurance racing, including the World Sportscar Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans race with the 905. The sportscar team was established at V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France. After early problems with reliability and aerodynamics, the 905 was successful in the World Sportscar Championship, winning eight of the 14 races across the 1991 and 1992 seasons and winning the team and driver titles in 1992. Peugeot also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1992 and 1993.\nPeugeot returned to sportscar racing and Le Mans in 2007 with the diesel-powered Peugeot 908 HDi FAP. At the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, St\u00e9phane Sarrazin secured pole position but the 908s proved unreliable and ceded victory to Audi. In 2008, Sarrazin earned a pole position but Audi prevailed once again. For the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Peugeot 908 HDi FAPs finished first and second overall, led by drivers Marc Gen\u00e9, David Brabham, and Alexander Wurz.\nFormula One.\nThe company has also been involved in providing engines to Formula One teams, notably to McLaren in 1994, to Jordan for the 1995, 1996 and 1997 seasons, and to Prost for the 1998, 1999 and 2000 seasons. Despite a number of podium finishes with each of these three teams, the manufacturer did not score any victories, and their F1 interests were sold to Asiatech at the end of the 2000 season.\nPikes Peak Hillclimb.\nIn April 2013, a 208 T16 was tested by S\u00e9bastien Loeb at Mont Ventoux. Loosely based on the shape and design of the production 208, the T16 is a lightweight vehicle that uses the rear wing from the Peugeot 908, and has a 3.2-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine, developing with the aim of competing at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. 30 June 2013 saw this car demolish the standing record on Pikes Peak by over a minute and a half, with an overall time of 8:13.878.\nConcept cars.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2017 film \"Blade Runner 2049\", the main character's flying car (known in-universe as a \"Spinner\") was branded as a Peugeot as part of a proposed advertising campaign to re-enter the US market. The film's production company, Alcon Entertainment, later sued Peugeot in 2019 for failure to hold up their financial and advertising obligations.\nPeugeot Avenue flagship dealerships.\nPeugeot has flagship dealerships, named Peugeot Avenue, located on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris, and in Berlin. The Berlin showroom is larger than the Paris one, but both feature regularly changing mini-exhibitions displaying production and concept cars. Both also feature a small Peugeot Boutique, and they are popular places for Peugeot fans to visit. Peugeot Avenue Berlin also features a caf\u00e9, called Caf\u00e9 de France. The Peugeot Avenue at Berlin closed in 2009.\nMotorcycles.\nThe Peugeot Motocycles company remained a major producer of scooters, underbones, mopeds, and bicycles in Europe, as of 2018. Peugeot produced an electric motor scooter, the Peugeot Scoot'Elec, from 1996 to 2006, and was projected to re-enter the market in 2011 with the E-Vivacity.\nBicycles.\nPeugeot also produced bicycles starting in 1882 in Beaulieu, France (with ten Tour de France wins between 1903 and 1983), followed by motorcycles and cars in 1889. In the late 1980s Peugeot sold the North American rights to the Peugeot bicycle name to ProCycle, a Canadian company which also sold bicycles under the CCM and Velo Sport names. The European rights were briefly sold to Cycleurope S.A., returning to Peugeot in the 1990s. Today, the Peugeot bicycle brand name remains within the Cycleurope S.A. portfolio.\nKitchen- and table-service equipment.\nAs of 2021, the separate Peugeot-family-owned firm Peugeot Saveurs, previously named PSP Peugeot, continues to make and market pepper grinders, salt grinders, corkscrews for wine bottles, cutlery, tableware, and other kitchen- and table-service equipment.\nThe company has produced household mills since the 19th century. Its first coffee mill, the R model, was launched in 1840, followed by large cast-iron grocers\u2019 mills in 1855.Peugeot introduced the Z model table pepper mill in 1874, which remains in production.In the early 21st century, the firm developed patented mechanisms tailored to different spices, including a chilli pre-chopper and a grinder for moist Gu\u00e9rande salt (2003), the adjustable \u201cu\u2019Select\u201d grind system (2004), and a ceramic mechanism to process wet sea salt without clogging (2014).\nThe product range has expanded to include coffee grinders, nutmeg mills, chilli grinders, and spice mills for seeds such as flax or sesame, as well as wine accessories such as corkscrews, decanters, champagne coolers, and vacuum pumps.Peugeot Saveurs also manufactures glazed ceramic ovenware under the \u201cAppolia\u201d brand line.\nProduction remains centered in Quingey, in the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region of France, where most of its mills are manufactured.The firm has been awarded the French Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (Living Heritage Company) label in recognition of its traditional expertise.Peugeot Saveurs reports annual production of more than two million mills and exports to over 80 countries.The company employs around 185 people, most of them at the Quingey facility.Its grinding mechanisms are typically covered by a lifetime guarantee, while the mill bodies carry multi-year warranties.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nicolas Cage stars as a suicidal alcoholic in Los Angeles who, having lost his family and been recently fired, has decided to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. Once there, he develops a romantic relationship with a prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). O'Brien died by suicide after signing away the film rights to the novel.\n\"Leaving Las Vegas\" was filmed in super 16 mm instead of 35 mm film; while 16\u00a0mm was common for art house films at the time, 35\u00a0mm is most commonly used for mainstream film. After limited release in the United States on October 27, 1995, \"Leaving Las Vegas\" was released nationwide on February 9, 1996, receiving strong praise from critics and audiences with many lauding the performances from Cage and Shue, the tone, the themes and Figgis's direction and screenplay. Cage received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actor, while Shue was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actress. The film also received nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director.\nPlot.\nBen Sanderson is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who has lost his job, family, and friends. With nothing left to live for, and with a sizable severance check from his boss, he heads to Las Vegas where he plans on drinking himself to death. One early morning, he drives drunkenly from his Los Angeles home down to the Las Vegas Strip; he nearly hits a woman, Sera, on the crosswalk. She chastises him and walks away.\nSera is a prostitute working for abusive Latvian pimp Yuri Butsov. Russian mobsters are after Yuri, so he ends his relationship with Sera for fear that the Russians might otherwise hurt her.\nOn his second day in Las Vegas, Ben contacts Sera. He introduces himself, and offers her $500 to spend an hour in his room with him. Sera agrees, but Ben does not want sex. Instead, they talk and develop a rapport; Sera invites Ben to move into her apartment. Ben makes Sera promise to never ask that he stop drinking; in return, Ben promises never to criticize her occupation. She thanks him and agrees to his terms.\nAt first, the pair are happy; yet each soon becomes frustrated with the other's behavior. Sera pleads with Ben to consult a rehab clinic, but all her advice is wasted on him. While Sera is working, Ben goes to a casino and returns with another prostitute. Sera returns home to find them in her bed, and throws Ben out. Shortly afterward, Sera is approached by three college students at the Excalibur Hotel and Casino. She initially rejects them, proclaiming that she \"dates\" just one customer at a time. Eventually, however, Sera acquiesces when offered an increased price. After she arrives at the students' hotel room, the trio change their deal by demanding anal sex. When she refuses and attempts to leave, all three violently gang-rape her.\nThe following day, Sera's landlady sees her bruised. She tells Sera to leave by the end of the week. Sera receives a call from Ben, who is on his deathbed. She visits Ben, and the two make love; he dies shortly thereafter. Later, Sera tells her therapist that she accepted Ben for who he was, and that she loved him.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nMike Figgis based \"Leaving Las Vegas\" on a 1990 autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, who died by suicide in April 1994, shortly after finding out his novel was being used as the basis for a film. Despite basing most of his screenplay on O'Brien's novel, Figgis spoke of a personal attachment to the novel, stating \"Anything I would do would be because I had a sympathetic feeling towards it. That's why I did \"Mr. Jones\", because I think manic-depression is a fascinating, sad, and amazing phenomenon. It's not a coincidence that some of the greatest artists have been manic-depressives. That made it, to me, a fascinating subject that, alas, did not come out in the film.\"\nCasting.\nFiggis encouraged the lead actors to experience their characters' ordeals first-hand by extensive research. He told \"Film Critic\": \"It was just a week and a half of rehearsal. A lot of conversations. A lot of communication in the year before we made the film. Reading the book. I encouraged them [Cage and Shue] to do their own research, which they wanted to do anyway, and then ultimately the three of us got together and just started talking...talking about anything, not necessarily about the film or the script, about anything that came up.\" Cage did research by binge drinking in Dublin for two weeks and had a friend videotape him so he could study his speech. He said \"it was one of the most enjoyable pieces of research I've ever had to do for a part.\" Shue spent time interviewing several Las Vegas prostitutes.\nFilming.\nThe limited budget dictated the production and Figgis ended up filming in super 16mm and composing his own score. He said \"We didn't have any money, and we weren't pretending to be something we weren't. We couldn't shut down The Strip to shoot\". Cage recounted that he found the use of 16mm liberating as an actor stating in a 1995 interview with Roger Ebert: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"As an actor, having a 16-mm. camera in my face was liberating because it's much smaller, so you don't feel as intimidated by it. It catches those little nuances. Because as soon as that big camera's in your face, you tense up a little bit. Film acting is a learning experience about how to get over that, but I don't know that you ever really do.\"\nFiggis had problems because permits were not issued for some street scenes. This caused him to film some scenes on the Las Vegas strip in one take to avoid the police, which Figgis said benefited production and the authenticity of the acting, remarking \"I've always hated the convention of shooting on a street, and then having to stop the traffic, and then having to tell the actors, 'Well, there's meant to be traffic here, so you're going to have to shout.' And they're shouting, but it's quiet and they feel really stupid, because it's unnatural. You put them up against a couple of trucks, with it all happening around them, and their voices become great\". Filming took place over 28 days during the autumn of 1994.\nRelease.\nBox office.\n\"Leaving Las Vegas\" had a limited release on October 27, 1995. As it won awards from multiple film critics\u2019 organizations and earned four Academy Award nominations, the film's release was expanded and it ultimately opened nationwide on February 9, 1996. United Artists distributed the film in North America, while RCV Film Distribution and Atalanta Filmes handled the European release, and 21st Century Film Corporation distributed the film in Australia. MGM/UA reportedly spent less than $2 million marketing the film, which included TV spots and ads in industry publications.\nThe film was a success at the box office, particularly considering its budget, grossing $49.8 million.\nCritical reception.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 91% based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Oscar-awarded Nicolas Cage finds humanity in his character as it bleeds away in this no frills, exhilaratingly dark portrait of destruction.\" It also holds a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 23 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nRoger Ebert from \"Chicago Sun-Times\" and Rick Groen from \"The Globe and Mail\" gave the film high marks. Ebert wrote, \"If there are two unplayable roles in the stock repertory, they are the drunk and the whore with a heart of gold. Cage and Shue make these cliches into unforgettable people.\" Ebert named the film \"best of 1995\", and would eventually rank it as the eighth best film of the 1990s.\nLeonard Klady from \"Variety\" wrote \"Leaving Las Vegas\" was \"certainly among a scant handful of films that have taken an unflinching view of dependency.\"\nCharles Switzer writing for \"Bright Lights Film Journal\" in 2025 said, \"Even after three decades, \"Leaving Las Vegas\" remains a raw and powerful experience for its ability to portray heavy scenes that do not offer the viewer any reprieve or hope whatsoever. It stands as a testament to the power of indie filmmaking to provoke, challenge, and deeply move audiences through bold and unconventional artistry.\"\nHome media.\nThe VHS and DVD of the film were released by MGM Home Entertainment. The VHS was released on November 12, 1996 in two languages, English and Russian, while the DVD was released on January 1, 1998 in English, in the USA and Canada. Australian and UK editions later were released. The DVD contains a supplemental \"Hidden Page\" menu feature.\nThe film was also released on Blu-ray, HD DVD, and LaserDisc.\nSoundtrack.\nA soundtrack album, consisting mainly of film score composed and performed by Mike Figgis, was released November 7, 1995. The soundtrack also included three jazz standards performed by Sting and excerpts of dialogue from the film. A version of \"Lonely Teardrops\" performed by Michael McDonald from \"\" that features in the film is not included.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His reign of nearly 32 years is the longest verified of any pope in history and second only to Saint Peter according to Catholic tradition. He was notable for convoking the First Vatican Council in 1868 which defined the dogma of papal infallibility before taking a break in summer of 1870. The council never reconvened. At the same time, France started the French-Prussian War and removed the troops that protected the Papal States, which allowed the Capture of Rome by the Kingdom of Italy on 20 September 1870. Thereafter, he refused to leave Vatican City, declaring himself a \"prisoner in the Vatican\".\nAt the time of his election, he was a liberal reformer, and during his early papacy, he enacted progressive reforms, but his approach changed after the Revolutions of 1848. When his prime minister, Pellegrino Rossi, was assassinated and Pius himself was made prisoner in his own palace, he fled Rome and excommunicated all participants in the short-lived Roman Republic. After its suppression by the French army and his return in 1850, his policies and doctrinal pronouncements became increasingly conservative. He was responsible for the kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, a six-year-old taken by force from his Jewish family who went on to become a Catholic priest in his own right and unsuccessfully attempted to convert his Jewish parents.\nIn his 1849 encyclical \"Ubi primum\", he emphasized Mary's role in salvation. In 1854, he promulgated the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, articulating a long-held Catholic belief that Mary, the Mother of God, was conceived without original sin. His 1864 \"Syllabus of Errors\" was a strong condemnation of liberalism, modernism, moral relativism, secularization, separation of church and state, and other Enlightenment ideas.\nHis appeal for financial support revived global donations known as Peter's Pence. He strengthened the central power of the Holy See and Roman Curia over the worldwide Catholic Church, while also formalizing the pope's ultimate doctrinal authority (the dogma of papal infallibility defined in 1870). Pope John Paul II beatified him in 2000.\nEarly life and ministry.\nGiovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti was born on 13 May 1792 in Senigallia. He was the ninth child born into the noble family of Girolamo dei Conti Mastai-Ferretti (1750\u20131833), grandnephew of , and wife Caterina Antonia Maddalena Solazzei di Fano (1764\u20131842). He was baptized on the day of his birth with the names Giovanni Maria Battista Pietro Pellegrino Isidoro. He was educated at the Piarist College in Volterra and in Rome. An unreliable account published many years later suggests that the young Count Mastai was engaged to the daughter of the Protestant Church of Ireland Bishop of Kilmore, William Foster. If there was ever any such engagement, it did not proceed.\nIn 1814, as a theology student in his hometown of Senigallia, he met Pope Pius VII, who had returned from French captivity. In 1815, he entered the Papal Noble Guard but was soon dismissed after an epileptic seizure. He threw himself on the mercy of Pius VII, who elevated him and supported his continued theological studies.\nMastai-Ferretti was ordained a priest on 10 April 1819. The Pope had originally insisted that another priest should assist Mastai-Ferretti during Holy Mass, but rescinded the stipulation after the seizures became less frequent. He initially worked as the rector of the Tata Giovanni Institute in Rome.\nShortly before his death, Pius VII \u2013 following Chilean leader Bernardo O'Higgins' wish to have the Pope reorganize the Catholic Church of the new republic \u2013 named him auditor to assist the apostolic nuncio, Monsignore Giovanni Muzi, in the first mission to post-revolutionary South America. The mission had the objective to map out the role of the Catholic Church in Chile and its relationship with the state, but when it finally arrived in Santiago in March 1824, O'Higgins had been overthrown and replaced by General Ram\u00f3n Freire, who was less well-disposed toward the Church and had already taken hostile measures such as the seizure of Church property. Having ended in failure, the mission returned to Europe. Nevertheless, Mastai-Ferretti had been the first future pope ever to have been in the Americas. Upon his return to Rome, the successor of Pius VII, Pope Leo XII, appointed him head of the hospital of San Michele a Ripa in Rome (1825\u20131827) and canon of Santa Maria in Via Lata.\nLeo XII appointed the 35-year-old Mastai-Ferretti Archbishop of Spoleto in 1827. In 1831, the abortive revolution that had begun in Parma and Modena spread to Spoleto; the Archbishop obtained a general pardon after it was suppressed, gaining him a reputation for being liberal. During an earthquake, he made a reputation as an efficient organizer of relief and great charity. The following year he was moved to the more prestigious Diocese of Imola, was made a cardinal \"in pectore\" in 1839, and in 1840 was publicly announced as cardinal-priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano. As in Spoleto, his episcopal priorities were the formation of priests through improved education and charities. He became known for visiting prisoners in jail and for programs for street children. Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti was considered a liberal during his episcopate in Spoleto and Imola because he supported administrative changes in the Papal States and sympathized with the nationalist movement in Italy.\nElection.\nThe conclave of 1846, following the death of Pope Gregory XVI (1831\u20131846), took place in an unsettled political climate within Italy. The conclave was steeped in a factional division between right and left. The conservatives on the right favoured the hardline stances and papal absolutism of the previous pontificate, while liberals supported moderate reforms. The conservatives supported Luigi Lambruschini, the late pope's Cardinal Secretary of State. Liberals supported two candidates: Tommaso Pasquale Gizzi and the then 54-year-old Mastai Ferretti.\nDuring the first ballot, Mastai-Ferretti received 15 votes, the rest going to Lambruschini and Gizzi. Lambruschini received a majority of the votes in the early ballots but failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority. Gizzi was favoured by the French government but failed to get further support from the cardinals, and the conclave ended up ultimately as a contest between Lambruschini and Mastai-Ferretti. In the meantime, Cardinal Tommaso Bernetti reportedly received information that Cardinal Karl Kajetan von Gaisruck, the Austrian Archbishop of Milan, was on his way to the conclave to veto the election of Mastai-Ferretti on behalf of the Austrian Empire and Prince Metternich. According to historian Val\u00e9rie Pirie, Bernetti realized that he had only a few hours in which to stop Lambruschini's election.\nFaced with a deadlock and urgently persuaded by Bernetti to reject Lambruschini, liberals and moderates decided to cast their votes for Mastai-Ferretti, in a move that contradicted the general mood throughout Europe. On the evening of the second day of the conclave, 16 June 1846, Mastai-Ferretti was elected pope. \"He was a glamorous candidate, ardent, emotional with a gift for friendship and a track-record of generosity even towards anti-Clericals and Carbonari. He was a patriot, known to be critical of Gregory XVI.\" Because it was night, no formal announcement was given, just the signal of white smoke.\nOn the following morning, the Cardinal protodeacon, Tommaso Riario Sforza, announced the election of Mastai Ferretti before a crowd of faithful Catholics. When Mastai-Ferretti appeared on the balcony, the mood became joyous. He chose the name of Pius IX in honour of Pope Pius VII, who had encouraged his vocation to the priesthood despite his childhood epilepsy. However, the new pope had little diplomatic experience and no curial experience at all. Pius IX was crowned on 21 June 1846.\nThe election of the liberal Pius IX created much enthusiasm in Europe and elsewhere. \"For the next twenty months after the election, Pius IX was the most popular man on the Italian peninsula, where the exclamation \"Long life to Pius IX!\" was often heard.\nEnglish Protestants celebrated him as a \"friend of light\" and a reformer of Europe towards freedom and progress. He was elected without secular political influences and in the full vigor of life. He was pious, progressive, intellectual, decent, friendly, and open to all. While his political views and policies were hotly debated in the coming years, his personal lifestyle was above reproach, a model of simplicity and poverty in everyday affairs.\nPapacy.\nCardinal Mastai Ferretti entered the papacy in 1846, amidst widespread expectations that he would be a champion of reform and modernization in the Papal States, which he ruled directly, and in the entire Catholic Church. Admirers wanted him to lead the battle for Italian independence. His later turn toward profound conservatism shocked and dismayed his original supporters, while surprising and delighting the conservative old guard.\nCentralization of the church.\nThe most notable event in Pius IX's long pontificate was the end of the Papal States, which lay in the middle of the \"Italian boot\" around the central area of Rome. In contrast, he led the worldwide Church toward an ever-increasing centralization and consolidation of power in Rome and the papacy. More than his predecessors, Pius used the papal pulpit to address the bishops of the world. The First Vatican Council (1869\u20131870), which he convened to consolidate papal authority further, was considered a milestone not only in his pontificate but also in ecclesiastical history through its defining of the dogma of papal infallibility.\nDispute with the Melkite Greek Catholic Church.\nAfter the First Vatican Council concluded, an emissary of the Roman Curia was dispatched to secure the signatures of Patriarch Gregory II Youssef and the rest of the Melkite delegation who had voted \"non placet\" at the general congregation and left Rome prior to the adoption of the dogmatic constitution \"Pastor aeternus\" on papal infallibility. Gregory and the Melkite bishops ultimately subscribed to it, but added the qualifying clause used at the Council of Florence: \"except the rights and privileges of Eastern patriarchs.\" This earned Gregory the enmity of Pius IX; during his next visit to the pontiff, before leaving Rome, when Gregory was kneeling, Pius placed his knee on the patriarch's shoulder, just saying to him: \"Testa dura!\" (\"You obstinate man!\"). In spite of this event, Gregory and the Melkite Greek Catholic Church remained committed to their union with the Holy See.\nEcclesiastical rights.\nThe ecclesiastical policies of Pius IX were dominated by defence of the rights of the church and the free exercise of religion for Catholics in countries such as Russia and the Ottoman Empire. He also fought against what he perceived to be anti-Catholic philosophies in countries such as Italy, Germany, and France. The German Empire sought to restrict and weaken the Church for a decade after the Franco-Prussian War.\nJubilees.\nPius IX celebrated several jubilees including the 300th anniversary of the Council of Trent. Pius celebrated the 1,800th anniversary of the martyrdom of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul on 29 June 1867 with 512 bishops, 20,000 priests and 140,000 lay persons in Rome. A large gathering was organized in 1871 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his papacy. Though the Italian government in 1870 outlawed many popular pilgrimages, the faithful of Bologna organized a nationwide \"spiritual pilgrimage\" to the pope and the tombs of the apostles in 1873. In 1875, Pius declared a Holy Year that was celebrated throughout the Catholic world. On the 50th anniversary of his episcopal consecration, people from all parts of the world came to see the old pontiff from 30 April 1877 to 15 June 1877. He was a bit shy, but he valued initiative within the church and created several new titles, rewards, and orders to elevate those who in his view deserved merit.\nConsistories.\nPius IX created 122 new cardinals, of whom 64 were alive at his death; at the time membership in the College of Cardinals was limited to 70. Noteworthy elevations included Vincenzo Pecci (his eventual successor Leo XIII); Nicholas Wiseman of Westminster; the convert Henry Edward Manning; and John McCloskey, the first American cardinal.\nAccording to Bishop Cipriano Calder\u00f3n, the pope intended to make the Bishop of Michoac\u00e1n, Juan Cayetano G\u00f3mez de Portugal y Sol\u00eds, a cardinal in 1850 and even had Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli send a letter to him to express his intentions. He would have been the first Latin American cardinal had he not died before the next consistory. According to the Benedictine monk Guy-Marie Oury, a letter addressed by Prosper Gu\u00e9ranger to his Benedictine colleague L\u00e9andre Fonteinne on 6 March 1856 indicated that Gu\u00e9ranger had learned that Pius IX wanted to name him a cardinal in November 1855, but he refused the honor because he did not want to live in Rome. As a result, Pius IX made the Bishop of La Rochelle Cl\u00e9ment Villecourt a cardinal instead.\nOn 22 August 1861, the pope informed the Patriarch of Venice Angelo Ramazzotti that he would name him a cardinal, however, Ramazzoti died three days before the consistory. Also in 1861, the dean of the Sacred Rota Ignazio Alberghini declined the pope's offer of nomination into the Sacred College. In December 1863, Pius IX intended to elevate the Archbishop of Gniezno and Pozna\u0144 Leon Micha\u0142 Przy\u0142uski to the cardinalate, but he died before the consistory took place. In 1866, Pius IX wanted to nominate a Barnabite to the College of Cardinals before he opened the First Vatican Council. While the pope originally decided on appointing Carlo Vercellone, a noted biblical scholar, Vercellone refused due to his precarious health, instead proposing that Pius IX instead nominate Luigi Bilio. In 1868, Pius IX nominated Andre Pila to the cardinalate, however, he died the day before he would have been elevated as the only person for elevation in that April consistory. Also in 1868, Pius IX offered the cardinalate to the Bishop of Concepci\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Hip\u00f3lito Salas whom he had met during the First Vatican Council, inviting him to join the Roman Curia. However, the bishop preferred to live in Chile and declined the offer, while Pius IX did not offer it again in the future.\nIn 1875, Pius IX intended to nominate the papal almoner Xavier de M\u00e9rode to the Sacred College, however, he died just eight months before the consistory was to be held. Pius IX also decided to nominate Augusto Negroni, a longtime Curial official, but he declined and instead joined the Society of Jesus in mid-1874.\nCanonizations and beatifications.\nPope Pius IX canonized 52 saints during his pontificate. He canonized notable saints such as the Martyrs of Japan (8 June 1862), Josaphat Kuntsevych (29 June 1867), and Nicholas Pieck (29 June 1867). Pius IX further beatified 222 individuals throughout his papacy, including the likes of Benedict Joseph Labre, Peter Claver, and his two predecessors Pope Eugene III and Pope Urban V.\nDoctors of the Church.\nPius IX named three new Doctors of the Church: Hilary of Poitiers (13 May 1851, naming him \"\" or \"Doctor of the Divinity of Christ\"), Alphonsus Liguori (23 March 1871, naming him \"\" or \"Most Zealous Doctor\"), and Francis de Sales (19 July 1877, naming him \"\" or \"Doctor of Charity\").\nSovereignty of the Papal States.\nPius IX was not only pope but, until 1870, also the last sovereign ruler of the Papal States. As a secular ruler he was occasionally referred to as \"king\", though it is unclear whether the Holy See ever accepted this title. Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger, a fervent critic of Pius' infallibility dogma, considered the political regime of the pope in the Papal States \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\". Yet there was controversy. In the period before the 1848 revolutions, Pius was a most ardent reformer advised by such innovative thinkers as Antonio Rosmini (1797\u20131855), who reconciled the new free-thinking concerning human rights with the classical natural law tradition of the church's political and economic teaching on social justice. After the revolution, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were minimal, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above.\nReforms in the Papal States.\nPius IX's liberal policies initially made him very popular throughout Italy. He appointed an able and enlightened minister, Pellegrino Rossi, to administer the Papal States. He also showed himself hostile to Austrian influences, delighting Italian patriots, who hailed him as the coming redeemer of Italy. He once declared, \"They want to make a Napoleon of me who am only a poor country parson.\"\nIn Pius' early years as pope, the government of the Papal States improved agricultural technology and productivity via farmer education in newly created scientific agricultural institutes. It abolished the requirements for Jews to attend Christian services and sermons and opened the papal charities to the needy amongst them. The new pope freed all political prisoners by giving amnesty to revolutionaries, which horrified the conservative monarchies in the Austrian Empire and elsewhere. \"He was celebrated in New York City, London and Berlin as a model ruler.\"\nGovernmental structure.\nIn 1848, Pius IX released a new constitution titled the \"Fundamental Statute for the Secular Government of the States of the Church\". The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy. The secular or laypersons were strongly in the majority with 6,850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. Nevertheless, the clergy made key decisions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his parish priest to be considered.\nFinance.\nFinancial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX was increasingly put in the hands of laymen. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX. In 1850, he created a government finance body (\"congregation\") consisting of four laymen with finance backgrounds for the 20 provinces. After joining the Latin Monetary Union in 1866, the old Roman scudo was replaced by the new papal lira.\nCommerce and trade.\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve manufacturing and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of wool, silk and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and seaports. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It soon became apparent that the Northern Italians were more adept at economically exploiting the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.\nJustice.\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to much criticism, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. Legal books were scarce, standards inconsistent, and judges were often accused of favoritism. In the Papal States and throughout Italy, organized criminal gangs threatened commerce and travelers, engaging in robbery and murder at will.\nMilitary.\nThe Papal army in 1859 had 15,000 soldiers. A separate military body, the elite Swiss Guard, served as the Pope's personal bodyguard.\nUniversities.\nThe two papal universities in Rome and Bologna suffered much from revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate. Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in 1851. During his tenure, Catholics and Protestants collaborated to found a school in Rome to study international law and train international mediators committed to conflict resolution. There was one newspaper, \"Giornale di Roma\", and one periodical, \"La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica\", run by Jesuits.\nArts.\nLike most of his predecessors, Pius IX was a patron of the arts. He supported architecture, painting, sculpture, music, goldsmiths, coppersmiths, and more, and handed out numerous rewards to artists. Much of his efforts went to renovate and improve churches in Rome and the Papal States. He ordered the strengthening of the Colosseum, which was feared to be on the verge of collapse. Huge sums were spent in the excavation of the Christian Catacombs of Rome, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853.\nJews.\nThe Papal States were a theocracy in which the Catholic Church and its members had far more rights than other religions. Pius IX's religious policies became increasingly reactionary over time. At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened up the Jewish ghetto in Rome, freeing Jews to reside elsewhere. In 1850, after French troops defeated the revolutionary Roman Republic and returned him from exile, the Pope reversed the Republic's religious freedom laws and issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Jewish ghetto.\nIn a highly publicized case from 1858, the police of the Papal States seized a 6-year-old Jewish boy, Edgardo Mortara, from his parents. A Christian servant girl unrelated to the family claimed she had informally baptized him during an illness six years prior, fearing he would die. This had made the child legally a Christian convert, and Papal law forbade Christians from being raised by Jews, even their own parents. The incident provoked widespread outrage amongst liberals, both Catholic and non-Catholic, and contributed to the growing anti-papal sentiment in Europe. The boy was raised in the papal household, and was eventually ordained a priest at age 21.\nPolicies toward other nations.\nPius IX was the last pope who also functioned as a secular ruler and the monarch of the Papal States, ruling over some 3 million subjects from 1846 to 1870, when the newly founded Kingdom of Italy seized the remaining areas of the Papal States by force of arms. Contention between Italy and the Papacy was only resolved legally by the 1929 Lateran Treaty (\"Lateran Pacts\" or \"Lateran Accords\") between the Kingdom of Italy under Mussolini and the Holy See, the latter receiving financial compensation for the loss of the Papal States and recognition of the Vatican City State as the sovereign independent territory of the Holy See.\nItaly.\nThough he was well aware upon his accession of the political pressures within the Papal States, Pius IX's first act was a general amnesty for political prisoners, despite the potential consequences. The freed revolutionaries resumed their previous political activities, and his concessions only provoked greater demands as patriotic Italian groups sought not only a constitutional government \u2013 to which he was sympathetic \u2013 but also the unification of Italy under his leadership and a war of liberation to free the northern Italian provinces from the rule of Catholic Austria.\nBy early 1848, all of Western Europe began to be convulsed in various revolutionary movements. The Pope, claiming to be above national interests, refused to go to war with Austria, which reversed Pius' popularity in his native Italy. In a calculated, well-prepared move, Prime Minister Rossi was assassinated on 15 November 1848, and in the days following, the Swiss Guards were disarmed, making the Pope a prisoner in his palace. However, he succeeded in escaping Rome several days later.\nA Roman Republic was declared in February 1849. Pius responded from his exile by excommunicating all participants. After the suppression of the republic later that year, Pius appointed a conservative government of three cardinals known as the Red Triumvirate to administer the Papal States until his return to Rome in April 1850. He visited the hospitals to comfort the wounded and sick, but he seemed to have lost both his liberal tastes and his confidence in the Romans, who had turned against him in 1848. Pius decided to move his residence from the Quirinal Palace inside Rome to the Vatican, where popes have lived ever since.\nEnd of the Papal States.\nAfter defeating the Papal army on 18 September 1860 at the Battle of Castelfidardo, and on 30 September at Ancona, Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia took all the Papal territories except Latium with Rome and took the title King of Italy. Rome itself was invaded on 20 September 1870 after a few-hours siege. Italy instituted the Law of Guarantees (13 May 1871) which gave the Pope the use of the Vatican but denied him sovereignty over this territory, nevertheless granting him the right to send and receive ambassadors and a budget of 3.25\u00a0million lira annually. Pius IX officially rejected this offer (encyclical \"Ubi nos\", 15 May 1871), since it was a unilateral decision which did not grant the papacy international recognition and could be changed at any time by the secular parliament.\nPius IX refused to recognize the new Italian kingdom, which he denounced as an illegitimate creation of revolution. He excommunicated the nation's leaders, including King Victor Emmanuel II, whom he denounced as \"forgetful of every religious principle, despising every right, trampling upon every law,\" whose reign over Italy was therefore \"a sacrilegious usurpation.\"\nMexico.\nIn response to the upheavals faced by the Papal States during the 1848 revolutions, the Mexican government offered Pope Pius IX asylum, which the pope responded to by considering the creation of a Mexican cardinal and granting an award to President Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera. With French Emperor Napoleon III's military intervention in Mexico and establishment of the Second Mexican Empire under Maximilian I in 1864, the church sought relief from a friendly government after the anti-clerical actions of Benito Ju\u00e1rez, who had suspended payment on foreign debt and seized ecclesial property.\nPius blessed Maximilian and his wife Charlotte of Belgium before they set off for Mexico to begin their reign. But the friction between the Vatican and Mexico would continue with the new emperor when Maximilian insisted on freedom of religion, which Pius opposed. Relations with the Vatican would only be resumed when Maximilian sent the recently converted American Catholic priest Father Agustin Fischer to Rome as his envoy.\nContrary to Fischer's reports back to Maximilian, the negotiations did not go well and the Vatican would not budge. Maximilian sent his wife Charlotte to Europe to plead with Napoleon III against the withdrawal of French troops from Mexico. After unsuccessful meetings with Napoleon III, Charlotte travelled to Rome to plead with Pius in 1866. As the days passed, Charlotte's mental state deteriorated. She sought refuge with the pope, and she would eat and drink only what was prepared for him, fearful that everything else might be poisoned. The pope, though alarmed, accommodated her, and even agreed to let her stay in the Vatican one night after she voiced anxiety about her safety. She and her assistant were the first women to stay the night inside the Vatican.\nEngland and Wales.\nEngland for centuries was considered missionary territory for the Catholic Church. In the wake of Catholic emancipation in the United Kingdom (which included all of Ireland), Pius IX changed that with the bull \"Universalis Ecclesiae\" (29 September 1850). He re-established the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, under the newly appointed Archbishop and Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman with 12 additional episcopal seats: Southwark, Hexham, Beverley, Liverpool, Salford, Shrewsbury, Newport, Clifton, Plymouth, Nottingham, Birmingham, and Northampton. Some violent street protests against the \"papal aggression\" resulted in the passage of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851, which forbade any Catholic bishop to use an episcopal title \"of any city, town or place, or of any territory or district (under any designation or description whatsoever), in the United Kingdom\". The law was never enforced and was repealed twenty years later.\nIreland.\nPius donated money to Ireland during the Great Famine. In 1847, he addressed the suffering Irish people in the encyclical \"Praedecessores nostros\".\nNetherlands.\nThe Dutch government instituted religious freedom for Catholics in 1848. In 1853, Pius erected the Archdiocese of Utrecht and four dioceses in Haarlem, Den Bosch, Breda, and Roermond under it. As in England, this resulted in a brief popular outburst of anti-Catholic sentiment.\nSpain.\nTraditionally Catholic Spain offered a challenge to Pius IX as anti-clerical governments came to power in 1832, resulting in the expulsion of religious orders; the closing of convents, Catholic schools and libraries; the seizure and sale of churches and religious properties; and the inability of the church to fill vacant dioceses. In 1851, Pius IX concluded a concordat with Queen Isabella II stipulating that unsold ecclesial properties were to be returned, while the church renounced properties that had already passed to new owners. This flexibility of Pius led to Spain guaranteeing the freedom of the church in religious education.\nUnited States.\nPope Pius IX approved on 7 February 1847 the unanimous request of the American bishops that the Immaculate Conception be invoked as the Patroness of the United States. Beginning in October 1862, the Pope began sending public letters to Catholic leaders in the United States calling for an end to the \"destructive Civil War.\" According to historian Don H. Doyle, however, \"During the American Civil War, the pope ... urged American bishops to call for peace at a time when peace meant separation, and privately he expressed strong sympathies with the South. The Confederacy sent envoys to enlist Pio Nono in their cause and came away boasting the most powerful pontiff in Europe had recognized the Confederacy. The pope said nothing to refute such claims...\"\nThe Vatican never recognized the Confederate States of America or sent any diplomats to it. However, in 1863 the pope did meet privately with a Confederate envoy and suggested gradual emancipation. A letter of Pius IX to Jefferson Davis in December 1863, addressing him as \"Praesidi foederatorum Americae regionum\" (President of the federated regions of America), was not seen as recognition of the Confederacy, even by its own officials: Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin interpreted it as \"a mere inferential recognition, unconnected with political action or the regular establishment of diplomatic relations\" without the weight of formal recognition. Pius IX elevated Archbishop John McCloskey of New York as the first American to the College of Cardinals on 15 March 1875.\nCanada.\nPius IX increased the number of Canadian dioceses from four to 21, with 1,340 churches and 1,620 priests in 1874.\nConcordats.\nPius IX signed concordats with Spain, Austria, Tuscany, Portugal, Haiti, Honduras, Ecuador, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Russia.\nAustria.\nThe 1848 revolution had mixed results for the Catholic Church in Austria-Hungary. It freed the church from the heavy hand of the state in its internal affairs, which was applauded by Pius IX. Similar to other countries, Austria-Hungary had significant anti-Catholic political movements, mainly liberals, which forced the emperor Franz-Joseph I in 1870 to renounce the Concordat of 1855 with the Vatican. Austria had already in 1866 nullified several of its sections concerning the freedom of Catholic schools and prohibition of civil marriages. After diplomatic approaches failed, Pius responded on 7 March 1874 with the encyclical \"Vix dum a nobis\", demanding religious freedom and freedom of education. Despite these developments, there was no equivalent to the German Kulturkampf in Austria, and Pius created new dioceses throughout Austria-Hungary.\nGerman Empire.\nIn Germany, the state of Prussia, under the leadership of Otto von Bismarck, saw Catholicism as a dangerous foreign influence, and in 1872\u20131878 fought hard to reduce the power of the pope and the bishops. After years of struggle in the Kulturkampf, the Catholics fought back by mobilising their voters in Prussia and in Germany as a whole. After Pius died, Bismarck came to terms with the new Pope Leo XIII. He dropped his alliance with the anti-Catholic Liberals and instead formed a political coalition with the Catholic Centre Party.\nRussian Empire.\nThe Pontificate of Pius IX began in 1847 with an \"Accomodamento\", a generous agreement, which allowed Pius to fill vacant episcopal sees of the Latin rites both in Russia (specifically the Baltic countries) and in the Polish provinces of Russia. The short-lived freedoms were undermined by the Russian Orthodox Church, Polish political aspirations in the occupied lands, and the tendency of imperial Russia to act against any dissent. Pius first tried to position himself in the middle, strongly opposing revolutionary and violent opposition against the Russian authorities and appealing to them for more ecclesiastical freedom. After the failure of the Polish uprising in 1863, Pius sided with the persecuted Poles, protesting against their persecutions, and infuriating the Tsarist government to the point that all Catholic dioceses were eliminated by 1870. Pius criticized the Tsar\u00a0\u2013 without naming him\u00a0\u2013 for expatriating whole communities to Siberia, exiling priests, condemning them to labour camps and abolishing Catholic dioceses. He pointed to Siberian villages Tounka and Irkout, where in 1868, 150 Catholic priests were awaiting death.\nPlans to leave Rome.\nSeveral times during his pontificate, Pius IX considered moving from Rome. On 24 November 1848, facing a rebellion by Italian nationalists, he fled to Gaeta in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, returning in 1850. On 26 July 1862, when Giuseppe Garibaldi and his volunteers marching in Rome were stopped at Aspromonte, Pius IX asked the British envoy Odo Russell if he would be granted political asylum in England after the Italian troops had marched in. Russell assured him of asylum if the need arose, but said that he was sure that the Pope's fears were unfounded. In 1870, after the Capture of Rome and the suspension of the First Vatican Council, Otto von Bismarck confided that Pius IX had asked whether Prussia could grant him asylum. Bismarck did not object, adding \"it would be very useful to us to be recognised by Catholics as what we really are, that is to say, the sole power now existing that is capable of protecting the head of their Church. ... But the King (Wilhelm I) will not consent. He is terribly afraid. He thinks all Prussia would be perverted and he himself would be obliged to become a Catholic. I told him, however, that if the Pope begged for asylum he could not refuse it.\"\nTheology.\nPius was adamant about his role as the highest teaching authority in the church, as expressed in the dogma of Papal infallibility defined by the First Vatican Council in 1870.\nMariology.\nMarian doctrines featured prominently in 19th-century theology, especially the issue of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. During his pontificate, petitions increased requesting the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception. In 1848, Pius appointed a theological commission to analyse the possibility for a Marian dogma. On 8 December 1854, he promulgated the apostolic constitution \"Ineffabilis Deus\", defining the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\nEncyclicals.\nPius issued a record 38 encyclicals. They include:\nUnlike popes in the 20th century, Pius IX did not use encyclicals to explain the faith, but to condemn what he considered errors. He was the first pope to popularize encyclicals on a large scale to foster his views.\nFirst Vatican Council.\nAfter prior consultation of the hierarchy in \"Ubi primum\" (see above), Pius decisively acted on the century-old disagreement between Dominicans and Franciscans regarding the Immaculate Conception of Mary, deciding in favour of the Franciscan view. However, his defining this infallible dogma raised a question: Can a pope make such decisions without the authority of the bishops? This doctrine of papal infallibility, enhancing the role of the papacy and decreasing the role of the bishops, became a topic of the First Vatican Council convened in 1869.\nInstitutions.\nPius IX approved 74 new religious congregations for women alone. In France, he created over 200 new dioceses and created new hierarchies in several countries. He supported Catholic associations such as the Ambrosian Circle in Italy, the Union of Catholic Workers in France, and the Pius Verein and the Deutsche Katholische Gesellschaft in Germany, whose purpose was to bring the fullness of Catholic faith to people outside the church.\nLater years and death.\nSince 1868, the pope had been plagued first by facial erysipelas and then by open sores on his legs. Nevertheless, he insisted on celebrating daily Mass. The extraordinary heat of the summer of 1877 worsened the sores to the effect that he had to be carried. He underwent several painful medical procedures with remarkable patience. He spent most of his last few weeks in his library, where he received cardinals and held papal audiences. On 8 December, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, his situation improved markedly to the point that he could walk again.\nBy February, he could say Mass again on his own in a standing position, enjoying the popular celebration of the 75th anniversary of his First Communion. Bronchitis, a fall to the floor, and rising temperature worsened his situation after 4 February 1878. He continued joking about himself: when the Cardinal Vicar of Rome ordered bell-ringing and non-stop prayers for his recuperation, the pope asked, \"Why do you want to stop me from going to heaven?\" He told his doctor that his time had come.\nPius IX lived just long enough to witness the death of his old adversary, Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, in January 1878. As soon as he learned about the seriousness of the situation of the king, he absolved him of all excommunications and other ecclesiastical punishments. Pius IX died one month later on 7 February 1878 at 5:40\u00a0pm, aged 85, while saying the rosary with his staff. The cause of death was epilepsy, which led to a seizure and a sudden heart attack. His last words were, \"Guard the Church I loved so well and sacredly\", as recorded by the cardinals kneeling beside his bedside. His death concluded the second-longest pontificate in papal history, after that of Saint Peter, who tradition holds had reigned for 37 years.\nHis body was originally buried in the Vatican Grottoes, but was moved in a night procession on 13 July 1881 to the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls. When the cortege approached the Tiber River, a group of anticlerical Romans screaming \"Long live Italy! Death to the Pope! Death to the Priests!\" threatened to throw the coffin into the river but a contingent of Carabinieri arrived to prevent this. The simple grave of Pius IX was changed by his successor John Paul II after his beatification.\nBeatification.\nThe process for his beatification, which in the early stages was strongly opposed by the Italian government, was begun on 11 February 1907, and recommenced three times. The Italian government had since 1878 strongly opposed beatification of Pius IX. Without Italian opposition, Pope John Paul II declared Pius IX to be Venerable on 6 July 1985 (upon confirming his life of heroic virtue), and beatified him on 3 September 2000 (his annual liturgical commemoration is 7 February, the date of his death). The beatification of Pius IX was controversial, and was criticized by some Jews and Christians because of what was perceived as his authoritarian and reactionary politics; the accusation of abuse of episcopal powers; and antisemitism (most specifically the case of Edgardo Mortara but also his reinstituting the Roman ghetto).\nLegacy.\nPius IX celebrated his silver jubilee in 1871, going on to have the longest reign in the history of the post-apostolic papacy, 31 years, 7 months, and 23 days. As his temporal sovereignty was lost, the Church rallied around him, and the papacy became more centralized, encouraged by his personal habits of simplicity. Pius IX's pontificate marks the beginning of the modern papacy: from his time on, it has become increasingly a spiritual rather than temporal authority.\nHaving started as a liberal, Pius IX turned conservative after being chased from Rome. Thereafter, he was considered politically conservative, but a restless and radical reformer and innovator of Church life and structures. Church life, religious vocations, new foundations and religious enthusiasm all flourished at the end of his pontificate. Politically, he suffered the isolation of the papacy from most major world powers: \"the prisoner of the Vatican\" had poor relations with Russia, Germany, the United States, and France, and open hostility with Italy. Yet he was most popular with the remaining Catholic faithful in all these countries, in many of which Pope Pius associations were formed in his support. He made lasting ecclesiastical history with his 1854 infallible decision of the Immaculate Conception, which was the basis for the later dogma on the Assumption. His other lasting contribution is the invocation of the First Vatican Council, which promulgated the definition of Papal infallibility. With his advice he helped John Bosco found the Salesian Society, for which reason he is also called \"don Bosco's Pope\".\nEpiscopal lineage.\nThe pope's episcopal lineage, or apostolic succession was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther languages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With over 285,000 in attendance annually, the Adelaide Grand Final is the most attended Supercars race in Australia.\nThe vehicles used in the series are loosely based on road-going cars. Cars are custom made using a control chassis, with only certain body panels being common between the road cars and race cars. The cars are controlled for \"technical parity\" - ensuring that teams and drivers using any of the homologated cars have a chance to build and drive a winning car.\nAll cars currently use either a 5.4L or 5.7L Naturally aspirated V8 engine. Originally only for Ford Falcons and Holden Commodores, the new generation V8 Supercar regulations, introduced in 2013, opened up the series to more manufacturers. Nissan were the first new manufacturer to commit to the series with four Nissan Altima L33s followed briefly by Erebus Motorsport with Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs and Garry Rogers Motorsport with Volvo S60s. The series returned to a Ford and Holden duopoly in 2020 with the departure of Nissan, while Ford replaced the Falcon with the Mustang in 2019. Holden announced its final year of competition in 2022, to be replaced by the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 for the 2023 season. Starting in 2026, Toyota will make its debut in the championship, competing with the GR Supra.\nHistory.\nGroup 3A.\nThe concept of a formula centred around V8-engined Fords and Holdens for the Australian Touring Car Championship had been established as early as mid-1991. With the new regulations set to come into effect in 1993, Ford and Holden were both keen to know the details of the new formula by the end of 1991, putting pressure on the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS) to provide clarity on the matter. However, CAMS was waiting to see what the FIA did with its proposed international formula for 2.5- and 2.0-litre touring cars.\nThe new rules for the ATCC were announced in November 1991 and indicated that the V8 cars would be significantly faster than the smaller-engined cars. In 1992, CAMS looked at closing the performance gap between the classes, only to have protests from Ford and Holden, which did not want to see their cars beaten by the smaller cars. In June 1992, the class structure was confirmed:\nBoth the Ford Falcon EB and Holden Commodore VP ran American-based engines, which were restricted to 7,500 rpm and a compression ratio of 10:1. The Holden teams had the option of using the Group A-developed 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, although this was restricted to the second-tier privateer teams from 1994 onwards, forcing the major Holden runners to use the more expensive Chevrolet engine. The V8s were first eligible to compete in the endurance races of 1992. The distinctive aerodynamics package, consisting of large front and rear spoilers, was designed partly with this in mind, to give the new cars a better chance of beating the Nissan Skyline GT-Rs in those races.\nThe new rules meant that cars such as the turbocharged Nissan Skyline GT-R and Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth were not eligible to compete in 1993, while cars such as the BMW M3 were. However, the M3 received few of the liberal concessions given to the new V8s and also had an extra added to its minimum weight, so with the Class C cars eligible for 1993 only, the German manufacturer's attention switched to the 2.0-litre class for 1994.\nCars from all three classes would contest the 1993 Australian Touring Car Championship, as well as non-championship Australian touring car events such as the Bathurst 1000. However, for the purposes of race classification and points allocation, cars competed in two classes:\nOriginally, the 2.0-litre class cars competed in a separate race to the V8s. This was changed for the second round of 1993 after only nine entrants were in the 2.0-litre class for the first round at Amaroo Park.\nWith the new regulations intended to be a parity formula, protests by the Holden teams indicated that the Fords had an aerodynamic advantage after they won the opening three rounds, beating the Commodores comprehensively. After round five at Winton, Holden was granted a new front and rear wing package. The BMWs were also allowed new splitters and full DTM-specification rear wings. Disparity between the Fords and Holdens continued to be a talking point during the next few years, with various concessions given to each manufacturer to try to equalise the two cars.\nFrom 1995, the 2.0-litre cars, now contesting their own series as super touring cars, became ineligible for the Australian Touring Car Championship. They did not contest the endurance races at Sandown and Bathurst, leaving these open solely to the 5.0-litre Ford and Holden models.\nV8 Supercars.\nThe Australian Vee Eight Super Car Company (AVESCO) \u2013 a joint venture between the Touring Car Entrants Group of Australia (TEGA), sports promoters IMG and the Australian Motor Sports Commission \u2013 was formed in November 1996 to run the series. This set the foundation for the large expansion of the series during the following years. The category also adopted the name 'V8 Supercars' at this time, though the cars themselves were much unchanged. A new television deal with Network Ten and Fox Sports was organised, although this had follow-on effects for the Bathurst 1000 later in the year.\nIn February, Tony Cochrane and James Erskine left IMG. Together with David Coe, they formed Sports and Entertainment Limited (SEL) in April 1997. TEGA would have a 75% share in AVESCO, with SEL owning the other 25%. TEGA was responsible for the rules and technical management of the series and the supply of cars and drivers, while SEL was responsible for capturing and maintaining broadcasting rights, sponsorship, licensing, and sanction agreements.\nThe expansion of the series began in 1998, with the first round to be held in the Northern Territory taking place at Hidden Valley Raceway. In 1999, a new street race on a shortened version of the Adelaide Grand Prix Circuit became one of the first festival-style events, which would become common in later years. Australia's capital city, Canberra, hosted its first event on the Canberra Street Circuit in 2000. In 2001, a championship round was held in New Zealand for the first time, at Pukekohe Park Raceway. In 2002, the V8 Supercar support event at the Indy 300 on the Gold Coast became a championship round, having been a non-championship event since 1994.\nMajor format changes were made for 1999, with the incorporation of the endurance races into the championship. Control tyres were used for the first time, with Bridgestone selected as the supplier. The series was also renamed from the \"Australian Touring Car Championship\" to the \"Shell Championship Series\", by virtue of Shell's sponsorship of the category. Reverse-grid races were introduced for multiple rounds in 2000 before being confined to just the Canberra round for 2001. Also in 2001, compulsory pit stops were introduced at certain rounds and the Top Ten Shootout was used at all rounds. The control tyre supplier changed from Bridgestone to Dunlop in 2002 and the series name was changed to the \"V8 Supercar Championship Series\" after Shell discontinued their sponsorship.\nProject Blueprint.\nDiscussions about parity had returned in 2000, with trimmed from the front spoiler of the Commodore after Holden, in particular, the Holden Racing Team, had dominated in 1998 and 1999. This was in response to the removed from the Falcon in previous seasons, and coincided with a trim from the Falcon's rear spoiler. The small reduction for the Holden teams was quickly addressed with both cars receiving the same front splitter shortly afterwards, but the Falcon's rear wing remained trimmed. Ford had threatened to withdraw from the series, but nothing came of this. After Holden again dominated in 2001 and 2002, a new set of regulations, dubbed \"Project Blueprint\", was introduced in 2003 to close the performance gap between the Commodore and the Falcon, thus creating closer, fairer racing. Project Blueprint was developed by Paul Taylor and Wayne Cattach, who spent two years designing a formula which would eliminate most of the differences between the Fords and Holdens.\nProject Blueprint had the chassis pick-up points, wheelbase, track, and driving position become common across both manufacturers. The Holdens were now able and required to use double-wishbone front suspension, similar to that of the Falcon, rather than the MacPherson struts used previously, and a Watts link at the rear rather than a Panhard. The aerodynamic packages were comprehensively tested and revised and differences in the porting of each of the manufacturers' engines were also removed. The performance of the new Ford BA Falcon and Holden VY and VZ Commodores was fairly even for the next four years, with Ford winning the championship in 2003, 2004, and 2005 and Holden winning in 2006. Reverse-grid races were used at certain events in 2006 before unpopularity with the drivers, teams, and fans saw them abolished halfway through the season.\nThe Holden VE Commodore caused controversy when it was introduced in 2007. The production model was longer, wider, and taller than the rival Ford BF Falcon and outside of the limits set by Project Blueprint. As a result, the VE race car was granted custom bodywork \u2013 namely shortened rear doors and a lowered roofline to meet the regulations. Despite this, the VE was approved for use in the series, along with the BF Falcon, after several months of preseason testing. Sequential gearboxes were introduced in 2008 and became compulsory by the end of the year. In 2009, E85 (a fuel consisting of 85% ethanol and 15% unleaded petrol) was introduced in an effort to improve the environmental image of the sport. Carbon dioxide emissions decreased by up to 50%, but fuel consumption was increased by 30% to produce the same power as before. 2009 also had the introduction of a soft compound tyre at certain events to try to improve the quality of the racing and create different strategies.\nIn 2005, AVESCO changed its name to V8 Supercars Australia (VESA). The series continued to expand during this time, with races held outside of Australasia for the first time. The series travelled to the Shanghai International Circuit in China in 2005, originally on a five-year agreement, however the promoter of the race dropped their support and the series did not return thereafter. 2006 saw the series travel to the Middle East, with an event held at the Bahrain International Circuit in Bahrain. Multiple new street circuits appeared on the calendar in 2008 and 2009, with new events held in Hamilton in New Zealand, Townsville in North Queensland and at Sydney Olympic Park. The series' Middle East expansion continued in 2010 with a second round held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. In November 2010, the series was granted international status by the FIA for the 2011 season, allowing the series to race at up to six international venues each year. As a result, the series name was changed to the 'International V8 Supercars Championship'.\n2008 saw the separate boards of directors of VESA and TEGA merge into a single board that was solely responsible for the administration of the category. The new board of directors was composed of four TEGA representatives, two members from SEL and two independent directors. In 2011, TEGA and SEL entered a sale agreement with Australian Motor Racing Partners (AMRP), which had significant financial backing from Archer Capital. This agreement saw SEL lose its 25% stake in V8 Supercars, with Archer Capital taking up a 60% share and TEGA the other 40%. A new board of directors was appointed, with two TEGA representatives and two AMRP representatives.\nIn 2011, Archer Capital purchased a 65% shareholding in the series with the teams owning the other 35%. In December 2021, both Archer Capital and the teams sold their shareholdings to Race Australia Consolidated Enterprises.\nNew Generation V8 Supercar.\nIn the middle of 2008, a project led by Mark Skaife was organised by V8 Supercars to investigate future directions for the sport. The project had the primary objective of cutting costs to $250,000 per car through the use of control parts and to create a pathway for new manufacturers to enter the series, provided that they have a four-door saloon car in mass production. The new formula, called \"Car of the Future\", was scheduled to be introduced before or during the 2012 season. The plan was publicly unveiled in March 2010 and was shown to incorporate several key changes to the internal workings of the car. The chassis and the cooling, fuel and electronics systems would all be changed to control parts, with changes to the engine, drivetrain, rear suspension, wheels and the control brake package. The safety of the cars was also to be reviewed and improved. While the plans were well received by all of the teams, Holden Motorsport boss Simon McNamara warned potential new manufacturers to stay out of the championship just hours after the plans were released, claiming that they would \"gain nothing\" from entering the series.\nMajor changes were revealed to include a switch from a live rear axle to independent rear suspension; the use of a rear transaxle instead of a mid-mounted gearbox; the repositioning of the fuel tank to in front of the rear axle to improve safety; replacing the windscreen with a polycarbonate unit; and a switch from to wheels. In 2011, it was announced that the Car of the Future would not be introduced until 2013. In February 2012, Nissan confirmed that they would enter the series under Car of the Future regulations with Kelly Racing. Later in 2012, Australian GT Championship team Erebus Motorsport announced they would be running Mercedes-Benz cars in the championship, taking over Stone Brothers Racing. In June 2013, Volvo announced it would enter the series in 2014 in a collaboration with its motorsport arm, Polestar Racing and Garry Rogers Motorsport. In November 2013 the Car of the Future moniker was dropped in favour of the name \"New Generation V8 Supercar\".\nThe series continued its international expansion in 2013, with the first event in North America held at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. In 2015, five drivers took part in a series of demonstration races at the Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit as part of the KL City Grand Prix. This was intended to be a precursor to the series holding a championship event at the circuit in 2016, in a push from CEO James Warburton to build series exposure in Asia. The event was later cancelled due to legal issues affecting the circuit.\nSupercars Championship.\nIn April 2016, the series reached an agreement with Virgin Australia to rename the series to the \"Virgin Australia Supercars Championship\" on 1 July.\nFor the 2021 season, this changed to the Repco Supercars Championship on a 5-year deal, extended to an 8-year deal at the end of 2022.\nGen 2 Supercar.\nIn December 2014, Supercars released details concerning the future of the category. New regulations, dubbed Gen2 Supercar, were introduced in 2017 to allow the use of two-door coup\u00e9 body styles and turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines. However, no teams elected to build cars to these alternate engine specifications. Cars were still required to be based on front-engined, rear-wheel drive, four-seater production cars that were sold in Australia. The chassis and control components were carried over from the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, while engine and aerodynamic parity was reviewed. Where Holden ZB Commodore made a debut in 2018 and later, Ford Mustang S550 in the 2019 debut as the only Two-door coupe Gen2 specifications and also the successor of FG X Falcon, which been discontinued at the end of 2016.\nGen 3 Supercar.\nAfter being first announced in 2020, and after being delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Gen 3 regulations were introduced for the 2023 Supercars Championship. The main aim was to create closer racing, to reduce costs and to increase road-relevance for the manufacturers. To do this, sweeping aerodynamic changes were made to cut the generated downforce. This reduced the amount of \"dirty\" air created, and made the cars more challenging to drive. The regulations continued previous changes to ensure technical parity between cars, helping to keep power, downforce and drag levels identical. Engines were further aligned to road going units, to increase longevity, remove the cost of manufacturing custom parts (in particular velocity stacks) and decrease the cost of a rebuild.\nSupercar specifications.\nThe current Gen 3 regulations are a complete refresh of the previous generation, with the cessation of volume car production in Australia being a major factor. The current cars are the Ford Mustang GT and the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1.\nThe full list of regulations, Sporting and Technical, can be found on the Supercars website in the operations manual. https://\nParity.\nSupercars is a \"parity formula\" which attempts to ensure that competitors using any of the available car models compete on an equal basis. In this aspect, it is similar in philosophy to the NASCAR Cup Series. The category's current rules, and the charter between organisers and teams state that \"..to the extent that it is possible, Competition will take place between the different makes and models of Cars as equalised by the technical parity mechanisms enshrined in the Rules.\".\nHowever, the rules go on to state that \"The Category is not about equalisation of the abilities of participating Drivers and/or Teams (such equalisation could be, and is in some categories, defined as sporting parity). It is up to individual Drivers and/or Teams to Compete to the best of their abilities under the principle of technical parity.\"\nParity is intended to extend to aerodynamics, engine performance, and handling characteristics.\nIn practice, achieving technical parity has proven difficult and contentious, with a number of changes for the 2023 and 2024 season to aerodynamics and engines.\nBodyshell.\nThe body of each car is based on its corresponding production car in Right Hand Drive and with homologation requirements. The bodies of both models are aerodynamically balanced through these homologations requirements, along with general balancing upon entering Composite and Exotic materials are generally not permitted. The tail lamps are carried over from the road car, while the windscreen is replaced by a polycarbonate unit. The cars also carry cameras for broadcasting.\nThe bodies are built around a chassis provided by official accredited builders, including certain race teams. Currently, Triple Eight Race Engineering homologate the Chevrolet Camaro and Dick Johnson Racing homologate the Ford Mustang. The new for 2026 Toyota GR Supra will be homologated by Walkinshaw Andretti United.\nMany safety features are utilised to protect the driver in the event of a crash. The fuel tank is positioned in front of the rear axle to prevent it from being damaged or ruptured in a rear end impact. The driver is seated towards the centre of the car and extra reinforcement is used on the roll cage on the driver's side to lessen the risk of injury in a side-on collision. The cars also feature a collapsible steering column and a fire extinguisher system.\nAerodynamics.\nAll cars have an aerodynamics package consisting of a front spoiler and splitter, and a rear wing. The aerodynamics package for each manufacturer is homologated after a series of tests which ensure that the different body styles produce near-identical downforce and drag numbers.\nBy modern racing vehicle standards, Supercars have relatively low amounts of downforce. This is intended to make it easier to follow other cars, and make the handling more similar to road cars. The Gen 3 cars were originally reported to produce about 140\u00a0kg of downforce at 200\u00a0km/h, similar to a road-registerable Porsche 911 GT3 RS. Revisions in 2024 are stated to produce about 20% more downforce.\nWeight.\nThe minimum weight of each car is including the driver and excluding the fuel, with a minimum load of 725\u00a0kg over the front axle. The minimum weight for the driver is 95\u00a0kg and includes the driver dressed in a full racing suit the seat and seat mountings and any ballast needed to meet the minimum weight. Some other components also have a minimum weight, such as the engine and the front uprights.\nEngine and drivetrain.\nAll cars must be front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, and powered by a V8 engine designated by Supercars for use in the respected model of car, and balanced in power and weight. Currently, the GM engine (for use in the Camaro) is a 5.7L V8 with a single camshaft and two valves per cylinder. The Ford engine (for use in the Mustang) is a 5.4L V8 with four camshafts and 4 valves per cylinder. These engines were designed to be cheaper and have a higher longevity compared to previous engines, along with being more road-relevant. The Toyota engine (for use in the GR Supra) introduced in 2026 is a 5.0L V8 with DOHC with 4 valves per cylinder.\nAs of the Gen3 Supercars, all engines for a given car model are built by a single engine builder - Herrod Performance Engines for the Mustang and KRE Race Engines for the Camaro. Each engine is tested on a dynamometer before delivery to ensure the power and torque characteristics are to specification, and engine allocation is randomised to preclude more powerful engines being allocated to a specific team. Engines are sealed upon delivery, and modifications are prohibited. Engine servicing is only permitted under strict conditions and after minimum distances completed with the engine. Teams are only permitted two new engines per car, per year.\nPower is transferred from the engine to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential transaxle with an integrated spool differential. The individual gear ratios and the final drive ratio are fixed with drop gears at the front of the transaxle allowing the teams to alter the overall transmission ratio for different circuits. The cars use a triple plate clutch. The cars run on E75 fuel with a fuel tank capacity of about 130 Litres.\nAn electronic control unit (ECU), provided by MoTeC, is used to monitor and optimise various aspects of the engine's performance. Numerous sensors in the car collect information which is then transmitted to the team, allowing them to monitor things such as tyre wear and fuel consumption and find potential problems with the car. The ECU is also used by officials during the scrutineering process. During the race it can also serve functions such as to automatically limit a car's speed.\nSuspension.\nAll cars are required to use a double wishbone setup for the front suspension and independent rear suspension. Both the front and rear suspension systems feature adjustable shock absorbers and an anti-roll bar which, as of the introduction of the Gen 3 regulations, can not be adjusted from inside the car.\nBrakes.\nThe cars use disc brakes supplied by AP Racing on the front and rear, with the master cylinders provided by AP Racing or former control brake supplier Alcon. The front discs have a diameter of and a six-piston caliper, while the rear discs are diameter and have a four-piston caliper.\nWheels and tyres.\nThe cars use control wheels, produced by Rimstock and supplied by Racer Industries, and control tyres from Dunlop. Supercars are provided with Soft, Supersoft, and Hard slick tyres as well as grooved wet tyres for each event, The requirement to use varying compounds and how many tyres need to be changed per race are dependent on the event.\nPerformance.\nThe highest speed recorded in a Supercar of any generation is 300.5\u00a0km/h on the (downhill) Conrod Straight on the Mount Panorama Circuit, by Shane van Gisbergen in qualifying for the 2023 Bathurst 1000. 2024-spec cars are expected to be about 10\u00a0km/h slower.\nSupercar lap times are similar to the 992 GT3 Cup cars running in the Porsche Carrera Cup Australia Championship. At the 2023 Bathurst 1000, the fastest Supercars qualifying lap recorded was 2:04.664 by Brodie Kostecki. On the same race weekend, the fastest qualifying lap recorded by the Carrera Cup cars was 2:04.6672.\nWhile Gen 3 Supercars and NASCAR Cup Series cars have never raced on the same circuit, their relative performance against Carrera Cup cars gives some indication of how they might compare on the same track. At Circuit of the Americas, the Cup series lap record is more than three seconds per lap slower than Carrera Cup, whereas the Supercars virtually match the Carrera Cup car performance at circuits where they both race. NASCAR Cup Series cars are designed to race on superspeedways and short-track oval courses as well as road circuits. Cam Waters, after driving a Cup series car in preparation for his first NASCAR race, said that the latest-generation NASCAR cars \"...feel fairly similar in some ways to the Supercars back home..Fairly heavy, the gearboxes are similar, the brakes are similar, a bit more power \"(in the Cup Series car)\"\".\nCompared to other modern circuit racing vehicles, V8 Supercars are quite powerful, but have relatively little downforce and mechanical grip, making them challenging to drive. The spool differential, which is very uncommon in modern racing vehicles, also requires a specific driving style unique to the series and makes it hard for drivers used to other categories to adapt quickly.\nCost.\nThe Gen 3 Supercar regulations were intended to reduce the cost of building a car (without engine) from around $450,000 to $250,000. In practice, this did not occur, with teams reporting that rather than reduced costs, building and running costs increased by approximately 30% from Gen2 to Gen3 as of 2023. The increased costs were partly attributed to time pressures getting the cars ready while dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, and the broader impact on materials costs of that period.\nThe costs of competing in the championship are considerably higher than the purchase price of a car. There is no budget cap, though caps have been proposed. One estimate puts the season cost for teams at \"1.2 to 3 million (Australian) dollars per car\" per season.\nSeries structure.\nTeams and drivers.\nIn order to compete in the Supercars Championship, drivers are required to hold a Motorsport Australia Superlicence, earned by success in other high-level Australian circuit racing series (with special eligibility processes for overseas drivers).\nEach car entered is required to have a Teams Racing Charter (TRC), formerly known as a Racing Entitlements Contract (REC). A TRC is a contract between Supercars and a team which outlines the team's entitlements and obligations. TRCs may be leased by their owners to another party for a maximum of two years, after which the owner must either use it themselves or sell it. A racing number is tied to each TRC, with teams able to apply for a TRC number to be changed. The defending series champion is entitled to use the number 1, with the original TRC number of that car reserved and not able to be used by another team without the agreement of its owner.\nThe TRCs were originally issued in 1999. Known as TEGA franchise agreements, they were divided into three categories \u2013 Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Twelve Level 1 franchises were issued to those teams that had competed in the series full-time since its inception in 1997:\nA thirteenth was later issued to Bob Forbes Racing. A Level 1 franchise required a team to race at least one car at all events, and at various times allowed a team to enter up to four cars. Other teams received Level 2 and Level 3 franchises based on their level of participation. The structure was changed a number of times before the present system of 28 RECs was arrived at in 2011. Supercars bought a number of RECs as they became available in order to achieve a long-held desire to reduce the field to 28 cars.\nAt the end of 2013, Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport, Tony D'Alberto Racing and Triple F Racing each returned a REC to Supercars. These were put up for sale in 2014, but no bids were received. One was reclaimed by Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport in 2015 after a legal fight. At the end of 2014, a further REC was returned by James Rosenberg Racing. In April 2015, Supercars launched a tender for one REC for the 2016 season, with Triple Eight the successful bidder.\nTeams consist of one to four cars, with most one-car teams forming a technical alliance with a larger team. Only the REC holders are allowed to compete at each event, although \"wildcard\" entries are accepted for the endurance races, with a maximum of six extra cars on top of the regular 28. Both Supercars and Development Series teams have entered wildcard entries in previous years. In 2014, the first wildcard entry for a sprint race was issued when Dick Johnson Racing entered a third car for Marcos Ambrose at the Sydney 500.\nMost drivers in the series are full-time professionals paid by their teams. Exact salaries are not disclosed, but former team owner Roland Dane stated in 2024 \"...the two top Supercar drivers are earning more than all their European based counterparts racing in GT3.\". Pay drivers are not unknown, but reportedly make up a small minority of the Supercar field.\nTeams are required to employ a co-driver for each car during the two endurance races due to the increased race distance and the need for driver substitutions during the race. Teams were able to pair their full-time drivers in one car until a rule change in 2010 that required each full-time driver to remain in his own car and be joined by a co-driver not competing full-time in the series. The Drivers Championship title is awarded to the driver who accumulates the most points over the course of the season. If there is a points tie for the series win, the champion will be decided based on the number of races won by each driver (if there is still a tie, it is based on second-place finishes and so on). Teams also compete for the Teams Championship, with the champion team being decided in the same manner as the Drivers Championship. For Teams Championship points scoring purposes, teams with four cars are separated into a pair of two-car teams, while teams with three cars are split into a two-car team and a single-car team. The Teams Championship dictates the pit lane order for the following season.\nThe defending champion driver has the right to carry the number 1 the following year. However, Shane van Gisbergen and Scott McLaughlin elected to retain their existing numbers in 2017, 2019, 2020, 2022 &amp; 2023.\nDevelopment series.\nA second-tier series, the Dunlop Super2 Series, is run as a support category to the main series at certain events. Initially for privateers who did not have the funding of the professional teams in the late 1990s, the series now serves the dual purpose of developing young drivers before they compete in the main series and a means for main series teams to give their endurance co-drivers more racing experience prior to the endurance races. Teams in the Dunlop Super2 Series compete with cars previously used in the main series. From the 2021 Season until the end of the 2024 season the Dunlop Super2 Series would compete as a class alongside the Super3 Series V8 Supercars class racing together on track at the same time. In the year 2025 season the Super3 Series would be axed due to low grid numbers in the 2024 season reverting back to a single class of the Dunlop Series.\nA third V8 Supercar-based series, the Kumho Tyres V8 Touring Car Series, had been run since 2008 until the end of 2024, but had no involvement with the Supercars Championship or Dunlop Super2 Series, instead running on the programme of the Shannons Nationals Motor Racing Championships. However, since 2016, several rounds have been run as support categories at Supercars events. It would officially become the third-tier series of V8 Supercars starting in 2019 before the category known as the Super3 Series would join as a class alongside Super2 Series Class V8 Supercars starting in the 2021 season. In the 2023 Season the V8 Touring Car Series would be revived to create an unofficial standalone fourth-tier level V8 Supercars category using V8 Supercars sold to teams that are no longer racing in the Super3 Series of the Dunlop Super2 &amp; Super3 Series, however it would only last for that year's season. The Super3 Series would officially be axed in 2025 and become defunct due to low grid numbers with only as many as two or three cars appearing at rounds in the 2024 Dunlop Super2 &amp; Super3 Series season.\nQualifying.\nIn 2023, there are two distinct formats for determining grid positions in races: Format 1 and Format 2. Format 1 uses a single qualifying session where all drivers participate simultaneously to establish their grid positions. Format 2, on the other hand, divides qualifying into three separate sessions. During Q1, the five slowest cars are assigned the last five grid positions, and the faster cars progress to Q2. In Q2, this process is repeated to determine the next ten grid positions. Finally, Q3 decides the top 10 grid positions. This can be done through a standard qualifying session or a 'top-ten shoot-out', where each driver has a single opportunity to set their lap time.\nThe selection between these qualifying formats is influenced by a variety of factors, including the layout of the track, the length of each race, and strategic considerations unique to each event. This approach allows the championship to adapt to a wide range of racing conditions and maintains a dynamic and engaging competition for participants and spectators alike, however, it is not uncommon for both Qualifying Format 1 and Format 2 to be utilised over the course of the same race weekend, especially during events that feature multiple races.\nRace formats.\nIn 2023, there are three racing formats: SuperSprint, two-race rounds and endurance.\nIn previous years, formats included SuperSprint events, International SuperSprint events, SuperStreet events and Enduro Cup events.\nSuperSprint.\nIn 2023, the SuperSprint format was used for the Melbourne SuperSprint (previously known as the Melbourne 400), the Perth SuperSprint, the Tasmania SuperSprint, the Sydney SuperNight, the Darwin Triple Crown and The Bend SuperSprint.\nThe format was previously used for the Phillip Island SuperSprint, Winton SuperSprint and the Ipswich SuperSprint.\nThe SuperSprint format generally involves three (at the Melbourne Supersprint four) races, each with separate qualifying sessions, on the Saturday and the Sunday. Some races use the same qualifying format for each race while other use format 1 and 2 on different days.\nIn previous years, the Phillip Island and Sydney Motorsport Park events featured a single one-hour practice session on Saturday, while all other SuperSprint events have two one-hour practice sessions on the Friday with a fifteen-minute practice session on Saturday. The Winton and Ipswich events featured an extra thirty-minute session on Friday for endurance co-drivers. The SuperSprint format featured a fifteen-minute qualifying session held on Saturday to decide the grid for the race on the same day. A single twenty-minute session was held on Sunday morning to decide the grid for the Sunday race. The Darwin event also featured a top ten shootout (a session where the fastest ten qualifiers complete one flying lap each to determine the top ten on the grid) following the Sunday qualifying session. A single race was held on Saturday with a single race was held on Sunday.\nInternational SuperSprint.\nThe International SuperSprint format was used at the Auckland SuperSprint.\nThree thirty-minute practice sessions are held on Friday, while Saturday and Sunday both consist of two ten-minute qualifying sessions which set the grid for the pair of races held on each day.\nTwo-race Weekends.\nThe two-race round format, previously known as the SuperStreet format, covers those races not branded as a SuperSprint or an endurance race. In 2023 the format will be used in the Newcastle 500, the Townsville 500, the Gold Coast 500 and the Adelaide 500.\nThis format generally involves two races on the Saturday and Sunday of the race weekend, 250\u00a0km in length. Unlike the SuperSprint, refuelling is allowed.\nIn previous years, two thirty-minute practice sessions took place on Friday at each SuperStreet event, while a thirty-minute practice session is held on Saturday at Adelaide. The Adelaide event features a fifteen-minute qualifying session on Friday to determine the grid for the Saturday race, while the other events have a single fifteen-minute session on Saturday. All four events feature a twenty-minute session followed by a top ten shootout both on Saturday and Sunday. The Adelaide 500, Newcastle 500, Townsville 500 and Gold Coast 500 feature a single race on each of Saturday and Sunday.\nEndurance races.\nIn 2023, there are two endurance races, the Bathurst 1000 and the Sandown 500. In previous years, the Gold Coast race was run as an endurance race and the driver who won the most points over the three races was awarded the Enduro Cup.\nThis format is a single endurance race over either 500 or 1000\u00a0km with refuelling allowed and multiple drivers required. The Bathurst race takes around six hours to complete with the Sandown race taking around half that.\nIn previous years, the Sandown 500 and the Gold Coast 600 both featured three thirty-minute practice sessions held on Friday, with Sandown having an extra session on Saturday. Practice for the Bathurst 1000 consists of six one-hour sessions held across Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Qualifying for the Sandown 500 involves a twenty-minute session followed by a pair of \"qualifying races\" held on Saturday. The grid for the first race is based on the qualifying session; the grid for the second race is based on the results of the first. The results of the second race determine the grid for the main race on Sunday. Co-drivers must compete in the first of the qualifying races while the main driver must compete in the second. The Bathurst 1000 features a single forty-minute qualifying session on Friday afternoon followed by a top ten shootout on Saturday. The Gold Coast 600 had two twenty-minute qualifying sessions, one each on Saturday and Sunday, with the Sunday session followed by a top ten shootout. The Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000 both have a twenty-minute warm-up session on Sunday morning.\nThe Sandown 500 and the Bathurst 1000 feature single races held on Sunday, at and in length respectively. The Gold Coast 600 consisted of two races with one held on Saturday and one on Sunday.\nPoints systems.\nBetween the founding of the championship and the current season, many different points scoring systems have been used. In the first few years, the same basic system as Formula 1 was used. Since the 1980s, separate point systems have been developed, some of which were based on the length of the race or which took into account whether there was only one long-distance race or several short races in a championship round. This should give the races a better weighting.\n2008\u20132024.\nPoints are awarded as follows at all championship events. Various different points scales are applied to events having one, two, three or four races, ensuring that a driver will be awarded 300 points for winning all races at any event. Points are awarded to all cars that have covered 75% of the race distance, provided they are running at the completion of the final lap and with a final lap time within 200% of the race winner's fastest lap. At the endurance events, both drivers earn the total points awarded to the finishing position of the car.\nNotable events.\nBathurst 1000.\nThe Bathurst 1000, also known as the \"Great Race\" and held in some form since 1960, is the most famous race on the Supercars calendar, as well as the longest both in terms of race distance and race time. The race is run over 161 laps of the Mount Panorama Circuit, in total, taking between six and seven hours to complete. The event has historically attracted crowds of nearly 200,000 people. The Peter Brock Trophy, named after nine-time Bathurst 1000 winner Peter Brock, is awarded to the winners of the race. The trophy was introduced in 2006 following Brock's death in a crash at the Targa West rally one month prior to the race.\nAdelaide 500.\nThe Adelaide 500, also known as the \"Clipsal 500\" and \"Superloop 500\" under former sponsorship names, is the premier car race in South Australia. It is the largest V8 Supercars race in the country by crowd numbers. Beginning in 1999, the race is held in the eastern streets of the Adelaide CBD, on a reduced version of the Adelaide Street Circuit previously used by the Grand Prix. There was no race in 2021 after the contract was not renewed by Liberal premier Steven Marshall, before it was revived in 2022 with a new contract under by subsequent Labor premier Peter Malinauskas, who had pledged its return during the 2022 South Australian state election. Held over four days, the event consists of two 250 kilometre races for the V8 Supercars, and additionary practise and qualifying races. The event has several categories of races throughout the four days, including Super2 Series, Formula 5000, SuperUtes Series, Touring Car Masters, Australian GT, and the Australian Carrera Cup as well as others. The race is accompanied by live music performances, of which the likes of Kiss, Keith Urban and Robbie Williams have previously performed, as well as food, activities, and an RAAF F/A 18A Hornet display each day in the skies above the city.\nSandown 500.\nThe Sandown 500 was first held as a six-hour race in 1964 and has been labelled as the traditional \"Bathurst warm-up\" race. Like the Bathurst 1000, the Sandown 500 is run over 161 laps. Due to the shorter track length of Sandown Raceway, the race is only and runs for between three and four hours. The Sandown 500 was not held for Supercars from 1999 to 2002 and from 2008 to 2011. During these years, the endurance races took place at Queensland Raceway (1999\u20132002) and the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit (2008\u20132011).\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nThe series is currently broadcast on Fox Sports and the Seven Network. Fox Sports shows all practice and qualifying sessions live along with the races. Seven shows only seven events live which are Adelaide, Melbourne, Townsville, Sandown, Bathurst, Gold Coast and Newcastle with the rest shown as a highlights package after the races have finished. The coverage is produced by Supercars Media, a specialist production company for Supercars Australia. Supercars Media provides the commentary for each race, with former champion and Bathurst winner Mark Skaife as lead commentator, along with Neil Crompton as expert commentator. Both Fox Sports and Seven use their own commentary team for pre- and post-race coverage. Supercars Media records the series in 1080i high-definition, with many cars carrying four or more onboard-cameras, though HD coverage is available only to subscribers of Foxtel HD.\nPrior to the 1984 Australian Touring Car Championship season (ATCC), the series did not have a common TV home, splitting between ABC and Channel 7, as the track owners controlled the TV rights for their specific round.\nIn 1984, CAMS intervened and prevented the track owners from obtaining their own TV rights and instead negotiated a contract with the ABC. The only race that was not shown in 1984 on the ABC was the Calder Park round, as Channel 7 already had a long term deal with Calder Park.\nIn 1985, the coverage moved full time to Channel 7. Due to reasons unknown, the first round was missed in certain regions and was shown as highlights at the second round. This was how it was until 1996 except for events were the ATCC was a support act (Australian GP F1 - Channel 9 and Indy Cars - Channel 9 / 10 on the Gold Coast) or non championship race (ie: ATCC Endurance Championship - Sandown 400/500 - ABC). Most races were same day delayed coverage to avoid the emptiness between ATCC and support races.\nIn 1996, the season was brought forward and the time between events was shortened to avoid conflicting with that years Olympic Games in Atlanta (Channel 7 being the rights holder for the Olympics).\nMeaning final round was in June instead of its traditional slot of August / September.\nDue to the Olympics, Channel 10 broadcast the Sandown 500 for 1996. This was considered a practice run for Channel 10.\nThe Bathurst 500 / 1000 was shown exclusively on Channel 7 from 1963 until 1996, and then from 1997 was packaged as part of the AVESCO TV Contract.\nThe V8 Supercars were broadcast on Network Ten and Fox Sports from 1997 as part of the AVESCO TV Contract.\nThis contract allowed simulcasting of the Channel 10 coverage on Fox Sports.\nSelect support events for the V8 Supercars were shown live, others were shown in Channel 10's Trackside series, which was broadcast either the following weekend or fortnight after the event.\nIn 2000, select races (FAI 1000) were produced and broadcast in widescreen (16:9). However, the public was not able to see this feed until it was rebroadcast on Foxtel on their Bathurst channel and when it was released to https:// in the 2020s.\nIn 2001, as Digital TV arrived in Australia, every race was produced and broadcast in native widescreen (16:9) on Channel 10 Digital.\nFor analogue TV viewers, they received a letterbox feed (excluding Round 1, which provided analogue viewers with their own feed, which was too demanding, so opted for a letterbox simulcast instead from Round 2 on-wards), while international and Fox Sports users were shown a 4:3 feed. For every Split screen (ie: going for an interview, showing pit stops, pit reporters, going onboard, etc while showing track cameras), the feeds shown were within the 4:3 frame but were in their native 16:9 widescreen format, giving analogue and international viewers a glimpse of what they were missing out on.\nFor 2001 Clipsal 500 and Bathurst 1000, an interactive feed was available, with the following being broadcast at the 2001 Clipsal 500:\nAnd the following were broadcast at the 2001 Bathurst 1000:\nDue to low viewership, this was never repeated after season 2001.\nFrom 2002, the V8 Supercars Greatest Hits Volume 2 (to Volume 4) DVDs and from the 2003 season, the V8 Supercars and Bathurst 1000 highlight DVDs, produced by Sony Music Video, were released in native widescreen (16:9).\nAt the 2002 Bathurst 1000, a ticker was used to show live positions. It was moved from beside the lap counter to the bottom of the screen in 2003.\nIn 2003, Bigpond became the exclusive Streaming provider for Bigpond Broadband Customers only.\nThis included live practice, qualifying and top ten shootouts, ad free racing (delayed) as well as live onboard and telemetry from your selected driver.\nThis also included exclusive interviews and highlight packages.\nThis ended in 2007 when Supercars Australia started to produce the coverage.\nIn 2004, Foxtel Digital was launched and by 2005 was showing races in widescreen.\nAt the Bathurst 1000 in 2004, Sky Cam, which hovered above the pit lane, was introduced. The camera ran on a wire from the Pedestrian Overpass to Turn 1 and had 360 degree tilt and pan.\nThe camera would be used in other events after its successful run at Bathurst.\nThis initial contract with Channel 10 and Fox Sports ended at the conclusion of the 2006 season.\nChannel 7 regained the rights from 2007 to 2012, then extended to 2014 (due to a lack of competitive tenders at the end of 2012 forcing Supercars Australia to default to Channel 7 for two more seasons). During 2013 and 2014, Channel 7's deal did not cover their production costs.\nIn 2007, Supercars Australia started to produce the coverage, rather than relying on the broadcasters.\nWhile Chanel 7 had the rights, Network Ten and Fox Sports continued to broadcast the series once a year for the Melbourne 400 championship races, which are a support category at the Formula One Rolex Australian Grand Prix, which was broadcast by Ten and Fox Sports. All support category races were tied up with the Formula One Australian Grand Prix broadcast rights as a package.\nThen the rights were returned to Network Ten and Fox Sports from 2015 to 2020.\nThe deal included Channel 10 showing six events live and showing one hour highlight packages for the rest of the season.\nFox Sports would show all sessions live, ad free (during sessions only) and in HD.\nIn 2020, Seven Network and Foxtel signed a five-year deal worth $200 million to televise the Repco Supercars Championship from 2021 to 2025. Seven Network broadcast six rounds live and showed highlights for the rest of the season. Foxtel's deal remains the same, it showed all races live and ad free on Fox Sports.\nIn 2025, the calendar changing to a NASCAR playoffs style series, meant the contract that Fox Sports and Channel 7 are currently under prevents Channel 7 from showing Friday Races live (Eastern Creek, Townsville and Adelaide having Friday races), even though Channel 7 has the rights to showing these events live.\nThe rights for the series beyond 2025 have yet to be announced.\nTen's television series \"RPM\", which has aired from 1997 to 2008, in 2011 and from 2015 - 2020, has covered Supercars, alongside other motorsports. From 2007 to 2014, Seven broadcast a weekly 25-minute show titled \"V8Xtra\" on non-racing weekends. The dedicated Supercars program covered news and feature items relating to the series. Since 2015, Fox Sports has broadcast a similar show, \"Inside Supercars\", a weekly one-hour long program featuring a panel led by Rust and Mark Skaife. In the same year, Fox Sports also launched an observational show \"Supercars Life\", featuring behind the scenes footage from race weekends and features on drivers' lives away from the track. In 2018, \"Inside Supercars\" was superseded by a new show on Fox Sports, \"Supercars Trackside\". Instead of being filmed in a studio midweek, the show is filmed on the Thursday before and the Sunday after each race meeting at the circuit.\nThe television broadcast of the Bathurst 1000 has won a Logie Award for the Most Outstanding Sports Coverage seven times (Note: year won is for the prior years coverage and are shown in Bold): 1979, 1985, 1998 (nominated), 2000, 2001 (nominated), 2002 (nominated), 2006, 2007 (nominated), 2008, 2009 (nominated), 2010, 2012 (nominated), 2015 (nominated), 2017 (nominated), and most recently won in 2018 for the 2017 Bathurst 1000.\nFoxtel broadcast the 2018 Bathurst 1000 in 4K resolution, the first such broadcast in Australian sport.\nCurrent TV broadcasters.\nSupercars races are broadcast on the following channels:\nOther media.\nThe series has its own live streaming pay-per-view service, Superview. The service, which started in 2013, currently shows all races as well as qualifying sessions. In 2021 the service was brought to YouTube which shows complete broadcasts including support races. The service is not available in New Zealand and Australia due to their current broadcasting rights with Sky Sport and Fox Sports.\nThe series has its own website, which contains information about the series, drivers, teams and events and news articles, and a radio show, V8 Insiders. News is also featured on motorsport websites such as Speedcafe and V8Sleuth. A media deal with News Corp Australia has been in place since 2009.\nVideo games.\nSupercars have made several licensed appearances in video games, including in Codemasters' \"V8 Supercars\" series in the 2000s and Turn 10 Studios' \"Forza\" series in the 2010s. From 2011 to 2014, an online championship, sanctioned by Supercars, was contested on iRacing. In 2017, Supercars launched an eSports competition using \"Forza Motorsport 6\" and \"Forza Motorsport 7\", which expanded to six rounds in 2018. The Supercars Eseries moved to the iRacing platform in 2019 with championship teams including Triple Eight Race Engineering and Walkinshaw Andretti United entering teams into the series alongside eSports teams. An additional Eseries was held in mid 2020 with all championship drivers competing during the hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "54164", "revid": "1319165346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54164", "title": "Cortland County, New York", "text": "County in New York, United States\nCortland County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population of Cortland County was 46,809. The county seat is Cortland. The county is named after Pierre Van Cortlandt, president of the convention at Kingston that wrote the first New York State Constitution in 1777, and first lieutenant governor of the state. The county is part of the Central New York region of the state.\nCortland County comprises the Cortland, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Ithaca\u2013Cortland, NY Combined Statistical Area.\nThe Cortland apple is named for the county.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nLocated in the glaciated Appalachian Plateau area of Central New York, midway between Syracuse and Binghamton, this predominantly rural county is the southeastern gateway to the Finger Lakes Region. Scattered archaeological evidence indicates the Iroquois also known as the Haudenosaunee controlled the area beginning about AD 1500.\nWhat was to become Cortland County remained within Indian territory until the American Revolution. It became part of the Military Tract, when, in 1781, more than 1\u00bc million acres (5,100\u00a0km2) were set aside by the State's Legislature to compensate two regiments formed to protect the State's western section from the English and their Iroquois allies, at the close of the Revolution. To encourage settlement in the upstate isolated wilderness, the State constructed a road from Oxford through Cortland County to Cayuga Lake in 1792\u201394. This, and construction of privately financed roads, were the major impetus to settlement.\nWhen counties were established in New York in 1683, the present Cortland County was part of Albany County, which encompassed the northern part of New York and all of the present State of Vermont, as well as indeterminate territory to west. On March 12, 1772, present day Cortland County became part of Tryon County, named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of the county was changed to honor General Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, thus replacing the name of the locally unpopular British governor. Present day Cortland County became part of Herkimer County in 1791, then became a part of Onondaga County when it split from Herkimer in 1794. Cortland County was formed by the splitting of Onondaga County in 1808.\nSettlement of the county.\nEastern New Yorkers and New Englanders, wanting new land to farm, welcomed the opening of this frontier. The first white settlement in the county was made in 1791 by Amos Todd, Joseph Beebe and Rhoda Todd Beebe, emigrants from Connecticut who paddled up the Tioughnioga River from Windsor, to live near the head of navigation in the Town of Homer. Following them came a flood of settlers who, in 1808, petitioned the State Legislature for county status. Thus, Cortland County was created from the southern half of Onondaga County as part of the Boston Ten Towns on April 8, 1808, and was named in honor of the Pierre Van Cortlandt family - Pierre, Sr. having been the first lieutenant governor of the state.\nNineteenth century.\nThe 76th New York Volunteer Infantry was one of the most famous of the New York units in the Civil War. It was raised in 1861 primarily from Cortland County and the surrounding areas (about a third of the men were from the Cherry Valley area). The 76th was in most of the major battles the Army of the Potomac fought from Second Bull Run through Petersburg, at which time the three-year enlistment of most of the men ran out and the 300 or so men remaining from the 1,100 who left Cortland either returned home or transferred to other units.\nAt the Battle of Gettysburg, the 76th New York was one of the first infantry regiments on the field, holding down the extreme right of the Union line on the first day. The regiment took huge casualties in that battle - nearly one-third of its strength - including its commander Major Andrew J. Grover, the first infantry officer killed in the battle.\nModern Cortland County.\nToday, Cortland county is noted for the production of CNC milling machines, hospitality supplies, medical instruments and components, textiles, electronic components, plastic consumer goods, components for NASA, and a variety of other goods and services. International exporting is an integral part of many of the corporations in the area.\nThe county's present reflects its past. Agribusiness flourishes, yet consistent with the pattern elsewhere in New York State, the number of farms has declined while farm size and yield have increased. Continued growth in the service and light industry sectors is contributing to the growing strength of the Central New York region and the Southern Tier region.\nThe loss of many of its local businesses has led to the current economic decline of the region. Cornell University, Syracuse University, Binghamton University, and Ithaca College are all within a 45-minute drive of the City of Cortland. The State University of New York College at Cortland is located within the county. Tompkins Cortland Community College, often referred to by the local residents as TC3, is located a short distance away in nearby Tompkins County.\nGovernment and politics.\nAlthough once a heavily Republican County rooted in Yankee tradition, Cortland County is a bellwether county, having voted for the national winner in every presidential election from 1980 to 2016. The city of Cortland itself, the largest city in the county, leans Democratic.\nRepublican Ronald Reagan scored landslide wins in the county in 1980 and 1984. Democrat Bill Clinton carried the county with pluralities in 1992 and 1996. Republican George W. Bush carried the county in 2000 and 2004, defeating Al Gore by less than 1% in 2000, and John Kerry by just over 4% in 2004. In 2008, Barack Obama defeated John McCain 54-44%, and in 2012 he defeated Mitt Romney by a similar margin. The last Democrat to win a majority in Cortland County prior to Obama was Lyndon Johnson in 1964.\nIn 2020, Cortland County's streak of voting for the winner ended, as Joe Biden defeated Republican incumbent Donald Trump. Had the streak continued, it would have been tied with Clallam County, Washington for the longest active streak in the nation, as the streaks of longstanding bellwethers Valencia County, New Mexico and Vigo County, Indiana also ended in 2020. Cortland was one of five counties in the state that Trump carried by less than 500 votes.\nCortland County's lawmaking body is the legislature, which consists of 17 members. All are elected from single member districts.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.\nCortland County is sometimes considered to be part of Central New York and Southern Tier regions of New York and is also somewhat to the southwest of the center of New York, south of Syracuse and north of Binghamton.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 48,599 people, 18,210 households, and 11,617 families residing in the county.

At the 2020 census, the population was 61,570. The county seat is Hudson. The name comes from the Latin feminine form of the surname of Christopher Columbus, which was at the time of the formation of the county a popular proposal for the name of the United States. The county is part of the Capital District region of the state.\nHistory.\nAt the arrival of European colonists the area was inhabited by the indigenous Mohican Indians. To the west of the river were the Mohawk and other four tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, extending past what is now the border of New York state. The first known European exploration of Columbia County was in 1609, when Henry Hudson, an English explorer sailing for the Dutch, ventured up the Hudson River. An accident to his craft forced him to stop at what is now known as Columbia County and there search for food and supplies. In 1612, the Dutch established trading posts and minor settlements, building New Amsterdam (now New York City) and Fort Orange (now Albany). Fort Orange became a center of the fur trade with the Mohawk people. Traders stopped at points along the Hudson River on their travels between New Amsterdam and Fort Orange; small settlements arose along the river to supply the traders' ships.\nDutch colonists bought land [from whom?] near Claverack in 1649 and 1667. As more Dutch arrived, the region slowly developed. In 1664, the English took over New Netherland and renamed it the \"Province of New York\"; they also renamed Fort Orange \"Albany\".\nIn the late 17th century, Robert Livingston, a Scots immigrant by way of Rotterdam, built on his connections as Indian agent in the colony and purchased two large tracts from the Native Americans. He gained much larger grants from the provincial government, for a total of 160,240 acres. He was made lord of Livingston Manor by the Crown, with all its perquisites, and developed the property with tenant farmers. In 1710, he sold 6,000 acres of his property to Queen Anne of Great Britain for use as work camps and for the resettlement of Palatine German refugees. The Crown had supported their passage to New York, and they were to pay off the cost by indentured labor. Some 1,200 Palatine Germans were brought to Livingston Manor (now Germantown). New York's Governor Hunter had also helped with these arrangements: the workers were to make naval stores (\"e.g.\", pitch, resin, and turpentine) from the pine trees in the Catskill Mountains.\nThey were promised land for resettlement after completing their terms of indenture. They were refugees from years of religious fighting along the border with France, as well as crop failures from a severe winter. Work camps were established on both sides of the Hudson River. The Germans quickly established Protestant churches at the heart of their community, which recorded their weddings, births and deaths, among the first vital records kept in the colony.\nAfter many years, some of the colonists were granted land in the frontier of the central Mohawk Valley west of present-day Little Falls in the 100 lots of the Burnetsfield Patent; in the Schoharie Valley, and other areas, such as Palatine Bridge along the Mohawk River west of Schenectady. They were buffer communities between the British settlements and the Iroquois and French (the latter located mostly in Canada.)\nColumbia County was formed in 1786 after the American Revolutionary War from portions of Albany County, once a vast area until new communities were developed and jurisdictions were organized. In 1799, the southern boundary of Columbia County was moved southward to include that portion of Livingston Manor located in Dutchess County.\nIn the nineteenth century, the Vermont Central Railway was constructed to the area. It provided transportation north towards Rutland and Burlington, Vermont, and south towards the major junction town of Chatham, New York, for travel to points west, south and east.\nA large number of LGBT artists and writers settled in Columbia County in the late 20th century, including Ellsworth Kelly, who moved to the county in 1970, followed by James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (1975) and the poet John Ashbery (1978).\nGovernment and politics.\nVoters in Columbia County since the mid-19th century have mostly elected Republicans to office. But from 1996 to 2007, new voter registrations by Democrats have outpaced those by Republicans by a margin of 4 to 1. Democrats have been able to win the county in every presidential election since 1996, with Joe Biden's 57% of the vote in 2020 being the highest for a Democrat in the county since 1964.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.1%) is water.\nColumbia County is in the southeast south-to-central part of New York State, southeast of Albany and immediately west of the Massachusetts border. The western border is the Hudson River.\nThe landscapes of the county were among the scenes depicting by the Hudson River School, a mid-19th century art movement.\nThe terrain is gentle, rolling hills, rising sharply into the Taconic and Berkshire Mountains along the state line. To the west lie the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains.\nThe highest point is on the Massachusetts state line, near the summit of Alander Mountain, at approximately above sea level, in the town of Copake. The lowest point is at or near sea level, along the Hudson.\nColumbia County is accessible by two limited-access highways. The Taconic State Parkway, which is not accessible to trucks or commercial traffic, runs through the center of the county from south to north, ending at an interchange with Interstate 90 and connecting the county with points south. Columbia County is the last New York county located along eastbound Interstate 90 (and the first county along westbound I-90), which passes through the towns of Canaan and Chatham as the Berkshire Connector portion of the New York Thruway. I-90 has two exits within the county; for the southbound Taconic State Parkway in Chatham, and for NYS Route 22 in Canaan. Depending on precise location within the county, road travel distance to New York City ranges between .\nSeveral other major routes cross Columbia County including north\u2013south U.S. Route 9, east\u2013west NYS Route 23, north\u2013south NYS Route 22 and a short portion of east\u2013west U.S. Route 20 in the county's northeastern corner.\nRivers and streams.\nThe Hudson River forms the western border of the county. Other notable creeks include; the Ancram Creek, Claverack Creek, Copake Creek, Kinderhook Creek, Roeliff-Jansen Kill, and Valatie Kill. The Rossman Falls and Stuyvesant Falls lie on the Kinderhook Creek. Notable lakes and ponds include Copake Lake, Kinderhook Reservoir, Queechy Lake, and Lake Taghkanic.\nFarms.\nColumbia County is home to many local farms supplying the area with fresh meat, eggs, herbs, and produce, including Holmquest, Ronnybrook, Fix Brothers Fruit Farm, Eger Brothers, Hover Farms, Marsh Meadow Farm, Schober Farm, Millerhurst, Ooms Farm, Churchtown Dairy, Pigasso, Common Hands Farm, Darlin' Doe, Blue Star Farm, Green Mead Farm, Little Ghent Farm, and Ironwood Farm. Other farms include the large, well-known Hawthorne Valley Farm which includes a farm store and training programs, the biodynamic Roxbury Farm, and FarmOn! at Empire Farm, also a teaching farm.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 63,094 people, 24,796 households, and 16,588 families residing in the county.

Set in 1936, the film stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, a globetrotting archaeologist vying with Nazi German forces to recover the long-lost Ark of the Covenant which is said to make an army invincible. Teaming up with his tough former romantic interest Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Jones races to stop rival archaeologist Ren\u00e9 Belloq (Paul Freeman) from guiding the Nazis to the Ark and its power.\nLucas conceived \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early 20th century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film's goal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977 film \"Star Wars\". Development on \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" resumed that year when he shared the idea with Spielberg, who joined the project several months later. While the pair had ideas for set pieces and stunts for the film, they hired Kasdan to fill in the narrative gaps between them. Principal photography began in June 1980 on a $20million budget, and concluded that September. Filming took place on sets at Elstree Studios, England, and on location mainly in La Rochelle, France, Tunisia, and Hawaii.\nPre-release polling showed little audience interest in the film leading up to its release date on June 12, 1981, especially compared to \"Superman II\". However, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" became the highest-grossing film of the year, earning approximately $354million worldwide, and played in some theaters for over a year. It was also a critical success, receiving praise for its set pieces, humor, and action sequences. The film was nominated for several awards, and won five Academy Awards, seven Saturn Awards, and one BAFTA, among other accolades.\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is considered by critics to be one of the greatest films ever made and has had a lasting influence on popular culture, spawning a host of imitators across several media and inspiring other filmmakers. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1999. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is the first entry in what became the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise, which includes four more films\u2014\"Temple of Doom\" (1984), \"Last Crusade\" (1989), \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" (2008), and \"Dial of Destiny\" (2023)\u2014a television series, video games, comic books, novels, theme park attractions, and toys.\nPlot.\nIn 1936, American archaeologist Indiana Jones recovers a Golden Idol from a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Rival archaeologist Ren\u00e9 Belloq corners him and steals the idol; Jones escapes in a waiting float plane.\nAfter returning to the United States, Jones is briefed by two Army Intelligence agents that Nazi German forces are excavating at Tanis, Egypt, and one of their telegrams mentions Jones's former mentor Abner Ravenwood. He deduces that the Nazis are seeking the Ark of the Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make their army invincible. The agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark first.\nAt a bar in Nepal, Jones reunites with Abner's daughter Marion, with whom Jones once had an illicit relationship, and learns that Abner is dead. The bar is set ablaze during a scuffle with Gestapo agent Arnold Toht, who arrives to take a medallion from Marion. Toht attempts to recover the medallion from the flames, but only burns its image into his hand. Jones and Marion safely take the medallion and escape.\nTraveling to Cairo, the pair meet Jones's friend Sallah. He reveals Belloq is assisting the Nazis, who have fashioned an incomplete replica medallion from the burns on Toht's hand. Nazi soldiers and mercenaries attack Jones, and Marion is seemingly killed, leaving Jones despondent. An imam deciphers the medallion for Jones, revealing that one side bears a warning against disturbing the Ark, and the other bears the complete measurements for the \"staff of Ra\", an item which, when combined with the medallion, is used to locate the Ark. Jones and Sallah realize that the Nazis are digging in the wrong location, infiltrate the Nazi dig site, and use the medallion and the correctly sized staff of Ra to locate the Well of Souls, the Ark's resting place. The pair recover the Ark, a golden, intricately decorated chest, but Belloq and the Nazis discover them and seize it. Jones and Marion, whom Belloq has been holding captive, are sealed inside the well, but the pair escape and Jones captures a truck carrying the Ark.\nAlongside Marion, Jones arranges to transport the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer. A German U-boat intercepts them, seizing the Ark and Marion; Jones covertly boards the U-boat. The vessel travels to an island in the Aegean Sea, where Belloq intends to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler.\nOn the island, Jones ambushes the Nazi group and threatens to destroy the Ark but surrenders after Belloq deduces that he would never destroy something so historically significant, also surmising that Jones wants to know if the Ark's power is real. The Nazis restrain Jones and Marion at the testing site as Belloq ceremonially opens the Ark but finds only sand inside. At Jones's instruction, he and Marion close their eyes to avoid looking at the opened Ark, as it releases spirits, flames, and bolts of energy that kill Belloq, Toht, and the assembled Nazis before sealing itself shut. Jones and Marion open their eyes to find the area cleared of bodies and their bindings removed.\nBack in Washington, D.C., the United States government rewards Jones for securing the Ark. Despite Jones's insistence, the agents state only that the Ark has been moved to an undisclosed location for \"top men\" to study. In a vast warehouse, the Ark is crated up and stored among countless other crates.\nCast.\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" also features Wolf Kahler as Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich and Anthony Higgins as Major Gobler, Dietrich's right-hand man. Don Fellows and William Hootkins appear as United States Army Intelligence agents Colonel Musgrove and Major Eaton, respectively. George Harris plays Simon Katanga, captain of the \"Bantu Wind\" tramp steamer, and Fred Sorenson portrays Jones's pilot Jock.\nProducer Frank Marshall appears as the Flying Wing pilot. Pat Roach appears as the Nazi who brawls with Jones by the Flying Wing and one of Toht's Nepalese Sherpas. Vic Tablian plays Jones's treacherous Peruvian guide Barranca and the Monkey Man in Cairo. Alfred Molina appears as Jones's traitorous guide Satipo in his film debut. Terry Richards portrays the Cairo swordsman shot by Jones.\nProduction.\nConception.\nGeorge Lucas conceived \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" in 1973, shortly after finishing the comedy drama \"American Graffiti\" (1973). An old movie poster of a heroic character leaping from a horse to a truck reminded Lucas of the early 20th-century serial films he enjoyed as a youth, such as \"Buck Rogers\" (1939), \"Zorro's Fighting Legion\" (1939), \"Spy Smasher\" (1942) and \"Don Winslow of the Navy\" (1942). He wanted to make a B movie modeled on those serials and conceived \"The Adventures of Indiana Smith\", featuring a daring archaeologist named after his Alaskan Malamute dog. Around the same time, Lucas was trying to adapt the space opera serial \"Flash Gordon\" (1936), but could not obtain the rights. He shelved the Indiana Smith project to focus on creating his own space opera, \"Star Wars\" (1977).\nIn 1975, Lucas discussed his serial film idea with his friend Philip Kaufman. The pair worked on a story for two weeks. Lucas imagined his character as a college professor and archaeologist adventurer, based on his own appreciation for archaeology and famous archaeologists like Hiram Bingham\u00a0III, Roy Chapman Andrews, and Leonard Woolley. Kaufman removed Lucas's vision of Smith as a nightclub patron and womanizer, and suggested the Ark of the Covenant as the film's central goal, taking inspiration from hematologist Raphael Isaacs's theories on the physics of Biblical miracles. The Ark provided a source of conflict for the hero and the Nazis, playing off Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's historical fascination with the occult.\nLucas wanted Kaufman to direct the film, but because he was already committed to working on the western \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" (1976), Lucas paused the idea again and resumed working on \"Star Wars\". In May 1977, Lucas vacationed in Hawaii to avoid any potential negative news about the theatrical debut of \"Star Wars\", which he feared would fail at the box office. He invited Steven Spielberg to join him and his wife. On a beach near the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, Lucas and Spielberg discussed their next projects. Spielberg wanted to direct a James Bond film, but Lucas pitched him \"The Adventures of Indiana Smith\". Lucas still hoped Kaufman would direct it, but a few months later it was clear he could not participate and Lucas asked Spielberg to replace him.\nWriting.\nLawrence Kasdan, Spielberg's recent discovery, was chosen to write the script. Kasdan had been working as a professional screenwriter for only a month but Lucas agreed to hire him after reading his script for \"Continental Divide\" (1981). In January 1978, Lucas, Kasdan, and Spielberg spent about nine hours a day over three to five days at Lucas's assistant's house in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, developing Lucas's outline. Several ideas came from these discussions, including the boulder trap, the monkey in Cairo, Toht burning the medallion's imprint into his hand, and government agents locking the Ark away. Kasdan realized Spielberg and Lucas had several set pieces in mind, but they were looking for someone else to do the hard work of piecing them together.\nSpielberg hated the name Indiana Smith, believing it would remind audiences of the Steve McQueen character Nevada Smith. All three men agreed to use the surname \"Jones\" instead. The Indiana Jones character was based on actors Clint Eastwood and Toshiro Mifune, and the fictional character James Bond. Lucas also wanted Jones to be a kung fu practitioner and a playboy, funding his lifestyle with the spoils of his adventures, but Spielberg and Kasdan felt the character was complicated enough being an adventurer and archaeologist. Spielberg suggested making Jones an avid gambler or an alcoholic, but Lucas wanted Jones to be a role model who is \"honest and true and trusting.\" Both men felt it was important Jones be fallible, vulnerable, and as capable of comedic moments as well as serious ones. They intended him to be someone the audience could relate to and idolize. Lucas suggested Marion would have a romantic past, at the age of 11, with the much older Jones; Spielberg replied, \"she had better be older\".\nWhile Spielberg directed \"1941\" (1979), Kasdan used his office to write \"Raiders\", taking inspiration from early 20th-century serials and adventure films like \"Red River\" (1948), \"Seven Samurai\" (1954), and \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960). He wrote Jones as an antihero, an archaeologist reduced to grave-robbing. Kasdan wanted a supporting cast with their own unique characteristics and believed it was important these characters had a memorable impact. He described how the hardest part of writing was explaining how Jones would fall into successive dangerous events and survive, and how he traveled between locations. In August 1978, after approximately five months, Kasdan completed his first draft.\nSpielberg described the draft as good but too long; Kasdan and Lucas collaborated to trim and refine it. The script was a globe-spanning tale set in the United States, Egypt, Greece, and Nepal. Several elements were cut, including a journey to Shanghai that would lead to a minecart chase and Jones using a gong to shield himself from gunfire, ideas later used in the prequel \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (1984). To his frustration, much of Kasdan's love story between Jones and Marion was trimmed, as were scenes showing the mutual attraction between Marion and Belloq. The screenplay was completed by December 1979.\nDevelopment and pre-production.\nLucas wanted to fund \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" himself, but lacked the money. Lucasfilm offered the project to several Hollywood studios. They rejected it, in part because of the proposed $20million budget, but also because of the deal Lucas offered. He wanted the studio to provide the budget, have no creative input and allow him to retain control of the licensing rights and any sequels. The studios considered this deal unacceptable. They were also hesitant because Spielberg had delivered a succession of films over-schedule and over-budget; his recent effort, \"1941\", was both over-budget and a critical failure. However, Lucas refused to do the project without Spielberg.\nWhen the project was offered to Paramount Pictures, president Michael Eisner compromised with Lucas, accepting his deal in exchange for exclusive rights to any sequels and severe penalties for exceeding the schedule or budget. Lucas reportedly negotiated a salary between $1million and $4million plus a share of the gross profits, though a separate report stated he received only net profits. Spielberg received up to $1.5million as director and a share of the gross profits.\nProducer Frank Marshall, who had experience on smaller independent films, was hired because Spielberg believed he would keep the film on schedule and budget. Spielberg also hired cinematographer Douglas Slocombe and production designer Norman Reynolds because he liked their previous works, and his long-time collaborator Michael Kahn as editor. Lucas served as a second unit director and the film's executive producer, along with his acquaintance Howard Kazanjian, whom Lucas believed would be a disciplined influence and not indulge the filmmakers' larger ambitions. He also brought in his long-time collaborator Robert Watts as associate producer and production manager. Paramount mandated a filming schedule of 85 days; Lucas, Spielberg, and Marshall agreed on a self-imposed 73-day schedule. Spielberg was determined to avoid criticism for another schedule overrun.\nSix months of pre-production began in December 1979. Spielberg preferred to spend a year in pre-production, but worked at a faster pace to keep the budget low. Spielberg and Lucas were both simultaneously working on other projects. Artists Ed Verreaux, Dave Negron, Michael Lloyd, and Joe Johnston provided extensive storyboarding, with over 80% of the script represented, equaling approximately 6,000 images. This helped Spielberg pre-visualize scenes and limit the time taken to set up shots. The script described the opening of the ark only as \"all hell breaks loose\", and the artists were tasked with envisioning what should happen. Each offered different aspects: spirits, flames, and weird light effects; Johnston was tasked with combining all three. Spielberg also had miniature sets of larger scenes built to plan layouts and lighting, including the Well of Souls, the Tanis dig site, and the Cairo marketplace. They contained 1-inch tall figurines to suggest how many extras would be required. Among changes made at this stage, Spielberg abandoned his idea for Toht to have a mechanical arm that could be replaced with a machine gun or flamethrower. Lucas said it put the film into a different genre.\nCasting.\nLucas wanted a relatively unknown actor, willing to commit to a trilogy of films, to play Indiana Jones. Those considered for the role included Bill Murray, Nick Nolte, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Tim Matheson, Nick Mancuso, Peter Coyote, Jack Nicholson, Jeff Bridges, John Shea, Sam Elliott, Harry Hamlin, and David Hasselhoff. Casting director Mike Fenton favored Bridges but Lucas's wife and frequent collaborator Marcia Lucas preferred Tom Selleck. Selleck was contractually obligated to filming the television series \"Magnum, P.I.\" if it were to be made into a full series. Lucas and Spielberg asked the show's network, CBS, to release him ten days early from his contract. Realizing Selleck was in demand, CBS greenlit \"Magnum P.I.\", forcing him to drop out and leaving the production with no lead actor only weeks before filming. The 1980 actors strike later put the show on hiatus for three months, which would have allowed Selleck to star as Jones.\nSpielberg said Ford was perfect for the role after seeing him in \"The Empire Strikes Back\"; Kazanjian said Ford had always been considered but not cast because he was already a well-known actor. Lucas was concerned about seeming reliant on Ford by casting him in another film after \"Star Wars\", and he also did not think he would commit to three films. However, Ford thought it would be a fun project and agreed to the deal. He negotiated a seven-figure salary, a percentage of the gross profits, and the option to re-write his dialogue. Ford undertook extensive exercise to enhance his physique and trained for several weeks under stunt coordinator Glenn Randall to use a bullwhip, becoming proficient enough to disarm the Monkey Man (Vic Tablian); his wrist had to be rehabilitated to compensate for an old injury. Ford's interpretation of the character was as an academic first and an adventurer second.\nFor Jones's love interest Marion, Spielberg wanted someone akin to early 20th-century leading female icons like Irene Dunne, Barbara Stanwyck, and Ann Sheridan, who equaled their male counterparts. Lucas wanted Debra Winger, but she was not interested, and Spielberg wanted his girlfriend Amy Irving, but she was unavailable. They also considered Stephanie Zimbalist, Barbara Hershey, Sean Young (who screen tested with Selleck), and Wendie Malick. Spielberg was aware of Karen Allen from her performance in \"Animal House\" (1978), portraying an independent female character, and she impressed him with her professionalism during auditions for \"Raiders\". One of the first things Spielberg asked Allen was \"how well do you spit?\". Allen developed a backstory for Marion that included her mother's death and her relationship with Jones when she was 15\u201316, but Spielberg said it belonged in a different movie. Kasdan named Marion after his grandmother-in-law, and took Ravenwood from a Los Angeles street.\nBelloq was intended to be a sophisticated villain to counter the \"beer-drinking\" hero. Spielberg cast Freeman after seeing him in the docudrama \"Death of a Princess\" (1980); Freeman's piercing eyes had captivated him. Giancarlo Giannini and singer Jacques Dutronc were also considered. Danny DeVito was approached to portray Sallah, described as a skinny, tall Egyptian like Gunga Din in \"Gunga Din\" (1939). DeVito could not participate because of scheduling conflicts with his sitcom \"Taxi\" and because his agent wanted too much money. Rhys-Davies was cast based on his performance in the 1980 miniseries \"Sh\u014dgun\". Spielberg asked him to play the character as a mix of his \"Sh\u014dgun\" role and the character John Falstaff. Ronald Lacey was cast as Toht because he reminded Spielberg of actor Peter Lorre. Klaus Kinski was offered the role but chose to appear in the horror film \"Venom\" (1981) because it offered more money.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography began on June\u00a023, 1980. Filming took place on location in La Rochelle in France, Tunisia in North Africa, and Hawaii, and on sets at Elstree Studios, England. Elstree was chosen because it was well-staffed with artists and technicians who had worked on \"Star Wars\". On-location shooting cost around $100,000 a day in addition to crew salaries; sets cost an additional $4million. The production could afford certain equipment only for a limited time, including a Panaglide camera stabilizer for smoother shots, and a camera crane for higher angles. To maintain the tight schedule, Spielberg said he \"...didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four... Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie.\"\nFilming began in La Rochelle, depicting the capture of the \"Bantu Wind\" by a Nazi U-boat. Watts borrowed a submarine from the war film \"Das Boot\" (1981) on condition it not be taken into deep waters. World War II German U-boat pens in La Rochelle represented the U-boat dock. An original coal-fired tramp steamer boat could not be found for filming, so an Egyptian boat found in an Irish port was decorated appropriately and sailed to France.\nThe production moved to Elstree Studios by June30. Interiors included the scene featuring an imam deciphering the staff headpiece and the Peruvian temple. There were repeated delays while filming the Well of Souls scene: there were too few snakes, a lack of anti-venom, and director Stanley Kubrick's daughter Vivian called the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) about the treatment of the snakes. The interior of Jones's school was filmed at The Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, in Hertfordshire; the exterior was the University of the Pacific in California.\nTunisia was used to portray Egypt. Spielberg described this phase as one of his worst filming experiences: the temperature was often over , and over 150 crew members became sick with amoebic dysentery from the local food. Spielberg was one of the few to remain healthy because he ate food and water he brought from England. Lucas also suffered a severe sunburn and facial swelling. The Cairo village was filmed in the city of Kairouan. A day of filming was lost there because over 300 TV antennas had to be removed from the surrounding houses. Budget constraints affected Spielberg's desire to have 2,000 extras as diggers; he had to settle for 600. Stuntman Terry Richards, who portrayed the swordsman nonchalantly dispatched by Jones, spent weeks practicing sword skills for an extended fight scene. Ford was unable to perform for long periods while suffering from dysentery, and it was decided to shorten the fight scene significantly. The Sidi Bouhlel canyon near the city of Tozeur is where a rocket launcher-equipped Jones confronts the Nazis for the Ark. Lucas had used the canyon in \"Star Wars\" to portray the planet Tatooine. During the scene, a fly crawled onto Freeman's lip during his dialogue, but he continued to deliver his lines. Although it appeared to be eaten, Freeman clarified it flew away.\nIn late September, filming moved to Hawaii for exterior shots required for the film's opening scenes set in Peru. The Paramount logo dissolving into a natural mountain was an improvisation by Spielberg based on his own childhood habit of doing the same while making films; the mountain is Kalalea Mountain on the island of Kaua\u02bbi. Ten locations were used across Hawaii, including the Huleia National Wildlife Refuge. Originally, the opening sequence was longer and more elaborate, featuring more dialogue and Jones fighting a guide who betrayed him; this was all removed for tighter pacing. Although the cave exterior was considered a perfect location, a nearby pool was a mosquito breeding ground; all the crew got bitten despite anti-mosquito equipment. The brown donkeys used for the trek suffered lameness. As replacements could not be sourced locally, a pair of gray donkeys were dyed brown with colored hairspray and flown by helicopter to the N\u0101 Pali Coast State Park to finish the scene.\nThe loosely detailed script led to much improvisation; where the script described three people talking in a room, in the film it took place in a quarry alongside 500 extras. Scenes like a student of Jones's flashing the \"Love You\" message written across her eyelids and Marion putting on a dress to conceal a weapon were also improvised. Allen believed the latter scene focused on her character seducing Belloq, undermining her loyalty and love for Jones. She and Freeman collaborated to develop the idea of Marion getting Belloq drunk instead. Allen, Lacey, Freeman, and Rhys-Davies often spent time together between filming to talk and discuss their characters. Allen described Ford as a private person who would not discuss his character in detail, and it took her a while to adapt to his working style. Filming concluded in September 1980, after 73 days. Lucas described it as the film he had the fewest problems with because of the lack of studio interference.\nPost-production.\nPost-production lasted about two months and focused mainly on special effects and pick-up shots. Spielberg's first cut was close to three hours long before he and Kahn re-edited it to just under two hours. Lucas was happy with this edit, but later asked if he could shorten the ending. He and Kahn collaborated on the edit; Spielberg said he was happy with their changes. The final cut of the film runs for 115minutes. Marcia Lucas opined there was no emotional closure for Jones and Marion because she was absent following the closure of the Ark. Marcia is not credited in the film, but her suggestion led Spielberg to shoot a final exterior sequence on the steps of San Francisco City Hall showing Jones and Marion together.\nOther changes included the addition of a scene where the Ark makes a humming noise in the \"Bantu Wind\" hold and the removal of a scene showing Jones holding on to the U-boat periscope to follow the Nazis; Spielberg thought it looked poor and hoped the audiences would not care how Jones accomplished the feat. Lucas removed a scene of a man fainting at the sight of Jones and Marion emerging from the Well of Souls because he thought the joke did not fit with the tone of the film. Shots of the Douglas DC-3 Jones and Marion use to fly out of Nepal were repurposed from the adventure film \"Lost Horizon\" (1973), and an establishing shot of the streets of Washington, D.C. was taken from \"The Hindenburg\" (1975). Spielberg justified the use of stock footage as cost-effective, and reasoned that only sharp-eyed viewers would notice. Special effects supervisor Richard Edlund claimed that the street scene was done with miniatures.\nMusic.\nJohn Williams composed the score for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". He said the music did not have to be serious for the film and was instead theatrical and excessive. Williams spent a few weeks working on the Indiana Jones theme, more commonly known as \"The Raiders March\" that plays during the main character's heroic scenes. Two separate pieces were played for Spielberg, who wanted to use both. These pieces became the main theme and musical bridge of \"The Raiders March\".\nFor the romantic theme, Williams took inspiration from older films like the drama \"Now, Voyager\" (1942) to create something more emotionally monumental that he felt would contrast well with the film's humor and lighter moments. Williams used \"dark\" orchestral pieces to represent the actions of the Nazis, using the \"seventh degree on the scale of the bottom\". He said this signified a militaristic evil. To create something suitably biblical for the Ark of the Covenant, he used a mix of chorus and orchestra.\nDesign.\nStunts.\nThe Peruvian temple interiors used in the film were life-sized sets. The giant boulder\u2014made of fiberglass, plaster and wood\u2014was designed to be wide, but this was reduced to , with the resulting prop weighing . Spielberg liked the effect and had its ramp extended to give it more screen time. The boulder was controlled by a steel rod concealed in the wall by rubber rock outcroppings. Ford performed the stunt ten times for the different camera angles. Spielberg said he was an idiot for letting Ford do it, but it would not have looked as good with a stuntman concealing his face. Ford performed as many of his stunts as was allowed throughout \"Raiders\", suffering various injuries. The tarantulas on Molina's body would not move because they were male and non-aggressive. A female spider was put on his chest to encourage movement. Abandoned ideas for the temple included a crushing wall trap and a pit concealed by spider-webs. The golden idol also had mechanically operated eyes that could follow Jones. For the last part of the scene where Jones flees by plane, the first take ended in near-disaster when the plane crashed from a height of because Ford's dangling leg was blocking the aircraft's right flap.\nFilming of the Well of Souls scene was delayed initially by a lack of snakes. There were 500\u2013600 snakes to use for close shots and some mechanical snakes for wider shots, but Spielberg wanted more. A request was made to snake handlers from around London and Europe who produced between 6,000 and 10,000 snakes in a few days. Afterward, they struggled to obtain anti-venom; with local supplies having expired, it had to be imported from India. Many of the snakes were harmless grass snakes or non-venomous pythons, but the cobras were positioned behind plexiglas to protect the cast and crew. Also present among the snakes were legless lizards. The stage doors were kept open during filming for quick access to a waiting ambulance. Spielberg recounted that Allen was so scared she could not scream on cue. He dropped a dead serpent on her to elicit a genuine reaction. Allen said she got used to the creatures after 3\u20134 days. Animal handler Steve Edge donned a dress and shaved his legs to stand in for Allen at specific points. Vivian Kubrick's complaint to the RSPCA about the perceived poor treatment of the snakes required production to cease while safeguards were added.\nReynolds and production artist Ron Cobb created the BV-38 flying wing based on the Horten Ho 229, the Northrop N-1M and the Vought V-173. Constructed by the British engineering firm Vickers, it was dismantled and shipped to Tunisia. It was not designed to be flight-worthy, only to serve as a source of danger from its propellers. The plane was abandoned in Tunisia and slowly dismantled over the following decade by souvenir hunters before being demolished. The fight between Jones and the German underneath the plane was mainly improvised; Spielberg had to restrain himself from making it too long as each new idea led to another. During the fight, the moving vehicle rolled over Ford's foot and towards his knee before it was stopped. It took 40 crew members to move it off of him. He avoided injury through a combination of the extreme Tunisian heat making the tire soft and the ground being covered in sand. Dysentery had left the production with a lack of stuntmen, and Spielberg had Marshall stand in as the flying wing pilot. The three-day shoot was one of Spielberg's more difficult scenes to film, and he was reported saying he wanted to go home.\nSecond unit director Michael D. Moore filmed most of the truck chase. Spielberg had not used a second director before but agreed to it as the scene would take a long time to film being set in multiple locations. Moore completed wider shots where stuntmen stood in for Ford. He closely followed Spielberg's storyboarding but innovated a few shots Spielberg considered improvements. Stuntman Glenn Randall suggested the scene of Jones traversing the underside of the truck. Ford sat in a concealed bicycle seat attached to the truck underside when clinging to its front. One of the convoy cars going over a cliff was a combination of matte painting background and stop motion animation of miniature figures falling out of the car.\nSpecial effects.\nLucas's Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) handled the film's special effects, under the supervision of Richard Edlund. The team worked on both \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and the dark fantasy \"Dragonslayer\" (1981). Lucas felt special effects were a financially economical method of delivering a good film; as long as they were emotionally involved in the story, he said audiences would buy into even a poor special effect. Spielberg liked practical effects because he could regularly check the raw footage during filming, rather than waiting months for the completed composite effects.\nFreeman said he had no idea what was happening when he opened the Ark. He was told to imagine something coming towards him and to scream. Special effects artist Steve Gawley created the Ark's spirits by suspending small robed puppets in a clouded water tank in front of a blue screen. They were shaken to create a natural movement that was composited into the live footage. A Lucasfilm receptionist, dressed in a long white robe, was suspended in the air in front of a blue screen for the close-up of the ghost. She was filmed moving away from the camera and the footage was reversed to create an inhuman movement. Her visage was composited with a skeletal model for the monstrous transformation.\nFreeman, Lacey, and Kahler's death scenes were created using different models. A mold was made of Kahler's face; it was lined with bladders filled with air. Controlled by up to ten people, the air was removed to make the head shrivel. Special effects artist Chris Walas sculpted Lacey's melting face using different colored layers of gelatin placed over a carved, heat-resistant stone skull. Propane heaters were used to melt the gelatin and filmed using a slower-than-normal camera so the effect appears to take place rapidly when played at normal speed. Belloq's head mold contained a thin-plaster skull filled with blood bags and detritus. It was blown up using explosives, shotguns, and an air cannon. It took three attempts to get the desired effect. Belloq's death was considered so extreme the Motion Picture Association of America initially classified the film with an R rating restricting it to those over the age of 17 without an adult. Flames were superimposed over the scene to conceal the effect.\nKasdan scripted detailed montages during the transition between locations, but Spielberg saved money by showing a map and an animated line traveling between destinations. Skulls and rotting bodies made by chief make-up artist Tom Smith filled the Well of Souls catacombs. To get the monkey to perform a Nazi salute, the trainer hit it on the head to make it touch the affected area. When this did not work, the filmmakers hung a grape over its head to encourage it to reach up; it took 50 takes to capture. A partially deaf rat was used for the scene of the ark humming in the hold of the \"Bantu Wind\", giving it a unique and unnatural head movement.\nVisuals and sound.\nMatte paintings were used to create more elaborate backgrounds: these included the establishing shot of Marion's Nepalese bar and the warehouse where the Ark is later stored, the latter painted by Michael Pangrazio. Spielberg disliked the painting of the China Clipper plane (by Alan Maley) as he did not think it looked real against the water they had filmed. Jones's attire\u2014a leather jacket and khaki pants\u2014was based on Humphrey Bogart's in \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948) and Charlton Heston in \"Secret of the Incas\" (1954). Costume designer Deborah Nadoolman Landis dumped boxes of hats on the floor for Ford to try on. After picking the right style, she purchased an Australian model she aged with Fuller's earth and mineral oil, and then scrunched beneath a bed. The hat allowed them to create a recognizable image even in silhouette. Designer Ralph McQuarrie was responsible for the Ark decorations.\nSpielberg wanted a moodier film noir lighting style like in \"The Informer\" (1935). In contrast, Slocombe wanted to make things brighter and used backlighting to create a greater depth of field; Spielberg preferred his changes. Slocombe often employed natural light, using solar position predictions to plot a scene's layout. Spielberg liked the beams of sunlight glimpsed through scenery and tasked special effects artist Kit West with using a smoke machine to create artificial sunlight shards. For the bar fight, Spielberg wanted pitch-black shadows on the wall, but the lighting required to achieve this would have shrouded the actors' eyes; he settled for subtler shadings. He also wanted to illuminate the Well of Souls with a lighting effect through the ceiling opening, but once this was sealed it no longer made sense. The flaming torches used in the scene did not provide enough light, so he opted to use an artificial light source. Spielberg noted Allen always looked beautiful in her scenes because Slocombe spent twice as long setting up her lighting as he did Ford's.\nSound effects supervisor Ben Burtt recorded the film's many sounds. The snake slithering is a mix of Burtt running his hands through cheese casserole and wet sponges being dragged across grip tape; the rolling boulder is a Honda Civic driving down a gravel hill; and the Ark lid opening is the sound of a toilet cistern being opened. The Ark spirits are the cries of sea lions and dolphins filtered through a vocoder. Jones's revolver is the sound of a Winchester rifle firing, while his whip-crack was made by recording Ford using the whip.\nRelease.\nContext.\nBy the summer of 1981 (June\u2013September), the film industry had been in decline for over a year. This was the result of few box office successes, rising film production costs, diminishing audiences, and increasing ticket prices. The season was predicted to be down 10% or $250million against the previous year. Over 60 films were scheduled for release\u2014more than the previous year\u2014by studios eager to make the next blockbuster film. This increased competition to attract audiences, mainly those aged 12 to 24, at the most profitable time of the year.\nThe superhero film \"Superman II\" was expected to dominate the season, and based on industry experts and audience polling, films including \"History of the World, Part I\", the latest James Bond film \"For Your Eyes Only\", and \"The Great Muppet Caper\", were also expected to perform well. Conversely, audience polling by CinemaScore showed little awareness or anticipation for \"Raiders\" until nationwide previews a week before its release. \"The New York Times\" reported Paramount had provided theater owners with a more beneficial deal than usual to ensure \"Raiders\" was screened in the best theaters and locations.\nFeaturing two camels, an elephant, and a python, the press event for the film cost $10,000. Film prints were supplied to theaters in lead-sealed containers to prevent tampering alongside a letter to theater managers stating they were responsible for any misuse of the film. This letter inspired a whistleblower at one theater to alert Paramount of the planned theft of a \"Raiders\" print to make pirated copies. The 1,200 film prints cost an estimated $1.7million. The theatrical release poster was created by Richard Amsel.\nBox office.\nIn the United States (U.S.) and Canada, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was released on June12, 1981, in 1,078 theaters. The film earned $8.3million\u2014an average of $7,705 per theater, and finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of the debuts of \"Clash of the Titans\" ($6.6million) and \"History of the World, Part I\" ($4.9million). Audiences polled by CinemaScore during its opening weekend gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nThe film fell to the number three position in its second weekend with an additional gross of $8million\u2014a decline of only four percent\u2014behind the debuts of \"The Cannonball Run\" ($11.8million) and \"Superman II\" ($14.1million). By its fourth week, \"Raiders\" began climbing box office charts, reaching the number two position with a gross of $7.3million, behind \"Superman II\" ($10.9million). In its sixth week, it regained the number one position with $6.4million. The film spent most of the following nine weeks as the number one film, and forty-weeks straight as one of the top ten highest-grossing films. It was declared the top box office film of the summer by early September, with a total approximate gross of $125million. Of this figure, $72 million was estimated to have been returned to the studio; the profit-sharing deal with Spielberg and Lucas meant that after marketing costs, Paramount had earned $23million in profit.\nThe film remained a steady success; six months after its release, industry executives joked \"Raiders\" would be the year's big Christmas film. The film officially left theaters on March18, 1982, although some were still playing it by July. \"Raiders\" earned an approximate total box office gross of $212.2million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1981, ahead of \"On Golden Pond\" ($119.3million), \"Superman II\" ($108.1million), and \"Stripes\" ($85.3million). An estimate by Box Office Mojo suggests over 77million tickets were bought to see the film. \"Raiders\" remains the \"leggiest\" film ever released, referring to the difference between the highest-weekend gross and the time taken to achieve the overall total gross.\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, \"Raiders\" earned a further $141.7million, making it the highest-grossing film ahead of \"For Your Eyes Only\" ($140.5million) and \"Superman II\" ($82.2million). In total, the film earned a worldwide gross of $354million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1981 worldwide, again ahead of \"For Your Eyes Only\" ($195.3million) and \"Superman II\" ($190.4million).\n\"Raiders\" has been re-released several times, first in July 1982, when it earned an additional $21.4million and again in March 1983, when the film earned an additional $11.4million. A remastered IMAX version, supervised by Spielberg, was released in 267 U.S. and Canadian theaters. The success of the release led to the run being extended to 300 additional theaters. These releases have raised the film's worldwide theatrical gross to an estimated $389.9million.\nThe record $1.95billion summer box-office of 1981 represented a 15.6% increase over 1980, with a 22.5% increase in ticket sales. This success was attributed mainly to \"Raiders\" and \"Superman II\". The most successful film genres of the year offered fun, comedy, and escapism. \"Superman II\" broke box office records, but it was \"Raiders\" that earned the most money and played in theaters for over a year. \"The New York Times\" reported that audiences considered other films only if both \"Superman II\" and \"Raiders\" were sold out. It became one of the top-four highest-grossing films ever, a list dominated by Lucas and Spielberg with \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Jaws\", and \"Star Wars\".\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was released to general critical acclaim. The National Board of Review and critic Vincent Canby listed it as one of the ten best films of the year. Canby labeled the film an \"instant classic\" and one of the most humorous and stylish American films ever made. He described it as having refined the old serial films into their most perfect form for a modern audience. Roger Ebert called it a series of \"breathless and incredible\" adventures inspired by and celebrating childhood stories told in comic books and movies. He concluded the film was successful in its singular goal of entertaining, creating an adventure epic in the vein of \"Star Wars\", the James Bond films, and \"Superman\". Writing for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Arthur Knight said a constant stream of thrills kept the film moving at a steady pace. Writing for \"Variety\", Stephen Klain called the film \"exhilarating escapist entertainment\". He continued that the film successfully balanced action, comedy, and suspense with mystical mythologies. Michael Sragow described it as the \"ultimate Saturday action matinee\". Gene Siskel said it was as entertaining as a \"commercial movie\" could be, the kind of film that makes children excited about cinema.\nRichard Schickel called it a return to form for Spielberg, demonstrating a competence not seen since \"Jaws\". He described it as a film Walt Disney would have made were he still alive, featuring an \"enchanting\" combination of fantasy and cinematic movement. Stanley Kauffmann said while the film's thrills did work on him, the frequency eventually irritated him. He criticized the film's reliance on nostalgia and updating older films instead of innovating new ideas. Pauline Kael was critical of the film, saying Lucas and Spielberg had thought like marketers in creating a film that would appeal to the broadest masses. Kael said though \"Raiders\" was a sophisticated update of older serials, avoiding cliches with clever editing, it was too focused on surpassing each previous action spectacle to the detriment of characterization or plot progression. She opined the failure of \"1941\" had made Spielberg too cautious, and scenes evidenced he was rushing and not achieving the best possible take as in his previous work. Lucas later named a villain in his 1988 fantasy film \"Willow\" after Kael. Dave Kehr said the constant rush between setpieces felt monotonous. He also criticized the story for allowing the hero to choose to rescue the Ark over his romantic interest on multiple occasions, believing it made Indiana Jones difficult to support.\nEbert said the amusing and unusual characters elevated the film beyond just a technical accomplishment. He described Ford's performance as taciturn and stubborn character in the vein of Humphrey Bogart in \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", but with the ability to laugh at himself. Klain said Ford's performance was \"riveting\", marking a major career highlight. Canby described Ford and Allen as both \"endearingly resilient\". Ebert said Allen gives Marion a charming toughness. Knight appreciated Marion did not become idiotic when the male star was in danger. His review concluded the character was the definition of an activist. Sragow said Allen's physical performance made her every bit the equal of Ford, and her vitality provided a positive counter to Ford's deadpan performance. Kael was critical of many cast performances, feeling they were stilted and heavily scripted. She singled out Freeman for praise, however, for continuing his performance after a fly crawled into his mouth; Freeman jokingly called it the best review of his career. Klain praised the film's performances, including Lacey's Toht, which he called \"the most outrageously offensive Nazi stereotype seen on screen since World War II\".\nCanby, Knight and \"Variety\" singled out the opening of the Ark as one of the film's best special effects. Knight said the effects artists deserved a \"special accolade\" for their work. Canby described it as a visual display as \"dazzling\" as the denouement of Spielberg's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Ebert said the truck chase stunt was the best he had ever seen, ahead of those in films like \"Bullitt\" (1968) and \"The French Connection\" (1971). Aljean Harmetz, Klain, and Siskel asserted the film's PG rating\u2014meaning any child could see it unsupervised\u2014was too lenient for such a scary film filled with a variety of on-screen deaths. An intermediate rating between PG and R, PG-13, would not be introduced until 1984, in part a response to the violence of the Indiana Jones prequel, \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\". Some children were reported to have suffered nightmares afterward.\nAwards and accolades.\nAt the 1982 Academy Awards, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" received five awards: Best Art Direction (Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley, and Michael D. Ford); Best Film Editing (Michael Kahn); Best Sound (Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, and Roy Charman); Best Sound Editing (Ben Burtt and Richard L. Anderson); and Best Visual Effects (Richard Edlund, Kit West, Bruce Nicholson, and Joe Johnston). The film received a further four nominations: Best Picture; Best Director; Best Cinematography; and Best Original Score. It tied with the drama film \"Ragtime\" for the third-most nominations, behind \"On Golden Pond\" and \"Reds\".\nFor the 39th Golden Globe Awards, \"Raiders\" received one nomination for Best Director. At the 9th Saturn Awards, \"Raiders\" won seven awards, including Best Fantasy Film, Best Actor (Ford), Best Actress (Allen), Best Director, Best Music (Williams), Best Writing (Kasdan), and Best Special Effects (Edlund). Spielberg received a Directors Guild Award nomination.\nThe 35th British Academy Film Awards earned the film one award for Best Production Design (Reynolds), and a further six nominations: Best Film; Best Supporting Actor for Elliott; Best Original Music; Best Cinematography; Best Editing; and Best Sound for Charman, Burtt, and Bill Varney. The film also received a Grammy Award for Williams' score, a People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture, a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the 34th Writers Guild of America Awards.\nPost-release.\nHome media.\nIn the early 1980s, the videocassette recorder (VCR) home video market was rapidly gaining popularity. In previous years, VHS sales were not a revenue source for studios, but by 1983 they could generate up to 13% of a film's total revenue; the U.S. and Canadian cassette rights could generate $500,000 alone. In November 1983, Paramount released a record 500,000 home video copies of \"Raiders\", priced at $39.95. Paramount priced their home videos significantly lower than their competition, reasoning it would broaden the sales audience and promote home video watching. By September 1985, over one million copies of the film had sold, making it the bestselling VHS of its time. In 1991, McDonald's launched possibly \"the largest video sales promotion...to date\" during which videocassettes of the first three Indiana Jones movies were sold at their restaurants for $5.99 each. Almost 10 million cassettes of the Indiana Jones series had been sold by this point. This promotion was expected to sell at least five million more. By 2000, the film was marketed as \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\" for consistency with other titles in the franchise.\nIn 2003, the film was released on DVD as a bundle with the other two films in the franchise. Like the VHS, it was a success, selling over one million units and becoming the fastest-selling DVD box set. This set introduced additional materials including \"Making the Films\", a two-hour documentary about the making of the films including deleted scenes, and \"Behind the Scenes\", a series of archival featurettes. The film and its sequels were released as a collection on Blu-ray disc in 2012, as \"Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures\". Spielberg worked on the films' restoration for the higher-quality format. This release included the additional content of previous releases. For its 40th anniversary in 2021, the film was released in a remastered 4K resolution Ultra HD Blu-ray based on the original film negative, as part of a boxset including the series' other films. This version was released individually in 2023.\nOther media.\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" has been represented across a wide variety of merchandise, including comic books, video games, novels, Lego sets, action figures and vehicles, playsets, candles, and board games.\nIt has received several game adaptations. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was released in 1982 for the Atari 2600 console. A pinball game, ', was released in 1993, and a platform game, \"Indiana Jones's Greatest Adventures\", was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System the following year. \"Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine\" (1999) includes a bonus level that returns players to the Peruvian temple. The Lego-themed adventure game ' (2008) and its 2009 sequel \"\" represent the film and its sequels. A 1984 boardgame, \"The Adventures of Indiana Jones role playing game\", was poorly received, and when the manufacturer lost the license later that decade, all remaining copies had to be burned. All that remained from the destruction were encased in plastic and turned into the Diana Jones Award\u2014\"...diana Jones\" being the only legible part of the burnt remains.\nA novelization of the film, written by Campbell Black, was released in 1981. The book was a worldwide sales success and included details not present in the film. Among them is Marion was aged 14 when she and Jones began their relationship, the staff of Ra headpiece has explicit instructions not to look at the opened Ark, and Brody finds Jones at home after having just entertained one of his students. Black, who was paid $35,000 plus royalties, sued Lucasfilm in 2005 for not paying him his percentage of the book sales profits. Marvel Comics produced a comic book adaptation of the film shortly after its release.\nThe \"Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!\" is a live amusement show at Walt Disney World Resort, Florida, that has been in operation since 1989. It features several live stunts based on set pieces from the film. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was also one of several films that made up the Great Movie Ride (1989\u20132017).\nThemes and analysis.\nRejection of Nazism.\n\"Raiders\" can be interpreted as a Jewish fantasy about punishing the Nazis for the Holocaust. Spielberg is Jewish, and the Ark is a Jewish artifact described as holding the Ten Commandments passed down to the Jewish people by God. In biblical descriptions, the Ark is a gold-plated wooden box that must be carried with poles because it is too holy to be touched. Although the Nazi regime persecuted the Jewish people, in the film, they needed to use a Jewish artifact to subjugate the world; however, the artifact was too pure and holy for them to touch and actively rejected them by destroying their symbol emblazoned on the Ark's transportation crate while leaving the crate itself unharmed. Eventually, it also destroys the Nazi forces that open it. The Nazis are stopped by the literal intervention of Godly power that leaves the perceived protagonists unharmed.\nIn another scene, Jones falls underneath a moving truck when its hood-ornament, a Mercedes logo, snaps, mocking Mercedes' involvement in aiding the Nazis. Elizabeth Hirschman identified elements of the metaphysical, believing the standard heroic quest was offset by the religious importance of the Ark, an item of Judeo-Christian belief. The image of God is one that is inherently on the side of the good, and the destruction of the Nazi villains draws parallels to Yahweh visiting plagues on Egypt for enslaving the Israelites.\nCinematic homage.\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is a pastiche of cinematic history, inspired by and referring to many films. Spielberg stated explicitly the film is about movies and designed as a tribute to filmmaking. Alongside directly referred inspirations like early 20th-century serials, the film contains references to \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), the film noir \"Kiss Me Deadly\" (1955), the samurai film \"Yojimbo\" (1961), and the epic \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), among others. \"Citizen Kane\" is referred to directly in \"Raiders\"'s last scene where the Ark is secured in a vast warehouse, a fate similar to that of the beloved childhood sled belonging to \"Citizen Kane\"'s principal character. \"Raiders\" also refers to several of Lucas's own films: the translation of the German U-boat announcement is \"1138\", a reference to science fiction film \"THX 1138\" (1971); and numerous nods to \"Star Wars\" including the characters of R2-D2 and C-3PO appearing as hieroglyphs inside the Well of Souls. Richard Crinkley recounted audience members of \"King David\" (1985) associated its use of the Ark explicitly with \"Raiders\" instead of its biblical origins. He deemed this an example of \"cinemate visual literacy\", an increasing number of people educated by visual media rather than text.\nSociology.\nOne of the film's themes\u2014shared with \"Superman II\" (released the same year in the United States)\u2014has been interpreted as American security being put at risk. These films are emblematic of their time and the contemporary fears of American citizens. The Nazi characters are based on a former threat to America, and like \"Superman II\", \"Raiders\" requires the intervention of a superhuman character to prevent destruction at the hands of enemy forces\u2014a character audiences can admire, but never possibly emulate. Janet Maslin argues that the fantasy of these films and the larger-than-life characters are designed to satisfy audiences who do not want to reflect on the world around them. Jones is striving to recover the Ark both to stop the Nazis but also for personal glory, but the film never dwells on the regular people around the world who would be affected by an invincible Nazi army.\n\"Raiders\" offers a counter to the American national embarrassments of the controversial Vietnam War (1955\u20131975), the Watergate scandal (1972), a\u00a0recession, and the growing influence of foreign nations. The period setting of the film also presents audiences with a time tinged in romantic nostalgia and filled with the possibility for adventure. Robin Wood wrote that \"Raiders\", \"Superman\", and \"Star Wars\" provide a familiar, comforting content using the nostalgic memories of the older serial films of which they are derivative, presenting an idealized vision of older traditional values. Wood opined the purpose of this was to subdue contemporary radical social movements eager for change. Jennifer Barker suggested that \"Raiders\" offers audiences what they want, and does not challenge their values or beliefs as anything but correct.\nThe macho male action hero archetype of the era, conveyed by Jones, can also be seen as reinforcing traditional masculinity in the face of growing feminism. Describing the typical interpretation of this archetype, Latham Hunter said films such as \"Raiders\", \"Lethal Weapon\" (1987), and \"Die Hard\" (1988) evolve the everyman character into someone who can overcome impossible odds and promote American might. Jones is an American hero who steps in reluctantly to save the world by overcoming almost exclusively foreign enemies. Barker argues that Jones is an individualist placed in opposition to a fascist or totalitarian regime, making \"Raiders\" a \"conservative serial fantasy\" film. Hunter believed this focus on masculinity was short sighted, and these films succeeded because they offered escapism from reality, and presented an outclassed hero who reflected the audiences' own feelings of powerlessness.\nArchaeology.\nJones has been criticized as a poor portrayal of an archaeologist and that his actions amount to theft. Archaeologist Winifred Creamer described Jones as the \"worst thing to happen to archaeology\" as he \"walks a fine line between what's an archaeologist and what's a professional looter\". Kevin McGeough wrote that the archetypal film archaeologist in older films was never the hero, but often a subject to be saved or conquered by the actual hero. Jones is imbued with the self-reliance and physical competence of the traditional hero, but with an intelligence that is recognized and celebrated, setting him apart from older heroes. Even so, Jones is hunting the Ark, in part, for personal glory attached to its recovery. When given the opportunity to destroy it to prevent its misuse, Belloq calls his bluff and Jones backs down. Belloq suggests he is a skewed reflection of Jones, and only a small change would turn Jones into Belloq.\nIn her argument that the film is about colonialism, Tatiana Prorokova identified Jones and the Nazis as all-Caucasian males invading foreign lands, belonging to people of color, to steal a local treasure for their own personal benefit. In dismissing the supernatural aspects of the Ark, Jones also dismisses its cultural significance, rendering it a prize to be collected for his sake. As the hero, Jones represents the United States' unfettered right to protect the Ark from others. Jones' famous quote of \"It belongs in a museum!\" could be seen as troubling from a decolonization perspective as he attempts to steal the golden idol of the Hovitos and steals the Ark from the proper authorities. Although according to Lucas the character of Indiana is named after his childhood dog, Prorokova insists that the hero is named for the U.S. state of Indiana, a state named after wars against Native Americans by colonizers. \"Raiders\" is set at a time when much of the world lived under colonial rule, and the film presents the non-white characters either as subjugated by the Nazis and reliant on a white American for aid or as collaborating with the Nazis.\nLegacy.\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" has had a lasting effect on popular culture. It is considered a touchstone of modern cinema, creating a film framework still emulated by other films. Spielberg has said he considers it the most perfect film of the series because he never wanted to modify it or change anything about it.\nFord's performance led to his casting in the 1982 science fiction cult classic film \"Blade Runner\". Kasdan became one of the most in-demand writers in Hollywood, and helped write Lucas's \"Star Wars\" sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980). Despite opening new opportunities for Allen, she expressed disappointment with the film because her character was motivated more by her relationship with Jones and financial gain than with her father and his obsession with the Ark. She unsuccessfully lobbied for rewrites to address this and explore her character further. Even so, Allen affirmed that many women and girls had appreciated and been inspired by her character. Forty years after the film's release, Allen affirmed she still received positive feedback from young women. Shortly after the film's release, Stanley Rader and Robert Kuhn filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers for $210million alleging the film was based on \"Ark\", a screenplay and unpublished novel by Kuhn. The outcome of this lawsuit is unknown.\nThe film led to an increase in students studying archaeology, and many modern archaeologists have cited the film as an inspiration. Rhys-Davies said he had met over 150 lecturers, professors, and archaeologists who told him their interest in the field began with the film. The original Indiana Jones costume hat and jacket were stored indiscriminately after filming, at Lucas's Skywalker Ranch, until 2012. Nadoolman Landis recovered the items to be exhibited as part of a Hollywood costume display at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\nCultural influence.\nIn 1999, the United States Library of Congress selected the film to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Assessing the film's legacy in 1997, Bernard Weinraub, opined \"the decline in the traditional family G-rated film, for 'general' audiences, probably began...\" with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". He continued, \"whether by accident or design... the filmmakers made a comic nonstop action film intended mostly for adults but also for children\". Lucas's frequent collaborator Gary Kurtz said that \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" marked the turning point where Lucas became convinced that audiences cared more about \"the roller-coaster ride\" than the story.\nAuthors, actors, and filmmakers have spoken of their appreciation for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" or cited it as an inspiration in their own careers, including Chris Carter, Hugh Jackman, Glen Powell, Simon Kinberg, Jon Turteltaub, Michael Bay, Dan Brown, M. Night Shyamalan and Joe Johnston. The experience had an explicit influence on Johnston's directorial effort \"\" (2011), including character designs. Director Steven Soderbergh released a black-and-white edit of the film in 2014, removing all the original sounds, intending for viewers to focus on Spielberg's staging and editing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was among the action films director James Gunn recommended people watch, and one of the 35 films recommended by \"The Independent\".\nThe film has inspired or been referred to in other media including film, television shows, and video games. Between 1982 and 1989, in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, children Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb made an amateur remake of the film, \"\". Spielberg congratulated the trio on their accomplishment.\nCritical reassessment.\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is considered one of the greatest films ever made. As part of his \"The Great Movies\" series, Ebert said while the special effects had not aged well, they were perfect for this type of film. He concluded it was a \"whiz-bang slamarama\" made with \"heedless joy\". The British Film Institute called it one of the ten greatest action films of all time, saying \"for all its barnstorming staging and boy's-own-adventure larks, it's refreshing Indy's greatest foil comes in three dimensions... the hard-drinking, wise-cracking, upstagingly brilliant Karen Allen\". A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment-industry members by \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ranked it the thirteenth best film ever made. It is also listed in the film reference book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\".\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average rating of . The consensus reads, \"Featuring bravura set pieces, sly humor, and white-knuckle action, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is one of the most consummately entertaining adventure pictures of all time.\" The film has a score of 86 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". In 2005, the Writers Guild of America's (WGA) listed the film's screenplay as the forty-second greatest screenplay of the preceding 75 years on their 101 Greatest Screenplays list. \"Empire\" listed the film at number two on its 2008 list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, behind the 1972 crime film \"The Godfather\". They said, \"no adventure movie is quite so efficiently entertaining\". In 1997, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked \"Raiders\" number60 on its 100 Years...100 Movies list recognizing the best American films. They reassessed to number66 in the 2007 anniversary edition. On the AFI's list of the 100 Best Thrills, the film was ranked number10, and the 2003 list of the 100 Best Heroes &amp; Villains ranked the Indiana Jones character as the number two hero, behind Atticus Finch from \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1962).\nSeveral publications have ranked it as one of the greatest films of all time, including number two by \"Empire\", number five by \"Time Out\", and number19 by MSN. It has also appeared on lists of the best action films, including number two by \"IGN\", number nine by \"Time Out\" (down from number two in an earlier ranking) and number11 by \"The Guardian\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\". \"IGN\" also named it the best action film of the 1980s. Rotten Tomatoes and \"Esquire\" have labeled it one of the greatest adventure films. Film critic Bilge Ebiri, writing for \"Rolling Stone\", considered it the best film in Spielberg's filmography as of 2018, stating that \"Its effects and technique are dazzling; it's a perfect blend of jaw-dropping spectacle and the sort of actor-driven movie-movie moments that are redolent of Golden-Age-of-Hollywood classics; and it's as perfect a piece of pure, uncut entertainment as anyone has produced in the last few decades.\"\nChannel 4 viewers in the United Kingdom ranked \"Raiders\" as the 20th best family film of all time in 2005. In the 2010s, \"Empire\" magazine readers named it the seventh-best film of all time, and it was ranked the sixteenth best film of all time, based on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes user votes and critical ratings. Readers of the \"Los Angeles Times\" voted it the number one summer film, ahead of competition including \"Jaws\" and \"Alien\" (1979).\nA 2013 episode of the sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\" (\"The Raiders Minimization\") argues that Jones accomplishes nothing in \"Raiders\", as the Nazis would have eventually found the Ark, opened it, and died regardless of Jones's actions. An essay by \"Esquire\"'s Matt Pomroy agreed, with the caveat that Marion would have almost certainly died at Toht's hands, and the Ark would have been flown to Germany on the Flying Wing and opened for Hitler, likely killing him. However, Jones's involvement ensures the Americans secure the Ark, preventing the Germans from using it.\nSequels and spin-offs.\nThe success of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" has spawned four other films. \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" was in development by 1982, while the original was still in theaters. A narrative prequel to \"Raiders\", \"Temple of Doom\" follows Jones's quest to recover sacred stones and liberate the slaves of a Thuggee cult leader. The film became one of the highest-grossing films of 1984 and broke box office records, but fared less well with critics who accused it of racism, sexism, and containing content inappropriate for child audiences.\nA narrative sequel to \"Raiders\", \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", was released in 1989. It serves as the final film of the original trilogy and follows Jones and his father, portrayed by Sean Connery, on a quest to recover the Holy Grail. Like its predecessor, \"The Last Crusade\" broke box office records, becoming one of the year's highest-grossing films. It was also well received by critics. Spielberg has said the film was, in part, an \"apology\" for the reception to \"Temple of Doom\". Following the conclusion of the film series, Lucas developed a television series, \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" (1992\u20131993), featuring Ford and other actors as Jones at different ages.\nA fourth film was released in 2008, titled \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\". It features the return of Allen as Marion Ravenwood and introduces Shia LaBeouf as her and Jones's son. The setting moved from the 1930s to the 1950s, pitting Jones against Russians to recover a crystal skull. The film was a financial success but polarized critics and fans. As with \"Temple of Doom\", Lucas and Spielberg have defended the film and apologized for its reception. A fifth film, \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\", was released in June 2023.\nNovels, comic books, and video games have also been released detailing the further adventures of Indiana Jones and his supporting cast from the films. Often set before and after the events of the films, these globe-spanning tales depict Jones's first marriage, and his adventures to discover the Spear of Destiny, Merlin, an Infernal Machine in the Tower of Babel, the Covenant of Buddha, the staff of Moses, the Philosopher's Stone, dinosaurs, a Unicorn horn, the Oracle of Delphi, the secrets of the Sphinx, Noah's Ark, and the fate of Atlantis. Jones is sometimes aided by Sallah in his conflicts against Belloq and Lao Che (from \"Temple of Doom\"), among others.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 44,308. The county seat is Delhi. The county is named after the Delaware River, which was named in honor of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, appointed governor of Virginia in 1609. The county is part of the Southern Tier region of the state.\nHistory.\nWhen counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present area of Delaware County was divided between Albany and Ulster Counties.\nAlbany County was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, British colonial governor of New York.\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of Tryon.\nDuring the late 1780s, New York State governor De Witt Clinton issued land grants to military officers, doctors and other veterans of the American Revolutionary War, which brought many patriot veterans to settle in the area.\nIn 1789, Montgomery County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Ontario County. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.\nIn 1791, Otsego was one of three counties that were split off from Montgomery (the other two being Herkimer and Tioga Counties).\nUlster County was an original county of New York State, considerably larger than the present Ulster County, and at the time that Delaware County was created it still contained most of its original area.\nDelaware County was formed in 1797 by combining portions of Otsego and Ulster counties.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.7%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in New York by land area.\nDelaware County is located in the southern part of the state, separated from the state of Pennsylvania by the Delaware River. It is east of Binghamton and southwest of Albany. The county contains part of the Catskill Mountains. The county is within a region called the Southern Tier of New York State.\nThe highest point is an approximately summit of Bearpen Mountain along the Greene County line. The lowest point is along the Delaware River. The county is drained by the headwaters of the Delaware. It has a hilly surface, and the soil in the valleys is exceedingly fertile. The Delaware and Susquehanna rivers are here navigable by boats.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 48,055 people, 19,270 households, and 12,737 families residing in the county.

It is near the border with Lazio. The city is the capital of the province of Terni, located in the plain of the River Nera. It is northeast of Rome and 81\u00a0km south of the regional capital, Perugia.\nThe Latin name means \"between-two-rivers\", in reference to its location on the confluence of the Nera river (Ancient Umbrian \"Nahar\", ) and the Serra stream. When disambiguation was needed, it was referred to as \"Interamna Nahars\". Its inhabitants were known in Latin as \"Interamn\u0101t\u0113s Na(ha)rt\u0113s\".\nInteramna was founded as an Ancient Roman town, albeit settlements in the Terni area well precede this occurrence. During the 19th century, steel mills were introduced and led the city to have a role in the Second Industrial Revolution in Italy. Because of its industrial importance, the city was heavily bombed during World War II by the Allies. It remains an industrial hub and has been nicknamed \"The Steel City\".\nTerni is also known as the \"City of Lovers\", as its patron saint, Saint Valentine, was born and became a bishop here, and the remains are preserved in the basilica-sanctuary in his honour.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded around the 7th century BC by the Umbrians \"Nahartes\", in a territory inhabited (as testified by archaeological excavations) as early as the Bronze Age. The Iguvine Tablets describe these \"Nahartes\" as a strong, numerous people and as the most important enemy of the Umbrian people of Gubbio (Iguvium). In the 3rd century BC, Terni was conquered by the Romans and soon became an important \"municipium\" lying on the Via Flaminia and known under the name \"Interamna\", meaning \"between-two-rivers\".\nIn 271 BC the Roman consul Manius Curius Dentatus ordered the construction of a canal (the Curiano Trench) to divert the water from the marshes in the Rieti Valley and from Lake Velino over the natural cliff at Marmore, creating the waterfall. This caused flooding in the valley around Terni below. For a long time this became the cause of interminable quarrels between the cities of Rieti and Terni. The issue was so contentious between the two cities that the Roman Senate was forced to address it in 54 BC. Aulus Pompeius represented Terni, and Cicero represented Rieti. The Senate did nothing about the problem, and the problem remained the same for centuries.\nAfter the Lombard conquest in 755, Terni lost prominence when it was reduced to a secondary town in the Duchy of Spoleto. In 1174, it was sacked by Frederick Barbarossa's general, Archbishop Christian of Mainz. In the following century, Terni was one of the sites visited frequently by St. Francis to give sermons.\nIn the 14th century Terni issued its own constitution, and from 1353 the walls were enlarged, and new channels were opened. As with many of the Italian communes of the Late Middle Ages, it was beset by civil unrest between the partisans of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and later between the \"Nobili\" and \"Banderari\" (Terni's bourgeoisie). It later joined the Papal States. In 1580, an ironwork, the Ferriera, was introduced to work the iron ore mined in Monteleone di Spoleto, starting the traditional industrial connotation of the city. In the 17th century, however, the population of Terni declined further due to plagues and famines.\nIn the 19th century, Terni took advantage of the Industrial Revolution and of plentiful water sources in the area. New industries included a steelworks, a foundry, as well as weapons, jute and wool factories. In 1927, Terni became capital of the province.\nThe presence of important industries made the city a favorite target for the Allied bombardments in World War II. On August 11, 1943, a raid by 44 USAAF bombers, which dropped 213 tons of bombs, devastated the city, killing 564 people. It was the first of the 57 airstrikes that destroyed or damaged 40% of Terni's buildings and killed 1,018 civilians. Despite this, industrial environment increased quickly after the war.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nThe city has three important industrial hubs: the first one is the Stainless Steel Area, called AST (part of the group ThyssenKrupp) and is a wide area located in the east part of Terni. West of the town, there is a second industrial hub, known as \"Area Polymer\", with four different chemical multinational industries. The third industrial hub is Italeaf, which controls TerniEnergia, a company listed on STAR segment of Borsa Italiana, that is active in the renewable energy sector, and promotes and develops technological start-ups in the cleantech sector.\nTransport.\nTerni is connected with the A1 motorway, the European route E45 and National Road Flaminia by the \"RATO\", a motorway junction.\nTerni railway station is part of the Ancona\u2013Orte railway, and is also a junction station for two secondary lines, the Terni\u2013Sulmona railway (which links Terni with L'Aquila) and the Terni\u2013Sansepolcro railway (\"FCU\") (which serves Perugia). One of the most important national freight stations is located nearby.\nThe local urban and suburban transport service, ATC, runs 90 bus lines. In the north of the city (Colleluna zone), there are works in progress on the line from Perugia to enable it to be used as a Light rail line. \nTerni does not its own airport, the nearest airport to the city is Perugia San Francesco d'Assisi \u2013 Umbria International Airport which provides flights to other parts of Italy, the UK and Europe. The airport is located north of the city. However, residents in the city would normally use Rome Fiumicino Airport as it provides most domestic and international flights. The airport is located south west of Terni. \nSport.\nTernana Calcio is the main football club in the city. The club has twice played in Italy's first division Serie A (seasons 1972\u20131973 and 1974\u20131975). Ternana is currently playing in Serie C (season 2025\u20132026). The club plays at the 22,000-seat Stadio Libero Liberati, named after Italian motorcycle racer Libero Liberati, who was born in Terni, won the 500cc World Championship in 1957, and died while he was training with his Gilera Saturno along the Valnerina road near Terni.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nTerni is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 954,236. However, in 2023 the estimated population was 946,147. The county seat is Buffalo, which makes up about 28% of the county's population. Both the county and Lake Erie were named for the regional Iroquoian language-speaking Erie tribe of Native Americans, who lived in the area before 1654. They were later pushed out by the more powerful Iroquoian nations tribes. The county is part of the Western New York region of the state.\nErie County, along with its northern neighbor Niagara County, makes up the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area, the second largest in the State of New York behind New York City. The county's southern part is known as the Southtowns.\nHistory.\nWhen counties were established by the English colonial authorities in the Province of New York in 1683, present-day Erie County was inhabited by the Iroquois. Significant colonization by White Americans did not begin until after the United States had gained independence with the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783. The U.S. forced the Iroquois to cede most of their lands, as many had been allies of the British during the conflict.\nAbout 1800, the Holland Land Company, formed by American businessmen and their Dutch associates, extinguished aboriginal claims by purchasing the land from New York, acquired the title to the territory of what are today the eight westernmost counties of New York, surveyed their holdings, established towns and began selling lots to individuals. The state was eager to attract settlers and have homesteads and businesses developed. At this time, all of western New York was included in Ontario County.\nAs the population increased, the state legislature created Genesee County in 1802 out of part of Ontario County. In 1808, Niagara County was created out of Genesee County. In 1821, Erie County was created out of Niagara County, encompassing all the land between Tonawanda Creek and Cattaraugus Creek. The first towns formed in present-day Erie County were the Town of Clarence and the Town of Willink. Clarence and Willink comprised the northern and southern portions of Erie county, respectively. Clarence is still a distinct town, but Willink was quickly subdivided into other towns. When Erie County was established in 1821, it consisted of the towns of Amherst, Aurora, Boston, Clarence, Collins, Concord, Eden, Evans, Hamburg, Holland, Sardinia and Wales.\nThe county has a number of houses and other properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Erie County, New York.\nIn 1861, the hamlet of Town Line in the Town of Lancaster voted 85\u201340 to secede from the Union. Town Line never sought admission into the Confederate States of America and there is no evidence that men from the community ever fought for the Confederacy. Some reporting from that time indicates the vote was a joke. On January 24, 1946, as part of a nationally reported event, Town Line voted to officially return to the Union after 85 years of Union secession.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (85%) is land and (15%) is water.\nErie County is in the western portion of upstate New York, bordering on the lake of the same name. Part of the industrial area that has included Buffalo, it is the most populous county in upstate New York outside of the New York City metropolitan area. The county also lies on the international border between the United States and Canada, bordering the Province of Ontario.\nThe northern border of the county is Tonawanda Creek. Part of the southern border is Cattaraugus Creek. Other major streams include Buffalo Creek (Buffalo River), Cayuga Creek, Cazenovia Creek, Scajaquada Creek, Eighteen Mile Creek and Ellicott Creek. The county's northern half, including Buffalo and its suburbs, is known as the Northtowns and is relatively flat and rises gently up from the lake. The southern half, known as the Southtowns, is much hillier. It has the northwesternmost foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The highest elevation in the county is a hill in the Town of Sardinia that tops out at around above sea level. The lowest ground is about , on Grand Island at the Niagara River.

About 9.2% of families and 12.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.3% of those under 18 and 7.8% of those older than 65.\nCounty government and politics.\nPrior to 1936, Erie County predominantly backed Republican Party candidates, with only four Democratic Party candidates winning the county in a presidential election - James Buchanan in 1856, George B. McClellan in 1864, Grover Cleveland in 1892 and Woodrow Wilson in 1912. However, starting with the 1936 election, it has turned predominantly Democratic since then, with only two Republicans carrying the county in a presidential election-- Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 and Richard Nixon in 1972, with Nixon being the most recent. In 2016, like many other counties in the Rust Belt, Donald Trump expanded the Republican vote share thanks to his appeal to working-class whites and Ethnic-Catholic voters, keeping the margin in single digits for the first time since 1984. Four years later, in 2020, Joe Biden won 267,270 votes in Erie County, more than Barack Obama in 2008. Biden's margin of victory, however, was smaller than Obama's 2008 victory within the county and Trump's margin, though declining, was still higher than any Republican since 1988 (aside from his 2016 margin).\nCounty legislature.\nAs of 2025, there are seven Democrats, three Republicans, and one Conservative in the county legislature.\nEducation.\nSchool districts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSchool districts include:\n\"Special act\" school districts\nAs of the 2010 U.S. census, some parts of this county were not in a defined school district, with some undefined land and some undefined water.\nHigher education.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAttractions and recreation.\nErie County is home to three professional teams\u2014the NFL's Buffalo Bills, the NHL's Buffalo Sabres and the NLL's Buffalo Bandits, along with Division I's Buffalo Bulls and MILB's Buffalo Bisons. The city of Buffalo also features the Buffalo Zoo, The Buffalo History Museum, Burchfield-Penney Art Center and Albright-Knox Art Gallery (all located within a mile of each other in the Delaware Park System), Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens and Buffalo Museum of Science, the Frank Lloyd Wright's Martin House Complex in addition to tourist districts such as Canalside and Larkinville. The Erie County Fair, held every August in the Town of Hamburg from 1820 to 2024 (the 2020 event, like much everything else across the country, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), is one of the largest county fairs in the United States.\nErie County Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry.\nThe Erie County Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry was established in 1925 with four parks spanning . As of 2003, the county managed 38 properties, totaling approximately of land. Management objectives include providing and maintaining recreational space and the conservation of the county's natural and historic resources. A 2003 Master Plan identified several broad categories of parks operated by the county, including heritage parks, waterfront parks, conservation parks, special purpose parks and forest management areas.\nHeritage parks.\nErie County's heritage parks include the five original county parks that were established during the 1920s and 1930s. These parks are examples of multiple-use sites with significant scenic, natural and historic features. Each park has unique man-made structures of historical character, many constructed as part of the Works Progress Administration movement in the 1930s.\nWaterfront parks.\nWaterfront parks include the significant scenic sites and recreational trail systems along the county's Lake Erie shoreline.\nConservation parks.\nThese largely-undeveloped parks are managed primarily for conservation of the natural environment and passive nature-based outdoor recreation activities. These lands are intended to generally remain in a natural state.\nSpecial purpose parks.\nSpecial purpose parks have unique characteristics that provide specific recreational functions within the county's park system.\nForest management areas.\nForest management areas are managed by the Erie County Bureau of Forestry, which was established in 1927. These areas include several thousand acres of mostly-coniferous plantation style forest, much of which was planted on abandoned farmland by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. These areas are located mostly in the rural southern portion of the county. These lands have limited recreation potential, mostly in the form of trails. Management of these lands is focused on natural resource conservation, in addition to potential commercial resource extraction of timber products or maple syrup.\nCommunities.\n\u2020 - County seat\n\u2021 - Not wholly in this county\nCities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTowns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVillages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHamlets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54172", "revid": "42342156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54172", "title": "LaserWriter", "text": "1985 laser printer\nThe LaserWriter is a laser printer with built-in PostScript interpreter sold by Apple, Inc. from 1985 to 1988. It was one of the first laser printers available to the mass market. In combination with WYSIWYG publishing software like PageMaker that operated on top of the graphical user interface of Macintosh computers, the LaserWriter was a key component at the beginning of the desktop publishing revolution.\nHistory.\nDevelopment of laser printing.\nLaser printing traces its history to efforts by Gary Starkweather at Xerox in 1969, which resulted in a commercial system called the Xerox 9700. IBM followed this with the IBM 3800 system in 1976. Both machines were large, room-filling devices handling the combined output of many users. During the mid-1970s, Canon started working on similar machines, and partnered with Hewlett-Packard to produce 1980's HP 2680, which filled only part of a room. Other copier companies also started development of similar systems.\nHP introduced their first desktop model, the 2687A with a Ricoh engine for $12,800 in 1983. Sales of the non-networked product were unsurprisingly poor. In 1983, Canon introduced the LBP-CX, a desktop laser printer engine using a laser diode and featuring an output resolution of 300 dpi. In 1984, HP released the first commercially available system based on the LBP-CX, the HP LaserJet.\nApple's development.\nBy 1982 Apple Computer was rumored to be developing laser printers. Steve Jobs of Apple had seen the LBP-CX while negotiating for supplies of 3.5\" floppy disk drives for the upcoming Apple Macintosh computer. Meanwhile, John Warnock had left Xerox to found Adobe Systems to commercialize PostScript and AppleTalk in a laser printer they intended to market. Jobs was aware of Warnock's efforts, and upon his return to California he began convincing Warnock to allow Apple to license PostScript for a new printer that Apple would sell. Negotiations between Apple and Adobe over the use of PostScript began in 1983 and an agreement was reached in December 1983, one month before Macintosh was announced. Jobs eventually arranged for Apple to buy $2.5 million in Adobe stock.\nAt about the same time, Jonathan Seybold (John W. Seybold's son) introduced Paul Brainerd to Apple, where he learned of Apple's laser printer efforts and saw the potential for a new program using the Mac's GUI to produce PostScript output for the new printer. Arranging his own funding through a venture capital firm, Brainerd formed Aldus and began development of what would become PageMaker. The venture capital coined the term \"desktop publishing\" during this time.\nRelease.\nThe LaserWriter was announced at Apple's annual shareholder meeting on January 23, 1985, the same day Aldus announced PageMaker. Shipments began in March 1985 at the retail price of US$6,995, significantly more than the HP model. However, the LaserWriter featured AppleTalk support that allowed the printer to be shared among as many as sixteen Macs, meaning that its per-user price could fall to under $450, far less expensive than HP's less-advanced model.\nThe combination of the LaserWriter, PostScript, PageMaker and the Mac's GUI and built-in AppleTalk networking would ultimately transform the landscape of computer desktop publishing. At the time, Apple planned to release a suite of AppleTalk products as part of the Macintosh Office, with the LaserWriter being only the first component.\nWhile competing printers and their associated control languages offered some of the capabilities of PostScript, they were limited in their ability to reproduce free-form layouts (as a desktop publishing application might produce), use outline fonts, or offer the level of detail and control over the page layout. HP's own LaserJet was driven by a simple page description language, known as Printer Command Language, or PCL. The version for the LaserJet, PCL3, was extended from the previous laser printers. It lacked the power and flexibility of PostScript until several upgrades provided some level of parity. It was some time before similar products became available on other platforms, by which time the Mac had ridden the desktop publishing market to success.\nThe LaserWriter contained four built-in PostScript font families: Times, Helvetica, Courier, and Symbol. These fonts became very popular as a result, being used a lot in desktop publishing.\nDescription.\nHardware.\nThe LaserWriter used the same Canon CX printing engine as the HP LaserJet, and as a consequence early LaserWriters and LaserJets shared the same toner cartridges and paper trays. PostScript is a complete programming language that has to be run in a suitable interpreter and then sent to a software rasterizer program, all inside the printer. To support this, the LaserWriter featured a Motorola 68000 CPU running at 12\u00a0MHz, 512\u00a0KB of workspace RAM, and a 1\u00a0MB frame buffer.\nAt introduction, the LaserWriter had the most processing power in Apple's product line\u2014more than the 8\u00a0MHz Macintosh. As a result, the LaserWriter was also one of Apple's most expensive offerings. For implementation purposes, the LaserWriter employed a small number of medium-scale-integration Monolithic Memories PALs, and no custom LSI, whereas the LaserJet employed a large number of small-scale-integration Texas Instruments 74-Series gates, and one custom LSI. The LaserWriter was, thereby, in the same form factor (for its RIP), able to provide much greater function, and, indeed, much greater performance, all within the very same LBP-CX form factor, although the external packaging was, for marketing purposes, somewhat different.\nNetworking.\nSince the cost of a LaserWriter was several times that of a dot-matrix impact printer, some means to share the printer with several Macs was desired. LANs were complex and expensive, so Apple developed its own networking scheme, LocalTalk. Based on the AppleTalk protocol stack, LocalTalk connected the LaserWriter to the Mac over an RS-422 serial port. At 230.4 kbit/s LocalTalk was slower than the Centronics PC parallel interface, but allowed several computers to share a single LaserWriter. PostScript enabled the LaserWriter to print complex pages containing high-resolution bitmap graphics, outline fonts, and vector illustrations. The LaserWriter could print more complex layouts than the HP LaserJet and other non-Postscript printers. Paired with the program Aldus PageMaker, the LaserWriter gave the layout editor an exact replica of the printed page. The LaserWriter offered a generally faithful proofing tool for preparing documents for quantity publication, and could print smaller quantities directly. The Mac platform quickly gained the favor of the emerging desktop-publishing industry, a market in which the Mac is still important.\nDesign.\nThe LaserWriter was the first major printer designed by Apple to use the new Snow White design language created by Frog Design. It also continued a departure from the beige color that characterized the Apple and Macintosh products to that time by using the same brighter, creamy off-white color first introduced with the Apple IIc and Apple Scribe Printer 8 months earlier. In that regard it and its successors stood out among all of Apple's Macintosh product offerings until 1987, when Apple adopted a unifying warm gray color they called Platinum across its entire product line, which was to last for over a decade.\nThe LaserWriter was also the first peripheral to use the LocalTalk connector and Apple's unified round AppleTalk Connector Family, which allowed any variety of mechanical networking systems to be plugged into the ports on the computers or printers. A common solution was the 3rd party PhoneNET which used conventional telephone cables for networking.\nLegacy.\nApple's RIP was of its own design, and was implemented using few ICs, including PALs for most combinatorial logic; with the subsystem timing DRAM refreshing, and rasterization functions being implemented in very few medium-scale-integration PALs. Apple's competitors (i.e., QMS, NEC, and others) generally used a variation of one of Adobe's RIPs with their large quantity of small-scale-integration (i.e., Texas Instruments' 7400 series) ICs.\nIn the same time-frame as Apple's LaserWriter, Adobe was licensing the very same version of PostScript to Apple's potential competitors (Apple's PostScript licensing terms were non-exclusive); however, all non-Apple licensees of PostScript generally employed one of Adobe's PostScript \"reference models\" (Atlas, Redstone, etc.) and even Linotype's first image setter which featured PostScript employed such a \"reference model\" (but with customization for the Linotronic's different video interface, plus the necessary implementation of \"banding\" and a hard drive frame buffer and font storage mechanism). Indeed, the PostScript language itself was concurrently enhanced and extended to support these high-resolution \"banding\" devices (as contrasted to the lower resolution \"framing\" devices, such as the LaserWriter, in which the entire \"frame\" could be contained within the available RAM).\nIn most cases, such RAM was fixed in size and was soldered to the logic board. In late PostScript Level 1, and in early PostScript Level 2, the RAM size was made variable and was generally extensible, through plug-in SIMMs, beyond the 2.0 to 2.5 MB minimum (0.5 to 1.0 MB for instructions, depending upon PostScript version, and 1.5 MB minimum for the \"frame buffer\", for the lowest resolution devices, 300 dpi), as more than 300 dpi of course required more RAM, and some LaserWriters were able to change between 300 dpi and 600 dpi, depending upon how much RAM was installed. 600 dpi, for example, required 6 MB of RAM, but 8 MB of RAM was more commonly found.\nAt this point, Apple's LaserWriters were employing generic non-parity RAM, whereas HP's LaserJets, especially the ones which offered a plug-in PostScript interpreter card, required special parity-type PS/2 RAM modules with a \"presence detect\" function according to IBM specs.\nOther LaserWriter models.\nBuilding on the success of the original LaserWriter, Apple developed many further models. Later LaserWriters offered faster printing, higher resolutions, Ethernet connectivity, and eventually color output in the Color LaserWriter. To compete, many other laser printer manufacturers licensed Adobe PostScript for inclusion into their own models. Eventually the standardization on Ethernet for connectivity and the ubiquity of PostScript undermined the unique position of Apple's printers: Macintosh computers functioned equally well with any Postscript printer. After the LaserWriter 8500, Apple discontinued the LaserWriter product line in 1997 when Steve Jobs returned to Apple.\nLaserWriter II.\nIn 1988, to address the need for both an affordable printer and a professional printer, the LaserWriter II was designed to allow for complete replacement of the computer circuit board that operates the printer. Across all the different models, the print engine was the same.\nThree years later in 1991, two updated versions of the LaserWriter II were produced.\nTo deliver higher performance, Apple eventually switched from the 68000 series to the Am29000 series of processors to drive later models, starting with the Personal LaserWriter NTR in 1992.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54173", "revid": "50493757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54173", "title": "Pulp Fiction", "text": "1994 crime film by Quentin Tarantino\nPulp Fiction is a 1994 American independent crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino from a story he conceived with Roger Avary. It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles. The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\nTarantino wrote \"Pulp Fiction\" in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for \"True Romance\" (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax Films fully financed.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress respectively. As a result of the film's success, Travolta's career was reinvigorated. The film's development, marketing, distribution, and profitability\u00a0had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" is widely regarded as Tarantino's \"magnum opus\", with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman, and Jackson earning high acclaim. In 2008, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, \"Pulp Fiction\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nNarrative structure.\n\"Pulp Fiction\"'s narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's partner in crime.\nThe film begins with a diner robbery staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one story line to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary story lines are preceded by intertitles:\nIf the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is \"an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative\". Other analysts describe the structure as a \"circular narrative\".\nSummary.\n\"Prologue \u2013 The Diner\".\nA pair of thieves, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, reminisce on their past robbery attempts as they eat breakfast in a diner. Pumpkin proposes they rob the diner at that moment because he believes the patrons and employees will be unprepared to stop them. Honey Bunny agrees, and they begin the robbery.\n\"Prelude to 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\".\nTwo hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, influential local gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett, and his friends. On the way, Vincent mentions that he had been tasked by Marsellus to take his wife, Mia Wallace, to dinner and asks Jules questions about Mia. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's friends. Jules rebukes Brett over his attempt to double-cross Marsellus and recites what is portrayed as a passage from the Book of Ezekiel, before he and Vincent kill Brett.\n\"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\".\nJules and Vincent give the briefcase to Marsellus, who bribes boxer Butch Coolidge to intentionally lose in his upcoming match. Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Mia, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town for the night. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, and snorts it, resulting in an overdose. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where Lance helps revive her by getting adrenaline for Vincent to inject into her heart. Vincent takes Mia home, and they agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident.\n\"The Gold Watch\".\nButch double-crosses Marsellus by winning the bout, but accidentally kills his opponent in the process. He plans to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack an heirloom: a gold watch which belonged to Butch's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom to find Butch pointing the gun at him. Butch shoots Vincent dead and departs.\nWhile Butch is stopped at a traffic light, he sees Marsellus crossing the road. Butch rams his car into him and knocks him over, but is himself injured when his vehicle collides with another. Marsellus recovers, shoots at Butch and chases him into a pawnshop. Maynard, the shop owner, captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice, Zed, task their gimp sex slave with watching Butch while they take Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him. Butch breaks free and is about to escape, but decides to save Marsellus and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard's shotgun. Marsellus tells Butch that he will call his crew to help him torture Zed to death. He further tells Butch that they are \"cool\" (even) and instructs him to tell no one about the incident and depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's chopper and they ride away.\n\"The Bonnie Situation\".\nIn the apartment, after Jules and Vincent kill Brett, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them. Every shot misses and they shoot him dead. Jules says that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes, believing the man was just a lousy shot. While driving away with another one of Brett's friends, Marvin (who was actually a plant from Marsellus's organization), Vincent accidentally shoots him in the head when Jules drives over a bump in the road, covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood. They hide the car at the home of Jules's old friend and former business partner Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife Bonnie comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to hide the body in the trunk, clean the car, dispose of their bloody clothes and take the car to a junkyard.\n\"Epilogue \u2013 The Diner\".\nAt the diner from the film's prologue, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their survival at the apartment was divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus's briefcase. Pumpkin initially holds Jules at gunpoint, but Jules soon overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint. Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.\nJules' partner-in-crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Tarantino cast Travolta in \"Pulp Fiction\" because Michael Madsen, who had played Vic Vega in \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992), chose to appear in Kevin Costner's \"Wyatt Earp\" instead. Madsen expressed regret over his decision. Harvey Weinstein pushed for Daniel Day-Lewis in the part. Travolta accepted a reduced rate; sources say either US$100,000 or US$140,000. The film's success and his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor revitalized his career. Vincent is the brother of Vic Vega, also known as Mr. Blonde in \"Reservoir Dogs\", and in 2004, Tarantino discussed an idea for a movie starring Travolta and Madsen as the \"Vega Brothers\"; though the concept never came to fruition.\nVincent's partner-in-crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Jackson's first audition was overshadowed by Paul Calder\u00f3n; Jackson had assumed the audition was merely a reading. Weinstein convinced him to audition a second time and his performance of the final diner scene won over Tarantino. Jules was originally scripted with a giant afro, but Tarantino's personal assistant mistakenly bought a Jheri curled wig. Tarantino was enraged but Jackson persuaded him to keep it since the hairstyle had gained popularity through the rap group N.W.A. Film critic Owen Gleiberman took it as a \"tacit comic statement about the ghettoization of [Black people] in movies\". Jackson received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Calder\u00f3n appears in the film as Paul, a bartender at Marsellus's social club, as well as Marsellus's assistant. Tarantino wrote the role for Laurence Fishburne, who turned it down. According to Tarantino, Fishburne refused it because his team did not see it as a starring role; Fishburne later said he turned it down because he felt the film glamorized heroin. Eddie Murphy was also considered.\nWallace's wife and an aspiring actress. Miramax favored Holly Hunter or Meg Ryan for the role of Mia. Robin Wright, Jennifer Beals, Debra Winger, Marisa Tomei, Alfre Woodard and Meg Tilly were also considered but Tarantino wanted Thurman after their first meeting. She dominated the film's promotional material, appearing on a bed with cigarette in hand. She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite being launched into the celebrity A-list, Thurman chose not to do any big-budget films until \"Batman &amp; Robin\" (1997) three years later.\nA \"cleaner\" who aids Jules and Vincent. Tarantino wrote the part of Wolfe for Keitel, who had starred in \"Reservoir Dogs\" and was instrumental in its production. In Tarantino's words, \"Harvey had been my favorite actor since I was 16 years old.\" Keitel had played a similarly employed character in \"Point of No Return\" (1993).\nA burglar and Yolanda's boyfriend. Roth had starred in \"Reservoir Dogs\" alongside Keitel. He had used an American accent in \"Reservoir Dogs\" but used his natural, London accent in \"Pulp Fiction\". Though Tarantino had written the part with Roth in mind, TriStar head Mike Medavoy preferred Johnny Depp or Christian Slater. Early in development, Tarantino had contemplated casting Roth as Vincent and Gary Oldman as Jules, rewriting the characters as \"two English guys\".\nRingo's girlfriend and partner in crime. Tarantino wrote the role of Yolanda for Plummer to partner her with Roth. Roth had introduced Tarantino to her, saying: \"I want to work with Amanda in one of your films but she has to have a really big gun.\"\nButch's girlfriend. Tarantino met de Medeiros, a Portuguese actress, while traveling with \"Reservoir Dogs\" around the European film festival circuit.\nA crime boss and employer of Jules and Vincent. Before Rhames was cast, the part of Wallace was initially offered to Max Julien and Sid Haig, but both turned down the role. According to Bender, Rhames gave \"one of the best auditions I've ever seen\". His acclaimed performance led to him being cast in big-budget features such as \"\" (1996), \"Con Air\" (1997) and \"Out of Sight\" (1998).\nVincent's drug dealer. Tarantino initially wrote the role with John Cusack in mind. Gary Oldman was the preferred choice among TriStar executives, based on his portrayal of drug-dealing pimp Drexl Spivey in \"True Romance\" (1993).\nLance's wife. Pam Grier read for the role, but Tarantino did not believe audiences would find it plausible for Lance to yell at her. Tarantino later cast Grier as the lead role for \"Jackie Brown\". Ellen DeGeneres also read for the part of Jody. Rosanna's sister Alexis (then known as Robert Arquette) also appears in the film, as a man emerging from a bathroom to shoot at and miss Vincent and Jules, who then kill him.\nA USAF veteran of the Vietnam War who delivers a young Butch his father's prized gold watch. During Koons' monologue, which is interspersed with colorful descriptions of the Viet Cong, he mentions a soldier called \"Winocki\". Joe Winocki (John Garfield) is a character in the 1943 film \"Air Force\" directed by Howard Hawks, one of Tarantino's favorite directors. Tarantino played a character named Desmond Winocki in a guest appearance on an episode of \"All-American Girl\" titled \"Pulp Sitcom\".\nAn aging boxer on the run from Marsellus after having double-crossed him. The role was originally written for Matt Dillon, who turned it down. Willis was already a star but most of his recent films had been critical and box-office disappointments. As related by Peter Bart, participating in the modestly budgeted film \"meant lowering his salary and risking his star status but the strategy\u00a0... paid off royally: \"Pulp Fiction\" not only brought Willis new respect as an actor but also earned him several million dollars\". Willis' appearance and physical presence were crucial to Tarantino, \"Bruce has the look of a 50s actor. I can't think of any other star that has that look\". Butch's look was modeled on Aldo Ray in \"Nightfall\" and his demeanor based on Ralph Meeker's portrayal of Mike Hammer in Robert Aldrich's \"Kiss Me Deadly\". Chandler Lindauer plays a young Butch.\nProduction.\nWriting.\nThe roots of \"Pulp Fiction\" can be traced back to the late 1980s, when Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary worked together at Video Archives, a video store in Southern California. Avary recalls that their initial concept was to create three short films with three different filmmakers\u2014himself, Tarantino, and a friend, Adam Rifkin. Avary wrote the first element of what would become the film's screenplay in the fall of 1990, titled \"Pandemonium Reigns,\" which eventually expanded into a feature-length screenplay. While Tarantino's short film similarly evolved into a full script, Rifkin never completed his contribution, leaving \"Pulp Fiction\" initially uncertain. The initial inspiration was the three-part horror anthology film \"Black Sabbath\" (1963), by Italian filmmaker Mario Bava. The Tarantino\u2013Avary project was provisionally titled \"Black Mask\", after the seminal hardboiled crime fiction magazine. Tarantino's script was produced as \"Reservoir Dogs\", his directorial debut; Avary created the basis for the \"Gold Watch\" storyline of \"Pulp Fiction\".\nWith work on \"Reservoir Dogs\" completed, Tarantino returned to the notion of a trilogy film: \"I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story.\" Tarantino explains that the idea \"was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories\u00a0\u2013 the oldest stories in the book\u00a0... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'\u00a0\u2013 the oldest story about\u00a0... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times.\" \"I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry\", he says. \"Part of the trick is to take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules and see how they unravel.\" In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: \"I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich's \"Kiss Me Deadly\" [1955]. I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk\".\nTarantino went to work on the script for \"Pulp Fiction\" in Amsterdam in March 1992, possibly at the Winston Hotel in the Red Light District. He was joined there by Avary, who contributed \"Pandemonium Reigns\" to the project and participated in its rewriting as well as the development of the new storylines that would link up with it. Two scenes originally written by Avary for the \"True Romance\" screenplay, exclusively credited to Tarantino, were incorporated into the opening of \"The Bonnie Situation\": the \"miraculous\" missed shots by the hidden gunman and the rear seat automobile killing. The notion of the crimeworld \"cleaner\" that became the heart of the episode was inspired by a short, \"Curdled\", that Tarantino saw at a film festival. He cast the lead actress, Angela Jones, in \"Pulp Fiction\" and later backed the filmmakers' production of a feature-length version of the short, likewise titled \"Curdled\". The script included a couple of made-up commercial brands that often featured in later Tarantino films: Big Kahuna burgers (a Big Kahuna soda cup appears in \"Reservoir Dogs\") and Red Apple cigarettes. As he worked on the script, Tarantino also accompanied \"Reservoir Dogs\" around the European film festivals. Released in the United States in October 1992, the picture was a critical and commercial success. In January 1993, the \"Pulp Fiction\" script was complete.\nThe adrenaline scene was inspired by the Martin Scorsese documentary \"\" about \"Taxi Driver\" actor Steven Prince, who played arms dealer Easy Andy in the film. Prince recalls injecting adrenaline into the heart of a woman who overdosed, with the help of a medical dictionary and a Magic Marker.\nFinancing.\nTarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, brought the script to Jersey Films. Before even seeing \"Reservoir Dogs\", Jersey had attempted to sign Tarantino for his next project. Ultimately a development deal worth around $1\u00a0million had been struck: The deal gave A Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino's newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got a share of the project and the right to shop the script to a studio. Jersey had a distribution and \"first look\" deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option. In February, \"Pulp Fiction\" appeared on a \"Variety\" list of films in pre-production at TriStar. In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround. According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it \"too demented\". There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image. Avary\u2014who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, \"Killing Zoe\"\u2014has said that TriStar's objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script's fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio's position: \"'This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent, and unfilmable.' ...\u00a0So I thought, 'That's that!'\"\nBender brought the script to Miramax Films, the formerly independent studio that had recently been acquired by Disney. Harvey Weinstein\u2014co-chairman of Miramax Films, along with his brother Bob\u2014was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up. Michael Shamberg, the executive producer, reflected on the bidding process, saying, \"Only Harvey [Weinstein] placed a bid. Harvey believed he was engaged in a bidding war, but he wasn't. Even now, whenever I see Bob Shaye, he expresses regret for turning down \"Pulp Fiction\". Quentin initially wanted to collaborate with Mike Medavoy, given Medavoy's history with the great Orion films. Ironically, when the opportunity arose, Mike deemed the script too violent.\" \"Pulp Fiction\", the first Miramax Films project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5\u00a0million, and at the end $500,000 was returned, bringing the final budget to $8 million. According to Bender, a lower budget meant that the producers could maintain more control over the movie itself.\nIt became the first movie that Miramax Films completely financed. Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of their industry status. \"The New York Times\" reported, \"Most of the actors received relatively small salaries along with a percentage of the profits.\" The biggest star to sign on to the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw. On the strength of his name, Miramax Films garnered $11\u00a0million for the film's worldwide rights, virtually ensuring its profitability.\nCasting.\nDanny DeVito, one of the film's executive producers, recalls that Weinstein suggested casting Daniel Day-Lewis, who had just won an Academy Award for \"My Left Foot\". DeVito responded by stating that Tarantino wanted John Travolta and reminded Weinstein that he had final cut and cast approval. He later reflected: \"I think he [Weinstein] called me every name in the book, but of course, Quentin got what he wanted, and he was absolutely right, and the rest is history.\" \nBender noted that during the casting process, while Samuel L. Jackson's initial audition was impressive, another candidate later delivered a performance that \"blew them away.\" This prompted Bender to inform Jackson's agent that they might need to consider the other actor. The agent firmly insisted, \"No, no, no, you can't do that. Sam will come back.\" Initially hesitant to ask him for another audition, Bender discovered that Jackson believed he was simply reading for the role, not auditioning, and his subsequent return resulted in an outstanding performance.\nTim Roth, initially interested in the role meant for Willis, suggested Amanda Plummer as a co-star, insisting she should have a gun as he thought it would be \"terrifying\" - a notion Tarantino later incorporated into the script.\nHarvey Keitel played a crucial role in getting \"Reservoir Dogs\" made and introduced Bruce Willis to Tarantino. Bender and Tarantino went to see him at his house in Malibu, where they learned that he could recite practically the entire movie of \"Reservoir Dogs,\" a movie he loved. After a conversation, Tarantino and Willis took a walk on the beach, where Willis revealed he'd read the \"Pulp Fiction\" script and expressed interest in playing Vincent or Jules. Tarantino encouraged him to read the script one last time with the Butch character in mind. Willis called Tarantino the next day and said, \"the shortest sentence in the Bible is, 'Jesus wept.' The shortest sentence in Hollywood is, 'I'm in.'\"\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography commenced on September 20, 1993. The lead offscreen talent had all worked with Tarantino on \"Reservoir Dogs\"\u00a0\u2013 cinematographer Andrzej Seku\u0142a, film editor Sally Menke, production designer David Wasco, and costume designer Betsy Heimann. According to Tarantino: \"[W]e had $8\u00a0million. I wanted it to look like a $20\u201325\u00a0million movie. I wanted it to look like an epic. It's an epic in everything\u00a0\u2013 in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag.\" The film, he says, was shot \"on 50 ASA film stock, which is the slowest stock they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almost no-grain image, it's lustrous. It's the closest thing we have to 50s Technicolor.\" The largest chunk of the budget\u00a0\u2013 $150,000\u00a0\u2013 went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim's set. It was built in a Culver City warehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film's production offices. The diner sequence was shot on location in Hawthorne at the Hawthorne Grill, known for its Googie architecture. For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor. Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had in \"Reservoir Dogs\". One of his pop totems, Fruit Brute, a long-discontinued General Mills cereal, also returned from the earlier film. The shoot wrapped on November 30. Before \"Pulp Fiction\"'s premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a \"story by\" credit, so the line \"Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino\" could be used in advertising and onscreen.\nMusic.\nNo film score was composed for \"Pulp Fiction\"; Quentin Tarantino instead used an eclectic assortment of surf music, rock and roll, soul, and pop songs. Dick Dale's rendition of \"Misirlou\" plays during the opening credits. Tarantino chose surf music as the basic musical style for the film, but not, he insists, because of its association with surfing culture: \"To me it just sounds like rock and roll, even Morricone music. It sounds like rock and roll spaghetti Western music.\" Tarantino planned to use a power pop song, \"My Sharona\" by The Knack, during the film's rape scene, but ultimately discounted it.\nSome of the songs were suggested to Tarantino by his friends Chuck Kelley and Laura Lovelace, who were credited as music consultants. Lovelace also appeared in the film as Laura, a waitress; she reprises the role in \"Jackie Brown\". The soundtrack album was released along with the film in 1994. The album peaked on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart at number 21. The single, Urge Overkill's cover of the Neil Diamond song \"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon\", reached number 59.\nEstella Tincknell describes how the particular combination of well-known and obscure recordings helps establish the film as a \"self-consciously 'cool' text. [The] use of the mono-tracked, beat-heavy style of early 1960s U.S. 'underground' pop mixed with 'classic' ballads such as Dusty Springfield's 'Son of a Preacher Man' is crucial to the film's postmodern knowingness.\" She contrasts the soundtrack with that of \"Forrest Gump\", the highest-grossing film of 1994, which also relies on period pop recordings: \"[T]he version of 'the sixties' offered by \"Pulp Fiction\"\u00a0... is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter-culture featured in \"Forrest Gump\", but is, rather, a more genuinely marginal form of sub-culture based around a lifestyle\u00a0\u2013 surfing, 'hanging'\u00a0\u2013 that is resolutely apolitical.\" The soundtrack is central, she says, to the film's engagement with the \"younger, cinematically knowledgeable spectator\" it solicits.\nRelease and reception.\nRelease and box office.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" premiered in May 1994 at the Cannes Film Festival. The Weinsteins \"hit the beach like commandos,\" bringing the picture's entire cast over to France. The film was unveiled at a midnight hour screening and caused a sensation. It won the Palme d'Or, the festival's top prize, generating a further wave of publicity.\nThe first U.S. review of the film was published on May 23 in industry trade magazine \"Variety\". Todd McCarthy called \"Pulp Fiction\" a \"spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture\u00a0... a startling, massive success.\" From Cannes forward, Tarantino was on the road continuously, promoting the film. Over the next few months, it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich, Taormina, Locarno, Norway, and San Sebasti\u00e1n. Tarantino later said: \"One thing that's cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when I watch the film with an audience, it does break [the audience's] alpha state. It's like, all of a sudden, 'I gotta watch this\u00a0... I gotta pay attention.' You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It's actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie.\" In late September, it opened the New York Film Festival. \"The New York Times\" published its review the day of the opening. Janet Maslin called the film a \"triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color\u00a0... [He] has come up with a work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers.\"\nOn October 14, 1994, \"Pulp Fiction\" went into general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind described: \"It was not platformed, that is, it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the traditional way of releasing an indie film; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters.\" In the eyes of some cultural critics, \"Reservoir Dogs\" had given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: \"You won't know the facts till you've seen the fiction\", went one slogan. \"Pulp Fiction\" was the top-grossing film at the US box office its first weekend with a gross of $9,311,882, edging out a Sylvester Stallone vehicle, \"The Specialist\", which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters. The gross claimed by Miramax Films was disputed by others. Warner Bros. initially reported an estimated gross of $8.9\u00a0million for \"The Specialist\", with Bob Weinstein then reporting a gross for \"Pulp Fiction\" of $9.1\u00a0million, claiming that the film was on another 100 screens that had previously been overlooked. Warner Bros. then updated their gross to $9.3\u00a0million, claiming they had made a calculation error.\nEarly Monday morning, Miramax Films reported a gross of $9.3\u00a0million with Warner Bros. reporting $8.9\u00a0million for \"The Specialist\", placing \"Pulp Fiction\" first but other industry sources did not believe Miramax Films' numbers. \"Variety\" estimated that \"Pulp Fiction\" grossed $8.6 to $9\u00a0million for the weekend.\nAgainst its budget of $8.5\u00a0million and about $10\u00a0million in marketing costs, \"Pulp Fiction\" grossed $107.93\u00a0million at the U.S. box office, making it the first Miramax film to surpass $100\u00a0million in the United States and Canada. Worldwide, it took in nearly $213\u00a0million. In terms of domestic grosses, it was the tenth biggest film of 1994, even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top 20. Popular engagement with the film, such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase, \"indicates the kind of cult status that \"Pulp Fiction\" achieved almost immediately.\" As \"MovieMaker\" puts it, \"The movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon.\" Abroad, as well: in Britain, where it opened a week after its U.S. release, not only was the film a big hit, but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in UK publishing history, a top-ten bestseller.\nCritical response.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Injecting its compendium of crime tales with the patois of everyday conversation, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a cinematic shot of adrenaline that cements writer-director Quentin Tarantino as an audacious purveyor of killer kino.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 95 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nThe response of major American film reviewers was widely favorable. Roger Ebert called it \"a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations... The screenplay by Tarantino and Roger Avary so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it\u00a0\u2013 the noses of those zombie writers who take 'screenwriting' classes that teach them the formulas for 'hit films'\". Richard Corliss of \"Time\" wrote: \"It towers over the year's other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. It dares Hollywood films to be this smart about going this far. If good directors accept Tarantino's implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in.\" In \"Newsweek\", David Ansen wrote: \"The miracle of Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" is how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new.\" \"You get intoxicated by it,\" wrote \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Owen Gleiberman, \"high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. I'm not sure I've ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that Tarantino does.\" \"There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive\", wrote Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\". \"\"Pulp Fiction\" is indisputably great.\"\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" was one of the few major news outlets to publish a negative review on the film's opening weekend. Kenneth Turan wrote: \"The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities.\" Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to \"Pulp Fiction\" itself. While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of \"The New Republic\" felt that \"the way that [it] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. \"Pulp Fiction\" nourishes, abets, cultural slumming.\" Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" wrote: \"The fact that \"Pulp Fiction\" is garnering more extravagant raves than \"Breathless\" ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful\u00a0\u2013 namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand.\" Observing in the \"National Review\" that \"[n]o film arrives with more advance hype\", John Simon was unswayed: \"titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness\".\nDebate about the film spread beyond the review pages, with its violence often being the theme. In \"The Washington Post\", Donna Britt described how she was happy not to see \"Pulp Fiction\" on a recent weekend and thus avoid \"discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody's brains around a car interior\". Some commentators took exception to the film's frequent use of the word \"nigger\" (mentioned 18 times). In the \"Chicago Tribune\", Todd Boyd argued that the word's recurrence \"has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool\". In Britain, James Wood, writing in \"The Guardian\", set the tone for much subsequent criticism: \"Tarantino represents the final triumph of postmodernism, which is to empty the artwork of all content, thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies\u00a0... Only in this age could a writer as talented as Tarantino produce artworks so vacuous, so entirely stripped of any politics, metaphysics, or moral interest.\"\nAwards season.\nAround the turn of the year, \"Pulp Fiction\" was named Best Picture by the National Society of Film Critics, National Board of Review, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Boston Society of Film Critics, Society of Texas Film Critics, Southeastern Film Critics Association, and Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Tarantino was named Best Director by all seven of those organizations as well as by the New York Film Critics Circle and Chicago Film Critics Association. The screenplay won several prizes, with various awarding bodies ascribing credit differently. At the 52nd Golden Globe Awards, Tarantino, named as sole recipient of the Best Screenplay honor, failed to mention Avary in his acceptance speech. In February 1995, the film received seven Oscar nominations\u00a0\u2013 Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Jackson), Supporting Actress (Thurman), Original Screenplay, and Film Editing. Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were each nominated as well for the 1st Screen Actors Guild Awards, presented on February 25, but none took home the honor. At the Academy Awards ceremony the following month, Tarantino and Avary were announced as joint winners of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The furor around the film was still going strong: much of the March issue of \"Artforum\" was devoted to its critical dissection. \"Pulp Fiction\" garnered four honors at the Independent Spirit Awards, held at the end of the month\u00a0\u2013 Best Feature, Best Director, Male Lead (Jackson), and Best Screenplay (Tarantino). At the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA), Tarantino and Avary shared the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Jackson won for Best Supporting Actor. The film was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" listed \"Pulp Fiction\" alongside \"Citizen Kane\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Dr. Strangelove\", \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", \"The Conversation\", \"Nashville\", \"Taxi Driver\", \"The Elephant Man\", \"In the Bedroom\", \"There Will Be Blood\", and \"Roma\" as \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars\".\nLegacy and influence.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" quickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era. In 1995, in a special edition of \"Siskel &amp; Ebert\" devoted to Tarantino, Gene Siskel argued that the work posed a major challenge to the \"ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas\". In Siskel's view,\nthe violent intensity of \"Pulp Fiction\" calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" [1960], Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" [1967], and Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\" [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for \"Pulp Fiction\". Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.\nKen Dancyger writes that its \"imitative and innovative style\"\u00a0\u2013 like that of its predecessor, \"Reservoir Dogs\"\u00a0\u2013 represents\na new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold\u00a0\u2013 the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the gangster films or Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.\nIn a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995, Bob Dole, Senate Majority Leader and Republican presidential candidate for the then-upcoming 1996 presidential election (as well as the party's vice presidential nominee in the 1976 presidential election), attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling \"nightmares of depravity\". \"Pulp Fiction\" was soon associated with his charges concerning gratuitous violence. Dole had not mentioned the film, instead citing two less-celebrated movies based on Tarantino screenplays, Oliver Stone's \"Natural Born Killers\" and Tony Scott's \"True Romance\". In September 1996, Dole did accuse \"Pulp Fiction\"\u00a0\u2013 which he had not seen at the time\u00a0\u2013 of promoting \"the romance of heroin\".\nPaula Rabinowitz expresses the general film industry opinion that \"Pulp Fiction\" \"simultaneously resurrected John Travolta and film noir\". In Peter Biskind's description, it created a \"guys-with-guns frenzy\". The film has also been labeled as a black comedy and a \"neo-noir\". Critic Geoffrey O'Brien, however, argued against the classification of \"Pulp Fiction\" into the neo-noir genre: \"The old-time noir passions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. [It is] neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir.\" Similarly, Nicholas Christopher calls it \"more gangland camp than neo-noir\", and Foster Hirsch suggests that its \"trippy fantasy landscape\" characterizes it more definitively than any genre label. Regardless, the stylistic influence of \"Pulp Fiction\" soon became apparent. Less than a year after the picture's release, British critic Jon Ronson attended the National Film School's end-of-semester screenings and assessed the impact: \"Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of \"The Brady Bunch\" before offing their victim. Not since \"Citizen Kane\" has one man appeared from relative obscurity to redefine the art of moviemaking.\" Among the first Hollywood films cited as its imitators were \"Destiny Turns on the Radio\" (1995), in which Tarantino acted, \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead\" (1995), and \"2 Days in the Valley\" (1996). It \"triggered a myriad of clones\", writes Fiona Villella. Internationally, according to David Desser, it \"not only influenced a British brand of noir, but extended the noir vision virtually around the world\". \"Pulp Fiction\"'s effect on film form was still reverberating in 2007, when David Denby of \"The New Yorker\" credited it with initiating the ongoing cycle of disordered cinematic narratives.\nAccording to \"Variety\", the trajectory of \"Pulp Fiction\" from Cannes launch to commercial smash \"forever altered the game\" of so-called independent cinema. It \"cemented Miramax's place as the reigning indie superpower\", writes Biskind. \"\"Pulp\" became the \"Star Wars\" of independents, exploding expectations for what an indie film could do at the box office.\" The film's large financial return on its small budget\ntransform[ed] the industry's attitude toward the lowly indies\u00a0... spawning a flock of me-too classics divisions\u00a0... [S]mart studio executives suddenly woke up to the fact that grosses and market share, which got all the press, were not the same as profits\u00a0... Once the studios realized that they could exploit the economies of (small) scale, they more or less gave up buying or remaking the films themselves, and either bought the distributors, as Disney had Miramax, or started their own\u00a0... copy[ing] Miramax's marketing and distribution strategies.\nIn 2001, \"Variety\", noting the increasing number of actors switching back and forth between expensive studio films and low-budget independent or indie-style projects, suggested that the \"watershed moment for movie stars\" came with the decision by Willis\u00a0\u2013 one of Hollywood's highest-paid performers\u00a0\u2013 to appear in \"Pulp Fiction\". In 2024, on the film's 30th anniversary, the magazine wrote that the film \"revived the career of John Travolta, minted a star in Samuel L. Jackson and spawned a still-thriving cottage industry of knockoffs and imitation films.\"\nIt has been described as a \"major cultural event\", an \"international phenomenon\" that influenced television, music, literature, and advertising. Not long after its release, it was identified as a significant focus of attention within the growing community of Internet users. Adding \"Pulp Fiction\" to his roster of The Great Movies in 2001, Roger Ebert called it \"the most influential film of the decade\". Four years later, \"Time\"'s Corliss wrote much the same: \"(unquestionably) the most influential American movie of the 90s\".\nSeveral scenes and images from the film achieved iconic status; in 2008, \"Entertainment Weekly\" declared, \"You'd be hard-pressed, by now, to name a moment from Quentin Tarantino's film that isn't iconic.\" Jules and Vincent's \"Royale with Cheese\" dialogue became famous. It was referenced more than a decade and a half later in the Travolta vehicle \"From Paris with Love\". The adrenalin shot to Mia Wallace's heart is on \"Premiere\"'s list of \"100 Greatest Movie Moments\". The scene of Travolta and Thurman's characters dancing has been frequently homaged, most unambiguously in the 2005 film \"Be Cool\", starring the same two actors. The image of Travolta and Jackson's characters standing side by side in suit and tie, pointing their guns, has also become widely familiar. In 2007, BBC News reported that \"London transport workers have painted over an iconic mural by 'guerrilla artist' Banksy\u00a0... The image depicted a scene from Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\", with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns.\" Certain lines were adopted popularly as catchphrases, in particular Marsellus's threat, \"I'm 'a get medieval on your ass.\" Jules's \"Ezekiel\" recitation was voted the fourth greatest movie speech of all time in a 2004 poll. One of the more notable homages to Jules's \"Biblical\" quote was one Jackson himself played a part in, near the end of 2014's \"\", Jackson's character Col. Nick Fury, presumed dead, visits his own gravestone, on which, below Fury's name is inscribed \"The path of the righteous man\u00a0...\" Ezekiel 25:17. In 2019, it was reported that Dominic Cummings, special political adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, quoted Jules by telling Conservative MPs to \"be cool like Fonzies\" as political pressure built to request an extension to the date of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" now appears in several critical assessments of all-time great films. In 2008, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named it the best film of the past quarter-century. That same year, the American Film Institute's \"Ten Top Ten\" poll ranked it number 7 all-time in the gangster film genre. In 2007, it was voted 94th overall on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. In 2005, it was named one of \"Time's All-Time 100 Movies\". As of September 2018, it is number 54 on Metacritic's list of all-time highest scores. The film ranks very highly in popular surveys. A 2008 \"Empire\" poll combining the opinions of readers, movie industry professionals, and critics named \"Pulp Fiction\" the ninth-best film of all time. In a 2006 readers' poll by the British magazine \"Total Film\", it ranked as the number three film in history. It was voted as the fourth-greatest film of all time in a nationwide poll for Britain's Channel 4 in 2001. In 2015, \"Pulp Fiction\" ranked 28th on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.\nCritical analysis.\nTarantino has stated that he originally planned \"to do a \"Black Mask\" movie\", referring to the magazine largely responsible for popularizing hardboiled detective fiction. \"[I]t kind of went somewhere else\". Geoffrey O'Brien sees the result as connected \"rather powerfully to a parallel pulp tradition: the tales of terror and the uncanny practiced by such writers as Cornell Woolrich [and] Fredric Brown\u00a0... Both dealt heavily in the realm of improbable coincidences and cruel cosmic jokes, a realm that \"Pulp Fiction\" makes its own.\" In particular, O'Brien finds a strong affinity between the intricate plot mechanics and twists of Brown's novels and the recursive, interweaving structure of \"Pulp Fiction\". Philip French describes the film's narrative as a \"circular movement or M\u00f6bius strip of a kind Resnais and Robbe-Grillet would admire\". James Mottram regards crime novelist Elmore Leonard, whose influence Tarantino has acknowledged, as the film's primary literary antecedent. He suggests that Leonard's \"rich dialogue\" is reflected in Tarantino's \"popular-culture-strewn jive\"; he also points to the acute, extremely dark sense of humor Leonard applies to the realm of violence as a source of inspiration.\nFilm scholar/historian Robert Kolker sees the \"flourishes, the apparent witty banality of the dialogue, the goofy fracturing of temporality [as] a patina over a pastiche. The pastiche\u00a0... is essentially of two films that Tarantino can't seem to get out of his mind: \"Mean Streets\" [1973; directed by Martin Scorsese, who loved \"Pulp Fiction\" and the way the film was told] and \"The Killing\" [1956; directed by Stanley Kubrick].\" He contrasts \"Pulp Fiction\" with postmodern Hollywood predecessors \"Hudson Hawk\" (1991; starring Willis) and \"Last Action Hero\" (1993; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger) that \"took the joke too far\u00a0... simply mocked or suggested that they were smarter than the audience\" and flopped. Todd McCarthy writes that the film's \"striking widescreen compositions often contain objects in extreme close-up as well as vivid contrasts, sometimes bringing to mind the visual strategies of Sergio Leone\", an acknowledged hero of Tarantino's. To Martin Rubin, the \"expansive, brightly colored widescreen visuals\" evoke comedy directors such as Frank Tashlin and Blake Edwards.\nThe movie's host of pop culture allusions, ranging from the famous image of Marilyn Monroe's skirt flying up over a subway grating to Jules addressing a soon-to-be victim as \"Flock of Seagulls\" because of his haircut, have led many critics to discuss it within the framework of postmodernism. Describing the film in 2005 as Tarantino's \"postmodern masterpiece\u00a0... to date\", David Walker writes that it \"is marked by its playful reverence for the 1950s\u00a0... and its constantly teasing and often deferential references to other films\". He characterizes its convoluted narrative technique as \"postmodern tricksiness\". Calling the film a \"terminally hip postmodern collage\", Foster Hirsch finds \"Pulp Fiction\" far from a masterpiece: \"authoritative, influential, and meaningless\". Set \"in a world that could exist only in the movies\", it is \"a succulent guilty pleasure, beautifully made junk food for cin\u00e9astes\". O'Brien, dismissing attempts to associate the movie with film noir, argues that \"\"Pulp Fiction\" is more a guided tour of an infernal theme park decorated with cultural detritus, Buddy Holly and Mamie Van Doren, fragments of blaxploitation and Roger Corman and \"Shogun Assassin\", music out of a twenty-four-hour oldies station for which all the decades since the fifties exist simultaneously.\" Catherine Constable takes the moment in which a needle filled with adrenalin is plunged into the comatose Mia's heart as exemplary. She proposes that it \"can be seen as effecting her resurrection from the dead, simultaneously recalling and undermining the Gothic convention of the vampire's stake. On this model, the referencing of previous aesthetic forms and styles moves beyond\u00a0... empty pastiche, sustaining an 'inventive and affirmative' mode of postmodernism.\"\nMark T. Conard asks, \"[W]hat is the film \"about\"?\" and answers, \"American nihilism.\" Hirsch suggests, \"If the film is actually about anything other than its own cleverness, it seems dedicated to the dubious thesis that hit men are part of the human family.\" Richard Alleva argues that \"\"Pulp Fiction\" has about as much to do with actual criminality or violence as \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" with the realities of seventeenth-century France or \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" with Balkan politics.\" He reads the movie as a form of romance whose allure is centered in the characters' nonnaturalistic discourse, \"wise-guy literate, media-smart, obscenely epigrammatic\". In Alan Stone's view, the \"absurd dialogue\", like that between Vincent and Jules in the scene where the former accidentally kills Marvin, \"unexpectedly transforms the meaning of the violence clich\u00e9\u00a0... \"Pulp Fiction\" unmasks the macho myth by making it laughable and deheroicizes the power trip glorified by standard Hollywood violence.\" Stone reads the film as \"politically correct. There is no nudity and no violence directed against women\u00a0... [It] celebrates interracial friendship and cultural diversity; there are strong women and strong black men, and the director swims against the current of class stereotype.\"\nWhere Stone sees a celebration, Kolker finds a vacuum: \"The postmodern insouciance, violence, homophobia, and racism of \"Pulp Fiction\" were perfectly acceptable because the film didn't pretend seriousness and therefore didn't mock it.\" Calling it the \"acme of postmodern nineties filmmaking\", he explains, \"the postmodern is about surfaces; it is flattened spatiality in which event and character are in a steady state of reminding us that they are pop-cultural figures.\" According to Kolker:\nThat's why \"Pulp Fiction\" was so popular. Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off\u00a0\u2013 by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.\nHenry A. Giroux argues that Tarantino \"empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing\u00a0... [t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight.\"\nRegarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that \"Pulp Fiction\" should be seen in light of the short stories of Flannery O'Connor, which likewise feature \"religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor.\" Discussing \"the connection between violence and redemption,\" Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers \"of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace,\" Tarantino \"seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film\u00a0\u2013 all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior\u00a0\u2013 grace is still possible; there might still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits.\"\nHomage as essence.\nCinema.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" is full of homages to other movies. \"Tarantino's characters\", writes Gary Groth, \"inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac\u00a0\u2013 he literally can't help himself.\" Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film's highly intertextual style. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim's was intended as a reference to Travolta's star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochal \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in the Jean-Luc Godard film \"Bande \u00e0 part\" (1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker, he clarified that the dance scene was not written specifically to showcase John Travolta's dancing; the scene was written in the script before Travolta was cast. However, once Travolta joined the film, Tarantino embraced the opportunity to feature him dancing, citing Jean-Luc Godard's films as his favorite example of musical sequences, admiring how they appear unpredictably and bring a sense of warmth and spontaneity. Tarantino noted that the charm lies in the fact that these films are not musical, yet they pause the narrative to include a musical moment, which he found particularly endearing.\nJerome Charyn argues that, beyond \"all the better\", Travolta's presence is essential to the power of the scene, and of the film:\nTravolta's entire career becomes \"backstory\", the myth of a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep waiting for him to shed his paunch, put on a white polyester suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn't have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn't part of America's own mad cosmology\u00a0... Tony Manero [is] an angel sitting on Vince's shoulder\u00a0... [Vince and Mia's] actual dance may be closer to the choreography of Anna Karina's shuffle with her two bumbling gangster boyfriends in \"Bande \u00e0 part\", but even \"that\" reference is lost to us, and we're with Tony again\u00a0...\nEstella Tincknell notes that while the \"diner setting seems to be a simulacrum of a 'fifties' restaurant\u00a0... the twist contest is a musical sequence which evokes 'the sixties,' while Travolta's dance performance inevitably references 'the seventies' and his appearance in \"Saturday Night Fever.\" ...\u00a0The 'past' thus becomes a more general 'pastness' in which the stylistic signifiers of various decades are loaded in to a single moment.\" She also argues that in this passage the film \"briefly shifts from its habitually ironic discourse to one that references the conventions of the classic film musical and in doing so makes it possible for the film to inhabit an affective space that goes beyond stylistic allusion.\"\nThe pivotal moment in which Marsellus crosses the street in front of Butch's car and notices him evokes the scene in which Marion Crane's boss sees her under similar circumstances in \"Psycho\" (1960). Marsellus and Butch are soon held captive by Maynard and Zed, \"two sadistic honkies straight out of \"Deliverance\"\" (1972), directed by John Boorman. Zed shares a name with Sean Connery's character in Boorman's follow-up, the science-fiction film \"Zardoz\" (1974). When Butch decides to rescue Marsellus, in Glyn White's words, \"he finds a trove of items with film-hero resonances\". Critics have identified these weapons with a range of possible allusions:\nAt the conclusion of the scene, a portentous line of Marsellus's echoes one from the crime drama \"Charley Varrick\" (1973), directed by another of Tarantino's heroes, Don Siegel; the name of the character who speaks it there is Maynard.\nDavid Bell argues that far from going against the \"current of class stereotype\", this scene, like \"Deliverance\", \"mobilize[s] a certain construction of poor white country folk\u00a0\u2013 and particularly their sexualization\u00a0... 'rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape' in American movies.\" Stephen Paul Miller believes the \"Pulp Fiction\" scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: \"The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in \"Deliverance\"\u00a0... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play\u00a0\u2013 a fiction, a pulp fiction.\" Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: \"in the end Tarantino's use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history.\" In Groth's view, the crucial difference is that \"in \"Deliverance\" the rape created the film's central moral dilemma whereas in \"Pulp Fiction\" it was merely 'the single weirdest day of [Butch's] life.'\" (\"\"American Me\" did it too,\" Tarantino observed. \"There's like \"three\" butt-fucking scenes in \"American Me\". That's definitely the one to beat in that particular category!\")\nNeil Fulwood focuses on Butch's weapon selection, writing, \"Here, Tarantino's love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an enfant terrible of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder.\" White asserts that \"the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with\u00a0... honourable heroes.\" Conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that Butch is rejecting. The traditional Japanese sword, in contrasts, represents a culture with a well-defined moral code and thus connects Butch with a more meaningful approach to life.\nThe biker film \"Nam's Angels\" is also shown with Fabienne characterizing it as \"A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.\"\nTelevision.\nRobert Miklitsch argues that \"Tarantino's telephilia\" may be more central to the guiding sensibility of \"Pulp Fiction\" than the filmmaker's love for rock 'n' roll and even cinema:\nTalking about his generation, one that came of age in the '70s, Tarantino has commented that the \"number one thing we all shared wasn't music, that was a Sixties thing. Our culture was television.\" A random list of the TV programs referenced in \"Pulp Fiction\" confirms his observation: \"Speed Racer, Clutch Cargo, The Brady Bunch, The Partridge Family, The Avengers, The Three Stooges, The Flintstones, I Spy, Green Acres, Kung Fu, Happy Days\", and last but not least, Mia's fictional pilot, \"Fox Force Five\".\n\"The above list, with the possible exception of \"The Avengers\",\" writes Miklitsch, \"suggests that \"Pulp Fiction\" has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: \"But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it's like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue of TV Guide.\"\nSharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (\"Clutch Cargo\") marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978). Willis writes that \"when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined masculinity in search of rehabilitation\u00a0... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze.\" Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a \"prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their b\u00eate noire: TV.\" Kolker might not disagree, arguing that \"\"Pulp Fiction\" is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend.\"\nNotable motifs.\nThe mysterious 666 briefcase.\nThe combination of the mysterious suitcase lock is 666, the \"Number of the Beast\". Tarantino has said there is no explanation for its contents\u00a0\u2013 it is simply a MacGuffin, a pure plot device. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow when the case was opened. In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friend Robert Rodriguez, Tarantino purportedly \"reveals\" the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez's \"Grindhouse\" (2007), with an intertitle that reads \"Missing Reel\". The interview resumes with Rodriguez discussing how radically the \"knowledge\" of the briefcase's contents alters one's understanding of the movie.\nDespite Tarantino's statements, many solutions to what one scholar calls this \"unexplained postmodern puzzle\" have been proposed. A strong similarity has often been observed with Robert Aldrich's 1955 film noir \"Kiss Me Deadly\", which features a glowing briefcase housing an atomic explosive. In their review of Alex Cox's 1984 film \"Repo Man\" in \"The Daily Telegraph\", Nick Cowen and Hari Patience suggest that \"Pulp Fiction\" may also owe \"a debt of inspiration\" to the glowing car trunk in that film. In scholar Paul Gormley's view, this connection with \"Kiss Me Deadly\", and a similar one with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), makes it possible to read the eerie glow as symbolic of violence itself. The idea that the briefcase contains Marsellus's soul gained popular currency in the mid-1990s. Analyzing the notion, Roger Ebert dismissed it as \"nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net\".\nJules' Bible passage.\nJules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage, Ezekiel 25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times\u00a0\u2013 in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus's briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of \"The Bonnie Situation\", which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:\nThe path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.\nThe second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: \"And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.\"\nWhile the final two sentences of Jules's speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases. The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God's wrath is retribution for the hostility of the Philistines. In the King James Version from which Jules's speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:\nAnd I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I \"am\" the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.\nTarantino's primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese martial arts star Sonny Chiba. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movie \"Karate Kiba\" (\"The Bodyguard\"; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.\nThe version seen at the beginning of \"The Bodyguard\" (1976) is as follows:\nThe path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them!\nIn the 1980s television series \"Kage no Gundan\" (\"Shadow Warriors\"), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him. A killer delivers a similar biblical rant in \"Modesty Blaise\", the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.\nTwo critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules's transformation and the issue of postmodernity. Gormley argues that unlike the film's other major characters\u00a0\u2013 Marsellus aside\u00a0\u2013 Jules is:\nlinked to a \"thing\" beyond postmodern simulation\u00a0... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was \"just a cool thing to say\u00a0...\" In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.\nAdele Reinhartz writes that the \"depth of Jules's transformation\" is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: \"In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness\u00a0... In the second\u00a0... he appears to be a different sort of man altogether\u00a0... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation.\" Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him \"that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life\"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture. Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: \"[T]he spiritual awakening at the end of \"Pulp Fiction\", which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser.\"\nThe bathroom.\nMuch of \"Pulp Fiction\"'s action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element. At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to \"powder her nose\"\u00a0\u2013 literally; she snorts coke in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth\u00a0\u2013 vigorously, after having given Butch \"oral pleasure.\" As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom\u00a0\u2013 his actions will lead to Jules' transformative \"moment of clarity\". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel. When the diner holdup turns into a standoff, \"Honey Bunny\" whines, \"I gotta go pee!\"\nAs described by Peter and Will Brooker, \"In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.\" The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:\nIn the Brookers' analysis, \"Through Vince\u00a0... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.\" Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading \"Modesty Blaise\" in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as \"the archetypal consumers of pulp\":\nLocating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of \"pulp\" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations\u00a0\u2013 pulp, women, shit\u00a0\u2013 that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.\nWillis reads \"Pulp Fiction\" in almost precisely the opposite direction, finding \"its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold. This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture, especially the popular culture of one's childhood, as is Tarantino's wont as well as his stated aim.\" Despite that, argues Fraiman, \"\"Pulp Fiction\" demonstrates\u00a0... that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences.\"\nAccolades.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" won eight major awards from a total of twenty-six nominations, including a Best Original Screenplay win at the 67th Academy Awards. Also, in the balloting by the National Society of Film Critics, Samuel L. Jackson was the runner-up in both the Best Actor and the Best Supporting Actor categories.\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\nHome media and ownership.\nThe first home video release was a VHS on September 12, 1995. Following their June 1993 sale to The Walt Disney Company, all of Miramax's home video releases were handled by Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment. However, the releases were being branded as Miramax Home Entertainment releases rather than Disney/Buena Vista releases, as a result of the studio's adult focused content. In 1996, Miramax issued a Special Collector\u2019s Edition VHS, which included deleted scenes introduced by Tarantino. In Australia, the Special Collector's Edition VHS was released in late 1997, through Village Roadshow, who had an Australian distribution agreement with Miramax at the time. The film's first US LaserDisc release occurred on October 4, 1995, and was followed by a special Criterion Collection LaserDisc release on June 19, 1996. Between 1995 and 1997, the film received additional LaserDisc releases in France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. On August 20, 2002, Miramax Home Entertainment released a two-disc Collector\u2019s Edition DVD. This version included DTS sound, and extensive extras such as documentaries, interviews with cast and crew, and trailers.\nIn December 2010, The Walt Disney Company sold Miramax to a private equity holding company known as Filmyard Holdings. The company had multiple investors, including Tutor-Saliba Corporation and the private equity firm Colony Capital, who were making their first entertainment-related investment. Filmyard licensed the home media rights for most of Miramax's notable titles to Lionsgate Films, with lower profile titles being licensed to Echo Bridge Entertainment. Lionsgate Home Entertainment reissued \"Pulp Fiction\" on DVD on April 26, 2011, and on October 1, 2011, the film received a Blu-ray release through Lionsgate Home Entertainment. The UK version of the Lionsgate Blu-ray was released on November 26, 2012. In 2011, Filmyard Holdings licensed the Miramax library to streamer Netflix. This streaming deal included \"Pulp Fiction\", and ran for five years, eventually ending on June 1, 2016.\nFilmyard Holdings sold Miramax to Qatari state-owned company beIN Media Group in March 2016. In April 2020, ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Skydance) acquired the rights to Miramax's library, after buying a 49% stake in the studio from beIN. \"Pulp Fiction\" is among the 700 titles they acquired in the deal, and since April 2020, the film has been distributed by Paramount Pictures. The deal also included a first look agreement with beIN/Miramax, which allows Paramount to release any future projects based on Miramax properties.\nIn late 2020, Paramount Home Entertainment started reissuing many of the Miramax titles they had acquired, and on September 22, 2020, they reissued \"Pulp Fiction\" on DVD and Blu-ray. Most of Paramount's Miramax reissues during this period had the same artwork as previous releases, but add the Paramount mountain logo to the packaging. On December 6 2022, Paramount Home Entertainment released \"Pulp Fiction\" on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray. The release includes special features originally from the 2011 Lionsgate Blu-ray. In celebration of \"Pulp Fiction\"'s 30th anniversary, Paramount Home Entertainment released a 4K Ultra HD Collector's Edition on December 3, 2024, as an Amazon-exclusive set (also available via Zavvi in Australia). This edition retains the 2022 version's 2160p transfer with HDR-10 and Dolby Vision, also retaining the legacy special features. It includes a new slipcover featuring pop-up artwork of the Jack Rabbit Slim's dance scene between John Travolta and Uma Thurman. Additional collectibles include reproductions of lobby cards showcasing key film moments, a photography contact sheet, and collectible stickers/decals with film imagery, all presented in a protective folder with custom artwork.\n\"Pulp Fiction\" was not one of the inaugural titles included on Paramount's subscription streaming service Paramount+, which launched on March 4, 2021, although it was later added to the service. It has also been made available on Paramount's free streaming service Pluto TV.\nNFT dispute.\nIn November 2021, Miramax filed a lawsuit against Tarantino who released seven NFTs based on uncut and unseen scenes of \"Pulp Fiction\" and including the original handwritten script \"revealing secrets about the film and its creator.\" Miramax claimed they own the film rights. Tarantino disputed the lawsuit and claimed he had rights to the film script in written form. The matter was later settled with Miramax's lawyers filing a brief statement in court: \"The parties have agreed to put this matter behind them and look forward to collaborating with each other on future projects, including possible NFTs.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He received an Emmy Award as a producer as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. He was also Emmy-nominated for his role in the action-comedy web series \"Die Hart\" (2021). \nOutside of acting, Travolta has released nine albums, including four singles that have charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100's Top 40. His albums have typically accompanied films he has starred in, such as \"\" (1978), which topped the \"Billboard\" 200. Travolta is also a private pilot.\nEarly life.\nThe youngest of six children, Travolta was born and raised in Englewood, an inner-ring suburb of New York City in Bergen County, New Jersey.\nHis father, Salvatore \"Sam\" Travolta, was a semiprofessional American football player turned tire salesman and partner in a tire company, Travolta Tire Exchange. His mother, Helen Cecilia (\"n\u00e9e\" Burke), was an actress and singer who had appeared in The Sunshine Sisters, a radio vocal group, and acted and directed before becoming a high school drama and English teacher. His siblings Joey, Ellen, Ann, Margaret, and Sam Travolta were all inspired by their mother's love of theater and drama and became actors. His father was a second-generation Italian American with roots in Godrano, Sicily, and his mother was Irish American.\nHe grew up in an Irish-American neighborhood and said that his household was predominantly Irish in culture. He was raised Catholic, but later converted to Scientology in 1975 at age 21. He converted after being given the book \"\" from former actress Joan Prather. Travolta attended Dwight Morrow High School, but dropped out as a junior at age 17 in 1971.\nCareer.\n1970s.\nAfter dropping out of school, Travolta moved across the Hudson River to New York City and landed a role in the touring company of the musical \"Grease\" as Doody and on Broadway in \"Over Here!\", singing the Sherman Brothers' song \"Dream Drummin'\". He then moved to Los Angeles for professional reasons. Travolta's first screen role in California was as a fall victim in \"Emergency!\" (Season 2, Episode 2) in September 1972, but his first significant movie role was as Billy Nolan, a bully who was goaded into playing a prank on Sissy Spacek's character in the horror film \"Carrie\" (1976) directed by Brian de Palma. Around that time, he landed his star-making role as Vinnie Barbarino in the ABC TV sitcom \"Welcome Back, Kotter\" (1975\u20131979), in which his sister, Ellen, also occasionally appeared (as Arnold Horshack's mother).\nTravolta had a hit single titled \"Let Her In\", peaking at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in July 1976. In the next few years, he starred in the television movie \"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble\" and two of his most noted screen roles: Tony Manero in the dance drama \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) and Danny Zuko in the musical \"Grease\" (1978). The films were among the most commercially successful pictures of the decade and catapulted Travolta to international stardom. \"Saturday Night Fever\" earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him, at age 24, one of the youngest performers ever nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. His mother and his sister Ann appeared very briefly in \"Saturday Night Fever\" and his sister Ellen played a waitress in \"Grease\". Travolta performed on the \"Grease\" soundtrack album. After the failure of the romance \"Moment by Moment\" (1978), in which he starred with Lily Tomlin, Travolta rebounded in 1980, riding a nationwide country music craze that followed on the heels of his hit film \"Urban Cowboy\", in which he starred with Debra Winger.\n1980s.\nTravolta followed up \"Urban Cowboy\" with a starring role in Brian de Palma's 1981 film \"Blow Out\", which was critically lauded but a box office disappointment, likely due to its bleak ending. After \"Blow Out\" came a series of commercial and critical failures which sidelined Travolta's acting career. These included \"Two of a Kind\" (1983), a romantic comedy reuniting him with Olivia Newton-John, and \"Perfect\" (1985), co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis. He also starred in \"Staying Alive\", the 1983 sequel to \"Saturday Night Fever\", for which he trained rigorously to portray a professional dancer and lost ; the film was a financial success, grossing over $65\u00a0million, though it, too, was scorned by critics.\nDuring that time, Travolta was offered, but declined, lead roles in what would become box-office hits, including \"American Gigolo\" and \"An Officer and a Gentleman\", both of which went to Richard Gere, as well as \"Splash\", which went to Tom Hanks. In 1989, Travolta starred with Kirstie Alley in \"Look Who's Talking\", which grossed $297\u00a0million, making it his most successful film since \"Grease\". \n1990s.\nTravolta subsequently starred in \"Look Who's Talking Too\" (1990) and \"Look Who's Talking Now\" (1993), but it was not until he played against type as Vincent Vega in Quentin Tarantino's hit \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), with Samuel L. Jackson, for which he received an Academy Award nomination, that his career was revived. It was Travolta's third film alongside Bruce Willis. The movie shifted him back onto the A-list and notable roles that followed include a movie-buff loan shark in \"Get Shorty\" (1995), a factory worker in \"White Man's Burden\" (1995), a corrupt U.S. Air Force pilot in \"Broken Arrow\" (1996), an everyman with extraordinary powers in \"Phenomenon\" (1996), an archangel in \"Michael\" (1996), an FBI agent and terrorist in \"Face/Off\" (1997), a desperate attorney in \"A Civil Action\" (1998), a Bill Clinton\u2013esque presidential candidate in \"Primary Colors\" (1998), and a military investigator in \"The General's Daughter\" (1999).\n2000s.\nIn 2000, Travolta starred in and co-produced the science fiction film \"Battlefield Earth\", based on the novel of the same name by L. Ron Hubbard, in which he played the villainous leading role as a leader of a group of aliens that enslaves humanity on a bleak future Earth. The film was a dream project for Travolta since the book's release in 1982, when Hubbard wrote to him to try to help make a film adaptation. The film received almost universally negative reviews and did very poorly at the box office. Travolta's performance in \"Battlefield Earth\" also earned him two Razzie Awards.\nThroughout the 2000s, Travolta remained busy as an actor, starring in \"Swordfish\" (2001); \"Lucky Numbers\" (2000); \"Domestic Disturbance\" (2001); \"Ladder 49\" (2004); \"Be Cool\" (2005); \"Lonely Hearts\" (2006); \"Wild Hogs\" (2007); the Disney animated film \"Bolt\" (2008), in which Travolta voiced the title character; \"The Taking of Pelham 123\"; and \"Old Dogs\" (both 2009).\nIn 2007, Travolta played Edna Turnblad in the remake of \"Hairspray\", his first musical since \"Grease\".\n2010s.\nSince 2010, Travolta has starred mostly in action films and thrillers, such as \"From Paris with Love\" (2010) and \"Savages\" (2012). In 2014, Travolta made headlines for mispronouncing the name of Idina Menzel by calling her \"Adele Dazeem\" during the live broadcast of the 86th Academy Awards; he subsequently apologized and expressed embarrassment for the error. The mispronunciation evolved into a popular internet meme which ultimately boosted Menzel's popularity, causing Menzel to remark that Travolta's error \"was one of the best things that happened\" in her career. In 2016, he returned to television in the first season of the anthology series \"American Crime Story\", titled \"\", in which he played lawyer Robert Shapiro. For his performance he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.\n2020s.\nFollowing the death of his wife Kelly Preston in July 2020, Travolta hinted on his Instagram account that he would be putting his career on hold, stating, \"I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while\".\nOther ventures.\nAviation.\nTravolta is a pilot and rated to fly Boeing 707 and 747 planes. He owns four aircraft. Travolta owned an ex-Qantas Boeing 707-138B (Ex-VH-EBM) which bears an old livery of Qantas, and Travolta acted as an official goodwill ambassador for the airline wherever he flew. Travolta named his 707 \"Jett Clipper Ella\", in honor of his children. The \"Clipper\" in the name refers to the use of that word by Pan Am as the company's call sign as well as in the names of their aircraft. In 2017, Travolta donated the Boeing 707 to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) near Wollongong, Australia. This was expected to be flown to Australia in November 2019, but was later delayed to sometime in 2020 due to condition of the aircraft. Travolta planned to be on board when the aircraft was to be flown to Illawarra Regional Airport, where HARS is based, but was not allowed to fly it, because it was to be registered as an Australian aircraft.\nOn November 24, 1992, Travolta was piloting his Gulfstream N728T at night above a solid undercast when he experienced a total electrical system failure while flying under instrument flight rules into Washington National Airport. During the emergency landing, he almost had a mid-air collision with a USAir Boeing 727, an event attributed to a risky decision by an air traffic controller.\nIn 1984, Travolta was inducted into the American Academy of Achievement and presented with the Golden Plate Award by Awards Council member General Chuck Yeager, USAF. Travolta was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2007 and acts as the award show's official ambassador.\nOn September 13, 2010, during the first episode of the final season of her talk show, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be taking her entire studio audience on an eight-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Australia, with Travolta serving as pilot for the trip. He had helped Winfrey plan the trip for more than a year.\nHe is the author of the book \"Propeller One-Way Night Coach\", the story of a young boy's first flight.\nHis estate in Ocala, Florida, is situated at Jumbolair Airport with its own runway and taxiway right to his house, with two outbuildings for covered access to planes.\nPhilanthropy.\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, joining other celebrities in helping with the relief efforts, Travolta reportedly flew his Boeing 707 full of supplies, doctors, and Scientologist Volunteer Ministers into the disaster area.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and family.\nTravolta was in a relationship with actress Diana Hyland, whom he met while filming \"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble\" (1976). They remained together until Hyland's death from breast cancer on March 27, 1977. In 1980, Travolta dated French actress Catherine Deneuve. Travolta also had an on-again/off-again relationship with actress Marilu Henner, which ended permanently in 1985. In 1988 while filming \"The Experts\", Travolta met actress Kelly Preston, whom he married in Paris in 1991. They had three children: Jett (1992\u20132009), Ella Bleu (born 2000), and Benjamin (born 2010). They regularly attended marriage counseling and Travolta has stated that therapy helped the marriage. They lived near Ocala, Florida.\nOn January 2, 2009, Jett died at age sixteen while on a Christmas vacation in The Bahamas. A Bahamian death certificate was issued, attributing the cause of death to a seizure. Jett, who had a history of seizures, reportedly had Kawasaki disease since the age of two. Travolta confirmed that Jett was autistic and had regular seizures, and immediately made his public statements while giving testimony at the trial of two defendants (a paramedic and a former Bahamas senator) who Travolta alleged tried to blackmail him with a multimillion-dollar extortion plot involving private information in connection with the death of his son Jett. After a mistrial, Travolta dropped the charges and has credited his immediate family and Scientology with helping him to cope with Jett's death and move forward with his career. In memory of Jett, Travolta created the Jett Travolta Foundation, a nonprofit organization to help children with special needs. It has contributed to organizations such as the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, and Simon Wiesenthal Center.\nOn July 12, 2020, Travolta's wife, Kelly Preston, died at the age of 57, at their home in Clearwater, Florida, two years after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Preston had undergone treatment at different hospitals, and at the time of her death, was receiving treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.\nTravolta is \"good friend[s]\" with American rapper Pitbull. The two collaborated on Travolta's 2018 film \"Gotti\", for which Pitbull scored and wrote the song \"Amore\". In 2019, Travolta debuted a new shaved head look after receiving advice from Pitbull to do so. Later that year, Travolta appeared in the music video for Pitbull's single \"3 to Tango\".\nLegal issues.\nIn May 2012, an anonymous masseur filed a lawsuit against Travolta, citing claims of sexual assault and battery. A lawyer for Travolta said that the allegations were \"complete fiction and fabrication\". Travolta's counsel also stated that his client would be able to prove that he was not in California on the day in question and asserted that Travolta would \"sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution\" after getting the case thrown out. A second masseur later joined the lawsuit, making similar claims. Both lawsuits were subsequently dropped by the complainants and dismissed without prejudice.\nOn September 27, 2012, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Travolta and his attorney Marty Singer by writer Robert Randolph because he found that a letter, written by Singer in response to allegations in a book by Randolph, was protected by free speech.\nIn July 2014, a California court allowed Travolta's former private pilot, Douglas Gotterba, to proceed with a lawsuit challenging the confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions of the termination agreement signed between Gotterba and Travolta years earlier. Travolta's lawyers served Gotterba with a cease and desist letter in 2012 after learning through a tip that Gotterba was planning to release a book about his time working for Travolta between 1981 and 1987, during which period Gotterba claims to have had a homosexual extramarital affair with Travolta. Travolta strongly denied the allegations.\nAwards and nominations.\nTravolta was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performances in \"Saturday Night Fever\" and \"Pulp Fiction\". He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy for his performance in \"Get Shorty\" and has received a total of six nominations, the most recent being in 2011. In 2014, he received the IIFA Award for Outstanding Achievement in International Cinema. \nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars John Travolta as Tony Manero, a young Italian-American man who spends his weekends dancing and drinking at a local disco while dealing with social tensions and disillusionment in his working class ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn. The story is based on \"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night\", a mostly fictional 1976 \"New York\" article by music writer Nik Cohn.\nA major critical and commercial success, \"Saturday Night Fever\" had a tremendous impact on the popular culture of the late 1970s. It helped popularize disco around the world and initiated a series of collaborations between film studios and record labels. It made Travolta, already well known from his role in the popular TV sitcom \"Welcome Back, Kotter\", a household name. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, at the time becoming the fourth-youngest nominee in the category. The film showcases aspects of the music, dancing, and subculture surrounding the disco era, including symphony-orchestrated melodies, haute couture styles of clothing, pre-AIDS sexual promiscuity and graceful choreography. The \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack, featuring songs by the Bee Gees, is one of the best-selling soundtrack albums worldwide. Travolta reprised his role of Tony Manero in \"Staying Alive\" in 1983, which was panned by critics despite being successful at the box office.\nIn 2010, \"Saturday Night Fever\" was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nAdjusted for inflation, it is one of the highest-grossing R-rated films released in the U.S. in the 1970s, with a total box office gross of $673,899,098 in 2024.\nPlot.\nTony Manero is an Italian-American from the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, living in his family's house and working in a hardware store. He escapes his day-to-day life by dancing at 2001 Odyssey, a local discotheque, where he receives the admiration he craves as king of the dance floor.\nTony and his friends Joey, Double J, Gus, and Bobby C spend their nights at the disco, trying to have sex with women in Bobby's car, and climbing on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Neighborhood girl Annette is infatuated with Tony, much to his annoyance, and he agrees to be her partner in an upcoming dance contest. Annette's happiness is short-lived when Tony is mesmerized by a better dancer, Stephanie Mangano, who rejects Tony's advances but eventually agrees to be his new partner in the competition.\nTony is pleased to no longer be the black sheep of the family when his older brother Frank Jr, the pride of their parents and grandmother, quits the Catholic priesthood. Frank Jr admits that he only became a priest to make their parents happy, and later advises Bobby, who is under pressure to marry his pregnant girlfriend, that the Pope is unlikely to grant him dispensation for an abortion. Leaving to start a new life, Frank encourages Tony to do what makes him happy.\nGus is beaten up and hospitalized, telling his friends that his attackers were the Barracudas, a Puerto Rican gang. Annette grows more and more desperate for Tony's attention, as does Bobby, who tries to ask him for guidance. Tony helps Stephanie move to Manhattan, and comforts her after discovering her past relationship with an older married colleague. Tony and his friends take revenge on the Barracudas, crashing Bobby's car into their hangout and starting a brawl, but are angry to learn that Gus may have identified the wrong gang.\nAfter much practice, Tony and Stephanie dance at the competition, sharing a kiss at the end of their performance. They win first prize, but Tony believes that a Puerto Rican couple performed better and the judges' decision was racially biased, and he gives the couple his trophy and award money. Outside in Bobby's car, Tony tries to force himself on Stephanie, who declares that she was only using him to win, before fighting him off and running away.\nTony's friends arrive with Annette, who, under the influence of drugs, agrees to have sex with everyone. Tony tries to lead her away but is subdued by Double J and Joey, and they all drive to the bridge. Joey rapes Annette in the back seat followed by Double J, while Tony and Bobby appear uncomfortable. They arrive to a point on the bridge and climb out. The others begin their usual cable-climbing antics on the bridge, an erratic Bobby behaves even more recklessly than his friends, and Tony tries to talk him down, but Bobby's strong sense of despair and Tony's broken promise to call him earlier all lead to a suicidal tirade, before Bobby falls to his death. After the police arrive, a disgusted and disillusioned Tony leaves Double J, Joey, and Annette behind, riding the graffiti-riddled subway into Manhattan. By morning, he appears at Stephanie's apartment and apologizes for his behavior, planning to relocate to Manhattan to start a new life. Stephanie forgives Tony, admitting that she danced with him because he gave her respect and moral support, and they salvage their relationship, agreeing to be friends.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe film was inspired by a 1976 \"New York\" magazine article entitled \"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night\" by British writer Nik Cohn. The article centers on working class Italian-Americans in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and on the lives of young men who work dead-end jobs but live for their nights dancing at the local discotheque. Cohn later wrote that \"the [disco] craze had started in black gay clubs, then progressed to straight blacks and gay whites and from there to mass consumption\u2014Latinos in the Bronx, West Indians on Staten Island, and, yes, Italians in Brooklyn.\" Shortly after Cohn's article was published, British music impresario Robert Stigwood purchased the film rights and hired Cohn to adapt his own article to screen.\nIn the mid-1990s Cohn acknowledged that although his account was presented as factual reporting, he fabricated most of the article. He said that as a newcomer to the United States and a stranger to the disco lifestyle, he was unable to make any sense of the subculture he had been assigned to write about; instead, the article's protagonist (who would become Tony Manero) was based on an acquaintance of Cohn who was an English mod.\nJohn G. Avildsen was originally hired as the film's director but was replaced one month before principal photography by John Badham over \"conceptual disagreements.\" Badham was a lesser-known director who, like his star, had mostly worked in television. His sole prior film credit, \"The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings\", was released while \"Saturday Night Fever\" was already well into production.\nThe film went through several different titles, including \"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night\" and \"Saturday Night\". After the Bee Gees wrote \"Night Fever\" and submitted it for the soundtrack, they told Stigwood they disliked the title \"Saturday Night\". It was after this that the film's final title of \"Saturday Night Fever\" was decided upon.\nWriting.\nAfter Cohn finished a single screenplay draft, he was replaced by Norman Wexler, a screenwriter with Oscar nominations for \"Joe\" (1970) and \"Serpico\" (1973). Among the elements Wexler added to the story was Tony's younger sister, as well as older brother Frank who disappoints his parents by leaving the priesthood. \"I think what Norman did so well was to create a family situation that had real truth, an accurate look at how men related to women in that moment, in ways that you would never get away with now,\" said producer Kevin McCormick.\nCasting.\nThe film's relatively low budget ($3.5 million) meant that most of the actors were relative unknowns, many of whom were recruited from New York's theatre scene. For more than 40% of the actors it was their film debut. The only actor in the cast who was already an established name was John Travolta, thanks to his role on the sitcom \"Welcome Back, Kotter\". Travolta, who had previously auditioned for Stigwood's film version of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", was remembered by the producer and signed to a three-movie contract with his company in 1976. Stigwood wanted Travolta to first star in a movie version of \"Grease\", but because a film adaptation of \"Grease\" was not permitted to begin filming until 1978 when its stage run had completed, they made this film first. Travolta's performance as Tony Manero brought him critical acclaim and helped launch him into international stardom.\nTravolta researched the part by visiting the real 2001 Odyssey discotheque, and claimed he adopted many of the character's swaggering mannerisms from the male patrons. Travolta said when he would get recognized, \"[Guys'] girlfriends would come up, and they'd say, 'Hey, stay away from him, don't bug Travolta,' and they\u2019d actually push the girls away. Tony Manero's whole male-chauvinist thing I got from watching those guys in the discos.\" He insisted on performing his character's own dance sequences after producers suggested he be substituted by a body double, rehearsing his choreography with Lester Wilson and Deney Terrio for three hours every day, losing in the process. Wilson is credited for providing the look of the dance scenes and \"breathing life\" into the film. Said Travolta, \"He taught me what he called his 'hang time.' He would smoke a cigarette to greet the day, and he infused my dancing with African-American rhythm. I'm the kind of dancer who needs thought and construction\u2014an idea\u2014before I dance. I need an internal story. Lester would put on some music and he would say, 'Move with me, motherfucker\u2014move with me!'\"\nKaren Lynn Gorney was nine years older than Travolta when she was cast as his love interest Stephanie. Although Gorney had dance experience before she was cast, she found it difficult to keep up with her co-star due to injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident some years before. After the success of \"Saturday Night Fever\", Gorney took a break from film acting to work as a dance instructor at a performing arts academy in Brooklyn. Jessica Lange, Kathleen Quinlan, Carrie Fisher, and Amy Irving were all considered for the part before Gorney was cast.\nDonna Pescow was considered almost \"too pretty\" by Paramount heads Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg for the role of Annette. She corrected this matter by putting on weight. She also had to relearn her native Brooklyn accent, which she had overcome while studying drama at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.\nFilming.\nThe film was shot entirely on location in Brooklyn, New York. The 2001 Odyssey Disco was a real club located at 802 64th Street, but it has since been demolished. The interior was modified for the film, including the addition of a $15,000 lighted floor, which was inspired by a Birmingham, Alabama establishment that Badham had visited. A similar effect was achieved on the club's walls using tin foil and Christmas lights. Since the Bee Gees were not involved in the production until after principal photography had wrapped, the \"Night Fever\", \"You Should Be Dancin'\" and \"More Than a Woman\" sequences were shot with Stevie Wonder tracks that were later overdubbed in the sound mix. During filming, the production was harassed by local gangs over use of the location, and was even firebombed.\nThe dance studio was Phillips Dance Studio in Bensonhurst, the Manero home was a house in Bay Ridge and the paint store was Pearson Paint &amp; Hardware, also in Bay Ridge. Other locations included the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, John J. Carty Park and the Bay Ridge Promenade.\nTo avoid Travolta's fans who might disrupt filming, Badham and his team shot exterior scenes as early in the morning as possible, often at the break of dawn. The producers also generated fake call sheets. Badham was usually able to complete the scenes before significant crowds had time to gather.\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack was released on November 15, 1977. Prior to the release of \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson, \"Saturday Night Fever\" was the best-selling album in music history, and still ranks among the best-selling soundtrack albums worldwide, with sales figures of over 40 million copies.\nIn the United States, the album was certified 16\u00d7 Platinum for shipments of at least 16 million units. The album stayed atop the charts for 24 straight weeks from January to July 1978 and stayed on \"Billboard\"'s album charts for 120 weeks until March 1980. The soundtrack included material written by the Bee Gees: \"How Deep Is Your Love\", \"Stayin' Alive\" and \"Night Fever\", which they also performed, as well as Yvonne Elliman's version of \"If I Can't Have You\". All four reached No. 1 in the US. In the UK, the album spent 18 consecutive weeks at No. 1. The album epitomized the disco phenomenon on both sides of the Atlantic and was an international sensation. The album has been added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress in 2014 for being culturally significant.\nWith the exception of (*) track 12 \"Jive Talkin\", all of the songs are played in the film.\nThe novelty songs \"Dr. Disco\" and \"Disco Duck\", both performed by Rick Dees, are played in the film but not included on the album.\nAccording to the DVD commentary for \"Saturday Night Fever\", the producers intended to use the song \"Lowdown\" by Boz Scaggs in the rehearsal scene between Tony and Annette in the dance studio, and choreographed their dance moves to the song. However, representatives for Scaggs' label Columbia Records refused to grant legal clearance for it, as they wanted to pursue another disco movie project, which never materialized. Composer David Shire, who scored the film, had to write a song to match the dance steps in the scene, replacing the Scaggs track. However, Shire's track does not appear on the movie's soundtrack.\nThe song \"K-Jee\" was used during the dance contest with the Puerto Rican couple that competed against Tony and Stephanie. Some VHS cassettes used a more traditional Latin-style song instead. The DVD restores the original recording.\nThe album, like its parent film, has been added to the Library of Congress via the National Recording Registry.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\nTwo theatrical versions of the film were released: the original R-rated version and an edited PG-rated version in 1979.\nThe R-rated version released in 1977 represented the movie's first run, and totaled 119 minutes. After the success of the first run, the film's content was re-edited into a 112-minute, toned down, PG-rated version, not only to attract a wider audience, but also to capitalize on attracting the target audience of the teenagers who were not old enough to see the film by themselves, but who made the film's soundtrack album a monster hit. The R-rated version's profanity, nudity, fight sequence, and a gang rape scene in a car, were all de-emphasized or removed from the PG version. Numerous profanity-filled scenes were replaced with alternate takes of the same scenes, substituting milder language initially intended for the network television cut.\nParamount initially intended to release the PG-rated version of the film in 1978, as it was already being screened on airlines. However, due to the regulations set by the MPAA at the time, it was not permissible to have two versions of a film with different ratings shown concurrently in American theaters. Consequently, Paramount had to remove the film from exhibition for a period of 90 days before they could showcase the alternate rated version, thereby causing a delay in their release plans. Eventually, in 1979, the PG-rated version was made available to the public. Paramount later decided to present it as a double feature along with their other successful John Travolta film, \"Grease\". In the \"Biography\" documentary \"Inside Story: Saturday Night Fever\", producer Robert Stigwood criticized the PG-rated version, stating that it undermined the film's impact and lacked the power of the original R-rated edition.\nIn 2017, the director's cut (running 122 minutes) premiered at the TCM Classic Film Festival at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Fathom Events hosted special screenings of this version in 2017.\nHome media.\nBoth theatrical versions were released on VHS. The PG-rated version never had a home video release on Laserdisc. It was first released to DVD by Paramount on October 8, 2002, as an R-rated special-edition, which included most of the deleted scenes present on the PG version, as well as a director's commentary and \"Behind the Music\" featurettes.\nOn May 5, 2009, Paramount released \"Saturday Night Fever\" on Blu-ray Disc in aspect ratio. This release retains the R-rated version of the film, and included bonus features from the 2002 release as well as new extras.\nThe 4K director's cut (122 minutes) was released on Blu-ray on May 2, 2017. This disc includes both the director's cut and the original theatrical version, as well as the bulk of the bonus features from the prior release.\nOn November 8, 2022, Paramount released the film as a special edition 4K HD Blu-ray.\nTelevision broadcast.\nWhen HBO acquired the pay television rights to \"Saturday Night Fever\" in 1980, both versions of the film were aired by the network: the PG version during the day, and the R version during the evening (HBO, which had primarily operated on a late afternoon-to-early overnight schedule at the time, had maintained a programming policy restricting the showing of R-rated films to the nighttime hours, a rule that continued long after it switched to a 24-hour schedule full-time in December 1981). The R-rated theatrical version premiered on the network at midnight Eastern Time on January 1, 1980.\nFor the film's network television premiere, airing on ABC on November 16, 1980, a new milder version was created to conform with network broadcast standards. The network television version was a slightly shortened cut of the PG-rated version. In order to maintain runtime, a few additional scenes deleted from both theatrical releases were added to make up for the lost/cut material, making the ABC version among the longest cuts of the film. These added scenes included Tony dancing with Doreen to \"Disco Duck\", Tony running his finger along the cables of the Verrazzano\u2013Narrows Bridge, and Tony's father getting his job back. The last two deleted scenes were included in the 2017 director's cut.\nStarting in the late 1990s, VH1, TBS and TNT began showing the original R-rated version with a TV-14 rating, although with nudity removed/censored, and the stronger profanity either being edited or (on recent airings) silenced. However, this version of the TV cut included some innuendo included in the original theatrical release that was edited or removed from the PG version. Turner Classic Movies has aired the film in both versions: the original R-rated version (rated TV-MA on the network) is the cut commonly broadcast, although the PG cut has been presented as part of TCM's family-oriented \"Funday Night at the Movies\" and \"Essentials Jr.\" film showcases.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film grossed $25.9 million in its first 24 days of release and grossed an average of $600,000 a day throughout January to March going on to gross $94.2 million in the United States and Canada and $237.1 million worldwide. Adjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing R-rated film released in the U.S. in the 1970s, with a total box office gross of $673,899,098 in 2024.\nCritical response.\n\"Saturday Night Fever\" received positive reviews and is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of 1977. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Boasting a smart, poignant story, a classic soundtrack, and a starmaking performance from John Travolta, \"Saturday Night Fever\" ranks among the finest dramas of the 1970s.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 77 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating . It was added to \"The New York Times\" \"Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\", which was published in 2004. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nFilm critic Gene Siskel, who would later list this as his favorite movie, praised the film: \"One minute into \"Saturday Night Fever\" you know this picture is onto something, that it knows what it's talking about.\" He also praised John Travolta's energetic performance: \"Travolta on the dance floor is like a peacock on amphetamines. He struts like crazy.\" Siskel even bought Travolta's famous white suit from the film at a charity auction.\nFilm critic Pauline Kael wrote a gushing review of the film in \"The New Yorker\": \"The way \"Saturday Night Fever\" has been directed and shot, we feel the languorous pull of the discotheque, and the gaudiness is transformed. These are among the most hypnotically beautiful pop dance scenes ever filmed ... Travolta gets so far inside the role he seems incapable of a false note; even the Brooklyn accent sounds unerring ... At its best, though, \"Saturday Night Fever\" gets at something deeply romantic: the need to move, to dance, and the need to be who you'd like to be. Nirvana is the dance; when the music stops, you return to being ordinary.\"\nAccolades.\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\nIn popular culture.\nA television show based on the film was in development, at some point after the film's release. In 2024, David Letterman said that he was sent to an audition for the series.\nThe 1980 comedy \"Airplane!\" by directors David &amp; Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams, included a flashback scene that directly parodied the dance competition scene at the disco in \"Saturday Night Fever\".\nIn 2008, director Pablo Larra\u00edn made a film, \"Tony Manero\", about a Chilean dancer obsessed by the main character in \"Saturday Night Fever\" who tries to win a Tony Manero look-alike contest.\nOn April 17, 2012, Fox aired series \"Glee\"'s episode 16, \"Saturday Night Glee-ver\", which pays tribute to the film and features various songs from its soundtrack (especially the songs performed by the Bee Gees), covered by the series' cast.\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers 2016 music video for their song \"Go Robot\" is heavily inspired by the film and recreates the opening scene and classic characters from the film who are portrayed by each band member.\nIn \"Team Fortress 2\", a community-created taunt for the spy in July 2016. The spy's dance references Tony Monero's dancing to \"You Should Be Dancin.'\"\nThe 2018 film \"Ready Player One\" features a dance scene that references \"Saturday Night Fever\", particularly the red, yellow, and blue dance floor from the 2001 Odyssey night club in the film.\nIn November 2023, Capital One began airing a holiday-themed commercial titled \"Holiday Night Fever\" which contained an homage to the opening scene of the movie. In the sixty second version, as the Bee Gees' \"Stayin' Alive\" plays over the scene, Santa Claus (a heavily made-up John Travolta) struts down a street that has been mostly cleared of snow after a winter storm. He carries a can of \"magical glitter paint\"; buys two cookies (instead of pizza slices) at a walk-up window and asks \"what happened to three?\" (he was offered three slices in the movie); eats them stacked; then pauses at a shoe store window and compares his shoes to a pair of elven boots with a jingle bell on them; he flirts with a store clerk (Donna Pescow); buys a disco ball Christmas ornament for his sleigh; throws some of the glitter paint onto a Christmas tree that is set up on the sidewalk; then goes to a disco where he asks how his hair looks and dances on the illuminated floor. The shorter version of the commercial was still being aired as of November 2024.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54176", "revid": "8565473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54176", "title": "Human body", "text": "Physical substance of the human organism\nThe human body is the entire structure of a human being. It is composed of many different types of cells that together create tissues and subsequently organs and then organ systems. \nThe external human body consists of a head, hair, neck, torso (which includes the thorax and abdomen), genitals, arms, hands, legs, and feet. The internal human body includes organs, teeth, bones, muscle, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels and blood, lymphatic vessels and lymph.\nThe study of the human body includes anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. The body varies anatomically in known ways. Physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. Many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar, iron, and oxygen in the blood.\nThe body is studied by health professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and artists to assist them in their work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nComposition.\nThe human body is composed of elements including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, calcium and phosphorus. These elements reside in trillions of cells and non-cellular components of the body.\nThe adult male body is about 60% total body water content of some . This is made up of about of extracellular fluid including about of blood plasma and about of interstitial fluid, and about of fluid inside cells. The content, acidity and composition of the water inside and outside cells is carefully maintained. The main electrolytes in body water outside cells are sodium and chloride, whereas within cells it is potassium and other phosphates.\nCells.\nThe body contains trillions of cells, the fundamental unit of life. At maturity, there are roughly 30 trillion cells, and 38 trillion bacteria in the body, an estimate arrived at by totaling the cell numbers of all the organs of the body and cell types. The skin of the body is also host to billions of commensal organisms as well as immune cells. Not all parts of the body are made from cells. Cells sit in an extracellular matrix that consists of proteins such as collagen, surrounded by extracellular fluids.\nEach of the cells of the human body experiences, on average, tens of thousands of DNA damages per day. These damages can block genome replication or genome transcription, and if they are not repaired or are repaired incorrectly, they may lead to mutations, or other genome alterations that threaten cell viability. \nGenome.\nCells in the body function because of DNA. DNA sits within the nucleus of a cell. Here, parts of DNA are copied and sent to the body of the cell via RNA. The RNA is then used to create proteins, which form the basis for cells, their activity, and their products. Proteins dictate cell function and gene expression, a cell is able to self-regulate by the amount of proteins produced. However, not all cells have DNA; some cells such as mature red blood cells lose their nucleus as they mature.\nTissues.\nThe body consists of many different types of tissue, defined as cells that act with a specialised function. The study of tissues is called histology and is often done with a microscope. The body consists of four main types of tissues. These are lining cells (epithelia), connective tissue, nerve tissue and muscle tissue.\nCells.\nCells that line surfaces exposed to the outside world or gastrointestinal tract (epithelia) or internal cavities (endothelium) come in numerous shapes and forms \u2013 from single layers of flat cells, to cells with small beating hair-like cilia in the lungs, to column-like cells that line the stomach. Endothelial cells are cells that line internal cavities including blood vessels and glands. Lining cells regulate what can and cannot pass through them, protect internal structures, and function as sensory surfaces.\nOrgans.\nOrgans, structured collections of cells with a specific function, mostly sit within the body, with the exception of skin. Examples include the heart, lungs and liver. Many organs reside within cavities within the body. These cavities include the abdomen (which contains the stomach, for example) and pleura, which contains the lungs.\nHeart.\nThe heart is an organ located in the thoracic cavity between the lungs and slightly to the left. It is surrounded by the pericardium, which holds it in place in the mediastinum and serves to protect it from blunt trauma, infection and help lubricate the movement of the heart via pericardial fluid. The heart works by pumping blood around the body allowing oxygen, nutrients, waste, hormones and white blood cells to be transported.\nThe heart is composed of two atria and two ventricles. The primary purpose of the atria is to allow uninterrupted venous blood flow to the heart during ventricular systole. This allows enough blood to get into the ventricles during atrial systole. Consequently, the atria allows a cardiac output roughly 75% greater than would be possible without them. The purpose of the ventricles is to pump blood to the lungs through the right ventricle and to the rest of the body through the left ventricle.\nThe heart has an electrical conduction system to control the contraction and relaxation of the muscles. It starts in the sinoatrial node traveling through the atria causing them to pump blood into the ventricles. It then travels to the atrioventricular node, which makes the signal slow down slightly allowing the ventricles to fill with blood before pumping it out and starting the cycle over again.\nCoronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, making up 16% of all deaths. It is caused by the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries supplying the heart, eventually the arteries may become so narrow that not enough blood is able to reach the myocardium, a condition known as myocardial infarction or heart attack, this can cause heart failure or cardiac arrest and eventually death. Risk factors for coronary artery disease include obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, lack of exercise and diabetes. Cancer can affect the heart, though it is exceedingly rare and has usually metastasized from another part of the body such as the lungs or breasts. This is because the heart cells quickly stop dividing and all growth occurs through size increase rather than cell division.\nGallbladder.\nThe gallbladder is a hollow pear-shaped organ located posterior to the inferior middle part of the right lobe of the liver. It is variable in shape and size. It stores bile before it is released into the small intestine via the common bile duct to help with digestion of fats. It receives bile from the liver via the cystic duct, which connects to the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.\nThe gallbladder gets its blood supply from the cystic artery, which in most people, emerges from the right hepatic artery.\nGallstones is a common disease in which one or more stones form in the gallbladder or biliary tract. Most people are asymptomatic but if a stone blocks the biliary tract, it causes a gallbladder attack; symptoms may include sudden pain in the upper right abdomen or center of the abdomen. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. Typical treatment is removal of the gallbladder through a procedure called a cholecystectomy. Having gallstones is a risk factor for gallbladder cancer, which, although quite uncommon, is rapidly fatal if not diagnosed early.\nSystems.\nCirculatory system.\nThe circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries). The heart propels the circulation of the blood, which serves as a \"transportation system\" to transfer oxygen, fuel, nutrients, waste products, immune cells and signaling molecules (i.e. hormones) from one part of the body to another. Paths of blood circulation within the human body can be divided into two circuits: the pulmonary circuit, which pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and leave carbon dioxide, and the systemic circuit, which carries blood from the heart off to the rest of the body. The blood consists of fluid that carries cells in the circulation, including some that move from tissue to blood vessels and back, as well as the spleen and bone marrow.\nDigestive system.\nThe digestive system consists of the mouth including the tongue and teeth, esophagus, stomach, (gastrointestinal tract, small and large intestines, and rectum), as well as the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and salivary glands. It converts food into small, nutritional, non-toxic molecules for distribution and absorption into the body. These molecules take the form of proteins (which are broken down into amino acids), fats, vitamins and minerals (the last of which are mainly ionic rather than molecular). After being swallowed, food moves through the gastrointestinal tract by means of peristalsis: the systematic expansion and contraction of muscles to push food from one area to the next.\nDigestion begins in the mouth, which chews food into smaller pieces for easier digestion. Then it is swallowed, and moves through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, food is mixed with gastric acids to allow the extraction of nutrients. What is left is called chyme; this then moves into the small intestine, which absorbs the nutrients and water from the chyme. What remains passes on to the large intestine, where it is dried to form feces; these are then stored in the rectum until they are expelled through the anus.\nEndocrine system.\nThe endocrine system consists of the principal endocrine glands: the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas, parathyroids, and gonads, but nearly all organs and tissues produce specific endocrine hormones as well. The endocrine hormones serve as signals from one body system to another regarding an enormous array of conditions, resulting in variety of changes of function.\nImmune system.\nThe immune system consists of the white blood cells, the thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, which are also part of the lymphatic system. The immune system provides a mechanism for the body to distinguish its own cells and tissues from outside cells and substances and to neutralize or destroy the latter by using specialized proteins such as antibodies, cytokines, and toll-like receptors, among many others.\nIntegumentary system.\nThe integumentary system consists of the covering of the body (the skin), including hair and nails as well as other functionally important structures such as the sweat glands and sebaceous glands. The skin provides containment, structure, and protection for other organs, and serves as a major sensory interface with the outside world.\nLymphatic system.\nThe lymphatic system extracts, transports and metabolizes lymph, the fluid found in between cells. The lymphatic system is similar to the circulatory system in terms of both its structure and its most basic function, to carry a body fluid.\nMusculoskeletal system.\nThe musculoskeletal system consists of the human skeleton (which includes bones, ligaments, tendons, joints and cartilage) and attached muscles. It gives the body basic structure and the ability for movement. In addition to their structural role, the larger bones in the body contain bone marrow, the site of production of blood cells. Also, all bones are major storage sites for calcium and phosphate. This system can be split up into the muscular system and the skeletal system.\nNervous system.\nThe nervous system consists of the body's neurons and glial cells, which together form the nerves, ganglia and gray matter, which in turn form the brain and related structures. The brain is the organ of thought, emotion, memory, and sensory processing; it serves many aspects of communication and controls various systems and functions. The special senses consist of vision, hearing, taste, and smell. The eyes, ears, tongue, and nose gather information about the body's environment.\nFrom a structural perspective, the nervous system is typically subdivided into two component parts: the central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and the spinal cord; and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), composed of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord. The CNS is mostly responsible for organizing motion, processing sensory information, thought, memory, cognition and other such functions. It remains a matter of some debate whether the CNS directly gives rise to consciousness. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is mostly responsible for gathering information with sensory neurons and directing body movements with motor neurons.\nFrom a functional perspective, the nervous system is again typically divided into two component parts: the somatic nervous system (SNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The SNS is involved in voluntary functions like speaking and sensory processes. The ANS is involved in involuntary processes, such as digestion and regulating blood pressure.\nThe nervous system is subject to many different diseases. In epilepsy, abnormal electrical activity in the brain can cause seizures. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the nerve linings, damaging the nerves' ability to transmit signals. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a motor neuron disease which gradually reduces movement in patients. There are also many other diseases of the nervous system.\nReproductive system.\nThe purpose of the reproductive system is to reproduce and nurture the growth of offspring. The functions include the production of germ cells and hormones. The sex organs of the male reproductive system and the female reproductive system develops and mature at puberty. These systems include the internal and external genitalia.\nFemale puberty generally occurs between the ages of 9 and 13 and is characterized by ovulation and menstruation; the growth of secondary sex characteristics, such as growth of pubic and underarm hair, breast, uterine and vaginal growth, widening hips and increased height and weight, also occur during puberty. Male puberty sees the further development of the Human penis and testicles.\nThe female inner sex organs are the two ovaries, their fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the cervix. At birth there are about 70,000 immature egg cells that degenerate until at puberty there are around 40,000. No more egg cells are produced. Hormones stimulate the beginning of menstruation, and the ongoing menstrual cycles. The female external sex organs are the vulva (labia, clitoris, and vestibule).\nThe male external genitalia include the penis and scrotum that contains the testicles. The testicles are gonads that produce the sperm cells which are ejaculated in semen through the penis. Unlike the egg cells in the female, sperm cells are produced throughout life. Other internal sex organs are the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and some accessory glands.\nDiseases that affect the reproductive system include polycystic ovary syndrome, a number of disorders of the testicles including testicular torsion, and a number of sexually transmitted infections including syphilis, HIV, chlamydia, HPV and genital warts. Cancer can affect most parts of the reproductive system including the penis, testicles, prostate, ovaries, cervix, vagina, fallopian, uterus and vulva.\nRespiratory system.\nThe respiratory system consists of the nose, nasopharynx, trachea, and lungs. It brings oxygen from the air and excretes carbon dioxide and water back into the air. First, air is pulled through the trachea into the lungs by the diaphragm pushing down, which creates a vacuum. Air is briefly stored inside small sacs known as alveoli (sing.: alveolus) before being expelled from the lungs when the diaphragm contracts again. Each alveolus is surrounded by capillaries carrying deoxygenated blood, which absorbs oxygen out of the air and into the bloodstream.\nFor the respiratory system to function properly, there need to be as few impediments as possible to the movement of air within the lungs. Inflammation of the lungs and excess mucus are common sources of breathing difficulties. In asthma, the respiratory system is persistently inflamed, causing wheezing or shortness of breath. Pneumonia occurs through infection of the alveoli, and may be caused by tuberculosis. Emphysema, commonly a result of smoking, is caused by damage to connections between the alveoli.\nUrinary system.\nThe urinary system consists of the two kidneys, two ureters, bladder, and urethra. It removes waste materials from the blood through urine, which carries a variety of waste molecules and excess ions and water out of the body.\nFirst, the kidneys filter the blood through their respective nephrons, removing waste products like urea, creatinine and maintaining the proper balance of electrolytes and turning the waste products into urine by combining them with water from the blood. The kidneys filter about 150 quarts (170 liters) of blood daily, but most of it is returned to the blood stream with only 1-2 quarts (1-2 liters) ending up as urine, which passes from the kidneys through the ureters into the bladder.\nThe smooth muscles lining the ureter walls continuously tighten and relax through a process called peristalsis, forcing small amounts of urine into the bladder every 10\u201315 seconds.\nThe bladder is a hollow balloon shaped organ located in the pelvis. It stores urine until the brain signals it to relax the urinary sphincter and release the urine into the urethra starting urination. A normal bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (half a liter) for 3\u20135 hours comfortably.\nNumerous diseases affect the urinary system including kidney stones, which are formed when materials in the urine concentrate enough to form a solid mass, urinary tract infections, which are infections of the urinary tract and can cause pain when urinating, frequent urination and even death if left untreated. Renal failure occurs when the kidneys fail to adequately filter waste from the blood and can lead to death if not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation. Cancer can affect the bladder, kidneys, urethra and ureters, with the latter two being far more rare.\nAnatomy.\nHuman anatomy is the study of the shape and form of the human body. The human body has four limbs (two arms and two legs), a head and a neck, which connect to the torso. The body's shape is determined by a strong skeleton made of bone and cartilage, surrounded by fat (adipose tissue), muscle, connective tissue, organs, and other structures. The spine at the back of the skeleton contains the flexible vertebral column, which surrounds the spinal cord, which is a collection of nerve fibres connecting the brain to the rest of the body. Nerves connect the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body. All major bones, muscles, and nerves in the body are named, with the exception of anatomical variations such as sesamoid bones and accessory muscles.\nBlood vessels carry blood throughout the body, which moves because of the beating of the heart. Venules and veins collect blood low in oxygen from tissues throughout the body. These collect in progressively larger veins until they reach the body's two largest veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, which drain blood into the right side of the heart. From here, the blood is pumped into the lungs where it receives oxygen and drains back into the left side of the heart. From here, it is pumped into the body's largest artery, the aorta, and then progressively smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches tissue. Here, blood passes from small arteries into capillaries, then small veins and the process begins again. Blood carries oxygen, waste products, and hormones from one place in the body to another. Blood is filtered at the kidneys and liver.\nThe body consists of a number of body cavities, separated areas which house different organ systems. The brain and central nervous system reside in an area protected from the rest of the body by the blood brain barrier. The lungs sit in the pleural cavity. The intestines, liver, and spleen sit in the abdominal cavity.\nHeight, weight, shape and other body proportions vary individually and with age and sex. Body shape is influenced by the distribution of bones, muscle and fat tissue.\nPhysiology.\nHuman physiology is the study of how the human body functions. This includes the mechanical, physical, bioelectrical, and biochemical functions of humans in good health, from organs to the cells of which they are composed. The human body consists of many interacting systems of organs. These interact to maintain homeostasis, keeping the body in a stable state with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.\nEach system contributes to homeostasis, of itself, other systems, and the entire body. Some combined systems are referred to by joint names. For example, the nervous system and the endocrine system operate together as the neuroendocrine system. The nervous system receives information from the body, and transmits this to the brain via nerve impulses and neurotransmitters. At the same time, the endocrine system releases hormones, such as to help regulate blood pressure and volume. Together, these systems regulate the internal environment of the body, maintaining blood flow, posture, energy supply, temperature, and acid balance (pH).\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment of the human body is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the ovary of a female is penetrated by sperm. The egg then lodges in the uterus, where an embryo and later fetus develop until birth. Growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. Development and growth continue throughout life, through childhood, adolescence, and through adulthood to old age, and are referred to as the process of aging.\nSociety and culture.\nProfessional study.\nHealth professionals learn about the human body from illustrations, models, and demonstrations. Medical and dental students in addition gain practical experience, for example by dissection of cadavers. Human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry are basic medical sciences, generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school.\nDepiction.\nIn Western societies, the contexts for depictions of the human body include information, art and pornography. Information includes both science and education, such as anatomical drawings. Any ambiguous image not easily fitting into one of these categories may be misinterpreted, leading to disputes. The most contentious disputes are between fine art and erotic images, which define the legal distinction of which images are permitted or prohibited.\nHistory of anatomy.\nIn Ancient Greece, the \"Hippocratic Corpus\" described the anatomy of the skeleton and muscles. The 2nd century physician Galen of Pergamum compiled classical knowledge of anatomy into a text that was used throughout the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance, Andreas Vesalius (1514\u20131564) pioneered the modern study of human anatomy by dissection, writing the influential book \"De humani corporis fabrica\". Anatomy advanced further with the invention of the microscope and the study of the cellular structure of tissues and organs. Modern anatomy uses techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging to study the body in unprecedented detail.\nHistory of physiology.\nThe study of human physiology began with Hippocrates in Ancient Greece, around 420 BCE, and with Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) who applied critical thinking and emphasis on the relationship between structure and function. Galen (c.\u2009129\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009216) was the first to use experiments to probe the body's functions. The term physiology was introduced by the French physician Jean Fernel (1497\u20131558). In the 17th century, William Harvey (1578\u20131657) described the circulatory system, pioneering the combination of close observation with careful experiment. In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate with the cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann in 1838, that organisms are made up of cells. Claude Bernard (1813\u20131878) created the concept of the \"milieu interieur\" (internal environment), which Walter Cannon (1871\u20131945) later said was regulated to a steady state in homeostasis. In the 20th century, the physiologists Knut Schmidt-Nielsen and George Bartholomew extended their studies to comparative physiology and ecophysiology. Most recently, evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1855 by Frederick Miller and was acquired by Molson Coors in 2016. Molson Coors continues to operate the Miller Brewery at the site of the original Miller Brewing Company complex in Milwaukee. Miller has produced several prominent beer brands, including Miller Lite, Miller High Life, and Milwaukee's Best.\nHistory.\nMiller Brewing Company was founded in Milwaukee in 1855 by Frederick Miller after his emigration from Hohenzollern, Germany, in 1854 with a unique brewer's yeast. Initially, he purchased the small Plank Road Brewery for $2,300 ($82,280 in 2024). The brewery's location in what is now the Miller Valley provided easy access to raw materials produced on nearby farms. In 1855, Miller changed its name to Miller Brewing Company, Inc. The enterprise remained in the family until 1966.\nThe company was one of six breweries affected by the 1953 Milwaukee brewery strike. In 1961, Miller purchased the smallest of the \"Big Five\" Milwaukee brewers, A. Gettelman Brewing Company. In 1966, the conglomerate W. R. Grace and Company bought Miller from Lorraine John Mulberger (Frederick Miller's granddaughter, who objected to alcohol) and her family. In 1969, Philip Morris (now Altria) bought Miller from W. R. Grace for $130\u00a0million, outbidding PepsiCo. In 1999, Miller acquired the Hamm's brand from Pabst.\nIn 2002, South African Breweries bought Miller from Philip Morris for $3.6\u00a0billion worth of stock and $2\u00a0billion in debt to form SABMiller, with Philip Morris retaining a 36% ownership share and 24.99% voting rights. In 2006, SABMiller purchased the Sparks and Steel Reserve brands from McKenzie River Corporation for $215\u00a0million. Miller had been producing both brands prior to the purchase.\nOn July 1, 2008, SABMiller formed MillerCoors, a joint venture with rival Molson Coors, to consolidate the production and distribution of its products in the United States, with each parent company's corporate operations and international operations to remain separate and independent of the joint venture. SABMiller owned 58% of the unit, which operated in the United States but not in Canada, where Molson Coors is strongest, but the companies had equal voting power.\nIn September 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced it had reached a full agreement to acquire SABMiller for $107\u00a0billion. As part of the agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, SABMiller divested itself of the Miller brands in the U.S. by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. Consequently, on October 11, 2016, SABMiller in the U.S. sold its interests in MillerCoors to Molson Coors for around US $12\u00a0billion. Molson Coors gained full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside the US, and retained the rights within the U.S. (including Puerto Rico).\nBrands.\nBrands with the Miller name, or historically sold by Miller Brewing Company, include:\nSponsorships.\nAt the 1978 United States Grand Prix, 1978 Canadian Grand Prix and 1979 Long Beach Grand Prix, the McLaren Formula One team raced a special L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u livery and entered the Grands Prix as L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u Team McLaren to promote the brand in the region. At the time, Miller Brewing Company was owned by Phillip Morris (who was the title sponsor of McLaren) and had secured the license to produce L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u in its United States breweries.\nMiller has been a large motorsport sponsor since the 1980s. In the CART World Series, the company has sponsored drivers such as Al Unser (1984), Danny Sullivan (1985\u20131989, 1991), Roberto Guerrero (1990), Bobby Rahal (1992\u20131998) and Kenny Br\u00e4ck (2003). It also sponsored the Miller 200 race at Mid-Ohio. \nIn 1997, Miller, under its Miller Lite brand, sponsored a car in the Indy Racing League, specifically for the Indianapolis 500. The car was driven by Arie Luyendyk. This sponsorship was significant as Luyendyk won the 1997 Indianapolis 500.\nIn the NASCAR Cup Series, Miller has sponsored Bobby Allison from 1983 to 1988, Dick Trickle in 1989, Rusty Wallace from 1990 to 2005, Kurt Busch from 2006 to 2010, and Brad Keselowski from 2011 to 2020.

{"id": "54180", "revid": "1236032609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54180", "title": "LocalTalk", "text": "Implementation of AppleTalk networking\nLocalTalk is a particular implementation of the physical layer of the AppleTalk networking system from Apple Computer. \nLocalTalk specifies a system of shielded twisted pair cabling, plugged into self-terminating transceivers, running at a rate of 230.4\u00a0kbit/s. CSMA/CA was implemented as a random multiple access method.\nNetworking was envisioned in the Macintosh during planning, so the Mac was given expensive RS-422 capable serial ports, first on a nine-pin D-connector, then on a mini-DIN-8 connector. The ports were driven by the Zilog SCC, which could serve as either a standard UART or handle the much more complicated HDLC protocol, which was a packet oriented protocol that incorporated addressing, bit-stuffing, and packet checksumming in hardware. Coupled together with the RS422 electrical connections, this provided a reasonably-high-speed data connection.\nThe 230.4\u00a0kbit/s bit rate is the highest in the series of standard serial bit rates (110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400) derived from the 3.6864\u00a0MHz clock after the customary divide-by-16. This clock frequency, 3.6864\u00a0MHz, was chosen (in part) to support the common asynchronous baud rates up to 38.4\u00a0kbit/s using the SCC's internal baud-rate generator. When the SCC's internal PLL was used to lock to the clock embedded in the LocalTalk serial data stream (using its FM0 encoding method) a divide-by-16 setting on the PLL yielded the fastest rate available, namely 230.4\u00a0kbit/s.\nOriginally released as \"AppleTalk Personal Network\", LocalTalk used shielded twisted-pair cable with three-pin mini-DIN connectors. Cables were daisy-chained from transceiver to transceiver. Each transceiver had two three-pin mini-DIN ports, and a \"pigtail\" cable to connect to the Mac's DE-9 serial connector. Later, when the Mac Plus introduced the eight-pin mini-DIN serial connector, transceivers were updated as well.\nA variation of LocalTalk called PhoneNET was introduced by Farallon Computing. It used standard unshielded side-by-side telephone wire, with six-position modular connectors (same as the popular RJ11 telephone connectors) connected to a PhoneNET transceiver, instead of the expensive, shielded, twisted-pair cable. In addition to being lower cost, PhoneNET-wired networks were more reliable due to the connections being more difficult to accidentally disconnect. In addition, because it used the \"outer\" pair of the modular connector, it could travel on many pre-existing phone cables and jacks where just the inner pair was in use for RJ11 telephone service. PhoneNET was also able to use an office's existing phone wire, allowing for entire floors of computers to be easily networked. Farallon introduced a 12-port hub, which made constructing star topology networks of up to 48 devices as easy as adding jacks at the workstations and some jumpers in the phone closet. These factors led to PhoneNET largely supplanting LocalTalk wiring in low-cost networking.\nThe useful life of PhoneNET was extended with the introduction of LocalTalk switching technology by Tribe Computer Works. Introduced in 1990, the Tribe LocalSwitch was a 16-port packet switch designed to speed up overloaded PhoneNET networks.\nThe widespread availability of Ethernet-based networking in the early 1990s led to the swift disappearance of both LocalTalk and PhoneNET. They remained in use for some time in low-cost applications and applications where Ethernet was not used. Macintosh Quadra and early models of Power Macintosh supported both 10BASE2 and 10BASE-T via the Apple Attachment Unit Interface (AAUI), and all other Ethernet media via an AAUI\u2013AUI adapter, while still supporting LocalTalk-based networking. For older Macintosh computers that did not have built-in Ethernet, a high-speed SCSI-to-Ethernet adapter was available, and was particularly popular on PowerBooks. This enabled all but the earliest Macintosh models to access a high-speed Ethernet network.\nWith the release of the iMac in 1998 the traditional Mac serial port\u2014and thus, the ability to use both LocalTalk and PhoneNET\u2014disappeared from new models of Macintosh. LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridges were introduced to allow legacy devices (especially printers) to function on newer networks. For very old Macintosh computers, LocalTalk remains the only option.\nDesign legacy.\nThe LocalTalk connector had the distinction of being the first to use Apple's unified AppleTalk Connector Family design, created by Brad Bissell of Frog Design using Rick Meadows' Apple Icon Family designs. LocalTalk connectors were first released in January 1985 to connect the LaserWriter printer initially with the Macintosh family of computers as an integral part of the newly announced Macintosh Office. However, well past the move to Ethernet, the connector's design continued to be used on all of Apple's peripherals and cable connectors as well as influencing the connectors used throughout the industry as a whole.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A runner who advances due to a passed ball is not credited with a stolen base unless he breaks for the base before the pitcher begins his delivery.\nHistory.\nA passed ball may be scored when a base runner reaches the next base on a bobble or missed catch by the catcher, or when the batter\u2013runner reaches first base on an uncaught strike three (\"see also\" Strikeout).\nA closely related statistic is the wild pitch. As with many baseball statistics, whether a pitch that gets away from a catcher is a passed ball or wild pitch is at the discretion of the official scorer. Typically, pitches that are deemed to be ordinarily catchable by the catcher, but are not, are ruled passed balls; pitches that get by the catcher that are thought to have required extraordinary effort by the catcher in order to stop them are wild pitches. If the pitch was so low as to touch the ground, or so high that the catcher has to rise out of his crouched position to get to it, or so wide that the catcher has to lunge for it, it is usually then considered a wild pitch and not a passed ball.\nA run scored due to a passed ball is not recorded as an earned run. However, a run scored due to a wild pitch is recorded as an earned run.\nPassed balls and wild pitches are considered to be part of the act of pitching rather than fielding. Thus they are kept as separate statistics and are not recorded as errors.\nThere tends to be a higher incidence of passed balls when a knuckleballer is pitching. The physics that make a knuckleball so difficult to hit make it similarly difficult to catch. While teams with a knuckleballer on their pitching staff often employ a special \"knuckleball catcher\" who is equipped with a knuckleball mitt, similar to a first baseman's glove, it is still extremely difficult to catch.\nRecords.\nThe MLB career record for passed balls allowed is 763 by Pop Snyder, while Rudy Kemmler set the single season record of 114 in 1883. The single season record in the modern era is 35, set by Geno Petralli in 1987. The record for passed balls in a single game, six, was set by Rube Vickers in 1902 and later tied by Petralli in 1987 and Jerry Goff in 1996. The record for passed balls in a single inning is four, and is jointly held by Petralli, Ray Katt, and Ryan Lavarnway, all three of whom were catching knuckleball pitchers (Charlie Hough, Hoyt Wilhelm, and Steven Wright, respectively).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a pointing breed that came from a cross between the standard poodle (pudel) and the English Pointer.\nAppearance.\nThe breed weighs between , stands at the shoulder, and comes in liver, chestnut, and occasionally black coats. The ideal coat is harsh, wiry, and dense. The dogs shed very little.\nHistory.\nIn 1881, a German breeder, Baron 'Hegewald' von Zedlitz, worked on producing his ideal tracking, pointing, and retrieving gun dog, suitable for work on both land and water. From seven poodles and 90 different pointers, he developed the Pudelpointer. The original sire was Tell, an English Pointer belonging to Kaiser Frederick III and the original dam was a German hunting pudel named Molly who was owned by Hegewald.\nThe goal was to produce a dog that was willing and easy to train, intelligent, and loved water and retrieving, like the poodle, and add to that a great desire to hunt, a strong pointing instinct, and an excellent nose, like in the English Pointer, as well as being an excellent companion in the home.\nThe Poodle breed had much stronger genes, and so many more Pointers were used to achieve the balanced hunting dog that was desired. A mix of 11 Pudels and 80 Pointers were used during the first 30 years to achieve the desired traits and results.\nThe breed was introduced to North America in 1956 by Bodo Winterhelt, who remained involved in maintaining the breed standard until his death in 2018. His Winterhelle Kennel was the foundation of the breed in North America. In 1977 Winterhelt founded the Pudelpointer Club of North America in Canada.\nIn Germany as well as North America, its performance standards are its most important trait. Before being approved for breeding, dogs and bitches must pass Hunt Test with minimum scores of their performance tests of its field, tracking, and water skills set by the various breed clubs. These clubs are the http:// in Germany and the following clubs in North America: http://, http:// and http://). The http:// also tests Pudelpointers and other breeds of versatile hunting dogs.\nThe Pudelpointer never became a popularized breed in the United States in part because breeders have actively avoided recognition by the American Kennel Club. Breeders believe that AKC recognition would place too much emphasis on form over function, possibly splitting the breed into a show breed and separate working class.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This drawing technique was popularized in the early 1920s, by Andr\u00e9 Masson and Hans Arp.\nOrigins.\nAutomatism has taken on many forms: the automatic writing and drawing initially (and still to this day) explored by the surrealists can be compared to similar or parallel phenomena, such as the non-idiomatic improvisation.\n\"Psychic automatism in its pure state\" was how Andr\u00e9 Breton defined Surrealism, and while the definition has proved capable of expansion, automatism remains of prime importance in the movement.\nEarly 20th-century Dadaists, such as Hans Arp, made some use of this method through chance operations. Surrealist artists, most notably Andr\u00e9 Masson, adapted to art the automatic writing method of Andr\u00e9 Breton and Philippe Soupault who composed with it \"Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques\" (The Magnetic Fields) in 1919. \"The Automatic Message\" (1933) was one of Breton's significant theoretical works about automatism. However, tradition has the Israel Salanter, who died in 1883, practiced automatic drawing by allowing his pen to scribble while giving lectures as means for insight into his subconscious [penimiut].\nAutomatic drawing and painting.\nAutomatic drawing (distinguished from drawn expression of mediums) is an artistic technique developed by surrealists in which the hand is allowed to move randomly across the paper. In applying chance and accident to mark-making, drawing is to a large extent freed of rational control. Hence the drawing produced may be attributed in part to the subconscious and may reveal something of the psyche, which would otherwise be repressed. Examples of automatic drawing were produced by mediums and practitioners of the psychic arts. It was thought by some Spiritualists to be a spirit control that was producing the drawing while physically taking control of the medium's body.\nAutomatic drawing was first written about by the English artist Austin Osman Spare who wrote a chapter, Automatic Drawing as a Means to Art, in his book, \"The Book of Pleasure\" (1913). Other artists who also practised automatic drawing were Hilma af Klint, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Joan Mir\u00f3, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Jean Arp, Andr\u00e9 Breton and Freddy Flores Knistoff.\nThe technique of automatic drawing was transferred to painting (as seen in Mir\u00f3's paintings which often started out as automatic drawings), and has been adapted to other media; there have even been automatic \"drawings\" in computer graphics. Pablo Picasso was also thought to have expressed a type of automatic drawing in his later work, and particularly in his etchings and lithographic suites of the 1960s.\nMost of the surrealists' automatic drawings were illusionistic, or more precisely, they developed into such drawings when representational forms seemed to suggest themselves. In the 1940s and 1950s the French Canadian group called Les Automatistes pursued creative work (chiefly painting) based on surrealist principles. They abandoned any trace of representation in their use of automatic drawing. This is perhaps a more pure form of automatic drawing since it can be almost entirely involuntary \u2013 to develop a representational form requires the conscious mind to take over the process of drawing, unless it is entirely accidental and thus incidental. These artists, led by Paul-\u00c9mile Borduas, sought to proclaim an entity of universal values and ethics proclaimed in their manifesto \"Refus Global\".\nAs alluded to above, surrealist artists often found that their use of \"automatic drawing\" was not entirely automatic; rather, it involved some form of conscious intervention to make the image or painting visually acceptable or comprehensible, \"...Masson admitted that his 'automatic' imagery involved a two-fold process of unconscious and conscious activity...\"\nSurautomatism.\nSome Romanian surrealists invented a number of surrealist techniques (such as cubomania, entoptic graphomania, and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface) that purported to take automatism to an absurd point, and the name given, \"surautomatism\", implies that the methods \"go beyond\" automatism, but this position is controversial.\nPaul-\u00c9mile Borduas.\nThe notion of automatism is also rooted in the artistic movement of the same name founded by Montreal artist Paul-\u00c9mile Borduas in 1942; himself influenced by the Dadaist movement as well as Andr\u00e9 Breton. He, as well as a dozen other artists from Quebec's artistic scene, very much under restrictive and authoritarian rule in that period, signed the \"Global Refusal\" manifesto, in which the artists called upon North American society (specifically in the culturally unique environment of Quebec), to take notice and act upon the societal evolution projected by these new cultural paradigms opened by the Automatist movement as well as other influences in the 1940s.\nContemporary techniques.\nThe computer, like the typewriter, can be used to produce automatic writing and automatic poetry. The practice of automatic drawing, originally performed with pencil or pen and paper, has also been adapted to mouse and monitor, and other automatic methods have also been either adapted from non-digital media, or invented specifically for the computer. For instance, filters have been automatically run in some bitmap editor programs such as Photoshop and GIMP, and computer-controlled brushes have been used by Roman Verostko to simulate automatism.\nGrandview \u2014 a software application created in 2011 for the Mac \u2014 displays one word at a time across the entire screen as a user types, facilitating automatic writing.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54195", "revid": "8155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54195", "title": "Stingray", "text": "Suborder of fishes\nStingrays are a group of sea rays, a type of cartilaginous fish. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays) and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).\nThere are about 220 known stingray species organized into 29 genera.\nStingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some species, such as the thorntail stingray (\"Dasyatis thetidis\"), are found in warmer temperate oceans and others, such as the deepwater stingray (\"Plesiobatis daviesi\"), are found in the deep ocean. The river stingrays and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray (\"Fontitrygon garouaensis\")) are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (inhabiting the next-to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays, are pelagic.\nStingray species are progressively becoming threatened or vulnerable to extinction, particularly as a consequence of unregulated fishing. As of 2013, 45 species have been listed as vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN. The status of some other species is poorly known, leading to their being listed as data deficient.\nEvolution.\nStingrays diverged from their closest relatives, the panrays, during the Late Jurassic period, and diversified over the course of the Cretaceous into the different extant families today. The earliest stingrays appear to have been benthic, with the ancestors of the eagle rays becoming pelagic during the early Late Cretaceous. \nFossils.\nPermineralized stingray teeth have been found in sedimentary deposits around the world as far back as the Early Cretaceous. The oldest known stingray taxon is \"Dasyatis\" \"speetonensis\" from the Hauterivian of England, whose teeth most closely resemble that of the extant sixgill stingray (\"Hexatrygon\"). Although stingray teeth are rare on sea bottoms compared to the similar shark teeth, scuba divers searching for the latter do encounter the teeth of stingrays. \nFull-body stingray fossils are very rare but are known from certain lagerst\u00e4tten that preserve soft-bodied animals. The extinct \"Cyclobatis\" of the Cretaceous of Lebanon is thought to be a skate that had convergently evolved a highly stingray-like body plan, although its exact taxonomic placement is still uncertain. True stingray fossils become more common in the Eocene, with the extinct freshwater stingrays \"Heliobatis\" and \"Asterotrygon\" known from the Green River Formation. A diversity of stingray fossils is known from the Eocene Monte Bolca formation from Italy, including the early stingaree \"Arechia\", as well as \"Dasyomyliobatis\", which is thought to represent a transitional form between stingrays and eagle rays, and the highly unusual \"Lessiniabatis\", which had an extremely short and slender tail with no sting.\nAnatomy.\nJaw and teeth.\nThe mouth of the stingray is located on the ventral side of the vertebrate. Stingrays exhibit hyostylic jaw suspension, which means that the mandibular arch is only suspended by an articulation with the hyomandibula. This type of suspensions allows for the upper jaw to have high mobility and protrude outward. The teeth are modified placoid scales that are regularly shed and replaced. In general, the teeth have a root implanted within the connective tissue and a visible portion of the tooth, is large and flat, allowing them to crush the bodies of hard shelled prey. Male stingrays display sexual dimorphism by developing cusps, or pointed ends, to some of their teeth. During mating season, some stingray species fully change their tooth morphology which then returns to baseline during non-mating seasons.\nSpiracles.\nSpiracles are small openings that allow some fish and amphibians to breathe. Stingray spiracles are openings just behind its eyes. The respiratory system of stingrays is complicated by having two separate ways to take in water to use the oxygen. Most of the time stingrays take in water using their mouth and then send the water through the gills for gas exchange. This is efficient, but the mouth cannot be used when hunting because the stingrays bury themselves in the ocean sediment and wait for prey to swim by. So the stingray switches to using its spiracles. With the spiracles, they can draw water free from sediment directly into their gills for gas exchange. These alternate ventilation organs are less efficient than the mouth, since spiracles are unable to pull the same volume of water. However, it is enough when the stingray is quietly waiting to ambush its prey.\nThe flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to effectively conceal themselves in their environments. Stingrays do this by agitating the sand and hiding beneath it. Because their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey after capture; instead, they use smell and electroreceptors (ampullae of Lorenzini) similar to those of sharks. Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tails visible. Coral reefs are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide.\nBehavior.\nReproduction.\nDuring the breeding season, males of various stingray species such as the round stingray (\"Urobatis halleri\"), may rely on their ampullae of Lorenzini to sense certain electrical signals given off by mature females before potential copulation. When a male is courting a female, he follows her closely, biting at her pectoral disc. He then places one of his two claspers into her valve.\nReproductive ray behaviors are associated with their behavioral endocrinology, for example, in species such as the atlantic stingray (\"Hypanus sabinus\"), social groups are formed first, then the sexes display complex courtship behaviors that end in pair copulation which is similar to the species \"Urobatis halleri.\" Furthermore, their mating period is one of the longest recorded in elasmobranch fish. Individuals are known to mate for seven months before the females ovulate in March. During this time, the male stingrays experience increased levels of androgen hormones which has been linked to its prolonged mating periods. The behavior expressed among males and females during specific parts of this period involves aggressive social interactions. Frequently, the males trail females with their snout near the female vent then proceed to bite the female on her fins and her body. Although this mating behavior is similar to the species \"Urobatis halleri\", differences can be seen in the particular actions of \"Hypanus sabinus\". Seasonal elevated levels of serum androgens coincide with the expressed aggressive behavior, which led to the proposal that androgen steroids start, indorse and maintain aggressive sexual behaviors in the male rays for this species which drives the prolonged mating season. Similarly, concise elevations of serum androgens in females has been connected to increased aggression and improvement in mate choice. When their androgen steroid levels are elevated, they are able to improve their mate choice by quickly fleeing from tenacious males when undergoing ovulation succeeding impregnation. This ability affects the paternity of their offspring by refusing less qualified mates.\nStingrays are ovoviviparous, bearing live young in \"litters\" of five to thirteen. During this period, the female's behavior transitions to support of her future offspring. Females hold the embryos in the womb without a placenta. Instead, the embryos absorb nutrients from a yolk sac and after the sac is depleted, the mother provides uterine \"milk\". After birth, the offspring generally disassociate from the mother and swim away, having been born with the instinctual abilities to protect and feed themselves. In a very small number of species, like the giant freshwater stingray (\"Urogymnus polylepis\"), the mother \"cares\" for her young by having them swim with her until they are one-third of her size.\nAt the Sea Life London Aquarium, two female stingrays delivered seven baby stingrays, although the mothers have not been near a male for two years. This suggests some species of rays can store sperm then give birth when they deem conditions to be suitable.\nLocomotion.\nThe stingray uses its paired pectoral fins for moving around. This is in contrast to sharks and most other fish, which get most of their swimming power from a single caudal (tail) fin. Stingray pectoral fin locomotion can be divided into two categories, undulatory and oscillatory. Stingrays that use undulatory locomotion have shorter thicker fins for slower motile movements in benthic areas. Longer thinner pectoral fins make for faster speeds in oscillation mobility in pelagic zones. Visually distinguishable oscillation has less than one wave going, opposed to undulation having more than one wave at all times.\nFeeding behavior and diet.\nStingrays use a wide range of feeding strategies. Some have specialized jaws that allow them to crush hard mollusk shells, whereas others use external mouth structures called cephalic lobes to guide plankton into their oral cavity. Benthic stingrays (those that reside on the sea floor) are ambush hunters. They wait until prey comes near, then use a strategy called \"tenting\". With pectoral fins pressed against the substrate, the ray will raise its head, generating a suction force that pulls the prey underneath the body. This form of whole-body suction is analogous to the buccal suction feeding performed by ray-finned fish. Stingrays exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns on their dorsal surface to help them camouflage with the sandy bottom. Some stingrays can even change color over the course of several days to adjust to new habitats. Since their mouths are on the underside of their bodies, they catch their prey, then crush and eat with their powerful jaws. Like its shark relatives, the stingray is outfitted with electrical sensors called ampullae of Lorenzini. Located around the stingray's mouth, these organs sense the natural electrical charges of potential prey. Many rays have jaw teeth to enable them to crush mollusks such as clams, oysters and mussels.\nMost stingrays feed primarily on mollusks, crustaceans and, occasionally, on small fish. Freshwater stingrays in the Amazon feed on insects and break down their tough exoskeletons with mammal-like chewing motions. Large pelagic rays like the manta use ram feeding to consume vast quantities of plankton and have been seen swimming in acrobatic patterns through plankton patches.\nStingray injuries.\nStingrays are not usually aggressive and ordinarily attack humans only when provoked, such as when they are accidentally stepped on. Stingrays can have one, two or three blades. Contact with the spinal blade or blades causes local trauma (from the cut itself), pain, swelling, muscle cramps from the venom and, later, may result in infection from bacteria or fungi. The injury is very painful, but rarely life-threatening unless the stinger pierces a vital area. The blade is often deeply barbed and usually breaks off in the wound. Surgery may be required to remove the fragments.\nFatal stings are very rare. The death of Steve Irwin in 2006 was only the second recorded in Australian waters since 1945. The stinger penetrated his thoracic wall and pierced his heart, causing massive trauma and bleeding.\nVenom.\nThe venom of the stingray has been relatively unstudied due to the mixture of venomous tissue secretions cells and mucous membrane cell products that occurs upon secretion from the spinal blade. The spine is covered with the epidermal skin layer. During secretion, the venom penetrates the epidermis and mixes with the mucus to release the venom on its victim. Typically, other venomous organisms create and store their venom in a gland. The stingray is notable in that it stores its venom within tissue cells. The toxins that have been confirmed to be within the venom are cystatins, peroxiredoxin and galectin. Galectin induces cell death in its victims and cystatins inhibit defense enzymes. In humans, these toxins lead to increased blood flow in the superficial capillaries and cell death. Despite the number of cells and toxins that are within the stingray, there is little relative energy required to produce and store the venom.\nThe venom is produced and stored in the secretory cells of the vertebral column at the mid-distal region. These secretory cells are housed within the ventrolateral grooves of the spine. The cells of both marine and freshwater stingrays are round and contain a great amount of granule-filled cytoplasm. The stinging cells of marine stingrays are located only within these lateral grooves of the stinger. The stinging cells of freshwater stingray branch out beyond the lateral grooves to cover a larger surface area along the entire blade. Due to this large area and an increased number of proteins within the cells, the venom of freshwater stingrays has a greater toxicity than that of marine stingrays.\nHuman use.\nAs food.\nRays are edible, and may be caught as food using fishing lines or spears. Stingray recipes can be found in many coastal areas worldwide. For example, in Malaysia and Singapore, stingray is commonly grilled over charcoal, then served with spicy \"sambal\" sauce. In Goa, and other Indian states, it is sometimes used as part of spicy curries. Generally, the most prized parts of the stingray are the wings, the \"cheek\" (the area surrounding the eyes), and the liver. The rest of the ray is considered too rubbery to have any culinary uses.\nEcotourism.\nStingrays are usually very docile and curious, their usual reaction being to flee any disturbance, but they sometimes brush their fins past any new object they encounter. Nevertheless, certain larger species may be more aggressive and should be approached with caution, as the stingray's defensive reflex (use of its venomous stinger) may result in serious injury or death.\nOther uses.\nThe skin of the ray is used as an under layer for the cord or leather wrap (known as \"samegawa\" in Japanese) on Japanese swords due to its hard, rough texture that keeps the braided wrap from sliding on the handle during use.\nSeveral ethnological sections in museums, such as the British Museum, display arrowheads and spearheads made of stingray stingers, used in Micronesia and elsewhere. Henry de Monfreid stated in his books that before World War II, in the Horn of Africa, whips were made from the tails of big stingrays and these devices inflicted cruel cuts, so in Aden, the British forbade their use on women and slaves. In former Spanish colonies, a stingray is called (\"whip ray\").\nSome stingray species are commonly seen in public aquarium exhibits and more recently in home aquaria.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an anionic surfactant used in many cleaning and hygiene products. This compound is the sodium salt of the 12-carbon organosulfate. Its hydrocarbon tail combined with a polar \"headgroup\" give the compound amphiphilic properties that make it useful as a detergent. SDS is also component of mixtures produced from inexpensive coconut and palm oils. SDS is a common component of many domestic cleaning, personal hygiene and cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food products, as well as of industrial and commercial cleaning and product formulations.\nPhysicochemical properties.\nThe critical micelle concentration (CMC) in water at 25\u00a0\u00b0C is 8.2 mM, and the aggregation number at this concentration is usually considered to be about 62. The micelle ionization fraction (\u03b1) is around 0.3 (or 30%).\nApplications.\nCleaning and hygiene.\nSDS is mainly used in detergents for laundry with many cleaning applications. It is a highly effective surfactant and is used in any task requiring the removal of oily stains and residues. For example, it is found in higher concentrations with industrial products including engine degreasers, floor cleaners, and car exterior cleaners.\nIt is a component in hand soap, toothpastes, shampoos, shaving creams, and bubble bath formulations, for its ability to create a foam (lather), for its surfactant properties, and in part for its thickening effect.\nFood additive.\nSodium dodecyl sulfate, appearing as its synonym \"sodium lauryl sulfate\" (SLS), is considered a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredient for food use according to the USFDA (21 CFR 172.822). It is used as an emulsifying agent and whipping aid. As an emulsifier in or with egg whites the United States Code of Federal Regulations require that it must not exceed 1,000 parts per million (0.1%) in egg white solids or 125 parts per million (0.0125%) in frozen or liquid egg whites and as a whipping agent for the preparation of marshmallows it must not exceed 0.5% of the weight of gelatine. SLS is reported to temporarily diminish perception of sweetness.\nLaboratory applications.\nSDS is used in cleaning procedures, and is commonly used as a component for lysing cells during RNA extraction or DNA extraction, inhibiting the activity of nucleases, enzymes that can degrade DNA, protecting the integrity of the isolated genetic material, and for denaturing proteins in preparation for electrophoresis in the SDS-PAGE technique.\nIn the case of SDS-PAGE, the compound works by disrupting non-covalent bonds in the proteins, and so denaturing them, i.e. causing the protein molecules to lose their native conformations and shapes. By binding to proteins at a ratio of one SDS molecule per 2 amino acid residues, the negatively charged detergent provides all proteins with a similar net negative charge and therefore a similar charge-to-mass ratio. In this way, the difference in mobility of the polypeptide chains in the gel can be attributed solely to their length as opposed to both their native charge and shape. This separation based on the size of the polypeptide chain simplifies the analysis of protein molecules. \nPharmaceutical applications.\nSodium lauryl sulfate is a widely used in the pharmaceutical field as an ionic solubilizer and emulsifier that is suitable for applications in liquid dispersions, solutions, emulsions and micro emulsions, tablets, foams and semi-solids such as creams, lotions and gels. Additionally, SLS aids in tablet wettability, as well as lubrication during manufacturing. Brand names of pharma-grade SLS include Kolliphor SLS and Kolliphor SLS Fine.\nMiscellaneous applications.\nSLS is used in an improved technique for preparing brain tissues for study by optical microscopy. The technique, which has been branded as CLARITY, was the work of Karl Deisseroth and coworkers at Stanford University, and involves infusion of the organ with an acrylamide solution to bind the macromolecules of the organ (proteins, nucleic acids, etc.), followed by thermal polymerization to form a \"brain\u2013hydrogel\" (a mesh interspersed throughout the tissue to fix the macromolecules and other structures in space), and then by lipid removal using SDS to eliminate light scattering with minimal protein loss, rendering the tissue quasi-transparent.\nAlong with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and Triton X-100, aqueous solutions of SDS are popular for dispersing or suspending nanotubes, such as carbon nanotubes.\nOther uses.\nSLS has been proposed as a potentially effective topical microbicide, for intravaginal use, to inhibit and possibly prevent infection by various enveloped and non-enveloped viruses such as the herpes simplex viruses, HIV, and the Semliki Forest virus.\nLiquid membranes formed from SDS in water have been demonstrated to work as unusual particle separators. The device acts as a reverse filter, allowing large particles to pass while capturing smaller particles.\nProduction.\nDodecyl alcohol is sulfated using sulfur trioxide. The reaction proceeds by initial formation of the pyrosulfate:\n\nSeveral million tons are produced annually.\nSDS can also be synthesized by treating lauryl alcohol with chlorosulfuric acid.\nThe resulting half ester of sulfuric acid is then neutralized with alkali.\nLauryl alcohol can be used in pure form or as a mixtures of fatty alcohols. When produced from these sources, \"SDS\" products are a mixture of various sodium alkyl sulfates with SDS being the main component. For instance, SDS is a component, along with other chain-length amphiphiles, when produced from coconut oil, and is known as sodium coco sulfate (SCS). SDS is available commercially in powder, pellet, and other forms (each differing in rates of dissolution), as well as in aqueous solutions of varying concentrations.\nSafety.\nSDS is not carcinogenic in low concentrations according to some studies. Like all detergents, sodium lauryl sulfate removes oils from the skin, and can cause skin and eye irritation. It has been shown to irritate the skin of the face, with prolonged and constant exposure (more than an hour) in young adults. SDS may worsen skin problems in individuals with chronic skin hypersensitivity, with some people being affected more than others.\nOral concerns.\nSDS is a common ingredient in toothpastes due to its low cost, its lack of impact on taste, and its desirable action as a foaming agent.\nVSCs.\nSDS may reduce the amount of bad breath-causing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in the mouth. A series of small crossover studies (25\u201334 patients) have supported the efficacy of SLS in the reduction of VSCs, and its related positive impact on breath malodor, although these studies have been generally noted to reflect technical challenges in the control of study design variables.\nDry mouth.\nPrimary sources from the group of Irma Rantanen at University of Turku, Finland claim that SLS-containing pastes cause more dry mouth (xerostomia) than their proposed alternative. However, a 2011 Cochrane review of these studies, and of the more general area, concludes that there \"is no strong evidence... that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth.\"\nMouth ulceration.\nA safety concern has been raised on the basis of several studies regarding the effect of toothpaste SDS on aphthous ulcers (more specifically, mouth ulcers or \"canker sores\"), commonly referred to as canker or white sores. According to the NHS and Alessandro Villa of the Miami Cancer Institute, SLS is a cause for concern for mouth ulcers. As Lippert notes, of 2013, \"very few... marketed toothpastes contain a surfactant other than SLS [SDS],\" and leading manufacturers continue to formulate their produce with SDS. According to Allesandro Villa of the Miami Cancer Institute, one theory is that SLS disrupts the protective layer of mucus covering the mouth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54204", "revid": "50052465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54204", "title": "Philip II of Macedon", "text": "King of Macedon from 359 to 336 BC\nPhilip II of Macedon (; 382 BC \u2013 October 336\u00a0BC) was the king (\"basileus\") of Macedon from 359 BC until his death in 336 BC. \nThe rise of Macedon, from a kingdom initially at the periphery of classical Greek affairs, to a power that came to dominate Ancient Greece in the span of less than 25 years, was largely thanks to the character and policies of Philip. He was the father of Alexander the Great and a member of the ruling Argead dynasty that founded the kingdom of the Macedonians.\nPhilip achieved to dominate Greece during his reign by the reformation of the Macedonian army, including the establishment of the Macedonian phalanx, the use of combined arms tactics and his extensive use of siege engines and artillery, as well as by the use of effective diplomacy and marriage alliances. After defeating the Greek city-states of Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, Philip II led the effort to establish a federation of Greek states known as the Hellenic League, with him as the elected hegemon and commander-in-chief of Greece for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire. However, his assassination by a royal bodyguard, Pausanias of Orestis, led to the immediate succession of his son Alexander, who would go on to invade the Achaemenid Empire in his father's stead.\nEarly life.\nPhilip was born in either 383 or 382 BC, and was the youngest son of King Amyntas III and Eurydice of Lynkestis. He had two older brothers, Alexander II and Perdiccas III, as well as a sister named Eurynoe. Amyntas later married another woman, Gygaea, with whom he had three sons, Philip's half-brothers Archelaus, Arrhidaeus, and Menelaus.\nAfter the assassination of Alexander II, Philip was sent as a hostage to Illyria by Ptolemy of Aloros. Philip was later held in Thebes (c.\u2009368\u2013365 BC), which at the time was the leading city of Greece. While in Thebes, Philip received a military and diplomatic education from Epaminondas, and lived with Pammenes, who was an enthusiastic advocate of the Sacred Band of Thebes.\nIn 364 BC, Philip returned to Macedon. In 359 BC, perhaps in May, Philip's other brother, King Perdiccas III, died in battle against the Illyrians. Before leaving, Perdiccas had appointed Philip as regent for his infant son Amyntas IV, but Philip succeeded in taking the kingdom for himself.\nPhilip's military skills and expansionist vision of Macedonia brought him early success. He first had to remedy the woes over Macedonian territory faced by his throne's government. This was a predicament that had greatly worsened through Macedonia's defeat by the Illyrians, a struggle in which King Perdiccas himself had died. The Paeonians and the Thracians had sacked and invaded the eastern regions of Macedonia, while the Athenians had landed at Methoni on the coast with a contingent under the Macedonian pretender Argaeus II.\nMilitary career.\nImprovements to the army.\nPhilip pushed back the Paeonians and Thracians promising tributes, and defeated the 3,000 Athenian hoplites (359 BC). Momentarily free from his opponents, he concentrated on strengthening his internal position and, above all, his army. Philip II made many notable contributions to the Macedonian army. The cavalry, which were the primary source of the army's strength, went from a force of 600 to 4000 from the time of the battles with the Illyrians to 334 BC. The discipline and training of the soldiers increased as well, and the Macedonian soldiers under Philip were provided with the possibility of promotion through the ranks and rewards and bonus wages for exceptional service. In addition to these changes, Philip created the Macedonian phalanx, an infantry formation that consisted of soldiers all armed with a \"sarissa.\" Philip is credited for adding the \"sarissa\" to the Macedonian army, where it soon was the common weapon used by most soldiers.\nEarly military career.\nThe following year (358 BC), Philip heard that the Paeonian king, Agis, had died. Taking advantage of their political disarray and transition of power, Philip marched his army into Paeonia, where he defeated the Paeonians. He then compelled the tribe to swear allegiance to Macedon.\nPhilip had married Audata, daughter or granddaughter of the Illyrian king Bardylis. However, this marriage did not prevent him from marching against the Illyrians in 358 BC and defeating them at the battle of Erigon Valley, in which some 7,000 Illyrians died (357 BC). By this move, Philip established his authority inland as far as Lake Ohrid and earned the favour of the Epirotes.\nAfter securing the western and southern borders of Macedon, Philip went on to besiege Amphipolis in 357 BC. The Athenians had been unable to conquer Amphipolis, which commanded the gold mines of Mount Pangaion, so Philip reached an agreement with Athens to lease the city to them after his conquest, in exchange for Pydna (which was lost by Macedon in 363 BC). However, after conquering Amphipolis, Philip captured Pydna for himself and kept both cities (357 BC). Athens soon declared war against him, and as a result, Philip allied Macedon with the Chalcidian League of Olynthus. He subsequently conquered Potidaea, this time keeping his word and ceding it to the League in 356 BC.\nIn 357 BC, Philip married the Epirote princess Olympias, who was the daughter of the king of the Molossians. Alexander was born in 356 BC, the same year as Philip's racehorse won at the Olympic Games.\nDuring 356 BC, Philip conquered the town of Crenides and changed its name to Philippi. He then established a powerful garrison there to control its mines, which yielded much of the gold he later used for his campaigns. In the meantime, his general Parmenion defeated the Illyrians again.\nIn 355\u2013354 BC, he besieged Methone, the last city on the Thermaic Gulf controlled by Athens. During the siege, Philip was injured in his right eye, which was later removed surgically. Despite the arrival of two Athenian fleets, the city fell in 354 BC. Philip also attacked Abdera and Maronea, on the Thracian coast (354\u2013353 BC).\nThird Sacred War.\nPhilip's involvement in the Third Sacred War (356\u2013346 BC) began in 354 BC. At the request of the Thessalian League, Philip and his army traveled to Thessaly in order to capture Pagasae, resulting in an alliance with Thebes. A year later in 353 BC, Philip was once again asked to assist in battle, but this time against the tyrant Lycophron who was supported by Onomarchus. Philip and his forces invaded Thessaly, defeating 7,000 Phocians and forcing Phayllus, the brother of Onomarchus, to leave.\nThat same year, Onomarchus and his army defeated Philip in two succeeding battles. Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer, this time with an army of 20,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, and the additional support of the Thessalian League's forces. At the Battle of Crocus Field, 6,000 Phocians fell and 3,000 were taken as prisoners and later drowned. This battle earned Philip immense prestige as well as the free acquisition of Pherae. He was made the leader (\"archon\") of the Thessalian League and was able to claim Magnesia and Perrhaebia, which expanded his territory to Pagasae. Philip did not attempt to advance into Central Greece because the Athenians, unable to arrive in time to defend Pagasae, had occupied Thermopylae.\nThere were no hostilities with Athens yet, but Athens was threatened by the Macedonians. From 352 to 346 BC, Philip did not again travel south. He was active in completing the subjugation of the Balkan hill-country to the west and north, and in reducing the Greek cities of the coast as far as the Hebrus. To the chief of these coastal cities, Olynthus, Philip continued to profess friendship until its neighboring cities were in his hands.\nIn 348 BC, Philip started the siege of Olynthus, which, apart from its strategic position, housed his half-brothers, Arrhidaeus and Menelaus, pretenders to the Macedonian throne. Olynthus had at first allied itself with Philip, but later shifted its allegiance to Athens. The latter, however, did nothing to help the city because its expeditions were held back by a revolt in Euboea. The Macedonian king took Olynthus in 348 BC and razed the city to the ground. The same fate was inflicted on other cities of the Chalcidian peninsula, resulting in the Chalcidian League dissolving.\nMacedon and the regions adjoining it having now been securely consolidated, Philip celebrated his Olympic Games at Dium. In 347 BC, Philip advanced to the conquest of the eastern districts about Hebrus, and compelled the submission of the Thracian prince Cersobleptes. In 346 BC, he intervened effectively in the war between Thebes and the Phocians, but his wars with Athens continued intermittently. However, Athens had made overtures for peace, and when Philip again moved south, peace was sworn in Thessaly.\nLater campaigns (346\u2013336 BC).\nWith key Greek city-states in submission, Philip II turned to Sparta, warning them \"If I invade Laconia, I shall turn you out.\" The Spartans' laconic reply was one word: \"If.\" Philip proceeded to invade Laconia, devastate much of it and eject the Spartans from various parts.\nIn 345 BC, Philip conducted a hard-fought campaign against the Ardiaioi (Ardiaei), under their king Pleuratus I, during which Philip was seriously wounded in the lower right leg by an Ardian soldier.\nIn 342 BC, Philip led a military expedition north against the Scythians, conquering the Thracian fortified settlement Eumolpia to give it his name, \"Philippopolis\" (modern Plovdiv).\nIn 340 BC, Philip started the siege of Perinthus, and in 339 BC, began another siege against the city of Byzantium. As both sieges failed, Philip's influence over Greece was compromised. He successfully reasserted his authority in the Aegean by defeating an alliance of Thebans and Athenians at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338\u00a0BC, and in the same year, destroyed Amfissa because the residents had illegally cultivated part of the Crisaian plain which belonged to Delphi. These decisive victories led to Philip being recognized as the military leader of the League of Corinth, a Greek confederation allied against the Persian Empire, in 338/7\u00a0BC. Members of the league agreed never to wage war against each other, unless it was to suppress revolution.\nAsian campaign (336 BC).\nPhilip II was involved quite early against the Achaemenid Empire. From around 352 BC, he supported several Persian opponents to Artaxerxes III, such as Artabazos II, Amminapes or a Persian nobleman named Sisines, by receiving them for several years as exiles at the Macedonian court. This gave him a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of his innovations in the management of the Macedonian state. Alexander was also acquainted with these Persian exiles during his youth.\nIn 336 BC, Philip II sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Asia Minor to make preparations for an invasion to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule. At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been assassinated and had been succeeded as king by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip's death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Achaemenids under the command of the mercenary Memnon of Rhodes.\nMarriages and family.\nThe kings of Macedon practiced polygamy. Philip II had seven wives throughout his life, all members of royalty from foreign dynasties, and all of which were considered queens, making their children royalty as well. The dates of Philip's multiple marriages and the names of some of his wives are contested. Below is the order of marriages:\nAssassination.\nKing Philip was assassinated in October 336 BC (perhaps 25 October) at Aigai, the ancient capital of the kingdom of Macedon. Philip and his royal court were gathered in order to celebrate the marriage of Alexander I of Epirus and Cleopatra of Macedon, Philip's daughter by his fourth wife Olympias. While the king was entering into the town's theatre, he was unprotected in order to appear approachable to the Greek diplomats and dignitaries who were present at that time. Philip was suddenly approached by Pausanias of Orestis, one of his seven bodyguards, who was also \u2013 according to Diodorus \u2013 his lover, and was stabbed in his ribs. After Philip was killed, the assassin immediately tried to escape and reach his getaway associates, who were waiting for him with horses at the entrance to Aegae. The assassin was pursued by three of Philip's other bodyguards, and during the chase, his horse tripped on a vine. He was subsequently stabbed to death by the bodyguards.\nThe three sons of Aeropus of Lyncestis, a commander disgraced by Philip, were also suspected of taking part in the plot as accomplices of Pausanias. Two brothers, Arrhabaeus and Heromenes, were put to death, while the third son, Alexander of Lyncestis, was pardoned.\nThe reasons for the assassination are difficult to ascertain. There was controversy even among ancient historians; the only known surviving contemporary account is that of Aristotle, who states simply that Philip was killed because Pausanias had been offended by Attalus (Philip's uncle-in-law) and his friends. Attalus was the uncle of Philip's wife Cleopatra (renamed Eurydice upon marriage).\nCleitarchus' analysis.\nFifty years later, the historian Cleitarchus expanded and embellished the story. Centuries afterwards, this version was propagated by Diodorus Siculus and other historians who relied on Cleitarchus. According to the sixteenth book of Diodorus' history, Pausanias of Orestis had been a lover of Philip, but became jealous when Philip turned his attention to a younger man, also called Pausanias. The elder Pausanias' taunting of the new lover caused the younger Pausanias to throw away his life in battle, which turned his friend Attalus against the elder Pausanias. Attalus took his revenge by getting Pausanias of Orestis drunk at a public dinner and then raping him.\nWhen Pausanias complained to Philip, the king felt unable to chastise Attalus, as he was about to send him to Asia with Parmenion to establish a bridgehead for an invasion he was planning. Also, Philip had recently married Attalus' niece, Cleopatra Eurydice. Rather than offend Attalus, Philip tried to mollify Pausanias by elevating him within his personal bodyguard. Pausanias then seems to have redirected his desire for revenge towards the man who had failed to avenge his damaged honour, and accordingly to plan to kill Philip. Some time after the alleged rape, while Attalus was away in Asia fighting the Persians, he put his plan into action.\nJustin's analysis.\nOther historians (e.g., Justin 9.7) suggested that Alexander and/or his mother Olympias were at least privy to the intrigue, if not themselves instigators. Olympias seems to have been anything but discreet in manifesting her gratitude to Pausanias, according to Justin's report: He writes that the same night of her return from exile, she placed a crown on the assassin's corpse, and later erected a tumulus over his grave and ordered that annual sacrifices be made to the memory of Pausanias.\nModern analysis.\nSome modern historians have claimed that none of the accounts are probable: They say that in the case of Pausanias, the purported motive for the crime hardly seems adequate. Furthermore they claim that implicating Alexander and Olympias in the plot seems specious, to act as they did would have required them to act with an improbable degree of brazen effrontery in the face of a military whose members were personally loyal to Philip. What seems to have been recorded, rather, are simply suspicions that were naturally directed towards the chief beneficiaries of the assassination; however, their actions in response to the murder are hardly evidence of their guilt with respect to the crime itself, regardless of how sympathetic they might have seemed afterward.\nScholar Daniel Ogden has noted that if there was a sexual side to the murder, \"then it can be contextualized in this regard against known homosexual relationships in and around the Macedonian court\" and that according to Aristotle, the regicide of Archelaus I of Macedon was by his former \"eromenoi\", Crateuas and Hellenocrates of Larissa.\nWhatever the actual background to the assassination, it may have had an enormous effect on later world events, far beyond what any conspirators could have predicted. As asserted by some modern historians, had the older and more settled Philip been the one in charge of the war against Persia, he might have been content to make relatively moderate conquests, e.g., making Anatolia into a Macedonian province, and, unlike his son Alexander, not have wanted to push further into an overall conquest of Persia and further campaigns in India.\nTomb of Philip II at Aigai.\nIn 1977, Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos started excavating the Great Tumulus at Aigai near modern Vergina, the capital and burial site of the kings of Macedon, and found that two of the four tombs in the tumulus were undisturbed since antiquity. Moreover, these two, and particularly Tomb II, contained fabulous treasures and objects of great quality and sophistication.\nAlthough there was much debate for some years, as suspected at the time of the discovery Tomb II has been shown to be that of Philip II as indicated by many features, including the greaves, one of which was shaped consistently to fit a leg with a misaligned tibia (Philip II was recorded as having broken his tibia). Also, the remains of the skull show damage to the right eye caused by the penetration of an object (historically recorded to be an arrow).\nTwo scientists who studied some of the bones claimed in 2015 that Philip was buried in Tomb I, not Tomb II. On the basis of age, knee ankylosis, and a hole matching the penetrating wound and lameness suffered by Philip, the authors of the study identified the remains of Tomb I in Vergina as those of Philip II. Tomb II instead was identified in the study as that of King Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice II. The Greek Ministry of Culture replied that this claim was baseless, and that the archaeological evidence shows that the ankylotic knee belongs to another body which was thrown or put into Tomb I after this had been looted, and probably between 276/5 and 250 BC. Besides this, the theory that Tomb I belonged to Philip II had previously been shown to be false.\nMore recent research gives conclusive evidence that Tomb II contains the remains of Philip II and his Thracian wife, Meda. This would mean that the magnificent 5.6-metre wall painting above the entrance could be a hunting scene showing Philip and Alexander.\nLegacy.\nCult.\nThe heroon at Vergina in Macedonia (the ancient city of Aegae \u2013 \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03b1\u03af) is thought to have been dedicated to the worship of the family of Alexander the Great and may have housed the cult statue of Philip. It is probable that he was regarded as a hero or deified on his death. Though the Macedonians did not consider Philip a god, he did receive other forms of recognition from other Greeks, e.g. at Eresos (altar to Zeus Philippeios), Ephesos (his statue was placed in the temple of Artemis), and at Olympia, where the Philippeion was built.\nIsocrates once wrote to Philip that if he defeated Persia, there would be nothing left for him to do but to become a god, and Demades proposed that Philip be regarded as the thirteenth god; however, there is no clear evidence that Philip was raised to the divine status accorded his son Alexander.\nBiblical reference.\nPhilip is mentioned in the opening verse of the deutero-canonical First Book of Maccabees.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nPrimary sources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When diapers become wet or soiled, they require changing, generally by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change a diaper on a sufficiently regular basis can result in skin problems around the area covered by the diaper.\nDiapers are made of cloth or synthetic disposable materials. Cloth diapers are composed of layers of fabric such as cotton, hemp, bamboo, microfiber, or even plastic fibers such as PLA or PU, and can be washed and reused multiple times. Disposable diapers contain absorbent chemicals and are thrown away after use.\nDiapers are primarily worn by infants, toddlers who are not yet toilet trained, and by children who experience bedwetting. They are also used by adults under certain circumstances or with various conditions, such as incontinence. Adult users can include those of advanced age, patients bed-bound in a hospital, individuals with certain types of physical or mental disability, and people working in extreme conditions, such as astronauts. It is not uncommon for people to wear diapers under dry suits.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper\"\n\u2014One of the earliest known uses of the word in Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\".\nThe Middle English word \"diaper\" originally referred to a type of cloth rather than the use thereof; \"diaper\" was the term for a pattern of repeated, rhombic shapes, and later came to describe white cotton or linen fabric with this pattern. According to the Oxford Dictionary, it is a piece of soft cloth or other thick material that is folded around a baby's bottom and between its legs to absorb and hold its body waste. The first cloth diapers consisted of a specific type of soft tissue sheet, cut into geometric shapes. The pattern visible in linen and other types of woven fabric was called \"diaper\". This meaning of the word has been in use since the 1590s in England. By the 19th century, baby diapers were being sewn from linen, giving us the modern-day reading of the word \"diaper\". This usage stuck in the United States and Canada following the British colonization of North America, but in the United Kingdom, the word \"nappy\" took its place. Most sources believe \"nappy\" is a diminutive form of the word napkin, which itself was originally a diminutive.\nDevelopment.\nIn the 19th century, the modern diaper began to take shape and mothers in many parts of the world used cotton material, held in place with a fastening\u2014eventually the safety pin. Cloth diapers in the United States were first mass-produced in 1887 by Maria Allen. In the UK, diapers were made out of terry towelling, often with an inner lining made out of soft muslin.\nHere is an extract from 'The Modern Home Doctor' written by physicians in the UK in 1935.\nNice old, soft bits of good Turkish towelling, properly washed, will make the softest of diaper coverings, inside which specially absorbent napkins (diapers), see below at 1A, soft, light, and easily washed, are contained. These should rarely be soiled once regular habits have been inculcated, especially during the night period in which it is most important to prevent habit formation\n1A -(squares of butter muslin or Harrington's packed rolls of \"mutton cloth\" in packets, sold for polishing motor-cars, would do equally well and are very cheap and soft)\nWool pants, or, once available, rubber pants, were sometimes used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber pants were harmful because they thought the rubber acted as a poultice and damaged the skin of infants. The constant problem to be overcome was diaper rash, and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter in contact with the skin, were the two main causes of these problems.\nIn the 20th century, the disposable diaper was conceived. In the 1930s, Robinsons of Chesterfield had what were labeled \"Destroyable Babies Napkins\" listed in their catalogue for the wholesale market. In 1944, Hugo Drangel of the Swedish paper company Paulistr\u00f6m suggested a conceptual design which would entail the placing of sheets of paper tissue (cellulose wadding) inside the cloth diaper and rubber pants. However, cellulose wadding was rough against the skin and crumbled into balls when exposed to moisture.\nIn 1946, Marion Donovan used a shower curtain from her bathroom to create the \"Boater\", a diaper cover made from army surplus nylon parachute cloth. First sold in 1949 at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in New York City, patents were later issued in 1951 to Donovan, who later sold the rights to the waterproof diaper for $1 million. Donovan also designed a paper disposable diaper, but was unsuccessful in marketing it.\nIn 1947, Scottish housewife Valerie Hunter Gordon started developing and making Paddi, a 2-part system consisting of a disposable pad (made of cellulose wadding covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable plastic garment with press-studs/snaps. Initially, she used old parachutes for the garment. She applied for the patent in April 1948, and it was granted for the UK in October 1949. Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable diapers. In 1948, Gordon made over 400 Paddis herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table. Her husband had unsuccessfully approached several companies for help until he had a chance meeting with Sir Robert Robinson at a business dinner. In November 1949 Valerie Gordon signed a contract with Robinsons of Chesterfield who then went into full production. In 1950, Boots UK agreed to sell Paddi in all their branches. In 1951 the Paddi patent was granted for the US and worldwide. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Paddi from Robinsons. Paddi was very successful for many years until the advent of 'all in one' diapers.\nIn Sweden, Hugo Drangel's daughter Lil Karhola Wettergren, in 1956 elaborated her father's original idea, by adding a garment (again making a 2-part system like Paddi). However she met the same problem, with the purchasing managers, declaring they would never allow their wives to \"put paper on their children.\"\nAfter the Second World War, mothers increasingly wanted freedom from washing diapers so that they could work and travel, causing an increasing demand for disposable diapers.\nDuring the 1950s, companies such as Johnson and Johnson, Kendall, Parke-Davis, Playtex, and Molnlycke entered the disposable diaper market, and in 1956, Procter &amp; Gamble began researching disposable diapers. Victor Mills, along with his project group including William Dehaas (both men who worked for the company) invented what would be trademarked \"Pampers\". Although Pampers were conceptualized in 1959, the diapers themselves were not launched into the market until 1961. Pampers now accounts for more than $10 billion in annual revenue at Procter &amp; Gamble.\nAs Audrey Quinn recounts about the 1980s \"Diaper Wars\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble took Kimberly-Clark to court for patent infringement \u2014 one diaper patent at a time. And Kimberly-Clark responded in pretty much the same way.\u2014\u200a\nOver the next few decades, the disposable diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter &amp; Gamble's Pampers and Kimberly Clark's Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, such as the use of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter &amp; Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, \"The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant...as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.\" Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the \"hourglass shape\" so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.\nTypes.\nDisposable.\nThe first waterproof diaper cover was invented in 1946 by Marion Donovan, a professional-turned-housewife who wanted to ensure her children's clothing and bedding remained dry while they slept. She also invented the first paper diapers, but executives did not invest in this idea and it was consequently scrapped for over ten years until Procter &amp; Gamble used Donovan's design ideas to create Pampers. Another disposable diaper design was created by Valerie Hunter Gordon and patented in 1948.\nEver since their introduction product innovations include the use of superabsorbent polymers, resealable tapes, and elasticised waist bands. They are now much thinner and much more absorbent. The product range has more recently been extended into children's toilet training phase with the introduction of training pants and pant diapers, which are now undergarments.\nModern disposable baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction, which allows the transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of air-laid paper and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which will transfer wetness to the absorbent layer. Some popular brands of disposable baby diapers include layers of colorful film, which decorate the diapers with cute and kid-friendly designs, such as animals or characters from movies and TV shows, while other brands are simply plain white.\nOther common features of disposable diapers include one or more pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which has not been absorbed. Baby diapers now have wetness indicators, which consist of a moisture-sensitive ink printed in the front of the diaper as either a fading design or a color-changing line to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.\nA disposable diaper may also include an inner fabric designed to hold moisture against the skin for a brief period before absorption to alert a toilet training or bedwetting user that they have urinated. Some brands also have a quick absorption layer that pulls urine and soft stool away from the baby's skin, which is helpful to parents, especially after they have put their little one to bed so they don't have to be changed in the middle of the night. Most materials in the diaper are held together with the use of a hot-melt adhesive, which is applied in spray form or multi lines, an elastic hot melt is also used to help with pad integrity when the diaper is wet.\nSome disposable diapers include fragrance, lotions or essential oils in order to help mask the smell of a soiled diaper, or to protect the skin. Care of disposable diapers is minimal, and primarily consists of keeping them in a dry place before use, with proper disposal in a garbage receptacle upon soiling. Stool is supposed to be deposited in the toilet, but is generally put in the garbage with the rest of the diaper.\nBuying the right size of disposable diaper can be a little difficult for first time parents since different brands tend to have different sizing standards. Baby diaper sizes in general are based on the child's weight (kg or lbs) and not determined by age like in clothing or shoes.\nCommon disposable baby diaper brands in the US include Huggies, Pampers, and Luvs.\nCloth diaper.\nCloth diapers are reusable and can be made from natural fibers, synthetic materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial cotton which may be bleached white or left the fiber's natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include wool, bamboo, and unbleached hemp. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of microfiber toweling or an external waterproof layer of polyurethane laminate (PUL) may be used. Polyester fleece and faux suedecloth are often used inside cloth diapers as a \"stay-dry\" wicking liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.\nTraditionally, cloth diapers consisted of a folded square or rectangle of cloth, fastened with safety pins. Today, most cloth diapers are fastened with hook and loop tape (velcro) or snaps.\nModern cloth diapers come in a host of shapes, including preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, fitted diaper with covers and pocket or \"stuffable\" diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts. Many design features of modern cloth diapers have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, such as the use of the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material. Several cloth diaper brands use variations of Procter &amp; Gamble's original 1973 patent use of a double gusset in Pampers.\nCompostable diapers.\nCompostable diapers can be made from a range of different plant-based materials. Dyper makes their compostable diapers from bamboo fibers.\nUsage.\nChildren.\nBabies may have their diapers changed five or more times a day. Parents and other primary childcare givers often carry spare diapers and necessities for diaper changing in a specialized diaper bag. Diapering may possibly serve as a good bonding experience for parent and child. Children who wear diapers may experience skin irritation, commonly referred to as diaper rash, due to continual contact with fecal matter, as feces contains urease which catalyzes the conversion of the urea in urine to ammonia which can irritate the skin and can cause painful redness.\nThe age at which children should cease regularly wearing diapers and toilet training should begin is a subject of debate. Proponents of baby-led potty training and Elimination Communication argue that potty training can begin at birth with multiple benefits, with diapers only used as a backup. Keeping children in diapers beyond infancy can be controversial, with family psychologist John Rosemond claiming it is a \"slap to the intelligence of a human being that one would allow baby to continue soiling and wetting himself past age two.\" Pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton, however, believes that toilet training is the child's choice and has encouraged this view in various commercials for Pampers Size 6, a diaper for older children. Brazelton warns that enforced toilet training can cause serious long-term problems, and that it is the child's decision when to stop wearing diapers, not the parents'.\nChildren typically achieve daytime continence and stop wearing diapers during the day between the ages of two and four, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality. However, it is becoming increasingly common for children five to eleven years old to still wear diapers during the day, due to the child's opposition to toilet training, neglect, or unconventional parenting techniques. Other children may use diapers past toileting age due to disability, developmental disorders, or other medical reasons. This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. There has been recent pushback from teachers concerning a trend of more children in diapers. If a child soils themselves or their diaper, the teacher has to stop the lesson to focus on one child, which is distracting, and take away from the learning environment.\nMost children continue to wear diapers at night for a period of time following daytime continence. Older children may have problems with bladder control (primarily at night) and may wear diapers while sleeping to control bedwetting. Approximately 16% of children in the U.S. over the age of 5 wet the bed, 5% of children over 10 wet the bed, and 2% of children over 15 wet the bed. Some companies have diaper products specifically designed for bedwetting, traditionally hosting higher leak guards, and being pull on style similar to training pants. If bedwetting becomes a concern, the current recommendation is to consider forgoing the use of a diaper at night as they may prevent the child from wanting to get out of bed, although this is not a primary cause of bedwetting. This is particularly the case for children over the age of 8.\nTraining pants.\nManufacturers have designed \"training pants\" which bridge the gap between baby diapers and normal underwear during the toilet training process. These are similar to infant diapers in construction, but they can be pulled on like normal underwear. Training pants are available for children who experience enuresis.\nAdults.\nAlthough most commonly worn by and associated with babies and children, diapers are also worn by adults for a variety of reasons. In the medical community, they are usually referred to as \"adult absorbent briefs\" rather than diapers, which are associated with children and may have a negative connotation. The usage of adult diapers can be a source of embarrassment, and products are often marketed under euphemisms such as incontinence pads. The most common adult users of diapers are those with medical conditions which cause them to experience urinary incontinence (like bedwetting) or fecal incontinence, those who are bedridden or otherwise limited in their mobility, or for other emotional, physical, or mental needs. It is important that the user selects the proper type, size, and absorbency level for their needs as every diaper design is different.\nScuba divers utilize diapers for their dry suits for long exposures.\nThe Maximum Absorbency Garment is an adult-sized diaper with extra absorption material that NASA astronauts wear during liftoff, landing, and extra-vehicular activity (EVA). The NASA Maximum Absorbency Garment is however only designed to retain 2 liters, while the commercial brand by \"Tykables Diapers\" known as their \"Little Rawrs\" diaper line is ISO rated to retain up to 7.5 liters of urine.\nAnimals.\nDiapers and diaperlike products are sometimes used on pets, laboratory animals, or working animals. This is often due to the animal not being housebroken, or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaperlike waste collection devices.\nThe diapers used on primates, canines, etc. are much like the diapers used by humans. The diapers used on equines are intended to catch excretions, as opposed to absorbing them.\nIn 2002, the Vienna city council proposed that horses be made to wear diapers to prevent them from defecating in the street. This caused controversy amongst animal rights groups, who claimed that wearing diapers would be uncomfortable for the animals. The campaigners protested by lining the streets wearing diapers themselves, which spelled out the message \"Stop pooh bags\". In the Kenyan town of Limuru, donkeys were also diapered at the council's behest. A similar scheme in Blackpool ordered that horses be fitted with rubber and plastic diapers to stop them littering the promenade with dung. The council consulted the RSPCA to ensure that the diapers were not harmful to the horses' welfare.\nOther animals that are sometimes diapered include female dogs when ovulating and thus bleeding, and monkeys and apes or chickens. Diapers are often seen on trained animals who appear on TV shows, in movies, or for live entertainment or educational appearances.\nCost of disposable diapers.\nMore than US$9 billion is spent on disposable diapers in North America each year.\nAs of 2018, name-brand, mid-range disposable diapers in the U.S., such as Huggies and Pampers, were sold at an average cost of approximately $0.20\u20130.30 each, and their manufacturers earned about two cents in profit from each diaper sold. Premium brands had eco-friendly features, and sold for approximately twice that price. Generic disposable diapers cost less per diaper, at an average price of $0.15 each, and the typical manufacturer's profit was about one cent per diaper. However, the low-cost diapers needed to be changed more frequently, so the total cost savings was limited, as the lower cost per diaper was offset by the need to buy more diapers.\nIn Latin America, some manufacturers sold disposable diapers at a price of approximately US$0.10 each.\nEnvironmental impact of cloth versus disposable diapers.\nAn average child will go through several thousand diapers in their life. Since disposable diapers are discarded after a single use, usage of disposable diapers increases the burden on landfill sites, and increased environmental awareness has led to a growth in campaigns for parents to use reusable alternatives such as cloth or hybrid diapers. An estimated 27.4 billion disposable diapers are used each year in the US, resulting in a possible 3.4 million tons of used diapers adding to landfills each year. A discarded disposable diaper takes approximately 450 years to decompose.\nThe environmental impact of cloth as compared to disposable diapers has been studied several times. In one cradle-to-grave study sponsored by the National Association of Diaper Services (NADS) and conducted by Carl Lehrburger and colleagues, results stated that disposable diapers produce seven times more solid waste when discarded and three times more waste in the manufacturing process. In addition, effluents from the plastic, pulp, and paper industries are believed far more hazardous than those from the cotton-growing and -manufacturing processes. Single-use diapers consume less water than reusables laundered at home, but more than those sent to a commercial diaper service. Washing cloth diapers at home uses 50 to 70 gallons (approx. 189 to 264 litres) of water every three days, which is roughly equivalent to flushing the toilet 15 times a day, unless the user has a high-efficiency washing machine. An average diaper service puts its diapers through an average of 13 water changes, but uses less water and energy per diaper than one laundry load at home.\nIn October 2008, \"An updated lifecycle assessment study for disposable and reusable nappies\" by the UK Environment Agency and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs stated that reusable diapers can cause significantly less (up to 40 per cent) or significantly more damage to the environment than disposable ones, depending mostly on how parents wash and dry them. The \"baseline scenario\" showed that the difference in green-house emissions was insignificant (in fact, disposables even scored slightly better). However, much better results (emission cuts of up to 40 per cent) could be achieved by using reusable diapers more rationally. \"The report shows that, in contrast to the use of disposable nappies, it is consumers' behaviour after purchase that determines most of the impacts from reusable nappies. Cloth nappy users can reduce their environmental impacts by:\nThere are variations in the care of cloth diapers that can account for different measures of environmental impact. For example, using a cloth diaper laundering service involves additional pollution from the vehicle that picks up and drops off deliveries. Yet such a service uses less water per diaper in the laundering process. Some people who launder cloth diapers at home wash each load twice, considering the first wash a \"prewash\", and thus doubling the energy and water usage from laundering. Cloth diapers are most commonly made of cotton. \"Conventional cotton is one of the most chemically-dependent crops, sucking up 10% of all agricultural chemicals and 25% of insecticides on 3% of our arable land; that's more than any other crop per unit.\" This effect can be mitigated by using organic cotton or other materials, such as bamboo and hemp.\nAnother aspect to consider when choosing between disposable diapers and cloth diapers is cost. It is estimated that an average baby will use from $1,500 to $2,000 or more in disposable diapers before being potty-trained. In contrast, cloth diapers, while initially more expensive than disposables, if bought new cost about $100 to $300 for a basic set, although costs can rise with more expensive versions. The cost of washing and drying diapers must also be considered. The basic set, if one-sized, can last from birth to potty-training.\nAnother factor in reusable cloth diaper impact is the ability to re-use the diapers for subsequent children or sell them on. These factors can alleviate the environmental and financial impact from manufacture, sale and use of brand-new reusable diapers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Newborn larvae are blackish and turn brown to tan as they grow, mottled with black. The heads and thorax develop a yellow tint as they grow to a total length of 24 to 32\u00a0mm. Adult males resemble bees, having a 25\u00a0mm wingspan with transparent wings (\"thuris\" window + \"pterux\" wing) and black furry bodies. Adult females are maggot-like with yellowish-white soft bodies 19 to 23\u00a0mm long and small tufts of hair near the end of the abdomen. The cream-colored eggs are 0.75\u00a0mm in diameter.\nThe evergreen bagworm thrives in the eastern United States as far west as Nebraska, north into New England, and bordering the Gulf of Mexico south throughout Texas. It has been found in other countries, such as South Africa, Croatia, and in the north-east of Iran. Large populations in forested areas are rare. With scarce predators in urban areas, evergreen bagworms often thrive in urban habitats. When disturbed, the larva retracts its head into its case and closes the front opening. Mature larvae may remain in the host tree or drag their case nearby before attaching themselves for the pupa stage.\nThe diet of larvae consists of leaves and buds of trees. Arborvitae and red cedar are favored host trees. Cypress, juniper, pine, spruce, apple, birch, black locust, elm, maple, poplar, oak, sycamore, willow, and over 100 other species can also be eaten.\nBagworms are commonly parasitized by ichneumonid wasps, notably \"Itoplectis conquisitor\". Predators include vespid wasps and hornets. Woodpeckers and sapsuckers can feed on the larvae from their cases.\nEggs hatch from early April to early June (earlier in the south), and larvae emerge from the carcass of their mother in her case. Newborn larvae emerge from the bottom of the hanging case and drop down on a strand of silk. The wind often blows the larva to nearby plants, beginning its new case from silk and fecal material before adding leaves and twigs from its host. When mature in mid-August, the larva wraps silk around a branch, hangs from it, and pupates head down. The silk is so strong that it can strangle and kill the branch it hangs from over several years as the branch grows. Adult males transform into moths in four weeks to seek out females for mating. The female never leaves the cocoon, requiring that the male mate with her through the open end at the back of the case. She has no eyes, legs, wings, or antennae and can't eat, but she emits a strong pheromone to attract a mate. After her death, with hundreds to several thousand eggs still inside, her offspring hatch and pass through her body, pupal shell, and case over several months, emerging to start their cases. Later, her pupal case can be found, full of the yellow remains of eggshells.\nThe bagworm has a voracious appetite and is considered a serious pest. Host trees develop damaged foliage that will kill the tree if left unchecked. If caught early enough in an infestation, the cases from the previous year can be picked off by hand before the end of May. They are easiest to detect in the fall after their cases have turned brown, especially on evergreen trees. Various bacterial sprays such as Bacillus thuringiensis Bt/Spinosad and stomach insecticides such as carbaryl (Sevin) are used to control infestations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively.\nGanymede is composed of silicate rock and water in approximately equal proportions. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid metallic core, giving it the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System. Its internal ocean potentially contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. \nGanymede's magnetic field is probably created by convection within its core, and influenced by tidal forces from Jupiter's far greater magnetic field. Ganymede has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3. Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether Ganymede has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.\nGanymede's surface is composed of two main types of terrain, the first of which are lighter regions, generally crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges, dating from slightly less than 4 billion years ago, covering two-thirds of Ganymede. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but may be the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating. The second terrain type are darker regions saturated with impact craters, which are dated to four billion years ago.\nGanymede's discovery is credited to Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei, who both observed it in 1610, as the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet. Marius soon named it after Ganymede, a Trojan prince desired by Zeus, who carried him off to serve as cupbearer to the gods.\nBeginning with \"Pioneer 10\", several spacecraft have explored Ganymede. The Voyager probes, \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\", refined measurements of its size, while \"Galileo\" discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), which was launched in 2023. After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, it is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.\nHistory.\nChinese astronomical records report that in 365 BC, Gan De detected what might have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.\nOn January 7, 1610, Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe what he thought were three stars near Jupiter, including what turned out to be Ganymede, Callisto, and one body that turned out to be the combined light from Io and Europa; the next night he noticed that they had moved. On January 13, he saw all four at once for the first time, but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once. By January 15, Galileo concluded that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter.\nName.\nGalileo claimed the right to name the moons he had discovered. He considered \"Cosmian Stars\" and settled on \"Medicean Stars\", in honor of Cosimo II de' Medici.\nThe French astronomer Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc suggested individual names from the Medici family for the moons, but his proposal was not taken up. Simon Marius, who had originally claimed to have found the Galilean satellites, tried to name the moons the \"Saturn of Jupiter\", the \"Jupiter of Jupiter\" (this was Ganymede), the \"Venus of Jupiter\", and the \"Mercury of Jupiter\", another nomenclature that never caught on. Later on, after finding out about a suggestion from Johannes Kepler, Marius agreed with Kepler's proposal and so he then proposed a naming system based on Greek mythology instead. This final Kepler/Marius proposal was ultimately successful.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis name and those of the other Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Ganymede is referred to instead by its Roman numeral designation, Jupiter III (a system introduced by Galileo), in other words \"the third satellite of Jupiter\". Following the discovery of moons of Saturn, a naming system based on that of Kepler and Marius was used for Jupiter's moons. Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure\u2014like Io, Europa, and Callisto, he was a lover of Zeus.\nIn English, the Galilean satellites Io, Europa and Callisto have the Latin spellings of their names, but the Latin form of Ganymede is \"Ganym\u0113d\u0113s\", which would be pronounced . However, the final syllable is dropped in English, perhaps under the influence of French \"Ganym\u00e8de\" ().\nPlanetary moons other than Earth's were never given symbols in the astronomical literature. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer who designed most of the dwarf planet symbols, proposed a Greek gamma (the initial of Ganymede) combined with the cross-bar of the Jupiter symbol as the symbol of Ganymede (). This symbol is not widely used.\nOrbit and rotation.\nGanymede orbits Jupiter at a distance of , third among the Galilean satellites, and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours (7.155 days). Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is also seven days and three hours. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009\u20130.0022 and 0.05\u20130.32\u00b0, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between the rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33\u00b0.\nGanymede participates in orbital resonances with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times. Conjunctions (alignment on the same side of Jupiter) between Io and Europa occur when Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis. Conjunctions between Europa and Ganymede occur when Europa is at periapsis. The longitudes of the Io\u2013Europa and Europa\u2013Ganymede conjunctions change at the same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance.\nThe current Laplace resonance is unable to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; if it is not pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago. Because Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively low\u2014on average 0.0015\u2014tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01\u20130.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.\nThere are two hypotheses for the origin of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed from the beginning of the Solar System; or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io's orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that, the expansion continued, but some of the angular moment was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede. Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace resonance.\nPhysical characteristics.\nSize.\nWith a diameter of about and a mass of , Ganymede is the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System. It is slightly more massive than the second most massive moon, Saturn's satellite Titan, and is more than twice as massive as the Earth's Moon. It is larger than the planet Mercury, which has a diameter of but is only 45 percent of Mercury's mass. Ganymede is the ninth-largest object in the solar system, but the tenth-most massive.\nComposition.\nThe average density of Ganymede, 1.936 g/cm3 (a bit greater than Callisto's), suggests a composition of about equal parts rocky material and mostly water ices. Some of the water is liquid, forming an underground ocean. The mass fraction of ices is between 46 and 50 percent, which is slightly lower than that in Callisto. Some additional volatile ices such as ammonia may also be present. The exact composition of Ganymede's rock is not known, but is probably close to the composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon ranges between 1.05 and 1.27 in Ganymede, whereas the solar ratio is around 1.8.\nSurface features.\nGanymede's surface has an albedo of about 43 percent. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50\u201390 percent, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 \u03bcm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the \"Galileo\" spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. \"Galileo\" results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.\nThe Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; the leading hemisphere is brighter than the trailing one. This is similar to Europa, but the reverse for Callisto. The trailing hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide. The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, but little or no carbon dioxide is observed near the poles. Impact craters on Ganymede (except one) do not show any enrichment in carbon dioxide, which also distinguishes it from Callisto. Ganymede's carbon dioxide gas was probably depleted in the past.\nGanymede's surface is a mix of two types of terrain: very old, highly cratered, dark regions and somewhat younger (but still ancient), lighter regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges. The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface, contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.\nThe heating mechanism required for the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70 percent of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by one to six percent due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.\nCratering is seen on both types of terrain, but is especially extensive on the dark terrain: it appears to be saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events. The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features, which have been only of minor importance to its tectonic evolution. The density of cratering indicates an age of 4\u00a0billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the Moon, and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain). Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4\u00a0billion years ago similar to that of the Moon. If true, the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since. Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible. Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede's icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a \"ghost\" of a crater known as a palimpsest.\nOne significant feature on Ganymede is a dark plain named Galileo Regio, which contains a series of concentric grooves, or furrows, likely created during a period of geologic activity.\nGanymede also has polar caps, likely composed of water frost. The frost extends to 40\u00b0 latitude. These polar caps were first seen by the \"Voyager\" spacecraft. Theories on the formation of the caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and the bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from \"Galileo\" suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.\nA crater named Anat provides the reference point for measuring longitude on Ganymede. By definition, Anat is at 128\u00b0 longitude. The 0\u00b0 longitude directly faces Jupiter, and unless stated otherwise longitude increases toward the west.\nInternal structure.\nGanymede appears to be fully differentiated, with an internal structure consisting of an iron-sulfide\u2013iron core, a silicate mantle, and outer layers of water ice and liquid water.\n The precise thicknesses of the different layers in the interior of Ganymede depend on the assumed composition of silicates (fraction of olivine and pyroxene) and amount of sulfur in the core. Ganymede has the lowest moment of inertia factor, 0.31, among the solid Solar System bodies. This is a consequence of its substantial water content and fully differentiated interior.\nSubsurface oceans.\nIn the 1970s, NASA scientists first suspected that Ganymede had a thick ocean between two layers of ice, one on the surface and one beneath a liquid ocean and atop the rocky mantle. In the 1990s, NASA's \"Galileo\" mission flew by Ganymede, and found indications of such a subsurface ocean. An analysis published in 2014, taking into account the realistic thermodynamics for water and effects of salt, suggests that Ganymede might have a stack of several ocean layers separated by different phases of ice, with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky mantle. Water\u2013rock contact may be an important factor in the origin of life. The analysis also notes that the extreme depths involved (~800\u00a0km to the rocky \"seafloor\") mean that temperatures at the bottom of a convective (adiabatic) ocean can be up to 40 K higher than those at the ice\u2013water interface.\nIn March 2015, scientists reported that measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope of how the aurorae moved confirmed that Ganymede has a subsurface ocean. A large saltwater ocean affects Ganymede's magnetic field, and consequently, its aurorae. The evidence suggests that Ganymede's oceans might be the largest in the entire Solar System. These observations were later supported by \"Juno\", which detected various salts and other compounds on Ganymede's surface, including hydrated sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and possibly aliphatic aldehydes. These compounds were potentially deposited from Ganymede's ocean in past resurfacing events and were discovered to be most abundant in Ganymede's lower latitudes, shielded by its small magnetosphere. As a result of these findings, there is increasing speculation on the potential habitability of Ganymede's ocean.\nCore.\nThe existence of a liquid, iron\u2013nickel-rich core provides a natural explanation for the intrinsic magnetic field of Ganymede detected by \"Galileo\" spacecraft. The convection in the liquid iron, which has high electrical conductivity, is the most reasonable model of magnetic field generation. The density of the core is 5.5\u20136 g/cm3 and the silicate mantle is 3.4\u20133.6 g/cm3. The radius of this core may be up to 500\u00a0km. The temperature in the core of Ganymede is probably 1500\u20131700 K and pressure up to .\nAtmosphere and ionosphere.\nIn 1972, a team of Indian, British and American astronomers working in Java, Indonesia and Kavalur, India claimed that they had detected a thin atmosphere during an occultation, when it and Jupiter passed in front of a star. They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0.1 Pa (1 microbar). However, in 1979, \"Voyager 1\" observed an occultation of the star \u03ba Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results. The occultation measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the visible spectrum. No atmosphere was revealed by the \"Voyager\" data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be , which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 \u03bcPa (25 picobar). The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.\nDespite the \"Voyager\" data, evidence for a tenuous oxygen atmosphere (exosphere) on Ganymede, very similar to the one found on Europa, was found by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1995. HST actually observed airglow of atomic oxygen in the far-ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130.4\u00a0nm and 135.6\u00a0nm. Such an airglow is excited when molecular oxygen is dissociated by electron impacts, which is evidence of a significant neutral atmosphere composed predominantly of O2 molecules. The surface number density probably lies in the range, corresponding to the surface pressure of 0.2\u20131.2 \u03bcPa. These values are in agreement with \"Voyager\"'s upper limit set in 1981. The oxygen is not evidence of life; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede's surface is split into hydrogen and oxygen by radiation, with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass. The airglow observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that observed over Europa. HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres, near \u00b1 50\u00b0 latitude, which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere (see below). The bright spots are probably polar auroras, caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines.\nThe existence of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, the nature of the Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some \"Galileo\" measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400\u20132,500\u00a0cm\u22123. As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede were not well constrained.\nAdditional evidence of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo\u2014they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but would dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (\u2212173.15\u00a0\u00b0C).\nA search for sodium in the atmosphere, just after such a finding on Europa, turned up nothing in 1997. Sodium is at least 13 times less abundant around Ganymede than around Europa, possibly because of a relative deficiency at the surface or because the magnetosphere fends off energetic particles. Another minor constituent of the Ganymedian atmosphere is atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms were observed as far as 3,000\u00a0km from Ganymede's surface. Their density on the surface is about .\nIn 2021, water vapour was detected in the atmosphere of Ganymede.\nMagnetosphere.\nThe \"Galileo\" craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995 to 2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and discovered that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of the moment is about 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013 T\u00b7m3, which is three times larger than the magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176\u00b0, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 \u00b1 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede\u2014about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator\u20141440 nT.\nThe permanent magnetic moment carves a part of space around Ganymede, creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter; it is the only moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature. Its diameter is 4\u20135 Ganymede radii. The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30\u00b0 latitude, where charged particles (electrons and ions) are trapped, creating a kind of radiation belt. The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygen (O+) which fits well with Ganymede's tenuous oxygen atmosphere. In the polar cap regions, at latitudes higher than 30\u00b0, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter's ionosphere. In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of kiloelectronvolt) electrons and ions have been detected, which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles. In addition, heavy ions precipitate continuously on Ganymede's polar surface, sputtering and darkening the ice.\nThe interaction between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects similar to that of the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow\u2014supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.\nIn addition to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following the direction of the varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT\u2014half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.\nGiven that Ganymede is completely differentiated and has a metallic core, its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated in a similar fashion to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior. The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core, if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.\nDespite the presence of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.\nRadiation environment.\nThe radiation level at the surface of Ganymede is considerably lower than on Europa, being 50\u201380 mSv (5\u20138 rem) per day, an amount that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for two months.\nOrigin and evolution.\nGanymede probably formed by an accretion in Jupiter's subnebula, a disk of gas and dust surrounding Jupiter after its formation. The accretion of Ganymede probably took about 10,000 years, much shorter than the 100,000 years estimated for Callisto. The Jovian subnebula may have been relatively \"gas-starved\" when the Galilean satellites formed; this would have allowed for the lengthy accretion times required for Callisto. In contrast, Ganymede formed closer to Jupiter, where the subnebula was denser, which explains its shorter formation timescale. This relatively fast formation prevented the escape of accretional heat, which may have led to ice melt and differentiation: the separation of the rocks and ice. The rocks settled to the center, forming the core. In this respect, Ganymede is different from Callisto, which apparently failed to melt and differentiate early due to loss of the accretional heat during its slower formation. This hypothesis explains why the two Jovian moons look so dissimilar, despite their similar mass and composition. Alternative theories explain Ganymede's greater internal heating on the basis of tidal flexing or more intense pummeling by impactors during the Late Heavy Bombardment. In the latter case, modeling suggests that differentiation would become a runaway process at Ganymede but not Callisto.\nAfter formation, Ganymede's core largely retained the heat accumulated during accretion and differentiation, only slowly releasing it to the ice mantle. The mantle, in turn, transported it to the surface by convection. The decay of radioactive elements within rocks further heated the core, causing increased differentiation: an inner, iron\u2013iron-sulfide core and a silicate mantle formed. With this, Ganymede became a fully differentiated body. By comparison, the radioactive heating of undifferentiated Callisto caused convection in its icy interior, which effectively cooled it and prevented large-scale melting of ice and rapid differentiation. The convective motions in Callisto have caused only a partial separation of rock and ice. Today, Ganymede continues to cool slowly. The heat being released from its core and silicate mantle enables the subsurface ocean to exist, whereas the slow cooling of the liquid Fe\u2013FeS core causes convection and supports magnetic field generation. The current heat flux out of Ganymede is probably higher than that out of Callisto.\nA study from 2020 by Hirata, Suetsugu and Ohtsuki suggests that Ganymede probably was hit by a massive asteroid 4 billion years ago; an impact so violent that may have shifted the moon's axis. The study came to this conclusion analyzing images of the furrows system in the satellite's surface.\nExploration.\nSeveral spacecraft have performed close flybys of Ganymede: two \"Pioneer\" and two \"Voyager\" spacecraft made a single flyby each between 1973 and 1979; the \"Galileo\" spacecraft made six passes between 1996 and 2000; and the \"Juno\" spacecraft performed two flybys in 2019 and 2021. No spacecraft has yet orbited Ganymede, but the JUICE mission, which launched in April 2023, intends to do so.\nCompleted flybys.\nThe first spacecraft to approach close to Ganymede was \"Pioneer 10\", which performed a flyby in 1973 as it passed through the Jupiter system at high speed. \"Pioneer 11\" made a similar flyby in 1974. Data sent back by the two spacecraft was used to determine the moon's physical characteristics and provided images of the surface with up to resolution. Pioneer 10's closest approach was 446,250\u00a0km, about 85 times Ganymede's diameter.\n\"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" both studied Ganymede when passing through the Jupiter system in 1979. Data from those flybys were used to refine the size of Ganymede, revealing it was larger than Saturn's moon Titan, which was previously thought to have been bigger. Images from the \"Voyagers\" provided the first views of the moon's grooved surface terrain.\nThe \"Pioneer\" and \"Voyager\" flybys were all at large distances and high speeds, as they flew on unbound trajectories through the Jupiter system. Better data can be obtained from a spacecraft which is orbiting Jupiter, as it can encounter Ganymede at a lower speed and adjust the orbit for a closer approach. In 1995, the \"Galileo\" spacecraft entered orbit around Jupiter and between 1996 and 2000 made six close flybys of Ganymede. These flybys were denoted G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29. During the closest flyby (G2), \"Galileo\" passed just 264\u00a0km from the surface of Ganymede (five percent of the moon's diameter), which remains the closest approach by any spacecraft. During the G1 flyby in 1996, \"Galileo\" instruments detected Ganymede's magnetic field. Data from the \"Galileo\" flybys was used to discover the sub-surface ocean, which was announced in 2001. High spatial resolution spectra of Ganymede taken by \"Galileo\" were used to identify several non-ice compounds on the surface.\nThe \"New Horizons\" spacecraft also observed Ganymede, but from a much larger distance as it passed through the Jupiter system in 2007 (en route to Pluto). The data were used to perform topographic and compositional mapping of Ganymede.\nLike \"Galileo\", the \"Juno\" spacecraft orbited Jupiter. On 2019 December 25, \"Juno\" performed a distant flyby of Ganymede during its 24th orbit of Jupiter, at a range of . This flyby provided images of the moon's polar regions. In June 2021, \"Juno\" performed a second flyby, at a closer distance of . This encounter was designed to provide a gravity assist to reduce \"Juno\"'s orbital period from 53 days to 43 days. Additional images of the surface were collected.\nFuture missions.\nThe Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will be the first to enter orbit around Ganymede itself. JUICE was launched on April 14, 2023. It is intended to perform its first flyby of Ganymede in 2031, then enter orbit of the moon in 2032. When the spacecraft consumes its propellant, JUICE is planned to be deorbited and impact Ganymede in February 2034.\nIn addition to JUICE, NASA's Europa Clipper, which was launched in October 2024, will conduct 4 close flybys of Ganymede beginning in 2030. It may also crash into Ganymede at the end of its mission to aid JUICE in studying the surface's geochemistry.\nCancelled proposals.\nSeveral other missions have been proposed to flyby or orbit Ganymede, but were either not selected for funding or cancelled before launch.\nThe Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter would have studied Ganymede in greater detail. However, the mission was canceled in 2005. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.\nA Ganymede orbiter based on the \"Juno\" probe was proposed in 2010 for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey. The mission was not supported, with the Decadal Survey preferring the Europa Clipper mission instead.\nThe Europa Jupiter System Mission had a proposed launch date of 2020, and was a joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter's moons including Ganymede. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. The mission was to consist of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter. The NASA and JAXA components were later cancelled, and ESA's appeared likely to be cancelled too, but in 2012 ESA announced it would go ahead alone. The European part of the mission became the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE).\nThe Russian Space Research Institute proposed a Ganymede lander astrobiology mission called Laplace-P, possibly in partnership with JUICE. If selected, it would have been launched in 2023. The mission was cancelled due to a lack of funding in 2017.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54217", "revid": "13220696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54217", "title": "Pigeonhole principle", "text": "If there are more items than boxes holding them, one box must contain at least two items\nIn mathematics, the pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with \"n\" &gt; \"m\", then at least one container must contain more than one item. For example, of three gloves, at least two must be right-handed or at least two must be left-handed, because there are three objects but only two categories of handedness to put them into. This seemingly obvious statement, a type of counting argument, can be used to demonstrate possibly unexpected results. For example, given that the population of London is more than one unit greater than the maximum number of hairs that can be on a human head, the principle requires that there must be at least two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.\nAlthough the pigeonhole principle appears as early as 1622 in a book by Jean Leurechon, it is commonly called Dirichlet's box principle or Dirichlet's drawer principle after an 1834 treatment of the principle by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet under the name (\"drawer principle\" or \"shelf principle\").\nThe principle has several generalizations and can be stated in various ways. In a more quantified version: for natural numbers k and m, if \"n\" = \"km\" + 1 objects are distributed among m sets, the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least \"k\" + 1 objects. For arbitrary n and m, this generalizes to formula_1, where formula_2 and formula_3 denote the floor and ceiling functions, respectively.\nThough the principle's most straightforward application is to finite sets (such as pigeons and boxes), it is also used with infinite sets that cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence. To do so requires the formal statement of the pigeonhole principle: \"there does not exist an injective function whose codomain is smaller than its domain\". Advanced mathematical proofs like Siegel's lemma build upon this more general concept.\nEtymology.\nDirichlet published his works in both French and German, using either the German or the French . The strict original meaning of these terms corresponds to the English \"drawer\", that is, an \"open-topped box that can be slid in and out of the cabinet that contains it\". (Dirichlet wrote about distributing pearls among drawers.) These terms morphed to \"pigeonhole\" in the sense of a \"small open space in a desk, cabinet, or wall for keeping letters or papers\", metaphorically rooted in structures that house pigeons.\nBecause furniture with pigeonholes is commonly used for storing or sorting things into many categories (such as letters in a post office or room keys in a hotel), the translation \"pigeonhole\" may be a better rendering of Dirichlet's original \"drawer\". That understanding of the term \"pigeonhole\", referring to some furniture features, is fading\u2014especially among those who do not speak English natively but as a lingua franca in the scientific world\u2014in favor of the more pictorial interpretation, literally involving pigeons and holes. The suggestive (though not misleading) interpretation of \"pigeonhole\" as \"dovecote\" has lately found its way back to a German back-translation of the \"pigeonhole principle\" as the \".\nBesides the original terms \" in German and \" in French, other literal translations are still in use in Arabic (), Bulgarian (\"), Chinese (\"), Danish (\"), Dutch (\"), Hungarian (\"), Italian (\"), Japanese (\"), Persian (\"), Polish (\"), Portuguese (\"), Swedish (\"), Turkish (\"), and Vietnamese (\").\nExamples.\nSock picking.\nSuppose a drawer contains a mixture of black socks and blue socks, each of which can be worn on either foot. You pull a number of socks from the drawer without looking. What is the minimum number of pulled socks required to guarantee a pair of the same color? By the pigeonhole principle (\"m\" \n 2, using one pigeonhole per color), the answer is three (\"n\" \n 3 items). Either you have \"three\" of one color, or you have \"two\" of one color and \"one\" of the other.\nHand shaking.\nIf \"n\" people can shake hands with one another (where \"n\" &gt; 1), the pigeonhole principle shows that there is always a pair of people who will shake hands with the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the \"hole\" to which a person is assigned is the number of hands that person shakes. Since each person shakes hands with some number of people from 0 to \"n\" \u2212 1, there are \"n\" possible holes. On the other hand, either the \"0\" hole, the \"\"n\" \u2212 1\" hole, or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if \"n\" &gt; 1) for some person to shake hands with everybody else while some person shakes hands with nobody. This leaves \"n\" people to be placed into at most \"n\" \u2212 1 non-empty holes, so the principle applies.\nThis hand-shaking example is equivalent to the statement that in any graph with more than one vertex, there is at least one pair of vertices that share the same degree. This can be seen by associating each person with a vertex and each edge with a handshake.\nHair counting.\nOne can demonstrate there must be at least two people in London with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows. Since a typical human head has an average of around 150,000 hairs, it is reasonable to assume (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head (\"m\" \n 1 million holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London (\"n\" is bigger than 1\u00a0million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person's head, and assigning people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their heads, there must be at least two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads; or, \"n\" &gt; \"m\"). Assuming London has 9.002 million people, it follows that at least ten Londoners have the same number of hairs, as having nine Londoners in each of the 1 million pigeonholes accounts for only 9 million people.\nFor the average case (\"m\" = 150,000) with the constraint: fewest overlaps, there will be at most one person assigned to every pigeonhole and the 150,001st person assigned to the same pigeonhole as someone else. In the absence of this constraint, there may be empty pigeonholes because the \"collision\" happens before the 150,001st person. The principle just proves the existence of an overlap; it says nothing about the number of overlaps (which falls under the subject of probability distribution).\nThere is a passing, satirical, allusion in English to this version of the principle in \"A History of the Athenian Society\", prefixed to \"A Supplement to the Athenian Oracle: Being a Collection of the Remaining Questions and Answers in the Old Athenian Mercuries\" (printed for Andrew Bell, London, 1710). It seems that the question \"whether there were any two persons in the World that have an equal number of hairs on their head?\" had been raised in \"The Athenian Mercury\" before 1704.\nPerhaps the first written reference to the pigeonhole principle appears in a short sentence from the French Jesuit Jean Leurechon's 1622 work \"Select\u00e6 Propositiones\": \"It is necessary that two men have the same number of hairs, \u00e9cus, or other things, as each other.\" The full principle was spelled out two years later, with additional examples, in another book that has often been attributed to Leurechon, but might be by Jean Appier Hanzelet.\nThe birthday problem.\nThe birthday problem asks, for a set of \"n\" randomly chosen people, what is the probability that some pair of them will have the same birthday? The problem itself is mainly concerned with counterintuitive probabilities, but we can also tell by the pigeonhole principle that among 367 people, there is at least one pair of people who share the same birthday with 100% probability, as there are only 366 possible birthdays to choose from.\nTeam tournament.\nImagine seven people who want to play in a tournament of teams (\"n\" \n 7 items), with a limitation of only four teams (\"m\" \n 4 holes) to choose from. The pigeonhole principle tells us that they cannot all play for different teams; there must be at least one team featuring at least two of the seven players: \n formula_4\nSubset sum.\nAny subset of size six from the set formula_5 must contain two elements whose sum is 10. The pigeonholes will be labeled by the two element subsets formula_6 and the singleton formula_7 , five pigeonholes in all. When the six \"pigeons\" (elements of the size six subset) are placed into these pigeonholes, each pigeon going into the pigeonhole that has it contained in its label, at least one of the pigeonholes labeled with a two-element subset will have two pigeons in it.\nHashing.\nHashing in computer science is the process of mapping an arbitrarily large set of data \"n\" to \"m\" fixed-size values. This has applications in caching whereby large data sets can be stored by a reference to their representative values (their \"hashes\") in a \"hash table\" for fast recall. Typically, the number of unique objects in a data set \"n\" is larger than the number of available unique hash codes \"m\", and the pigeonhole principle holds in this case that hashing those objects is no guarantee of uniqueness, since if you hashed all objects in the data set \"n\", some objects must necessarily share the same hash code.\nUses and applications.\nThe principle can be used to prove that any lossless compression algorithm, provided it makes some inputs smaller (as \"compression\" suggests), will also make some other inputs larger. Otherwise, the set of all input sequences up to a given length L could be mapped to the (much) smaller set of all sequences of length less than L without collisions (because the compression is lossless), a possibility that the pigeonhole principle excludes.\nA notable problem in mathematical analysis is, for a fixed irrational number a, to show that the set &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; of fractional parts is dense in [0, 1]. One finds that it is not easy to explicitly find integers n, m such that formula_8 where \"e\" &gt; 0 is a small positive number and a is some arbitrary irrational number. But if one takes M such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; by the pigeonhole principle there must be formula_9 such that \"n\"1\"a\" and \"n\"2\"a\" are in the same integer subdivision of size &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; (there are only M such subdivisions between consecutive integers). In particular, one can find \"n\"1, \"n\"2 such that\nformula_10\nfor some p, q integers and k in {0, 1, ..., \"M\" \u2212 1}. One can then easily verify that \nformula_11\nThis implies that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; where \"n\" = \"n\"2 \u2212 \"n\"1 or \"n\" = \"n\"1 \u2212 \"n\"2. This shows that 0 is a limit point of {[\"na\"]}. One can then use this fact to prove the case for p in (0, 1]: find n such that &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; then if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; the proof is complete. Otherwise \nformula_12\nand by setting \nformula_13 \none obtains \nformula_14\nVariants occur in a number of proofs. In the proof of the pumping lemma for regular languages, a version that mixes finite and infinite sets is used: If infinitely many objects are placed into finitely many boxes, then two objects share a box. In Fisk's solution to the Art gallery problem a sort of converse is used: If n objects are placed into k boxes, then there is a box containing at most &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; objects.\nAlternative formulations.\nThe following are alternative formulations of the pigeonhole principle.\nStrong form.\nLet \"q\"1, \"q\"2, ..., \"q\"\"n\" be positive integers. If\nformula_15\nobjects are distributed into \"n\" boxes, then either the first box contains at least \"q\"1 objects, or the second box contains at least \"q\"2 objects, ..., or the \"n\"th box contains at least \"q\"\"n\" objects.\nThe simple form is obtained from this by taking \"q\"1 = \"q\"2 = ... = \"q\"\"n\" = 2, which gives \"n\" + 1 objects. Taking \"q\"1 = \"q\"2 = ... = \"q\"\"n\" = \"r\" gives the more quantified version of the principle, namely:\nLet \"n\" and \"r\" be positive integers. If \"n\"(\"r\" \u2212 1) + 1 objects are distributed into \"n\" boxes, then at least one of the boxes contains \"r\" or more of the objects.\nThis can also be stated as, if \"k\" discrete objects are to be allocated to \"n\" containers, then at least one container must hold at least formula_16 objects, where formula_17 is the ceiling function, denoting the smallest integer larger than or equal to \"x\". \nSimilarly, at least one container must hold no more than formula_18 objects, where formula_19 is the floor function, denoting the largest integer smaller than or equal to \"x\".\nGeneralizations of the pigeonhole principle.\nA probabilistic generalization of the pigeonhole principle states that if \"n\" pigeons are randomly put into \"m\" pigeonholes with uniform probability 1/\"m\", then at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon with probability\nformula_20\nwhere (\"m\")\"n\" is the falling factorial \"m\"(\"m\" \u2212 1)(\"m\" \u2212 2)...(\"m\" \u2212 \"n\" + 1). For \"n\" = 0 and for \"n\" = 1 (and \"m\" &gt; 0), that probability is zero; in other words, if there is just one pigeon, there cannot be a conflict. For \"n\" &gt; \"m\" (more pigeons than pigeonholes) it is one, in which case it coincides with the ordinary pigeonhole principle. But even if the number of pigeons does not exceed the number of pigeonholes (\"n\" \u2264 \"m\"), due to the random nature of the assignment of pigeons to pigeonholes there is often a substantial chance that clashes will occur. For example, if 2 pigeons are randomly assigned to 4 pigeonholes, there is a 25% chance that at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon; for 5 pigeons and 10 holes, that probability is 69.76%; and for 10 pigeons and 20 holes it is about 93.45%. If the number of holes stays fixed, there is always a greater probability of a pair when you add more pigeons. This problem is treated at much greater length in the birthday paradox.\nA further probabilistic generalization is that when a real-valued random variable \"X\" has a finite mean \"E\"(\"X\"), then the probability is nonzero that \"X\" is greater than or equal to \"E\"(\"X\"), and similarly the probability is nonzero that \"X\" is less than or equal to \"E\"(\"X\"). To see that this implies the standard pigeonhole principle, take any fixed arrangement of \"n\" pigeons into \"m\" holes and let \"X\" be the number of pigeons in a hole chosen uniformly at random. The mean of \"X\" is \"n\"/\"m\", so if there are more pigeons than holes the mean is greater than one. Therefore, \"X\" is sometimes at least 2.\nInfinite sets.\nThe pigeonhole principle can be extended to infinite sets by phrasing it in terms of cardinal numbers: if the cardinality of set A is greater than the cardinality of set B, then there is no injection from A to B. However, in this form the principle is tautological, since the meaning of the statement that the cardinality of set A is greater than the cardinality of set B is exactly that there is no injective map from A to B. However, adding at least one element to a finite set is sufficient to ensure that the cardinality increases.\nAnother way to phrase the pigeonhole principle for finite sets is similar to the principle that finite sets are Dedekind finite: Let A and B be finite sets. If there is a surjection from A to B that is not injective, then no surjection from A to B is injective. In fact no function of any kind from A to B is injective. This is not true for infinite sets: Consider the function on the natural numbers that sends 1 and 2 to 1, 3 and 4 to 2, 5 and 6 to 3, and so on.\nThere is a similar principle for infinite sets: If uncountably many pigeons are stuffed into countably many pigeonholes, there will exist at least one pigeonhole having uncountably many pigeons stuffed into it.\nThis principle is not a generalization of the pigeonhole principle for finite sets however: It is in general false for finite sets. In technical terms it says that if A and B are finite sets such that any surjective function from A to B is not injective, then there exists an element b of B such that there exists a bijection between the preimage of b and A. This is a quite different statement, and is absurd for large finite cardinalities.\nQuantum mechanics.\nYakir Aharonov et al. presented arguments that quantum mechanics may violate the pigeonhole principle, and proposed interferometric experiments to test the pigeonhole principle in quantum mechanics. \nLater research has called this conclusion into question. In a January 2015 arXiv preprint, researchers Alastair Rae and Ted Forgan at the University of Birmingham performed a theoretical wave function analysis, employing the standard pigeonhole principle, on the flight of electrons at various energies through an interferometer. If the electrons had no interaction strength at all, they would each produce a single, perfectly circular peak. At high interaction strength, each electron produces four distinct peaks, for a total of 12 peaks on the detector; these peaks are the result of the four possible interactions each electron could experience (alone, together with the first other particle only, together with the second other particle only, or all three together). If the interaction strength was fairly low, as would be the case in many real experiments, the deviation from a zero-interaction pattern would be nearly indiscernible, much smaller than the lattice spacing of atoms in solids, such as the detectors used for observing these patterns. This would make it very difficult or impossible to distinguish a weak-but-nonzero interaction strength from no interaction whatsoever, and thus give an illusion of three electrons that did not interact despite all three passing through two paths.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was elected King of England by the Witan in 1066 but never crowned. After exile and war against the Normans, Edgar migrated to Norman Apulia (modern-day Italy) and possibly partook in the First Crusade (or, at least, made pilgrimage to Jerusalem following its conquest). In later life, Edgar was entangled in Norman dynastic struggles before retiring to a quiet life in the countryside.\nFamily and early life.\nEdgar was probably born in Hungary, where his father Edward the Exile, son of King Edmund Ironside, had found refuge after Edmund's death and the conquest of England by the Danish king Cnut in 1016. Edgar's mother was Agatha, who was described as a relative of the Holy Roman Emperor or a descendant of Saint Stephen of Hungary, but her exact identity is unknown. He was his parents' only son but had two sisters, Margaret and Cristina.\nIn 1057, Edward the Exile arrived in England with his family but died almost immediately. Edgar, a child, was left as the only surviving male member of the royal dynasty apart from the king, his great-uncle Edward the Confessor. Edgar was brought up by the Confessor's wife, Edith, and he is recorded in the New Minster Liber Vitae as , the Latin for , a royal prince eligible for the throne. In the view of the historian Tom Licence, Edward chose Edgar as his heir, but this is questioned by other historians, who argue that Edward does not appear to have taken any steps to support his candidacy.\nSuccession struggle.\nWhen King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066, Edgar was still in his early teens, considered too young to be an effective military leader. This had not been an insurmountable obstacle in the succession of previous kings. However, the avaricious ambitions that had been aroused across north-western Europe by the Confessor's lack of an heir prior to 1057, and by the king's failure thereafter to prepare the way for Edgar to succeed him, removed any prospect of a peaceful hereditary succession. War was clearly inevitable and Edgar was in no position to fight it, as he was without powerful adult relatives that could champion his cause. Accordingly, the Witenagemot elected Harold Godwinson to succeed Edward, as he was the man best placed to defend the country against foreign claimants to the throne.\nFollowing Harold's death at the Battle of Hastings against the invading Normans in October 1066, some of the Anglo-Saxon leaders decided to back young Edgar's claim to the throne. Two leading magnates, Edwin, Earl of Mercia and his brother Morcar, Earl of Northumbria, promised their support, but they failed to deliver military assistance and without it Edgar's cause was hopeless. In early December Edgar was among English leaders who submitted to William at Berkhamsted.\nExile and war against the Normans.\nWilliam kept Edgar in his custody and took him, along with other English leaders, to his court in Normandy in 1067, before returning with them to England. Edgar might have been involved in the abortive rebellion of the Earls Edwin and Morcar in 1068, or he might have been attempting to return to Hungary with his family and been blown off course; in any case, in that year he arrived with his mother and sisters at the court of King Malcolm III of Scotland. Malcolm married Edgar's sister Margaret, and agreed to support Edgar in his attempt to reclaim the English throne. When the rebellion that resulted in the Harrying of the North broke out in Northumbria at the beginning of 1069, Edgar returned to England with other rebels who had fled to Scotland, to become the leader, or at least the figurehead, of the revolt. However, after early successes the rebels were defeated by William at York, and Edgar again sought refuge with Malcolm who happily allowed him asylum for his loyalty. It appears that Edgar married Malcolm's sister Margaret Canmore and the union failed to have issue. \nIn late summer that year, the arrival of a fleet sent by King Sweyn of Denmark triggered a fresh wave of English uprisings in various parts of the country. Edgar and the other exiles sailed to the Humber, where they linked up with Northumbrian rebels and the Danes. Their combined forces overwhelmed the Normans at York and took control of Northumbria, but a small seaborne raid which Edgar led into the former Kingdom of Lindsey ended in disaster, and he escaped with only a handful of followers to rejoin the main army. Late in the year, William fought his way into Northumbria and occupied York, buying off the Danes and devastating the surrounding country. Early in 1070, he moved against Edgar and other English leaders who had taken refuge with their remaining followers in a marshy region, perhaps Holderness or the Isle of Ely, and put them to flight. Edgar returned to Scotland.\nHe remained there until 1072, when William invaded Scotland and forced King Malcolm to submit to his overlordship. The terms of the agreement between them included the expulsion of Edgar. He therefore took up residence in Flanders, whose count, Robert the Frisian, was hostile to the Normans. However, he was able to return to Scotland in 1074. Shortly after his arrival there, he received an offer from Philip I, King of France, who was also at odds with William, of a castle and lands near the borders of Normandy from where he would be able to raid his enemies' homeland. He embarked with his followers for France, but a storm wrecked their ships on the English coast. Many of Edgar's men were hunted down by the Normans, though he managed to escape with the remainder to Scotland by land. Following this disaster, he was persuaded by Malcolm to make peace with William and return to England as his subject, abandoning any ambition of regaining his ancestral throne.\nItalian venture.\nDisappointed at the level of recompense and respect he received from William, in 1086 Edgar renounced his allegiance to the Conqueror and moved with a retinue of men to Norman Apulia. The Domesday Book, compiled that year, records Edgar's ownership of only two small estates (Barkway and Hermead) in Hertfordshire. This is probably because Edgar had given up his English properties when he left for Italy, not intending to return. In that case, the recording of the Hertfordshire estates under his name is likely to be an anomaly, reflecting a situation which had recently ceased to apply. The venture in the Mediterranean was evidently not a success; within a few years Edgar returned to England.\nNorman and Scottish dynastic strife.\nAfter King William's death in 1087, Edgar supported William's eldest son Robert Curthose, who succeeded him as Duke of Normandy, against his second son, William Rufus, who received the throne of England as William II. Edgar was one of Robert's three principal advisers at this time. The war waged by Robert and his allies to overthrow William ended in defeat in 1091. As part of the resulting settlement between the brothers, Edgar was deprived of lands which he had been granted by Robert. These were presumably former possessions of William and his supporters in Normandy, confiscated by Robert and distributed to his own followers, including Edgar, but restored to their previous owners by the terms of the peace agreement. The disgruntled Edgar travelled once again to Scotland, where Malcolm was preparing for war with William. When William marched north and the two armies confronted one another, the kings opted to talk rather than fight. The negotiations were conducted by Edgar on behalf of Malcolm, and the newly reconciled Robert Curthose on behalf of William. The resulting agreement included a reconciliation between William and Edgar. However, within months Robert left England, unhappy with William's failure to fulfil the pact between them, and Edgar went with him to Normandy.\nHaving returned to England, Edgar went to Scotland again in 1093, on a diplomatic mission for William to negotiate with Malcolm, who was dissatisfied with the Norman failure to implement in full the terms of the 1091 treaty. This dispute led to war, and within the year Malcolm had invaded England and had been killed along with his designated heir Edward, eldest of his sons by Margaret, in the Battle of Alnwick. Malcolm's successor, his brother Donald B\u00e1n, drove out the English and French retainers who had risen high in Malcolm's service and had thus aroused the jealousy of the existing Scottish aristocracy. This purge brought him into conflict with the Anglo-Norman monarchy, whose influence in Scotland had diminished. William helped Malcolm's eldest son Duncan, who had spent many years as a hostage at William I's court and remained there when set at liberty by William II, to overthrow his uncle, but Donald soon regained the throne and Duncan was killed. Another effort to restore the Anglo-Norman interest through sponsorship of Malcolm's sons was launched in 1097, and Edgar made yet another journey to Scotland, this time in command of an invading army. Donald was ousted, and Edgar installed his nephew and namesake, Malcolm and Margaret's son Edgar, on the Scottish throne.\nFirst Crusade.\nOn 4 March 1098, a fleet manned by Englishmen, probably members of the Varangian Guard, commanded by Edgar, sailed into Port Saint Symeon, bringing supplies of siege materials from the Byzantine Emperor for the First Crusade. He then sailed on to Latakia. William of Malmesbury wrote that Edgar made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1102. William stated that on his way back from Jerusalem, Edgar was given rich gifts by both the Byzantine and the German emperors, each of whom offered him an honoured place at court, but that he insisted on returning home instead.\nLater life.\nBack in Europe, Edgar again took the side of Robert Curthose in the internal struggles of the Norman dynasty, this time against Robert's youngest brother, who was now Henry I, King of England. He was taken prisoner in the final defeat at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106, which resulted in Robert being imprisoned for the rest of his life. Edgar was more fortunate: having been taken back to England, he was pardoned and released by King Henry. His niece Edith (renamed Matilda), daughter of Malcolm III and Margaret, had married Henry in 1100. Edgar is believed to have travelled to Scotland once more late in life, perhaps around the year 1120. He lived to see the death at sea in the White Ship in November 1120 of William Adelin, the son of his niece Edith and heir to Henry I. Edgar was still alive in 1125, according to William of Malmesbury, who wrote at the time that Edgar \"now grows old in the country in privacy and quiet\". Edgar died some time after this contemporary reference, but the exact date and the location of his grave are not known.\nAccording to a 1291 Huntingdon Priory Chronicle, Edgar had one child, Margaret Lovel, who was the wife of firstly Ralph Lovel II, of Castle Cary in Somerset, and secondly of Robert de Londres, both of whom had estates in southern Scotland.\nThere are two references to an \"Edgar Adeling\" found in the \"Magnus Rotulus Pipae Northumberland\" (Pipe rolls) for the years 1158 and 1167. Historian Edward Freeman, writing in \"The History of the Norman Conquest of England\", says that this was the same Edgar (aged over 100), a son of his, or some other person known by the title \"\u00c6theling\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mencken", "text": "American journalist and writer (1880\u20131956)\nHenry Louis Mencken (September 12, 1880 \u2013 January 29, 1956) was an American journalist, essayist, satirist, cultural critic, and scholar of American English. He commented widely on the social scene, literature, music, prominent politicians, and contemporary movements. His satirical reporting on the Scopes Trial, which he dubbed the \"Monkey Trial\", also earned him attention. The term \"Menckenian\" has entered multiple dictionaries to describe anything of or pertaining to Mencken, including his combative rhetorical and prose styles.\nAs a scholar, Mencken is known for \"The American Language\", a multi-volume study of how the English language is spoken in the United States. As an admirer of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, he was an outspoken opponent of organized religion, theism, censorship, populism, Prohibition, and representative democracy, the last of which he viewed as a system in which inferior men dominated their superiors. Mencken was a supporter of scientific progress and was critical of osteopathy and chiropractic. He was also an open critic of economics.\nMencken opposed the American entry into World War I and World War II. Some of the opinions in his private diary entries have been described by some researchers as racist and antisemitic, although this characterization has been disputed. Larry S. Gibson argued that Mencken's views on race changed significantly between his early and later private writings which started when he was 50, and that it was more accurate to describe Mencken as elitist rather than racist. He seemed to show a genuine enthusiasm for militarism but never in its American form. \"War is a good thing,\" he wrote, \"because it is honest; it admits the central fact of human nature... A nation too long at peace becomes a sort of gigantic old maid.\"\nHis longtime home in the Union Square neighborhood of West Baltimore was turned into a city museum, the H. L. Mencken House. His papers were distributed among various city and university libraries, with the largest collection held in the Mencken Room at the central branch of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library.\nEarly life and education.\nMencken was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 12, 1880. He was the son of Anna Margaret (Abhau) and August Mencken Sr., a cigar factory owner. He was of German ancestry and spoke German in his childhood. When Henry was three, his family moved into a new home at 1524 Hollins Street facing Union Square park in the Union Square neighborhood of old West Baltimore. Apart from five years residing elsewhere during the marriage that left him a widower in middle age, Mencken would stay there for the rest of his life.\nIn his bestselling memoir \"Happy Days\", he described his childhood in Baltimore as \"placid, secure, uneventful and happy\".\nWhen he was nine years old, he read Mark Twain's \"Huckleberry Finn\", which he later described as \"the most stupendous event in my life\". He became determined to become a writer and read voraciously. In one winter while in high school he read William Makepeace Thackeray and then \"proceeded backward to Addison, Steele, Pope, Swift, Johnson and the other magnificos of the Eighteenth century\". He read the entire canon of Shakespeare and became an ardent fan of Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Huxley. As a boy, Mencken also had practical interests, photography and chemistry in particular, and eventually had a home chemistry laboratory in which he performed experiments of his own design,\nsome of them inadvertently dangerous.\nHe began his primary education in the mid-1880s at Professor Knapp's School on the east side of Holliday Street between East Lexington and Fayette Streets, next to the Holliday Street Theatre and across from the newly constructed Baltimore City Hall. The site today is the War Memorial and City Hall Plaza laid out in 1926 in memory of World War I dead. At 15, in June 1896, he graduated as valedictorian from the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, at the time a males-only mathematics, technical and science-oriented public high school.\nHe worked for three years in his father's cigar factory. He disliked the work, especially the sales aspect of it, and resolved to leave, with or without his father's blessing. In early 1898 he took a writing class at the Cosmopolitan University, a free correspondence school established by The Cosmopolitan magazine. This was to be the entirety of Mencken's formal post-secondary education in journalism, or in any other subject. Upon his father's death a few days after Christmas in the same year, the business passed to his uncle, and Mencken was free to pursue his career in journalism. He applied in February 1899 to the \"Morning Herald\" newspaper (which became the \"Baltimore Morning Herald\" in 1900) and was hired part-time, but still kept his position at the factory for a few months. In June he was hired as a full-time reporter.\nCareer.\nMencken served as a reporter at the \"Herald\" for six years. Fewer than two-and-a-half years after the Great Baltimore Fire, the paper was purchased in June 1906 by Charles H. Grasty, the owner and editor of \"The News\" since 1892 and competing owner and publisher Gen. Felix Agnus, of the town's oldest (since 1773) and largest daily, \"The Baltimore American.\" They proceeded to divide the staff, assets and resources of \"The Herald\" between them. Mencken then moved to \"The Baltimore Sun\", where he worked for Charles H. Grasty. He continued to contribute to \"The Sun,\" \"The Evening Sun\" (founded 1910) and \"The Sunday Sun\" full-time until 1948, when he stopped writing after suffering a stroke.\nMencken began writing the editorials and opinion pieces that made his name at \"The Sun.\" On the side, he wrote short stories, a novel, and even poetry, which he later revealed. In 1908, he became a literary critic for \"The Smart Set\" magazine, and in 1924 he and George Jean Nathan founded and edited \"The American Mercury\", published by Alfred A. Knopf. It soon developed a national circulation and became highly influential on college campuses across America. In 1933, Mencken resigned as editor.\nDuring the Great Depression, Mencken did not support the New Deal, which cost him popularity. In 1931, the Arkansas legislature passed a motion to pray for Mencken's soul after he had called the state the \"apex of moronia\".\nIn the mid-1930s, Mencken feared President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal liberalism as a powerful force. Mencken was \"deeply conservative, resentful of change, looking back upon the 'happy days' of a bygone time, wanted no part of the world that the New Deal promised to bring in\" according to Charles A. Fecher.\nMencken had strong reservations regarding U.S. participation in World War II. He ceased writing for \"The Baltimore Sun\" for several years, focusing on his memoirs and other projects as editor while he served as an adviser for the paper that had been his home for nearly his entire career.\nIn 1948, he briefly returned to the political scene to cover the presidential election in which President Harry S. Truman faced Republican Thomas Dewey and Henry A. Wallace of the Progressive Party. His later work consisted of humorous, anecdotal, and nostalgic essays that were first published in \"The New Yorker\" and then collected in the books \"Happy Days\", \"Newspaper Days\", and \"Heathen Days\".\nPersonal life.\nOn August 27, 1930, Mencken married Sara Haardt, a German American professor of English at Goucher College in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior. Haardt had led an unsuccessful effort in Alabama to ratify the 19th Amendment. The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued. The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage \"the end of hope\" and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, had gone to the altar. \"The Holy Spirit informed and inspired me,\" Mencken said. \"Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this one seemed to be a superb one.\" Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the American South. Haardt was in poor health from tuberculosis throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of meningitis, leaving Mencken grief-stricken. He had always championed her writing, and after her death, had a collection of her short stories published under the title \"Southern Album\". Haardt's childhood friend, Alabama author Sara Mayfield wrote extensively about Haardt and Mencken in her 1968 book \"The Constant Circle: H. L. Mencken and His Friends\".\nLast years.\nOn November 23, 1948, Mencken suffered a stroke, which left him aware and fully conscious but nearly unable to read or write and able to speak only with difficulty. After his stroke, Mencken enjoyed listening to classical music, and after some recovery of his ability to speak, talking with friends, but he sometimes referred to himself in the past tense, as if he were already dead. During the last year of his life, his friend and biographer William Manchester read to him daily.\nDeath.\nMencken died in his sleep on January 29, 1956. He was interred in Baltimore's Loudon Park Cemetery. A very small, short, and private service was held, in accordance with Mencken's wishes.\nAlthough it does not appear on his tombstone, Mencken, during his \"Smart Set\" days, wrote a joking epitaph for himself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If, after I depart this vale, you ever remember me and have thought to please my ghost, forgive some sinner and wink your eye at some homely girl.\nBeliefs.\nIn his capacity as editor, Mencken became close friends with the leading literary figures of his time, including Theodore Dreiser, F.\u00a0Scott Fitzgerald, Joseph Hergesheimer, Anita Loos, Ben Hecht, Sinclair Lewis, James Branch Cabell, and Alfred Knopf, as well as a mentor to several young reporters, including Alistair Cooke. He also championed artists whose works he considered worthy. For example, he asserted that books such as \"Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street\" (1929), by Eddie Cantor (ghostwritten by David Freedman) did more to pull America out of the Great Depression than all government measures combined. He also mentored John Fante. Thomas Hart Benton illustrated an edition of Mencken's book \"Europe After 8:15\".\nMencken also published many works under various pseudonyms, including Owen Hatteras, John H Brownell, William Drayham, WLD Bell, and Charles Angoff. As a ghostwriter for the physician Leonard K. Hirshberg, he wrote a series of articles, and in 1910, most of a book about the care of babies.\nMencken was an outspoken critic of Prohibition. His detestation with the Eighteenth Amendment aligned Mencken with the cultural elite of his time. He led intellectual and emotional campaigns to eradicate Prohibition and went as far to vote for Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 to accomplish this abolition of the Eighteenth Amendment. Mencken viewed the freedom to drink as critical liberty and considered alcohol as one of humanity's greatest inventions. \nMencken admired the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (he was the first writer to provide a scholarly analysis in English of Nietzsche's views and writings) and Joseph Conrad. His humor and satire owed much to Ambrose Bierce and Mark Twain. He did much to defend Theodore Dreiser despite freely admitting his faults, including stating forthrightly that Dreiser often wrote badly and was gullible. Mencken expressed his appreciation for William Graham Sumner in a 1941 collection of Sumner's essays and regretted never having known Sumner personally. In contrast, Mencken was scathing in his criticism of the German philosopher Hans Vaihinger, whom Mencken described as \"an extremely dull author\" and whose famous book \"Philosophy of 'As If\"' he dismissed as an unimportant \"foot-note to all existing systems\".\nMencken recommended for publication philosopher and author Ayn Rand's first novel, \"We the Living\" and called it \"a really excellent piece of work\". Shortly afterward, Rand addressed him in correspondence as \"the greatest representative of a philosophy\" to which she wanted to dedicate her life, \"individualism\", and later listed him as her favorite columnist.\nFor Mencken, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" was the finest work of American literature. He particularly relished Mark Twain's depiction of a succession of gullible and ignorant townspeople, \"boobs\", as Mencken referred to them, who are repeatedly gulled by a pair of colorful con men: the deliberately pathetic \"Duke\" and \"Dauphin\", with whom Huck and Jim travel down the Mississippi River. For Mencken, the depiction epitomizes the hilarious dark side of America, where democracy, as defined by Mencken, is \"the worship of jackals by jackasses\".\nSuch turns of phrase evoked the erudite cynicism and rapier sharpness of language displayed by Ambrose Bierce in his darkly satiric \"The Devil's Dictionary\". A noted curmudgeon, democratic in subjects attacked, Mencken savaged politics, hypocrisy, and social convention. A master of English, he was given to bombast and once disdained the lowly hot dog bun's descent into \"the soggy rolls prevailing today, of ground acorns, plaster of Paris, flecks of bath sponge and atmospheric air all compact\".\nDefining Puritanism as \"the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy\", Mencken believed that the U.S. had not cast aside the Puritans' influence. He opined that American culture, unlike its European counterparts, had not attained intellectual freedom, and judged literature by moral orthodoxy and not by artistic merit. His most outspoken essay was \"Puritanism as a Literary Force\" from his 1917 collection of essays \"A Book of Prefaces\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Puritan's utter lack of aesthetic sense, his distrust of all romantic emotion, his unmatchable intolerance of opposition, his unbreakable belief in his own bleak and narrow views, his savage cruelty of attack, his lust for relentless and barbarous persecution \u2013 these things have put an almost unbearable burden up on the exchange of ideas in the United States.\nAs a nationally syndicated columnist and book author, he commented widely on the social scene, literature, music, prominent politicians and contemporary movements, such as the temperance movement. Mencken was a keen cheerleader of scientific progress, skeptical of economic theories and strongly opposed to osteopathic/chiropractic medicine. He also debunked the idea of objective news reporting since \"truth is a commodity that the masses of undifferentiated men cannot be induced to buy\" and added a humorous description of how \"Homo Boobus\", like \"higher mammalia\", is moved by \"whatever gratifies his prevailing yearnings\".\nAs a frank admirer of Nietzsche, Mencken was a detractor of representative democracy, which he believed was a system in which inferior men dominated their superiors. Also, like Nietzsche, Mencken lambasted religious belief and the very concept of God, as he was an unflinching atheist. He was particularly hostile to Christian fundamentalism, Christian Science and creationism, and towards the \"Booboisie\", his word for the ignorant middle classes. In the summer of 1925 he attended the famous Scopes \"Monkey Trial\" in Dayton, Tennessee, and wrote scathing columns for the \"Baltimore Sun\" (these widely syndicated) and \"American Mercury\" mocking the anti-evolution fundamentalists (especially William Jennings Bryan). The play \"Inherit the Wind\" is a fictionalized version of the trial, and as noted above the cynical reporter E.K. Hornbeck is based on Mencken. In 1926, he deliberately had himself arrested for selling an issue of \"The American Mercury\", which was banned in Boston by the Comstock laws. Mencken heaped scorn not only on the public officials he disliked but also on the state of American elective politics itself.\nIn the summer of 1926, Mencken followed with great interest the Los Angeles grand jury inquiry into the famous Canadian American evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. She was accused of faking her reported kidnapping and the case attracted national attention. There was every expectation that Mencken would continue his previous pattern of anti-fundamentalist articles, this time with a searing critique of McPherson. Unexpectedly, he came to her defense by identifying various local religious and civic groups that were using the case as an opportunity to pursue their respective ideological agendas against the embattled Pentecostal minister. He spent several weeks in Hollywood, California, and wrote many scathing and satirical columns on the movie industry and Southern California culture. After all charges had been dropped against McPherson, Mencken revisited the case in 1930 with a sarcastic and observant article. He wrote that since many of that town's residents had acquired their ideas \"of the true, the good and the beautiful\" from the movies and newspapers, \"Los Angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her\".\nScience and mathematics.\nMencken defended the evolutionary views of Charles Darwin but spoke unfavorably of many prominent physicists and had little regard for pure mathematics. Regarding theoretical physics, he said to longtime editor Charles Angoff, \"Imagine measuring infinity! That's a laugh.\" Elsewhere, he dismissed higher mathematics and probability theory as \"nonsense\", after he read Angoff's article for Charles Sanders Peirce in the \"American Mercury\": \"So you believe in that garbage, too\u2014theories of knowledge, infinity, laws of probability. I can make no sense of it, and I don't believe you can either, and I don't think your god Peirce knew what he was talking about.\"\nMencken repeatedly identified mathematics with metaphysics and theology. According to Mencken, mathematics is necessarily infected with metaphysics. Mathematicians tend to engage in metaphysical speculation. In a review of Alfred North Whitehead's \"The Aims of Education,\" Mencken remarked that, although he agreed with Whitehead's thesis and admired his writing style, \"Now and then he falls into mathematical jargon and pollutes his discourse with equations\", and \"[T]here are moments when he seems to be following some of his mathematical colleagues into the gaudy metaphysics which now entertains them\". For Mencken, theology was characterized by it using correct reasoning from false premises. Mencken uses the term \"theology\" more generally to refer to the use of logic in science or any field of knowledge. In a review of Arthur Eddington's \"The Nature of the Physical World\" and Joseph Needham's \"Man a Machine\", Mencken ridiculed the use of reasoning to establish any fact in science.\nMencken wrote a review of Sir James Jeans's book, \"The Mysterious Universe\", in which Mencken wrote that mathematics is not necessary for physics. Instead of mathematical \"speculation\" (such as quantum theory), Mencken believed physicists should directly look at individual facts in the laboratory, as do chemists.\nIn the same article, which he re-printed in the \"Mencken Chrestomathy,\" Mencken primarily contrasts what real scientists do, which is to simply directly look at the existence of \"shapes and forces\" confronting them instead of (such as in statistics) attempting to speculate and use mathematical models. Physicists and especially astronomers are consequently not real scientists, because when looking at shapes or forces, they do not simply \"patiently wait for further light\", but resort to mathematical theory. There is no need for statistics in scientific physics, since one should simply look at the facts while statistics attempts to construct mathematical models. On the other hand, the really competent physicists do not bother with the \"theology\" or reasoning of mathematical theories (such as in quantum mechanics).\nMencken ridiculed Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, believing that \"in the long run his curved space may be classed with the psychosemantic bumps of Gall and Spurzheim\".\nRace and elitism.\nIn addition to his identification of races with castes, Mencken had views about the superior individual within communities. He believed that every community produced a few people of clear superiority. He considered groupings on a par with hierarchies, which led to a kind of natural elitism and natural aristocracy. \"Superior\" individuals, in Mencken's view, were those wrongly oppressed and disdained by their own communities but nevertheless distinguished by their will and personal achievement, not by race or birth.\nIn 1989, per his instructions, Alfred A. Knopf published Mencken's \"secret diary\" as \"The Diary of H.\u00a0L. Mencken\". According to an Associated Press story, Mencken's views shocked even the \"sympathetic scholar who edited it\", Charles Fecher of Baltimore. A club in Baltimore, the Maryland Club, had one Jewish member. When that member died, Mencken said, \"There is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable.\" The diary also quoted him as saying of his black maid, in September 1943, that \"it is impossible to talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything\".\nMencken opposed lynching. In 1935, he testified before Congress in support of the Costigan\u2013Wagner Bill. While he had previously written negatively about lynchings during the 1910s and 1920s, the lynchings of Matthew Williams and George Armwood caused him to write in support of the bill and give political advice to Walter White on how to maximize the likelihood of the bill's passing. The two lynchings in his home state made the issue directly relevant to him. His arguments against lynching were influenced by his interpretation of civilization, as he believed that a civilized society would not tolerate it.\nOne of his biographers observed that:\nIn a review of \"The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken\", by Terry Teachout, journalist Christopher Hitchens described Mencken as a German nationalist, \"an antihumanist as much as an atheist\", who was \"prone to the hyperbole and sensationalism he distrusted in others\". Hitchens also criticized Mencken for writing a scathing critique of Franklin Delano Roosevelt but nothing equally negative of Adolf Hitler.\nLarry S. Gibson argued that Mencken's views on race changed significantly between his early and later writings, attributing some of the changes in Mencken's views to his personal experiences of being treated as an outsider due to his German heritage during World War I. Gibson speculated that much of Mencken's language was intended to lure in readers by suggesting a shared negative view of other races, and then writing about their positive aspects. Describing Mencken as elitist rather than racist, he says Mencken ultimately believed that humans consisted of a small group of those of superior intelligence and a mass of inferior people, regardless of race.\nMencken scholar Marion Elizabeth Rodgers has argued that, despite the racial slurs and ethnic slang in the diaries, Mencken rebelled against \"the Aryan imbecilities of Hitler\" and stated: \"To me personally, race prejudice is one of the most preposterous of all the imbecilities of mankind. There are so few people on earth worth knowing that I hate to think of any man I like as a German or a Frenchman, a gentile or a Jew, Negro or a white man.\"\nAnglo-Saxons.\nMencken countered the arguments for Anglo-Saxon superiority prevalent in his time in a 1923 essay entitled \"The Anglo-Saxon\", which argued that if there was such a thing as a pure \"Anglo-Saxon\" race, it was defined by its inferiority and cowardice: \"The normal American of the 'pure-blooded' majority goes to rest every night with an uneasy feeling that there is a burglar under the bed and he gets up every morning with a sickening fear that his underwear has been stolen.\"\nJews.\nChaz Bufe, an admirer of Mencken, wrote that Mencken's various anti-Semitic statements should be understood in the context that Mencken made bombastic and over-the-top denunciations of almost any national, religious, and ethnic group. One of his autobiographers noted:\nThat said, Bufe still wrote that some of Mencken's statements were \"odious\", such as his claim in his 1918 introduction to Nietzsche's \"The Anti-Christ\" that \"The case against the Jews is long and damning; it would justify ten thousand times as many pogroms as now go on in the world\". Mencken was also an Axis sympathizer who berated the Allied war effort as late as 1944.\nHistorian David T. Beito points out, however, that Mencken often showed greater sensitivity toward the suffering of Jews than most other leading figures during the period, including Franklin D. Roosevelt. In January 1939, for example, Mencken proposed immediate admission to the U.S of all the German Jews. There was \u201cno reason whatsoever for believing it would be impossible to absorb them, or even difficult.\u201d Mencken pointed out that \u201cAlmost as many Jews as that came \ninto the United States during every year from 1903 to 1914, and \nyet the republic somehow survived.\u201d He considered it unfair to \nexpect American Jews to carry the funding burden because it would only make them targets of the \u201cKu Kluxers.\u201d He challenged \nthe \u201cso-called Christians . . . who are now so free with weasel words of comfort and flattery, and so curiously stingy with practical aid\u201d to take financial responsibility. \nMemorials.\nHome.\nMencken's home at 1524 Hollins Street in Baltimore's Union Square neighborhood, where he lived for 67 years, was bequeathed to the University of Maryland, Baltimore on the death of his younger brother, August, in 1967. The City of Baltimore acquired the property in 1983, and the H. L. Mencken House became part of the City Life Museums. The house was restored in 2019, with the third floor and rear of the second floor becoming the headquarters of the Baltimore National Heritage Area. The first floor and front of the second floor appear much as they were in the 1940s, and constitute the H. L. Mencken House Museum, overseen by the nonprofit Society to Preserve H. L. Mencken's Legacy. It is opened for special events, and individual and group visits are available by arrangement.\nPapers.\nShortly after World War\u00a0II, Mencken expressed his intention of bequeathing his books and papers to Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library. At his death, it was in possession of most of the present large collection. As a result, his papers as well as much of his personal library, which includes many books inscribed by major authors, are held in the Library's Central Branch on Cathedral Street in Baltimore. The original third floor \"H.\u00a0L. Mencken Room and Collection\" housing this collection was dedicated on April 17, 1956. The new Mencken Room, on the first floor of the Library's Annex, was opened in November 2003.\nThe collection contains Mencken's typescripts, newspaper and magazine contributions, published books, family documents and memorabilia, clipping books, large collection of presentation volumes, file of correspondence with prominent Marylanders, and the extensive material he collected while he was preparing \"The American Language\".\nOther Mencken related collections of note are at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, Princeton University, Johns Hopkins University, and Yale University. In 2007, Johns Hopkins acquired \"nearly 6,000 books, photographs and letters by and about Mencken\" from \"the estate of an Ohio accountant\".\nThe Sara Haardt Mencken collection at Goucher College includes letters exchanged between Haardt and Mencken and condolences written after her death. Some of Mencken's vast literary correspondence is held at the New York Public Library. \"Gift of HL Mencken 1929\" is stamped on \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\", Luce 1906 edition of William Blake, which shows up from the Library of Congress online version for reading. Mencken's letters to Louise (Lou) Wylie, a reporter and feature writer for New Orleans's \"The Times-Picayune\" newspaper, are archived at Loyola University New Orleans.\nWorks.\nBooks.\nPosthumous collections\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Independent motorcycle racing events have been held since the start of the twentieth century and large national events were often given the title Grand Prix. The foundation of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme as the international governing body for motorcycle sport in 1949 provided the opportunity to coordinate rules and regulations in order that selected events could count towards official World Championships. It is the oldest established motorsport world championship.\nGrand Prix motorcycles are purpose-built racing machines that are unavailable for purchase by the general public and unable to be ridden legally on public roads. This contrasts with the various production-based categories of racing, such as the Superbike World Championship and the Isle of Man TT Races that feature modified versions of road-going motorcycles available to the public. The top-division is known as MotoGP since 2002, when the four-stroke era began. Prior to that, the largest class was 500cc, both of which form a historical continuum as the official World Championship, although all classes have official status.\nThe championship is divided into three classes: the eponymous MotoGP, Moto2, Moto3. All three classes use four-stroke engines. \nThe most successful rider in Grand Prix history is Giacomo Agostini with 15 titles and 122 race wins. In the top-flight series, Agostini holds the title record with eight, followed by Valentino Rossi and active rider Marc M\u00e1rquez with seven. As of 2025, Rossi holds the record for most top-flight race wins with 89.\nHistory.\nAn FIM Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix was first organized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme in 1949. The commercial rights are now owned by Dorna Sports, with the FIM remaining as the sport sanctioning body. Teams are represented by the International Road Racing Teams Association (IRTA) and manufacturers by the Motorcycle Sport Manufacturers Association (MSMA). Rules and changes to regulations are decided between the four entities, with Dorna casting a tie-breaking vote. In cases of technical modifications, the MSMA can unilaterally enact or veto changes by unanimous vote among its members. These four entities compose the Grand Prix Commission.\nThere have traditionally been several races at each event for various classes of motorcycles, based on engine size, and one class for sidecars. Classes for 50cc, 80cc, 125cc, 250cc, 350cc, 500cc, and 750cc solo machines have existed at some time, and 350cc and 500cc sidecars. Up through the 1950s and most of the 1960s, four-stroke engines dominated all classes. In the 1960s, due to advances in engine design and technology, two-stroke engines began to take root in the smaller classes.\nIn 1969, the FIM\u2014citing high development costs for non-works teams due to rules which allowed a multiplicity of cylinders (meaning smaller pistons, producing higher revs) and a multiplicity of gears (giving narrower power bands, affording higher states of tune)\u2014brought in new rules restricting all classes to six gears and most to two cylinders (four cylinders in the case of the 350cc and 500cc classes). This led to a mass walk-out of the sport by the previously highly successful Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha manufacturer teams, skewing the results tables for the next several years, with MV Agusta effectively the only works team left in the sport until Yamaha (1973) and Suzuki (1974) returned with new two-stroke designs. By this time, two-strokes completely eclipsed the four-strokes in all classes. In 1979, Honda, on its return to GP racing, made an attempt to return the four-stroke to the top class with the NR500, but this project failed, and, in 1983, even Honda was winning with a two-stroke 500.\nPreviously, the championship featured a 50cc class from 1962 to 1983, later changed to an 80cc class from 1984 to 1989. The class was dropped for the 1990 season, after being dominated primarily by Spanish and Italian makers. It also featured a 350cc class from 1949 to 1982, and a 750cc class from 1977 to 1979. Sidecars were dropped from World Championship events after 1996 (see Sidecar World Championship).\nFrom the mid-1970s through to 2001, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc displacement with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. This is unlike TT Formula or motocross, where two and four strokes had different engine size limits in the same class to provide similar performance. Consequently, all machines were two-strokes, since they produce power with every rotation of the crank, whereas four-stroke engines produce power only every second rotation. Some two- and three-cylinder two-stroke 500s were seen, but though they had a minimum-weight advantage under the rules, typically attained higher corner speed and could qualify well, they lacked the power of the four-cylinder machines.\nIn 2002, rule changes were introduced to facilitate the phasing out of the 500cc two-strokes. The premier class was rebranded MotoGP, as manufacturers were to choose between running two-stroke engines up to 500cc or four-strokes up to 990cc or less. Manufacturers were also permitted to employ their choice of engine configuration. Despite the increased costs of the new four-stroke engines, they were soon able to dominate their two-stroke rivals. As a result, by 2003 no two-stroke machines remained in the MotoGP field. The 125cc and 250cc classes still consisted exclusively of two-stroke machines.\nIn 2007, the MotoGP class had its maximum engine displacement capacity reduced to 800cc for a minimum of five years. In 2009, during the Great Recession, in an effort to cut costs, MotoGP underwent changes including reducing Friday practice sessions and testing sessions, extending the lifespan of engines, switching to a single tyre manufacturer, and banning qualifying tyres, active suspension, launch control and ceramic composite brakes. For the 2010 season, carbon brake discs were banned.\nFor the 2012 season, the MotoGP engine capacity was increased again to 1,000cc. It also saw the introduction of Claiming Rule Teams (CRT), which were given more engines per season and larger fuel tanks than factory teams, but were subject to a factory team buying (\"claiming\") their rival's powertrain for a fixed price. The sport's governing body received applications from sixteen new teams looking to join the MotoGP class. For the 2014 season, the CRT subclass was rebranded Open, as the claiming rule was removed. Also, all entries adopted a standard engine control unit, with factory teams being allowed to run any software, and Open entries using a standard software. For the 2016 season, the Open subclass was dropped, and factory entries switched to a standard engine control unit software.\nIn 2010, the 250cc two-stroke class was replaced by the new Moto2 600cc four-stroke class. In 2012, the 125cc two-stroke class was replaced by the Moto3 250cc four-stroke class with a weight limit of 65\u00a0kg with fuel. For the 2019 season Moto2 introduced the 3-cylinder, 765cc Triumph production engine, while Moto3 and MotoGP still use prototype engines.\nMotoE was introduced in as a \"World Cup\" until and gained World Championship status only from until , because MotoE class on hiatus after the 2025 season.\nEvent format.\nThe starting grid consists of three columns and features around 20 riders. Grid positions are determined based on qualifying speeds, arranged in descending order, with the fastest rider occupying the pole. Each race is a 45-minute sprint, completed without any fuel or tyre stops. \nIn 2005, a flag-to-flag rule for MotoGP was introduced. Previously, if a race started dry and rain fell, officials could red-flag (stop) the race and either restart or resume on 'wet' tyres. Now, when rain falls, a white flag is shown, indicating that riders can pit to swap the motorcycle on which they started the race for an identical one, as long as the tyres are different (that is, intermediates or wets instead of slicks). Besides different tyres, the wet-weather bikes have steel brake rotors and different brake pads instead of the carbon discs and pads used on the 'dry' bikes. This is because the carbon brakes need to be very hot to function properly, and the water cools them too much. The suspension is also 'softened' up somewhat for the wet weather.\nWhen a rider crashes, track marshals up the track from the incident wave yellow flags, prohibiting overtaking in that area; one corner farther up the track, a stationary yellow flag is shown. If a fallen rider cannot be evacuated safely from the track, the race is red-flagged. Motorcycle crashes are usually one of two types: lowside, when the bike loses either front or rear tyre grip and slides out on the \"low\" side, and the more dangerous highside, when the tyres do not completely slide out, but instead grip the track surface, flipping the bike over to the \"high side\", usually catapulting the rider over the top. Increased use of traction control has made highsides much less frequent.\n2023 saw the introduction of 'Sprint' race events; these races take place on the Saturday of the race weekend with the traditional Grand Prix taking place on the Sunday. The 'Sprint' races are shorter - approximately half the length of a Grand Prix. Riders score approximately half the points in these races.\nRiders.\nTwenty-two riders entered the full 2026 MotoGP World Championship.\nChampions.\nThe Riders' World Championship is awarded to the most successful rider over a season, as determined by a points system based on Grand Prix results.\nGiacomo Agostini is the most successful champion in Grand Prix history, with 15 titles to his name (8 in the 500cc class and 7 in the 350cc class). The most dominant rider of all time was Mike Hailwood, winning 10 out of 12 (83%) races, in the 250cc class, in the 1966 season. Mick Doohan, who won 12 out of 15 (80%) of the 500cc races in the 1997 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season also deserves an honourable mention. Valentino Rossi is the most successful contemporary rider, having won nine titles including seven 500cc/MotoGP titles (2001\u20132005, 2008\u20132009), and one each at 250cc and 125cc levels (Shared with Marc M\u00e1rquez). The current champion is Spanish rider Marc M\u00e1rquez.\nCircuits.\nThe 2026 MotoGP World Championship consists of 22 circuits.\nTechnical regulations.\nThe following shows the key technical regulations for each class. It was also introduced for the 2005 year, that under rule 2.10.5: 'No fuel on the motorcycle may be more than 15\u00a0\u00b0C below ambient temperature. The use of any device on the motorcycle to artificially decrease the temperature of the fuel below ambient temperature is forbidden. No motorcycle may include such a device.' This stops an artificial \"boost\" gained from increasing fuel density by cooling it.\nMotoGP class.\nAt the beginning of the new MotoGP era in 2002, 500cc two-stroke or 990cc four-stroke bikes were specified to race. The enormous power advantage of the twice as large displacement four-stroke engine over the half the size two-stroke meant that by the following season, no two-stroke bikes were racing. In 2007, the maximum engine capacity was reduced to 800cc without reducing the existing weight restriction.\nMotoGP-class motorcycles are not restricted to any specific engine configuration. However, the number of cylinders employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; the weight of the extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap. This is necessary because, for a given capacity, an engine with more cylinders is capable of producing more power. If comparable bore to stroke ratios are employed, an engine with more cylinders will have a greater piston area and a shorter stroke. The increased piston area permits an increase in the total valve area, allowing more air and fuel to be drawn into the engine, and the shorter stroke permits higher revs at the same piston speed, allowing the engine to pump still more air and fuel with the potential to produce more power, but with more fuel consumption too. In 2004 motorcycles were entered with three-, four-and five-cylinder configurations. A six-cylinder engine was proposed by Blata, but it did not reach the MotoGP grids. Presently four-cylinder engines appear to offer the best compromise between weight, power, and fuel consumption as all competitors in the 2009 series used this solution in either 'V' or in-line configuration.\nIn 2002, the FIM became concerned about the advances in design and engineering that resulted in higher speeds around the race track; regulation changes related to weight, amount of available fuel and engine capacity were introduced. The amended rules reduced engine capacity to 800cc from 990cc and restricted the amount of available fuel for race distance from in year 2004 to in year 2007 and onwards. In addition, the minimum weight of four-cylinder bikes used by all participating teams was increased by .\nThe top speed in the history of MotoGP is , set by Brad Binder and Pol Espargar\u00f3 at Mugello Circuit, both with a KTM RC16.\nOn 11 December 2009, the Grand Prix Commission announced that the MotoGP class would switch to the 1,000cc motor limit starting in the 2012 season. Maximum displacement was limited to 1,000cc, maximum cylinders were limited to four, and maximum bore was capped at . Carmelo Ezpeleta, the CEO of Dorna Sports, indicated that the projected changes were received by the teams favorably.\nFrom 2012, teams not entered by one of the major manufacturers could seek \"claiming rule team\" (CRT) status. Claiming rule team were intended to allow independent teams to be competitive at a lower cost and increase the number of entries in MotoGP. Claiming rule teams benefitted from less restrictive rules on the number of engines that could be used in a season, and with larger fuel allowances during the races. Under the claiming rule, CRTs agree to allow up to four of their engines per season to be claimed, after a race, by one of the major manufacturer teams at a cost of \u20ac20,000 each including transmission, or \u20ac15,000 each for the engine alone. From the 2014 season, the CRT class was dropped in favour of an \"Open Class\" specification - allowing teams using the control ECU hardware and software certain benefits to increase their competitiveness.\nFrom 2023, front ride height \u2013 or holeshot \u2013 devices were banned. These devices have been common place in MotoGP since the back-end of 2018, when Ducati first introduced a system that could lower the rear of its bike to help with acceleration off the line for race starts.\nFrom 2027, all ride height devices will be banned. Maximum displacement will be 850cc and aerodynamics will be more tightly regulated. Motorcycles will use 100% sustainable fuel, up from 40% sustainable fuel the sport has used since 2024. GPS data for all riders will be available after each session. All teams will have their concession rank reset to B.\nMoto2 class.\nMoto2 was initially a 600cc four-stroke class introduced in 2010 to replace the traditional 250cc two-stroke class. Engines were supplied exclusively by Honda, tyres by Dunlop and electronics are limited and supplied only by FIM-sanctioned producers. Carbon brake discs are banned, only steel brake discs are allowed. However, there are no chassis limitations. Until 2019, only 600cc four-stroke Moto2 machines were allowed.\nIn 2019 Triumph replaced Honda as the sole supplier of Moto2 engines. The Triumph's engine configuration is 765cc displacement with three cylinders, contrasting with the previous Honda's 600cc in-line four. In 2024 Pirelli became the sole tyre supplier in Moto2 and Moto3, replacing Dunlop. \nMoto3 class.\nThe 125cc class was replaced in 2012 by the Moto3 class. This class is restricted to single-cylinder 250cc four-stroke engines with a maximum bore of . The minimum total weight for motorcycle and rider is . Traditionally, the age limits for Moto3 were 16-28, with an upper limit of 25 for new contracted riders participating for the first time and wild-cards. A change of rules was introduced in 2014, allowing under-age FIM CEV Repsol Moto3 (junior) champions to participate in a subsequent Moto3 series at World Championship level. The first beneficiary of this rule-change was double (2013 and 2014) CEV champion Fabio Quartararo. However, after a rash of incidents involving young rider fatalities in lower classes, the FIM set a minimum age of 18 starting in the 2023 season.\nTyres.\nTyre selection is critical, usually done by the individual rider based on bike 'feel' during practice, qualifying and the pre-race warm-up laps on the morning of the race, as well as the predicted weather. The typical compromise is between grip and longevity\u2014softer compound tyres have more traction, but wear out more quickly; harder compound tyres have less traction, but are more likely to last the entire race. Conserving rubber throughout a race is a specific skill winning riders acquire. Special 'Q' or qualifying tyres of extreme softness and grip were typically used during grid-qualifying sessions until their use was discontinued at the end of the 2008 season, but they lasted typically no longer than one or two laps, though they could deliver higher qualifying speeds. In wet conditions, special tyres ('wets') with full treads are used, but they suffer extreme wear if the track dries out.\nIn 2007 new MotoGP regulations limited the number of tyres any rider could use over the practice and qualifying period, and the race itself, to a maximum of 31 tyres (14 fronts and 17 rears) per rider. This introduced a problem of tyre choice versus weather (among other factors) that challenges riders and teams to optimize their performance on race day. This factor was greeted with varying degrees of enthusiasm by participants. Bridgestone had dominated in 2007 and Michelin riders Valentino Rossi, Nicky Hayden, Dani Pedrosa, and Colin Edwards all acknowledged shortcomings in Michelin's race tyres relative to Bridgestone. Rossi, disappointed with and critical of the performance of his Michelin tyres, switched to Bridgestones for 2008 and won the world championship in dominant fashion. Pedrosa controversially switched to Bridgestones during the 2008 season.\nIn 2008, the rules were amended to allow more tyres per race weekend\u201418 fronts and 22 rears for a total of 40 tyres. The lower number of tyres per weekend was considered a handicap to Michelin riders. The only MotoGP team using Dunlop Tyres in 2007, Yamaha Tech 3, did not use them in 2008 but switched to Michelin.\nFor 2009, 2010 and 2011, a 'spec' tyre supplier, Bridgestone, was appointed by the FIM (with Michelin no longer supplying any tyres to MotoGP and returning to the category in 2016). For the whole season Bridgestone provided four specifications of front tyre, six of rear, and a single wet specification\u2014with no qualifying specification. For each round Bridgestone provided only two specifications for front and rear. Tyres are assigned to riders randomly to assure impartiality. Jorge Lorenzo has publicly supported the mono tyre rule.\nAt the end of the 2015 season, Bridgestone withdrew as tyre supplier of MotoGP. Following a formal tender, French tyre manufacturer Michelin became the official supplier for the 2016 season, marking their return to the series and testing began in Aragon immediately after the end of the 2015 season.\nAfter the first race of the 2025 season, it was announced that Pirelli will be the tyre supplier of MotoGP from 2027, which includes the Moto2 and Moto3 Championships using Pirelli since 2024.\nIn media.\nVideo games.\nEarly Grand Prix video games include \"Grand Prix 500cc\" (1987), ' (1989), \"Grand Prix 500 2\" (1991) and \"GP-1\" (1993). The first simulator was \"GP 500\", launched in 1999. In the early 2000s, THQ published five video games for Windows and Xbox platforms, the first being ' (2002) and the last \"MotoGP '07\" (2007), whereas Namco of Japan published and in-house developed five video games for PlayStation platforms starting with \"MotoGP\" (2000) and ending with \"MotoGP\" (2006). In 2007, Capcom became the new PlayStation publisher and worked together with Italy-based Milestone to produce \"MotoGP '07 (PS2)\" and some of its successors. In 2008, THQ lost the MotoGP licence and Capcom became the exclusive publisher.\n\"MotoGP 2010\", an iOS game made in 2010 by I-Play, released on 3 September 2010 and was not received well by critics after having a 43% rating on Metacritic. \"MotoGP 10/11\" was released by Capcom on 15 March 2011, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Metacritic gave the game a rating of 72%. \nIn 2013, Milestone got the exclusive license for MotoGP video games, a contract that will now last until at least 2026. \nThe first game in this run of their contract was \"MotoGP 13\", which was released on 21 June 2013 on PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The game received mixed reviews and scored 73%. As of May 2025 the latest release is \"MotoGP 25\" on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.\nThe game GPBikes allows players to ride Grand Prix bikes such as the Cagiva 500.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In monotheism, the single God is often also the creator. A number of monolatristic traditions separate a secondary creator from a primary transcendent being, identified as a primary creator.\nMonotheism.\nAtenism.\nInitiated by Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti around 1330\u00a0BCE, during the New Kingdom period in ancient Egyptian history. They built an entirely new capital city (Akhetaten) for themselves and worshippers of their sole creator god in a wilderness. His father used to worship Aten alongside other gods of their polytheistic religion. Aten, for a long time before his father's time, was revered as a god among the many gods and goddesses in Egypt. Atenism was countermanded by later pharaoh Tutankhamun, as chronicled in the artifact, the Restoration Stela. Despite different views, Atenism is considered by some scholars to be one of the frontiers of monotheism in human history.\nAbrahamic religions.\nJudaism.\nThe Genesis creation narrative is the creation myth of both Judaism and Christianity. The narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the Book of Genesis. In the first, Elohim (the Hebrew generic word for God) creates the heavens and the Earth, the animals, and mankind in six days, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the seventh (i.e. the Biblical Sabbath). In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name Yahweh, creates Adam, the first man, from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden, where he is given dominion over the animals. Eve, the first woman, is created from Adam and as his companion.\nIt expounds themes parallel to those in Mesopotamian mythology, emphasizing the Israelite people's belief in one God. The first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch (the series of five books which begins with Genesis and ends with Deuteronomy) was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the Jahwist source) and was later expanded by other authors (the Priestly source) into a work very similar to Genesis as known today. The two sources can be identified in the creation narrative: Priestly and Jahwistic. The combined narrative is a critique of the Mesopotamian theology of creation: Genesis affirms monotheism and denies polytheism. Robert Alter described the combined narrative as \"compelling in its archetypal character, its adaptation of myth to monotheistic ends\".\nChristianity.\nThe Abrahamic creation narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the two first chapters of the Book of Genesis. The first account (1:1 through 2:3) employs a repetitious structure of divine fiat and fulfillment, then the statement \"And there was evening and there was morning, the [\"x\"th] day,\" for each of the six days of creation. In each of the first three days there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the \"waters above\" from the \"waters below\", and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with sun, moon, and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally, land-based creatures and mankind populate the land.\nThe first (the Priestly story) was concerned with the cosmic plan of creation, while the second (the Yahwist story) focuses on man as cultivator of his environment and as a moral agent. The second account, in contrast to the regimented seven-day scheme of Genesis 1, uses a simple flowing narrative style that proceeds from God's forming the first man through the Garden of Eden to the creation of the first woman and the institution of marriage. In contrast to the omnipotent God of Genesis 1 creating a god-like humanity, the God of Genesis 2 can fail as well as succeed. The humanity he creates is not god-like, but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like (Genesis 3:1-24) and the order and method of creation itself differs. \"Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in Genesis 1:1 and Gen 2:4, however elegantly they have now been combined.\"\nAn early conflation of Greek philosophy with the narratives in the Hebrew Bible came from Philo of Alexandria (d. 50\u00a0CE), writing in the context of Hellenistic Judaism. Philo equated the Hebrew creator-deity Yahweh with Aristotle's unmoved mover (First Cause) in an attempt to prove that the Jews had held monotheistic views even before the Greeks.\nA similar theoretical proposition was demonstrated by Thomas Aquinas, who linked Aristotelian philosophy with the Christian faith, followed by the statement that God is the First Being, the First Mover, and is Pure Act.\nThe deuterocanonical 2 Maccabees has two relevant passages. At chapter 7, it narrows about the mother of a Jewish proto-martyr telling to her son: \"I beseech thee, my son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: and consider that God made them out of nothing, and mankind also\"; at chapter 1, it refers a solemn prayer hymned by Jonathan, Nehemiah and the Priest of Israel, while making sacrifices in honour of God: \"O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art fearefull, and strong, and righteous, and mercifull, and the onely, and gracious king\".\nThe begins with: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.\"\nChristianity affirms the creation by God since its early time in the Apostles' Creed (\"I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.\", 1st century CE), that is symmetrical to the Nicene Creed (4th century CE).\nNowadays, theologians debate whether the Bible itself teaches if this creation by God is a creation \"ex nihilo\". Traditional interpreters argue on grammatical and syntactical grounds that this is the meaning of Genesis 1:1, which is commonly rendered: \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" However, other interpreters understand creation \"ex nihilo\" as a 2nd-century theological development. According to this view, church fathers opposed notions appearing in \"pre\"-Christian creation myths and in Gnosticism\u2014notions of creation by a demiurge out of a primordial state of matter (known in religious studies as \"chaos\" after the Greek term used by Hesiod in his \"Theogony\").\nJewish thinkers took up the idea, which became important to Judaism.\nIslam.\nAccording to Islam, the creator deity, God, known as Allah, is the all-powerful and all-knowing Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer, and Judge of the universe. Creation is seen as an act of divine choice and mercy, one with a grand purpose: \"And We did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.\" Rather, the purpose of humanity is to be tested: \"Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving;\" Those who pass the test are rewarded with Paradise: \"Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of (the heart's) desires;\"\nAccording to the Islamic teachings, God exists above the heavens and the creation itself. The Quran mentions, \"He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He Istawa (rose over) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything.\" At the same time, God is unlike anything in creation: \"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\" and nobody can perceive God in totality: \"Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.\" God in Islam is not only majestic and sovereign, but also a personal God: \"And indeed We have created man, and We know what his ownself whispers to him. And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge).\" Allah commands the believers to constantly remember Him (\"O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance\") and to invoke Him alone (\"And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof\u2014then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.\").\nIslam teaches that God as referenced in the Qur'an is the only god and the same God worshipped by members of other Abrahamic religions such as Christianity and Judaism.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nIn the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence. He is described as \"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\". Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator.\nMandaeism.\nIn Mandaeism, \"Hayyi Rabbi\" (lit=The Great Life), or 'The Great Living God', is the supreme God from which all things emanate. He is also known as 'The First Life', since during the creation of the material world, Yushamin emanated from Hayyi Rabbi as the \"Second Life.\" \"The principles of the Mandaean doctrine: the belief of the only one great God, Hayyi Rabbi, to whom all absolute properties belong; He created all the worlds, formed the soul through his power, and placed it by means of angels into the human body. So He created Adam and Eve, the first man and woman.\" Mandaeans recognize God to be the eternal, creator of all, the one and only in domination who has no partner.\nSikhism.\nOne of the biggest responsibilities in the faith of Sikhism is to worship God as \"The Creator\", termed \"Waheguru\", who is shapeless, timeless, and sightless, i.e., Nirankar, Akal, and Alakh Niranjan. The religion only takes after the belief in \"One God for All\" or Ik Onkar.\nMonolatrism.\nMonolatristic traditions would separate a secondary creator from the primary transcendent being, identified as a primary creator. According to Gaudiya Vaishnavas, Brahma is the secondary creator and not the supreme. Vishnu is the primary creator. According to Vaishnava belief Vishnu creates the basic universal shell and provides all the raw materials and also places the living entities within the material world, fulfilling their own independent will. Brahma works with the materials provided by Vishnu to actually create what are believed to be planets in Puranic terminology, and he supervises the population of them.\nMonism.\nMonism is the philosophy that asserts oneness as its fundamental premise, and it contradicts the dualism-based theistic premise that there is a creator God that is eternal and separate from the rest of existence. There are two types of monism, namely spiritual monism which holds that all spiritual reality is one, and material monism which holds that everything including all material reality is one and the same thing.\nNon-creationism.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator.\nJainism.\nJainism does not support belief in a creator deity. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents\u2014soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a static universe similar to that of Epicureanism and steady state cosmological model). All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of conservation of mass). Similarly, the soul of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[a]\nThe Jain theory of causation holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and therefore a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the cosmos; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\nThrough the ages, Jain philosophers have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as \"n\u0101stika darsana\" or atheist philosophy by the rival religious philosophies. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its cosmology, karma, moksa and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.\nPolytheism.\nIn polytheistic creation, the world often comes into being organically, e.g. sprouting from a primal seed, sexually, by miraculous birth (sometimes by parthenogenesis), by hieros gamos, violently, by the slaying of a primeval monster, or artificially, by a divine demiurge or \"craftsman\". Sometimes, a god is involved, wittingly or unwittingly, in bringing about creation. Examples include:\nPlatonic demiurge.\nPlato, in his dialogue \"Timaeus\", describes a creation myth involving a being called the demiurge ( \"craftsman\"). Neoplatonism and Gnosticism continued and developed this concept. In Neoplatonism, the demiurge represents the second cause or dyad, after the monad. In Gnostic dualism, the demiurge is an imperfect spirit and possibly an evil being, transcended by divine Fullness (Pleroma). Unlike the Abrahamic God, Plato's demiurge is unable to create ex-nihilo.\nHinduism.\nHinduism is a diverse system of thought with beliefs spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, pandeism, monism, and atheism among others; and its concept of creator deity is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed. Hinduism is sometimes referred to as henotheistic (i.e., involving devotion to a single god while accepting the existence of others), but any such term is an overgeneralization.\nThe \"Nasadiya Sukta\" (\"Creation Hymn\") of the \"Rigveda\" is one of the earliest texts which \"demonstrates a sense of metaphysical speculation\" about what created the universe, the concept of god(s) and The One, and whether even The One knows how the universe came into being. The \"Rig Veda\" praises various deities, none superior nor inferior, in a henotheistic manner. The hymns repeatedly refer to One Truth and Reality. The \"One Truth\" of Vedic literature, in modern era scholarship, has been interpreted as monotheism, monism, as well as a deified Hidden Principles behind the great happenings and processes of nature.\nThe post-Vedic texts of Hinduism offer multiple theories of cosmogony, many involving Brahma. These include \"Sarga\" (primary creation of universe) and \"Visarga\" (secondary creation), ideas related to the Indian thought that there are two levels of reality, one primary that is unchanging (metaphysical) and other secondary that is always changing (empirical), and that all observed reality of the latter is in an endless repeating cycle of existence, that cosmos and life we experience is continually created, evolved, dissolved and then re-created. The primary creator is extensively discussed in Vedic cosmogonies with \"Brahman\" or \"Purusha\" or \"Devi\" among the terms used for the primary creator, while the Vedic and post-Vedic texts name different gods and goddesses as secondary creators (often Brahma in post-Vedic texts), and in some cases a different god or goddess is the secondary creator at the start of each cosmic cycle (\"kalpa\", aeon).\nBrahma is a \"secondary creator\" as described in the \"Mahabharata\" and Puranas, and among the most studied and described. Born from a lotus emerging from the navel of Vishnu, Brahma creates all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself. In contrast, the Shiva-focused Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by Ardhanarishvara, that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from Rudra, or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons (kalpa). Thus in most Puranic texts, Brahma's creative activity depends on the presence and power of a higher god.\nIn other versions of creation, the creator deity is the one who is equivalent to the Brahman, the metaphysical reality in Hinduism. In Vaishnavism, Vishnu creates Brahma and orders him to order the rest of universe. In Shaivism, Shiva may be treated as the creator. In Shaktism, the Great Goddess creates the Trimurti.\nOther.\nKongo religion.\nThe Bakongo people traditionally believe in Nzambi Mpungu, the Creator God, whom the Portuguese compared to the Christian God during colonization. They also believe his female counterpart called \"Nzambici\", the ancestors (\"bakulu\") as well as guardian spirits, such as Lemba, the basimbi, bakisi and bakita. Oral tradition accounts that in the beginning, there was only a circular void (\"mb\u00fbngi\") with no life. Nzambi Mpungu summoned a spark of fire (\"Kal\u00fbnga\") that grew until it filled the mb\u00fbngi. When it grew too large, Kal\u00fbnga became a great force of energy and unleashed heated elements across space, forming the universe with the sun, stars, planets, etc. Because of this, Kal\u00fbnga is seen as the origin of life and a force of motion. The Bakongo believe that life requires constant change and perpetual motion. Nzambi Mpunga is also referred to as Kal\u00fbnga, the God of change. Similarities between the Bakongo belief of Kal\u00fbnga and the Big Bang Theory have been studied.\nNzambi is also said to have created two worlds. As Kal\u00fbnga filled mb\u00fbngi, it created an invisible line that divided the circle in half. The top half represents the physical world (\"Ku Nseke\" or \"nsi a bam\u00f4yo\"), while the bottom half represents the spiritual world of the ancestors (\"Ku Mp\u00e8mba\"). The Kal\u00fbnga line separates these two worlds, and all living things exists on one side or another. After creation, the line and the mb\u00fbngi circle became a river, carrying people between the worlds at birth and death. Then the process repeats and a person is reborn. A simbi (pl. bisimbi) is a water spirit that is believed to inhabit bodies of water and rocks, having the ability to guide \"bakulu\", or the ancestors, along the Kal\u00fbnga line to the spiritual world after death. They are also present during the baptisms of African American Christians, according to Hoodoo tradition.\nChinese traditional cosmology.\nPangu can be interpreted as another creator deity. In the beginning there was nothing in the universe except a formless chaos. However this chaos began to coalesce into a cosmic egg for eighteen thousand years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of yin and yang became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy giant with horns on his head and clad in furs. Pangu set about the task of creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the Earth (murky \"Yin\") and the Sky (clear \"Yang\"). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. This task took eighteen thousand years, with each day the sky grew ten feet higher, the Earth ten feet wider, and Pangu ten feet taller. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the Turtle, the Qilin, the Phoenix, and the Dragon.\nAfter eighteen thousand years had elapsed, Pangu was laid to rest. His breath became the wind; his voice the thunder; left eye the sun and right eye the moon; his body became the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his muscles the fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the bushes and forests; his bones the valuable minerals; his bone marrows sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became human beings all over the world.\nThe first writer to record the myth of Pangu was Xu Zheng during the Three Kingdoms period.\nShangdi is another creator deity, possibly prior to Pangu; sharing concepts similar to Abrahamic faiths.\nKazakh.\nAccording to Kazakh folk tales, Jasagnan is the creator of the world.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typically, the designations are that of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer.\nThe Om symbol of Hinduism is considered to have an allusion to Trimurti, where the A, U, and M phonemes of the word are considered to indicate creation, preservation and destruction, adding up to represent Brahman. The Tridevi is the trinity of goddess consorts for the Trimurti.\nEvolution.\nThe Puranic period from the 4th to the 12th century CE saw the rise of post-Vedic religion and the evolution of what R. C. Majumdar calls \"synthetic Hinduism.\"\nFollowing is a well-known verse from the Vishnu Purana (1.2.66) that mentions Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva together in a single verse, highlighting their roles within the cosmic functions of creation, preservation, and destruction.\nr\u016bp\u0101\u1e47i tr\u012b\u1e47i tatraiva m\u016brttibheda-vibh\u0101gata\u1e25 |&lt;br&gt;\naj\u0101myek\u0101m\u015bam \u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 \u015biva-r\u016bpe\u1e47a tishthati ||&lt;br&gt;\njagata\u1e25 sthiti-samdh\u0101na\u1e41 samharanti yuge yuge |&lt;br&gt;\ntraya\u1e41 brahma-mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u0101he\u015bvara-iti sm\u1e5btam ||&lt;br&gt;\nTranslation: \"In this way, the one supreme entity divides itself into three forms\u2014Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh (Shiva)\u2014taking on different aspects. It creates, preserves, and destroys the universe in various ages.\"\nThis period had no homogeneity, and included orthodox Brahmanism in the form of remnants of older Vedic faith traditions, along with different sectarian religions, notably Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism that were within the orthodox fold yet still formed distinct entities. One of the important traits of this period is a spirit of harmony between orthodox and sectarian forms. \nRegarding this spirit of reconciliation, R. C. Majumdar says that:\nIts most notable expression is to be found in the theological conception of the , in other words, the manifestation of the supreme God in three forms of , , and ... But the attempt cannot be regarded as a great success, for never gained an ascendancy comparable to that of or , and the different sects often conceived the as really the three manifestations of their own sectarian god, whom they regarded as Brahman or Absolute.\nThe identification of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva as one being is strongly emphasized in the \" Pur\u0101\u1e47a\". In verse 1.6, Brahman is worshipped as Trimurti; verse 1.9 especially inculcates the unity of the three gods, and verse 1.26 relates to the same theme. \nNoting Western interest in the idea of trinity, historian A. L. Basham explains the background of the Trimurti as follows:\nThere must be some doubt as to whether the Hindu tradition has ever recognized Brahma as the Supreme Deity in the way that Visnu and Siva have been conceived of and worshiped. The concept of Trimurti is also present in the \"Maitri Upanishad\", where the three gods are explained as three of his supreme forms.\nViews within Hinduism.\nThe word \u2018trimurti\u2019 means \u2018three forms\u2019. In the trimurti, Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the preserver and Shiva is the destroyer.\nRemember the difference between Brahman (with an \u2018n\u2019), which refers to Ultimate Reality, and Brahma (with no \u2018n\u2019), which refers to the creator god.\nShaivism.\nShaivites hold that, according to Shaiva Agama, Shiva performs five actions: creation, preservation, dissolution, grace, and illusion. Respectively, these first three actions are associated with Shiva as Sadyojata (akin to Brahma), Vamadeva (akin to Vishnu) and Aghora (akin to Rudra). \nThus, Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra are not deities different from Shiva, but rather are forms of Shiva. As Brahma/Sadyojata, Shiva creates. As Vishnu/Vamadeva, Shiva preserves. As Rudra/Aghora, he dissolves. This stands in contrast to the idea that Shiva is the \"God of destruction.\" Shiva is the supreme God and performs all actions, of which destruction is only but one. Ergo, the Trimurti is a form of Shiva Himself for Shaivas. \nShaivites believe that Shiva is the Supreme, who assumes various critical roles and assumes appropriate names and forms, and also stands transcending all these. A prominent visual example of a Shaivism version of the Trimurti is the \"Trimurti Sadashiva\" sculpture in the Elephanta Caves on Gharapuri Island.\nVaishnavism.\nDespite the fact that the Vishnu Purana describes that Vishnu manifests as Brahma in order to create and as Rudra (Shiva) in order to destroy, Vaishnavism generally does not acknowledge the Trimurti concept. Instead, they believe in the avataras of Vishnu like Narasimha, Rama, Krishna, and so forth. \nThey also believe that Shiva and Brahma are both forms of Vishnu. For example, the Dvaita school holds Vishnu alone to be the Supreme God, with Shiva subordinate, and interprets the Puranas differently. For example, Vijayindra T\u00eertha, a Dvaita scholar interprets the 18 puranas differently. He interprets the Vaishnavite puranas as satvic and Shaivite puranas as tamasic and that only satvic puranas are considered to be authoritative. \nThe tradition of Sri Vaishnavism in the south holds that all major deities that are hailed in the Puranas are in fact forms of Vishnu, and that the scriptures are dedicated to him alone.\nShaktism.\nThe female-centric Shaktidharma denomination assigns the eminent roles of the three forms (\"Trimurti\") of Supreme Divinity not to masculine gods but instead to feminine goddesses: Mahasarasvati (Creatrix), Mahalaxmi (Preservatrix), and Mahakali (Destructrix). This feminine version of the Trimurti is called \"Tridevi\" (\"three goddesses\"). The masculine gods (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva) are then relegated as auxiliary agents of the supreme feminine Tridevi.\nSmartism.\nSmartism is a denomination of Hinduism that places emphasis on a group of five deities rather than just a single deity. The \"worship of the five forms\" () system, which was popularized by the ninth-century philosopher among orthodox Brahmins of the Sm\u0101rta tradition, invokes the five deities Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Shakti and Surya. later added Kartikeya to these five, making six total. \nThis reformed system was promoted by primarily to unite the principal deities of the six major sects on an equal status. The monistic philosophy preached by made it possible to choose one of these as a preferred principal deity and at the same time worship the other four deities as different forms of the same all-pervading Brahman.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cacao trees are native to the Amazon rainforest. They are the basis of chocolate and Mesoamerican foods including tejate, an indigenous Mexican drink.\nThe cacao tree was first domesticated at least 5,300 years ago by the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in South America before it was introduced in Mesoamerica. Cacao was consumed by pre-Hispanic cultures in spiritual ceremonies, and its beans were a common currency in Mesoamerica. The cacao tree grows in a limited geographical zone; today, West Africa produces nearly 81% of the world's crop. The three main varieties of cocoa plants are Forastero, Criollo, and Trinitario, with Forastero being the most widely used.\nIn 2024, global cocoa bean production reached 5.8 million tonnes, with Ivory Coast leading at 38% of the total, followed by Ghana and Indonesia. Cocoa beans, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder are traded on futures markets, with London focusing on West African cocoa and New York on Southeast Asian cocoa. Various international and national initiatives aim to support sustainable cocoa production, including the Swiss Platform for Sustainable Cocoa (SWISSCO), the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa (GISCO), and Belgium's Beyond Chocolate. At least 29% of global cocoa production was compliant with voluntary sustainability standards in 2016. Deforestation due to cocoa production remains a concern, especially in West Africa. Sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroforestry, can support cocoa production while conserving biodiversity. Cocoa contributes significantly to economies such as Nigeria's, and demand for cocoa products has grown at over 3% annually since 2008.\nCocoa contains phytochemicals like flavanols, procyanidins, and other flavonoids, and flavanol-rich chocolate and cocoa products may have a small blood pressure lowering effect. The beans also contain theobromine and a small amount of caffeine. The tree takes five years to grow and has a typical lifespan of 100 years.\nEtymology.\nCocoa is a variant of cacao, likely due to confusion with the word coco. It is ultimately derived from \"kakaw(a)\", but whether that word originates in Nahuatl or a Mixe-Zoquean language is the subject of substantial linguistic debate.\nThe term \"cocoa beans\" originated in the 19th century; during the 18th century they were called \"chocolate nuts\", \"cocoa nuts\" or just \"cocoa\".\nHistory.\nThe cacao tree is native to the Amazon rainforest. It was first domesticated at least 5,300 years ago, in equatorial South America from the Santa Ana-La Florida (SALF) site in what is present-day southeast Ecuador (Zamora-Chinchipe Province) by the Mayo-Chinchipe culture, before being introduced in Mesoamerica.\nMore than 3,000 years ago, it was consumed by pre-Hispanic cultures along the Yucat\u00e1n, including the Maya, and as far back as Olmeca civilization in spiritual ceremonies. It also grows in the foothills of the Andes in the Amazon region and the Orinoco basins of South America, such as in Colombia and Venezuela. Wild cacao still grows there. Its range may have been larger in the past; evidence of its wild range may be obscured by cultivation of the tree in these areas since long before the Spanish arrived.\nAs of 2018, evidence suggests that cacao was first domesticated in equatorial South America, before being domesticated in Central America roughly 1,500 years later. Artifacts found at Santa-Ana-La Florida, in Ecuador, indicate that the Mayo-Chinchipe people were cultivating cacao as long as 5,300 years ago. Chemical analysis of residue extracted from pottery excavated at an archaeological site at Puerto Escondido, in Honduras, indicates that cocoa products were first consumed there sometime between 1500 and 1400 BC. Evidence also indicates that, long before the flavor of the cacao seed (or bean) became popular, the sweet pulp of the chocolate fruit, used in making a fermented (5.34% alcohol) beverage, first drew attention to the plant in the Americas.\nThe cocoa bean was a common currency throughout Mesoamerica before the Spanish conquest.The bean was utilized in pre-modern Latin America to purchase small items such as tamales and rabbit dinners. A greater quantity of cocoa beans was used to purchase turkey hens and other large items.\nCacao trees grow in a limited geographical zone, of about 20\u00b0 to the north and south of the Equator. More than 70% of the world's cacao crop is grown in Africa, with Ivory Coast and Ghana producing approximately 58% of global production. The cacao plant was first given its botanical name by Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus in his original classification of the plant kingdom, where he called it \"Theobroma\" (\"food of the gods\") \"cacao\".\nCocoa was an important commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. A Spanish soldier who was on Hernan Cort\u00e9s' side during the conquest of the Aztec Empire tells that when Moctezuma II, emperor of the Aztecs, dined, he took no other beverage than chocolate, served in a golden goblet. Flavored with vanilla or other spices, his chocolate was whipped into a froth that dissolved in the mouth. No fewer than 60 portions each day reportedly may have been consumed by Moctezuma II, and 2,000 more by the nobles of his court.\nChocolate was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards, and became a popular beverage by the mid-17th century. Venezuela became the largest producer of cocoa beans in the world. Spaniards also introduced the cacao tree into the West Indies and the Philippines. It was also introduced into the rest of Asia, South Asia and into West Africa by Europeans. In the Gold Coast, modern Ghana, cacao was introduced by a Ghanaian, Tetteh Quarshie.\nVarieties.\nCocoa beans are traditionally classified into three main varieties: Forastero, Criollo and Trinitario. Use of these terms has changed across different contexts and times, and recent genetic research has found that the categories of Forastero and Trinitario are better understood as geohistorical inventions rather than as having a botanical basis. They are still used frequently in marketing material. Criollo has traditionally been the most prized variety. Believed to have been native to South America, by the time of the Spanish conquest they were grown in Mesoamerica. After European colonization, disease and population decrease led to the Spanish and Portuguese using different cacao varieties from South America. Different from the Criollo beans, these new beans were named Forastero, which can be translated as \"strange\" or \"foreign\". They are generally of the Amelonado type and are associated with West Africa. Trinitario refers to any hybrid between Criollo and Forastero.\nCultivation.\nA cocoa pod (fruit) is about long and has a rough, leathery rind about thick (varying with the origin and variety of pod) filled with sweet, mucilaginous pulp (called \"baba de cacao\" in South America) with a lemonade-like taste enclosing 30 to 50 large seeds that are fairly soft and a pale lavender to dark brownish purple color.\nDuring harvest, the pods are opened, the seeds are kept, and the empty pods are discarded and the pulp made into juice. The seeds are placed where they can ferment. Due to heat buildup in the fermentation process, cacao beans lose most of the purplish hue and become mostly brown in color, with an adhered skin which includes the dried remains of the fruity pulp. This skin is released easily by winnowing after roasting. White seeds are found in some rare varieties, usually mixed with purples, and are considered of higher value.\nHarvesting.\nCacao trees grow in hot, rainy tropical areas within 20\u00b0 of latitude from the Equator. Cocoa harvest is not restricted to one period per year and a harvest typically occurs over several months. In fact, in many countries, cocoa can be harvested at any time of the year. Pesticides are often applied to the trees to combat capsid bugs, and fungicides to fight black pod disease.\nImmature cocoa pods have a variety of colours, but most often are green, red, or purple, and as they mature, their colour tends towards yellow or orange, particularly in the creases. Unlike most fruiting trees, the cacao pod grows directly from the trunk or large branch of a tree rather than from the end of a branch, similar to jackfruit. This makes harvesting by hand easier as most of the pods will not be up in the higher branches. The pods on a tree do not ripen together; harvesting needs to be done periodically through the year. Harvesting occurs between three and four times weekly during the harvest season. The ripe and near-ripe pods, as judged by their colour, are harvested from the trunk and branches of the cacao tree with a curved knife on a long pole. Care must be used when cutting the stem of the pod to avoid damaging the junction of the stem with the tree, as this is where future flowers and pods will emerge. One person can harvest an estimated 650 pods per day.\nHarvest processing.\nThe harvested pods are opened, typically with a machete, to expose the beans. The pulp and cocoa seeds are removed and the rind is discarded. The pulp and seeds are then piled in heaps, placed in bins, or laid out on grates for several days. During this time, the seeds and pulp undergo \"sweating\", where the thick pulp liquefies as it ferments. The fermented pulp trickles away, leaving cocoa seeds behind to be collected. At the end of this process, the seeds change color from pale yellow or violet to brown. Sweating is important for the quality of the beans, which originally have a strong, bitter taste. If sweating is interrupted, the resulting cocoa may be ruined; if underdone, the cocoa seed maintains a flavor similar to raw potatoes and becomes susceptible to mildew. Some cocoa-producing countries distill alcoholic spirits using the liquefied pulp.\nA typical pod contains 30 to 40 beans and about 400 dried beans are required to make of chocolate. Cocoa pods weigh an average of and each one yields dried beans; this yield is 9\u201310% of the total weight in the pod. One person can separate the beans from about 2000 pods per day.\nThe wet beans are then transported to a facility so they can be fermented and dried. The farmer packs them into boxes or heaps them into piles, then covers them with mats or banana leaves for three to seven days. Finally, the beans are trodden and shuffled about (often using bare human feet) and sometimes, during this process, red clay mixed with water is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer color, polish, and protection against molds during shipment to factories in other countries. Drying in the sun is a common means of drying the beans, particularly among smaller cocoa farmers, as no extraneous flavors such as smoke or oil are introduced which might otherwise taint the flavor as is common in many artificial means of drying. However, large-scale chocolate producers often use artificial means because the processes are more controllable and are not dependent on the weather as well as being faster. Drying the beans too fast, however, can lead to incomplete chemical and physical processes during the drying process which remove or destroy acidic compounds and that can leave the beans overly acidic, decreasing their quality.\nThe beans should be dry for shipment, which is usually by sea. Traditionally exported in jute bags, over the last decade, beans are increasingly shipped in \"mega-bulk\" parcels of several thousand tonnes at a time on ships, or standardized to per bag and 200 () or 240 () bags per container. Shipping in bulk significantly reduces handling costs. Shipment in bags, either in a ship's hold or in containers, is still common.\nThroughout Mesoamerica where they are native, cocoa beans are used for a variety of foods. The harvested and fermented beans may be ground to order at \"tiendas de chocolate\", or chocolate mills. At these mills, the cocoa can be mixed with a variety of ingredients such as cinnamon, chili peppers, almonds, vanilla, and other spices to create drinking chocolate. The ground cocoa is also an important ingredient in \"tejate\".\nChild slavery.\nThe first allegations that child slavery is used in cocoa production appeared in 1998. In late 2000, a BBC documentary reported the use of enslaved children in the production of cocoa in West Africa. Other media followed by reporting widespread child slavery and child trafficking in the production of cocoa.\nThe cocoa industry was accused of profiting from child slavery and trafficking. The Harkin\u2013Engel Protocol is an effort to end these practices. In 2001, it was signed and witnessed by the heads of eight major chocolate companies, US senators Tom Harkin and Herb Kohl, US Representative Eliot Engel, the ambassador of the Ivory Coast, the director of the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labor, and others. It has, however, been criticized by some groups including the International Labor Rights Forum as an industry initiative which falls short, as the goal to eliminate the \"worst forms of child labor\" from cocoa production by 2005 was not reached. The deadline was extended multiple times and the goal changed to a 70% child labor reduction.\nChild labour was growing in some West African countries in 2008\u201309 when it was estimated that 819,921 children worked on cocoa farms in Ivory Coast alone; by 2013\u201314, the number went up to 1,303,009. During the same period in Ghana, the estimated number of children working on cocoa farms was 957,398 children.\nThe 2010 documentary \"The Dark Side of Chocolate\" revealed that children smuggled from Mali to the Ivory Coast were forced to earn income for their parents, while others were sold as slaves for \u20ac230.\nIn 2010, the US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1\u00a0million children in Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were involved in harvesting cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides. According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: \"I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it's the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you really need leadership.\" As Reported in 2018, a three-year pilot program, conducted by Nestl\u00e9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.\nLawsuits.\nIn 2021, several companies were named in a class action lawsuit filed by eight former children from Mali who alleged that the companies aided and abetted their enslavement on cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast. The suit accused Barry Callebaut, Cargill, The Hershey Company, Mars, Mondelez, Nestl\u00e9, and Olam International, of knowingly engaging in forced labour, and the plaintiffs sought damages for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\nThis case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich because a \"traceable connection\" between the defendant companies and the specific plantations where plaintiffs were enslaved could not be established.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2022, world production of cocoa beans was 5.87 million tonnes, led by Ivory Coast with 38% of the total, while secondary producers were Ghana and Indonesia (table).\nCocoa trading.\nCocoa beans are traditionally shipped and stored in burlap sacks, in which the beans are susceptible to pest attacks. Fumigation with methyl bromide was to be phased out globally by 2015. Additional cocoa protection techniques for shipping and storage include the application of pyrenoids, as well as hermetic storage in sealed bags or containers with lowered oxygen concentrations. Safe long-term storage facilitates the trading of cocoa products at commodity exchanges.\nCocoa beans, cocoa butter and cocoa powder are traded on futures markets. The London market is based on West African cocoa and New York on cocoa predominantly from Southeast Asia. Cocoa is the world's smallest soft commodity market. The futures price of cocoa butter and cocoa powder is determined by multiplying the bean price by a ratio. The combined butter and powder ratio has tended to be around 3.5. If the combined ratio falls below 3.2 or so, production ceases to be economically viable and some factories cease extraction of butter and powder and trade exclusively in cocoa liquor.\nCocoa futures traded on the ICE Futures US Softs exchange, are valued at 10 Tonnes per contract with a tick size of 1 and tick value of US$10.\nSustainability.\nMultiple international and national initiatives collaborate to support sustainable cocoa production. These include the Swiss Platform for Sustainable Cocoa (SWISSCO), the German Initiative on Sustainable Cocoa (GISCO), and Beyond Chocolate, Belgium. A memorandum between these three initiatives was signed in 2020 to measure and address issues including child labor, living income, deforestation and supply chain transparency. Similar partnerships between cocoa producing and consuming countries are being developed, such as the cooperation between the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) and the Ghanaian Cocoa Authority, who aim to increase the proportion of sustainable cocoa being imported from Ghana to Switzerland to 80% by 2025. The ICCO is engaged in projects around the world to support sustainable cocoa production and provide current information on the world cocoa market. Cocoa is one of seven commodities included in the EU Regulation on Deforestation-free products (EUDR), which aims to guarantee that the products European Union (EU) citizens consume do not contribute to deforestation or forest degradation worldwide.\nVoluntary sustainability standards.\nThere are numerous voluntary certifications including Fairtrade and UTZ (now part of Rainforest Alliance) for cocoa which aim to differentiate between conventional cocoa production and that which is more sustainable in terms of social, economic and environmental concerns. As of 2016, at least 29% of global cocoa production was compliant with voluntary sustainability standards. However, among the different certifications there are significant differences in their goals and approaches, and a lack of data to show and compare the results on the farm level. While certifications can lead to increased farm income, the premium price paid for certified cocoa by consumers is not always reflected proportionally in the income for farmers. In 2012 the ICCO found that farm size mattered significantly when determining the benefits of certifications, and that farms an area less than 1ha were less likely to benefit from such programs, while those with slightly larger farms as well as access to member co-ops and the ability to improve productivity were most likely to benefit from certification. Certification often requires high up-front costs, which are a barrier to small farmers, and particularly, female farmers. The primary benefits to certification include improving conservation practices and reducing the use of agrochemicals, business support through cooperatives and resource sharing, and a higher price for cocoa beans which can improve the standard of living for farmers.\nFair trade cocoa producer groups are established in Belize, Bolivia, Cameroon, the Congo, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ghana, Haiti, India, Ivory Coast, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Sierra Leone, and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\nIn 2018, the Beyond Chocolate partnership was created between multiple stakeholders in the global cocoa industry to decrease deforestation and provide a living income for cocoa farmers. The many international companies are currently participating in this agreement and the following voluntary certification programs are also partners in the Beyond Chocolate initiative: Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade, ISEAL, BioForum Vlaanderen.\nMany major chocolate production companies around the world have started to prioritize buying fair trade cocoa by investing in fair trade cocoa production, improving fair trade cocoa supply chains and setting purchasing goals to increase the proportion of fair trade chocolate available in the global market.\nThe Rainforest Alliance lists the following goals as part of their certification program:\nThe UTZ Certified-program (now part of Rainforest Alliance) included counteracting against child labor and exploitation of cocoa workers, requiring a code of conduct in relation to social and environmentally friendly factors, and improvement of farming methods to increase profits and salaries of farmers and distributors.\nEnvironmental impact.\nThe relative poverty of many cocoa farmers means that environmental consequences such as deforestation are given little significance. For decades, cocoa farmers have encroached on virgin forest, mostly after the felling of trees by logging companies. This trend has decreased as many governments and communities are beginning to protect their remaining forested zones. However, deforestation due to cocoa production is still a major concern in parts of West Africa. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana, barriers to land ownership have led migrant workers and farmers without financial resources to buy land to illegally expand their cocoa farming in protected forests. Many cocoa farmers in this region continue to prioritize expansion of their cocoa production, which often leads to deforestation.\nSustainable agricultural practices such as utilizing cover crops to prepare the soil before planting and intercropping cocoa seedlings with companion plants can support cocoa production and benefit the farm ecosystem. Prior to planting cocoa, leguminous cover crops can improve the soil nutrients and structure, which are important in areas where cocoa is produced due to high heat and rainfall which can diminish soil quality. Plantains are often intercropped with cocoa to provide shade to young seedlings and improve drought resilience of the soil. If the soil lacks essential nutrients, compost or animal manure can improve soil fertility and help with water retention.\nWhile governments and NGOs have made efforts to help cocoa farmers in Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sustainably improve crop yields, many of the educational and financial resources provided are more readily available to male farmers versus female farmers. Access to credit is important for cocoa farmers, as it allows them to implement sustainable practices, such as agroforestry, and provide a financial buffer in case disasters like pest or weather patterns decrease crop yield.\nCocoa production is likely to be affected in various ways by the expected effects of global warming. Specific concerns have been raised concerning its future as a cash crop in West Africa, the current centre of global cocoa production. If temperatures continue to rise, West Africa could simply become unfit to grow the beans. The International Center for Tropical Agriculture warned in a paper published in 2013 that Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the world's two top cocoa growers, will experience a decline in suitable areas for cocoa production as global temperatures rise by up to 2\u00a0\u00b0C by 2050.\nClimate change, coupled with pests, poor soil health, and the demand for sustainable cocoa, has led to a rapid decline in cocoa productivity, resulting in reduced income for smallholder cocoa farmers. Severe droughts have led to soil fertility decline, causing a decrease in yields, and resulting in some farmers abandoning cocoa production.\nCocoa beans also have a potential to be used as a bedding material in farms for cows. Using cocoa bean husks in bedding material for cows may contribute to udder health (less bacterial growth) and ammonia levels (lower ammonia levels on bedding).\nAgroforestry.\nCocoa beans may be cultivated under shade, as done in agroforestry. Agroforestry can reduce the pressure on existing protected forests for resources, such as firewood, and conserve biodiversity. Integrating shade trees with cocoa plants reduces risk of soil erosion and evaporation, and protects young cocoa plants from extreme heat. Agroforests act as buffers to formally protected forests and biodiversity island refuges in an open, human-dominated landscape. Research of their shade-grown coffee counterparts has shown that greater canopy cover in plots is significantly associated with greater mammal species diversity. The amount of diversity in tree species is fairly comparable between shade-grown cocoa plots and primary forests.\nEconomic effects.\nCocoa contributes significantly to Nigerian economic activity, comprising the largest part of the country's foreign exchange, and providing income for farmers. Farmers can grow a variety of fruit-bearing shade trees to supplement their income to help cope with the volatile cocoa prices. Although cocoa has been adapted to grow under a dense rainforest canopy, agroforestry does not significantly further enhance cocoa productivity. However, while growing cocoa in full sun without incorporating shade plants can temporarily increase cocoa yields, it will eventually decrease the quality of the soil due to nutrient loss, desertification and erosion, leading to unsustainable yields and dependency on inorganic fertilizers. Agroforestry practices stabilize and improve soil quality, which can sustain cocoa production in the long term.\nOver time, cocoa agroforestry systems become more similar to forest, although they never fully recover the original forest community within the life cycle of a productive cocoa plantation (approximately 25 years). Thus, although cocoa agroforests cannot replace natural forests, they are a valuable tool for conserving and protecting biodiversity while maintaining high levels of productivity in agricultural landscapes.\nIn West Africa, where about 70% of global cocoa supply originates from smallholder farmers, recent public\u2013private initiatives such as the Cocoa Forest Initiatives in Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (World Cocoa Foundation, 2017) and the Green Cocoa Landscape Programme in Cameroon (IDH, 2019) aim to support the sustainable intensification and climate resilience of cocoa production, the prevention of further deforestation and the restoration of degraded forests. They often align with national REDD+ policies and plans.\nConsumption.\nPeople around the world consume cocoa in many different forms, consuming more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans yearly. Once the cocoa beans have been harvested, fermented, dried and transported they are processed in several components. Processor grindings serve as the main metric for market analysis. Processing is the last phase in which consumption of the cocoa bean can be equitably compared to supply. After this step all the different components are sold across industries to many manufacturers of different types of products.\nGlobal market share for processing has remained stable, even as grindings increase to meet demand. One of the largest processing countries by volume is the Netherlands, handling around 13% of global grindings. Europe and Russia as a whole handle about 38% of the processing market. Average year after year demand growth has been just over 3% since 2008. While Europe and North America are relatively stable markets, increasing household income in developing countries is the main reason of the stable demand growth. As demand is awaited to keep growing, supply growth may slow down due to changing weather conditions in the largest cocoa production areas.\nChocolate production.\nTo produce of chocolate, around 300 to 600 cocoa beans are processed. The beans are roasted, cracked, and deshelled, resulting in pieces called nibs (the cotyledons, of which beans generally contain two), which are ground into a thick paste known as chocolate liquor or cocoa paste. The liquor is processed into chocolate by adding cocoa butter, sugar, and sometimes vanilla and lecithin. Alternatively, cocoa powder and cocoa butter can be separated using a hydraulic press or the Broma process. Treating cocoa with an alkali produces Dutch process cocoa, which has a different flavor profile than untreated cocoa. Roasting can also be done on the whole bean or nib, affecting the final flavor. Most nibs are ground, using various methods, into a thick, creamy paste, known as chocolate liquor or cocoa paste. This \"liquor\" is then further processed into chocolate by mixing in (more) cocoa butter and sugar (and sometimes vanilla and lecithin as an emulsifier), and then refined, conched and tempered. Alternatively, it can be separated into cocoa powder and cocoa butter using a hydraulic press or the Broma process. This process produces around 50% cocoa butter and 50% cocoa powder.\nCocoa powder may have a fat content of about 12%, but this varies significantly. Cocoa butter is used in chocolate bar manufacture, other confectionery, soaps, and cosmetics.\nTreating with an alkali produces Dutch process cocoa, which is less acidic, darker, and more mellow in flavor than untreated cocoa. Regular (non-alkalized) cocoa is acidic, so when cocoa is treated with an alkaline ingredient, generally potassium carbonate, the pH increases. This can be done at various stages during manufacturing, including during nib treatment, liquor treatment, or press cake treatment.\nAnother process that helps develop the flavor is roasting, which can be done on the whole bean before shelling or on the nib after shelling. The time and temperature of the roast affect the result: A \"low roast\" produces a more acid, aromatic flavor, while a high roast gives a more intense, bitter flavor lacking complex flavor notes.\nPhytochemicals and research.\nCocoa contains various phytochemicals, such as flavanols (including epicatechin), procyanidins, and other flavonoids. A systematic review presented moderate evidence that the use of flavanol-rich chocolate and cocoa products causes a small (2 mmHg) blood pressure lowering effect in healthy adults\u2014mostly in the short term. The highest levels of cocoa flavanols are found in raw cocoa and to a lesser extent, dark chocolate, since flavonoids degrade during cooking used to make chocolate.\nThe beans contain theobromine, and between 0.1% and 0.7% caffeine, whereas dry coffee beans are about 1.2% caffeine. Theobromine found in the cocoa solids is fat soluble.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a free content work.

The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (known as rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. However, post-tensioning is also employed as a technique to reinforce the concrete. In terms of volume used annually, it is one of the most common engineering materials. In corrosion engineering terms, when designed correctly, the alkalinity of the concrete protects the steel rebar from corrosion.\nDescription.\nReinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (concrete in compression, reinforcement in tension), so as to improve the behavior of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning.\nFor a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least:\nHistory.\nThe early development of reinforced concrete took place in parallel in England and France during the mid-19th century.\nFrench builder Fran\u00e7ois Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete as a building technique. In 1853-55, Coignet built for himself the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four-story house at 72 rue Charles Michels in the suburbs of Paris known as the Fran\u00e7ois Coignet House. Coignet's descriptions of reinforcing concrete suggests that he did not do it for means of adding strength to the concrete but for keeping walls in monolithic construction from overturning. The 1872\u201373 Pippen Building in Brooklyn, although not designed by Coignet, stands as a testament to his technique.\nIn 1854, English builder William B. Wilkinson reinforced the concrete roof and floors in the two-story house he was constructing. His positioning of the reinforcement demonstrated that, unlike his predecessors, he had knowledge of tensile stresses. Between 1869 and 1870, Henry Eton would design, and Messrs W &amp; T Phillips of London construct the wrought iron reinforced Homersfield Bridge, with a 50' (15.25 meter) span, over the river Waveney, between the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.\nJoseph Monier, a 19th-century French gardener, was a pioneer in the development of structural, prefabricated and reinforced concrete, having been dissatisfied with the existing materials available for making durable flowerpots. He was granted a patent for reinforcing concrete flowerpots by means of mixing a wire mesh and a mortar shell in 1867. In 1877, Monier was granted another patent for a more advanced technique of reinforcing concrete columns and girders, using iron rods placed in a grid pattern. Though Monier undoubtedly knew that reinforcing concrete would improve its inner cohesion, it is not clear whether he even knew how much the tensile strength of concrete was improved by the reinforcing.\nIn 1877, Thaddeus Hyatt published a report entitled \"An Account of Some Experiments with Portland-Cement-Concrete Combined with Iron as a Building Material, with Reference to Economy of Metal in Construction and for Security against Fire in the Making of Roofs, Floors, and Walking Surfaces\", in which he reported his experiments on the behaviour of reinforced concrete. His work played a major role in the evolution of concrete construction as a proven and studied science. Without Hyatt's work, more dangerous trial and error methods might have been depended on for the advancement in the technology.\nBefore the 1870s, the use of concrete construction, though dating back to the Roman Empire, and having been reintroduced in the early 19th century, was not yet a scientifically proven technology .\nErnest L. Ransome, an English-born engineer, was an early innovator of reinforced concrete techniques at the end of the 19th century. Using the knowledge of reinforced concrete developed during the previous 50 years, Ransome improved nearly all the styles and techniques of the earlier inventors of reinforced concrete. Ransome's key innovation was to twist the reinforcing steel bar, thereby improving its bond with the concrete. Gaining increasing fame from his concrete constructed buildings, Ransome was able to build in 1886\u20131889 two of the first reinforced concrete bridges in North America. One of his bridges still stands on Shelter Island in New York's East End.\nOne of the first concrete buildings constructed in the United States was a private home designed by William Ward, completed in 1876. The home was particularly designed to be fireproof.\n was a German civil engineer and a pioneer of the iron and steel concrete construction. In 1879, Wayss bought the German rights to Monier's patents and, in 1884, his firm, , made the first commercial use of reinforced concrete. Up until the 1890s, Wayss and his firm greatly contributed to the advancement of Monier's system of reinforcing, establishing it as a well-developed scientific technology.\nThe Lamington Bridge was Australia's first large reinforced concrete road bridge. It was designed by Alfred Barton Brady, who was the Queensland Government Architect at the time of the bridge's construction in 1896. It has eleven spans and a total length of , larger than any known comparable bridge in the world at that time.\nOne of the first skyscrapers made with reinforced concrete was the 16-story Ingalls Building in Cincinnati, constructed in 1904.\nThe first reinforced concrete building in Southern California was the Laughlin Annex in downtown Los Angeles, constructed in 1905. In 1906, 16 building permits were reportedly issued for reinforced concrete buildings in the City of Los Angeles, including the Temple Auditorium and 8-story Hayward Hotel.\nIn 1906, a partial collapse of the Bixby Hotel in Long Beach killed 10 workers during construction when shoring was removed prematurely. That event spurred a scrutiny of concrete erection practices and building inspections. The structure was constructed of reinforced concrete frames with hollow clay tile ribbed flooring and hollow clay tile infill walls. That practice was strongly questioned by experts and recommendations for \"pure\" concrete construction were made, using reinforced concrete for the floors and walls as well as the frames.\nIn April 1904, Julia Morgan, an American architect and engineer, who pioneered the aesthetic use of reinforced concrete, completed her first reinforced concrete structure, El Campanil, a bell tower at Mills College, which is located across the bay from San Francisco. Two years later, El Campanil survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake without any damage, which helped build her reputation and launch her prolific career. The 1906 earthquake also changed the public's initial resistance to reinforced concrete as a building material, which had been criticized for its perceived dullness. In 1908, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors changed the city's building codes to allow wider use of reinforced concrete.\nIn 1906, the National Association of Cement Users (NACU) published \"Standard No. 1\" and, in 1910, the \"Standard Building Regulations for the Use of Reinforced Concrete\".\nUse in construction.\nMany different types of structures and components of structures can be built using reinforced concrete elements including slabs, walls, beams, columns, foundations, frames and more.\nReinforced concrete can be classified as precast or cast-in-place concrete.\nDesigning and implementing the most efficient floor system is key to creating optimal building structures. Small changes in the design of a floor system can have significant impact on material costs, construction schedule, ultimate strength, operating costs, occupancy levels and end use of a building.\nWithout reinforcement, constructing modern structures with concrete material would not be possible.\nReinforced concrete elements.\nWhen reinforced concrete elements are used in construction, these reinforced concrete elements exhibit basic behavior when subjected to external loads. Reinforced concrete elements may be subject to tension, compression, bending, shear, and/or torsion.\nBehavior.\nMaterials.\nConcrete is a mixture of coarse (stone or brick chips) and fine (generally sand and/or crushed stone) aggregates with a paste of binder material (usually Portland cement) and water. When cement is mixed with a small amount of water, it hydrates to form microscopic opaque crystal lattices encapsulating and locking the aggregate into a rigid shape. The aggregates used for making concrete should be free from harmful substances like organic impurities, silt, clay, lignite, etc. Typical concrete mixes have high resistance to compressive stresses (about ); however, any appreciable tension (\"e.g.,\" due to bending) will break the microscopic rigid lattice, resulting in cracking and separation of the concrete. For this reason, typical non-reinforced concrete must be well supported to prevent the development of tension.\nIf a material with high strength in tension, such as steel, is placed in concrete, then the composite material, reinforced concrete, resists not only compression but also bending and other direct tensile actions. A composite section where the concrete resists compression and reinforcement \"rebar\" resists tension can be made into almost any shape and size for the construction industry.\nKey characteristics.\nThree physical characteristics give reinforced concrete its special properties:\nAs a rule of thumb, only to give an idea on orders of magnitude, steel is protected at pH above ~11 but starts to corrode below ~10 depending on steel characteristics and local physico-chemical conditions when concrete becomes carbonated. Carbonation of concrete along with chloride ingress are amongst the chief reasons for the failure of reinforcement bars in concrete.\nThe relative cross-sectional area of steel required for typical reinforced concrete is usually quite small and varies from 1% for most beams and slabs to 6% for some columns. Reinforcing bars are normally round in cross-section and vary in diameter. Reinforced concrete structures sometimes have provisions such as ventilated hollow cores to control their moisture &amp; humidity.\nDistribution of concrete (in spite of reinforcement) strength characteristics along the cross-section of vertical reinforced concrete elements is inhomogeneous.\nMechanism of composite action of reinforcement and concrete.\nThe reinforcement in an RC structure, such as a steel bar, has to undergo the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete in order to prevent discontinuity, slip, or separation of the two materials under load. Maintaining composite action requires the transfer of load between the concrete and steel. The direct stress is transferred from the concrete to the bar interface so as to change the tensile stress in the reinforcing bar along its length. This load transfer is achieved by means of bond (anchorage) and is idealized as a continuous stress field that develops in the vicinity of the steel-concrete interface.\nThe reasons that the two different material components, concrete and steel, can work together are as follows:\n(1) Reinforcement can be well bonded to the concrete, thus they can jointly resist external loads and deform.\n(2) The thermal expansion coefficients of concrete and steel are so close\n( to for concrete and for steel) that the thermal stress-induced damage to the bond between the two components can be prevented.\n(3) Concrete can protect the embedded steel from corrosion and high-temperature-induced softening.\nAnchorage (bond) in concrete: Codes of specifications.\nBecause the actual bond stress varies along the length of a bar anchored in a zone of tension, current international codes of specifications use the concept of development length rather than bond stress. The main requirement for safety against bond failure is to provide a sufficient extension of the length of the bar beyond the point where the steel is required to develop its yield stress, and this length must be at least equal to its development length. However, if the actual available length is inadequate for full development, special anchorages must be provided, such as cogs, hooks or mechanical end plates. The same concept applies to lap splice length mentioned in the codes where splices (overlapping) provided between two adjacent bars in order to maintain the required continuity of stress in the splice zone.\nAnticorrosion measures.\nIn wet and cold climates, reinforced concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures, and other structures that may be exposed to deicing salt may benefit from the use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanized or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications.\nUncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy-coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green color of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull gray depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar. Reference ASTM standard specifications A1035/A1035M Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Low-carbon, Chromium, Steel Bars for Concrete Reinforcement, A767 Standard Specification for Hot Dip Galvanized Reinforcing Bars, A775 Standard Specification for Epoxy Coated Steel Reinforcing Bars and A955 Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Stainless Bars for Concrete Reinforcement.\nAnother, cheaper way of protecting rebars is coating them with zinc phosphate. Zinc phosphate slowly reacts with calcium cations and the hydroxyl anions present in the cement pore water and forms a stable hydroxyapatite layer.\nPenetrating sealants typically must be applied some time after curing. Sealants include paint, plastic foams, films and aluminum foil, felts or fabric mats sealed with tar, and layers of bentonite clay, sometimes used to seal roadbeds.\nCorrosion inhibitors, such as calcium nitrite [Ca(NO2)2], can also be added to the water mix before pouring concrete. Generally, 1\u20132\u00a0wt.\u00a0% of [Ca(NO2)2] with respect to cement weight is needed to prevent corrosion of the rebars. The nitrite anion is a mild oxidizer that oxidizes the soluble and mobile ferrous ions (Fe2+) present at the surface of the corroding steel and causes them to precipitate as an insoluble ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). This causes the passivation of steel at the anodic oxidation sites. Nitrite is a much more active corrosion inhibitor than nitrate, which is a less powerful oxidizer of the divalent iron.\nReinforcement and terminology of beams.\nA beam bends under bending moment, resulting in a small curvature. At the outer face (tensile face) of the curvature the concrete experiences tensile stress, while at the inner face (compressive face) it experiences compressive stress.\nA singly reinforced beam is one in which the concrete element is only reinforced near the tensile face and the reinforcement, called tension steel, is designed to resist the tension.\nA doubly reinforced beam is the section in which besides the tensile reinforcement the concrete element is also reinforced near the compressive face to help the concrete resist compression and take stresses. The latter reinforcement is called compression steel. When the compression zone of a concrete is inadequate to resist the compressive moment (positive moment), extra reinforcement has to be provided if the architect limits the dimensions of the section.\nAn under-reinforced beam is one in which the tension capacity of the tensile reinforcement is smaller than the combined compression capacity of the concrete and the compression steel (under-reinforced at tensile face). When the reinforced concrete element is subject to increasing bending moment, the tension steel yields while the concrete does not reach its ultimate failure condition. As the tension steel yields and stretches, an \"under-reinforced\" concrete also yields in a ductile manner, exhibiting a large deformation and warning before its ultimate failure. In this case the yield stress of the steel governs the design.\nAn over-reinforced beam is one in which the tension capacity of the tension steel is greater than the combined compression capacity of the concrete and the compression steel (over-reinforced at tensile face). So the \"over-reinforced concrete\" beam fails by crushing of the compressive-zone concrete and before the tension zone steel yields, which does not provide any warning before failure as the failure is instantaneous.\nA balanced-reinforced beam is one in which both the compressive and tensile zones reach yielding at the same imposed load on the beam, and the concrete will crush and the tensile steel will yield at the same time. This design criterion is however as risky as over-reinforced concrete, because failure is sudden as the concrete crushes at the same time of the tensile steel yields, which gives a very little warning of distress in tension failure.\nSteel-reinforced concrete moment-carrying elements should normally be designed to be under-reinforced so that users of the structure will receive warning of impending collapse.\nThe characteristic strength is the strength of a material where less than 5% of the specimen shows lower strength.\nThe design strength or nominal strength is the strength of a material, including a material-safety factor. The value of the safety factor generally ranges from 0.75 to 0.85 in Permissible stress design.\nThe ultimate limit state is the theoretical failure point with a certain probability. It is stated under factored loads and factored resistances.\nReinforced concrete structures are normally designed according to rules and regulations or recommendation of a code such as ACI-318, CEB, Eurocode 2 or the like. WSD, USD or LRFD methods are used in design of RC structural members. Analysis and design of RC members can be carried out by using linear or non-linear approaches. When applying safety factors, building codes normally propose linear approaches, but for some cases non-linear approaches. To see the examples of a non-linear numerical simulation and calculation visit the references:\nPrestressed concrete.\nPrestressing concrete is a technique that greatly increases the load-bearing strength of concrete beams. The reinforcing steel in the bottom part of the beam, which will be subjected to tensile forces when in service, is placed in tension before the concrete is poured around it. Once the concrete has hardened, the tension on the reinforcing steel is released, placing a built-in compressive force on the concrete. When loads are applied, the reinforcing steel takes on more stress and the compressive force in the concrete is reduced, but does not become a tensile force. Since the concrete is always under compression, it is less subject to cracking and failure.\nCommon failure modes of steel reinforced concrete.\nReinforced concrete can fail due to inadequate strength, leading to mechanical failure, or due to a reduction in its durability. Corrosion and freeze/thaw cycles may damage poorly designed or constructed reinforced concrete. When rebar corrodes, the oxidation products (rust) expand and tends to flake, cracking the concrete and unbonding the rebar from the concrete. Typical mechanisms leading to durability problems are discussed below.\nMechanical failure.\nCracking of the concrete section is nearly impossible to prevent; however, the size and location of cracks can be limited and controlled by appropriate reinforcement, control joints, curing methodology and concrete mix design. Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a serviceability failure in limit state design. Cracking is normally the result of an inadequate quantity of rebar or rebar spaced at too great a distance. The concrete cracks either under excess loading or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.\nUltimate failure leading to collapse can be caused by crushing the concrete, which occurs when compressive stresses exceed its strength, by yielding or failure of the rebar when bending or shear stresses exceed the strength of the reinforcement, or by bond failure between the concrete and the rebar.\nCarbonation.\nCarbonation, or neutralisation, is a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide in the air and calcium hydroxide and hydrated calcium silicate in the concrete.\nWhen a concrete structure is designed, it is usual to specify the concrete cover for the rebar (the depth of the rebar within the object). The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes. If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur. The concrete cover depth can be measured with a cover meter. However, carbonated concrete incurs a durability problem only when there is also sufficient moisture and oxygen to cause electropotential corrosion of the reinforcing steel.\nOne method of testing a structure for carbonation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the cut surface with phenolphthalein indicator solution. This solution turns pink when in contact with alkaline concrete, making it possible to see the depth of carbonation. Using an existing hole does not suffice because the exposed surface will already be carbonated.\nChlorides.\nChlorides can promote the corrosion of embedded rebar if present in sufficiently high concentration. Chloride anions induce both localized corrosion (pitting corrosion) and generalized corrosion of steel reinforcements. For this reason, one should only use fresh raw water or potable water for mixing concrete, ensure that the coarse and fine aggregates do not contain chlorides, rather than admixtures which might contain chlorides.\nIt was once common for calcium chloride to be used as an admixture to promote rapid set-up of the concrete. It was also mistakenly believed that it would prevent freezing. However, this practice fell into disfavor once the deleterious effects of chlorides became known. It should be avoided whenever possible.\nThe use of de-icing salts on roadways, used to lower the freezing point of water, is probably one of the primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or prestressed concrete bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars and the application of cathodic protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.\nAnother important source of chloride ions is sea water. Sea water contains by weight approximately 3.5% salts. These salts include sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and bicarbonates. In water these salts dissociate in free ions (Na+, Mg2+, Cl\u2212, SO42\u2212, HCO3\u2212) and migrate with the water into the capillaries of the concrete. Chloride ions, which make up about 50% of these ions, are particularly aggressive as a cause of corrosion of carbon steel reinforcement bars.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was also relatively common for magnesite, a chloride rich carbonate mineral, to be used as a floor-topping material. This was done principally as a levelling and sound attenuating layer. However it is now known that when these materials come into contact with moisture they produce a weak solution of hydrochloric acid due to the presence of chlorides in the magnesite. Over a period of time (typically decades), the solution causes corrosion of the embedded rebars. This was most commonly found in wet areas or areas repeatedly exposed to moisture.\nAlkali silica reaction.\nThis a reaction of amorphous silica (chalcedony, chert, siliceous limestone) sometimes present in the aggregates with the hydroxyl ions (OH\u2212) from the cement pore solution. Poorly crystallized silica (SiO2) dissolves and dissociates at high pH (12.5 - 13.5) in alkaline water. The soluble dissociated silicic acid reacts in the porewater with the calcium hydroxide (portlandite) present in the cement paste to form an expansive calcium silicate hydrate (CSH). The alkali\u2013silica reaction (ASR) causes localised swelling responsible for tensile stress and cracking. The conditions required for alkali silica reaction are threefold:\n(1) aggregate containing an alkali-reactive constituent (amorphous silica), (2) sufficient availability of hydroxyl ions (OH\u2212), and (3) sufficient moisture, above 75% relative humidity (RH) within the concrete. This phenomenon is sometimes popularly referred to as \"concrete cancer\". This reaction occurs independently of the presence of rebars; massive concrete structures such as dams can be affected.\nConversion of high alumina cement.\nResistant to weak acids and especially sulfates, this cement cures quickly and has very high durability and strength. It was frequently used after World War II to make precast concrete objects. However, it can lose strength with heat or time (conversion), especially when not properly cured. After the collapse of three roofs made of prestressed concrete beams using high alumina cement, this cement was banned in the UK in 1976. Subsequent inquiries into the matter showed that the beams were improperly manufactured, but the ban remained.\nSulfates.\nSulfates (SO4) in the soil or in groundwater, in sufficient concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., ettringite or thaumasite, which can lead to early failure of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the sulfate ion, via alternate wetting and drying, can increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The sulfate ion concentration increases much slower in the soil mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to check for the presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various protective coatings can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.\nSteel plate construction.\nIn steel plate construction, stringers join parallel steel plates. The plate assemblies are fabricated off site, and welded together on-site to form steel walls connected by stringers. The walls become the form into which concrete is poured. Steel plate construction speeds reinforced concrete construction by cutting out the time-consuming on-site manual steps of tying rebar and building forms. The method results in excellent strength because the steel is on the outside, where tensile forces are often greatest.\nFiber-reinforced concrete.\nFiber reinforcement is mainly used in shotcrete, but can also be used in normal concrete. Fiber-reinforced normal concrete is mostly used for on-ground floors and pavements, but can also be considered for a wide range of construction parts (beams, pillars, foundations, etc.), either alone or with hand-tied rebars.\nConcrete reinforced with fibers (which are usually steel, glass, plastic fibers) or cellulose polymer fiber is less expensive than hand-tied rebar. The shape, dimension, and length of the fiber are important. A thin and short fiber, for example short, hair-shaped glass fiber, is only effective during the first hours after pouring the concrete (its function is to reduce cracking while the concrete is stiffening), but it will not increase the concrete tensile strength. A normal-size fiber for European shotcrete (1\u00a0mm diameter, 45\u00a0mm length\u2014steel or plastic) will increase the concrete's tensile strength. Fiber reinforcement is most often used to supplement or partially replace primary rebar, and in some cases, it can be designed to fully replace rebar.\nSteel is the strongest commonly available fiber, and comes in different lengths (30 to 80\u00a0mm in Europe) and shapes (end-hooks). Steel fibers can only be used on surfaces that can tolerate or avoid corrosion and rust stains. In some cases, a steel-fiber surface is faced with other materials.\nGlass fiber is inexpensive and corrosion-proof, but not as ductile as steel. Recently, spun basalt fiber, long available in Eastern Europe, has become available in the U.S. and Western Europe. Basalt fiber is stronger and less expensive than glass, but historically has not resisted the alkaline environment of Portland cement well enough to be used as direct reinforcement. New materials use plastic binders to isolate the basalt fiber from the cement.\nThe premium fibers are graphite-reinforced plastic fibers, which are nearly as strong as steel, lighter in weight, and corrosion-proof. Some experiments have had promising early results with carbon nanotubes, but the material is still far too expensive for any building.\nNon-steel reinforcement.\nThere is considerable overlap between the subjects of non-steel reinforcement and fiber-reinforcement of concrete. The introduction of non-steel reinforcement of concrete is relatively recent; it takes two major forms: non-metallic rebar rods, and non-steel (usually also non-metallic) fibers incorporated into the cement matrix. For example, there is increasing interest in glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) and in various applications of polymer fibers incorporated into concrete. Although currently there is not much suggestion that such materials will replace metal rebar, some of them have major advantages in specific applications, and there are also new applications in which metal rebar simply is not an option. However, the design and application of non-steel reinforcing is fraught with challenges. For one thing, concrete is a highly alkaline environment, in which many materials, including most kinds of glass, have a poor service life. Also, the behavior of such reinforcing materials differs from the behavior of metals, for instance in terms of shear strength, creep and elasticity.\nFiber-reinforced plastic/polymer (FRP) and glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) consist of fibers of polymer, glass, carbon, aramid, or other polymers or high-strength fibers set in a resin matrix to form a rebar rod, or grid, or fiber. These rebars are installed in much the same manner as steel rebars. The cost is higher, but when suitably applied, the structures have advantages, in particular a dramatic reduction in problems related to corrosion, either by intrinsic concrete alkalinity or by external corrosive fluids that might penetrate the concrete. These structures can be significantly lighter and usually have a longer service life. The cost of these materials has dropped dramatically since their widespread adoption in the aerospace industry and by the military.\nIn particular, FRP rods are useful for structures where the presence of steel would not be acceptable. For example, MRI machines have huge magnets, and accordingly require non-magnetic buildings. Again, toll booths that read radio tags need reinforced concrete that is transparent to radio waves. Also, where the design life of the concrete structure is more important than its initial costs, non-steel reinforcing often has its advantages where corrosion of reinforcing steel is a major cause of failure. In such situations, corrosion-proof reinforcing can extend a structure's life substantially, for example in the intertidal zone. FRP rods may also be useful in situations where it is likely that the concrete structure may be compromised in future years, for example the edges of balconies when balustrades are replaced, and bathroom floors in multi-story construction where the service life of the floor structure is likely to be many times the service life of the waterproofing building membrane.\nPlastic reinforcement often is stronger, or at least has a better strength to weight ratio than reinforcing steels. Also, because it resists corrosion, it does not need a protective concrete cover as thick as steel reinforcement does (typically 30 to 50\u00a0mm or more). FRP-reinforced structures can therefore be lighter and last longer. Accordingly, for some applications, the whole-life cost will be price-competitive with steel-reinforced concrete.\nThe material properties of FRP or GRP bars differ markedly from steel, so there are differences in the design considerations. FRP or GRP bars have relatively higher tensile strength but lower stiffness, so that deflections are likely to be higher than for equivalent steel-reinforced units. Structures with internal FRP reinforcement typically have an elastic deformability comparable to the plastic deformability (ductility) of steel reinforced structures. Failure in either case is more likely to occur by compression of the concrete than by rupture of the reinforcement. Deflection is always a major design consideration for reinforced concrete. Deflection limits are set to ensure that crack widths in steel-reinforced concrete are controlled to prevent water, air or other aggressive substances from reaching the steel and causing corrosion. For FRP-reinforced concrete, aesthetics and possibly water-tightness will be the limiting criteria for crack width control. FRP rods also have relatively lower compressive strengths than steel rebar, and accordingly require different design approaches for reinforced concrete columns.\nOne drawback to the use of FRP reinforcement is its limited fire resistance. Where fire safety is a consideration, structures employing FRP have to maintain their strength and the anchoring of the forces at temperatures to be expected in the event of fire. For purposes of fireproofing, an adequate thickness of cement concrete cover or protective cladding is necessary. The addition of 1\u00a0kg/m3 of polypropylene fibers to concrete has been shown to reduce spalling during a simulated fire. (The improvement is thought to be due to the formation of pathways out of the bulk of the concrete, allowing steam pressure to dissipate.)\nAnother problem is the effectiveness of shear reinforcement. FRP rebar stirrups formed by bending before hardening generally perform relatively poorly in comparison to steel stirrups or to structures with straight fibers. When strained, the zone between the straight and curved regions is subject to strong bending, shear, and longitudinal stresses. Special design techniques are necessary to deal with such problems.\nThere is growing interest in applying external reinforcement to existing structures using advanced materials such as composite (fiberglass, basalt, carbon) rebar, which can impart exceptional strength. Worldwide, there are a number of brands of composite rebar recognized by different countries, such as Aslan, DACOT, V-rod, and ComBar. The number of projects using composite rebar increases day by day around the world, in countries including the USA, Russia, South Korea and Germany.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The absolute value function formula_3 also has a singularity at formula_2, since it is not differentiable there.\nThe algebraic curve defined by formula_5 in the formula_6 coordinate system has a singularity (called a cusp) at formula_7. For singularities in algebraic geometry, see singular point of an algebraic variety. For singularities in differential geometry, see singularity theory.\nReal analysis.\nIn real analysis, singularities are either discontinuities, or discontinuities of the derivative (sometimes also discontinuities of higher order derivatives). There are four kinds of discontinuities: type\u00a0I, which has two subtypes, and type\u00a0II, which can also be divided into two subtypes (though usually is not).\nTo describe the way these two types of limits are being used, suppose that formula_8 is a function of a real argument formula_9, and for any value of its argument, say formula_10, then the left-handed limit, formula_11, and the right-handed limit, formula_12, are defined by:\nformula_13, constrained by formula_14 and\nformula_15, constrained by formula_16.\nThe value formula_11 is the value that the function formula_8 tends towards as the value formula_9 approaches formula_10 from \"below\", and the value formula_12 is the value that the function formula_8 tends towards as the value formula_9 approaches formula_10 from \"above\", regardless of the actual value the function has at the point where formula_25\u00a0.\nThere are some functions for which these limits do not exist at all. For example, the function\nformula_26\ndoes not tend towards anything as formula_9 approaches formula_28. The limits in this case are not infinite, but rather undefined: there is no value that formula_29 settles in on. Borrowing from complex analysis, this is sometimes called an \"essential singularity\".\nThe possible cases at a given value formula_10 for the argument are as follows.\nIn real analysis, a singularity or discontinuity is a property of a function alone. Any singularities that may exist in the derivative of a function are considered as belonging to the derivative, not to the original function.\nCoordinate singularities.\nA coordinate singularity occurs when an apparent singularity or discontinuity occurs in one coordinate frame, which can be removed by choosing a different frame. An example of this is the apparent singularity at the 90 degree latitude in spherical coordinates. An object moving due north (for example, along the line 0 degrees longitude) on the surface of a sphere will suddenly experience an instantaneous change in longitude at the pole (in the case of the example, jumping from longitude 0 to longitude 180 degrees). This discontinuity, however, is only apparent; it is an artifact of the coordinate system chosen, which is singular at the poles. A different coordinate system would eliminate the apparent discontinuity (e.g., by replacing the latitude/longitude representation with an n-vector representation).\nComplex analysis.\nIn complex analysis, there are several classes of singularities. These include the isolated singularities, the nonisolated singularities, and the branch points.\nIsolated singularities.\nSuppose that formula_50 is a function that is complex differentiable in the complement of a point formula_51 in an open subset formula_52 of the complex numbers formula_53 Then:\nNonisolated singularities.\nOther than isolated singularities, complex functions of one variable may exhibit other singular behaviour. These are termed nonisolated singularities, of which there are two types:\nBranch points.\nBranch points are generally the result of a multi-valued function, such as formula_78 or formula_79 which are defined within a certain limited domain so that the function can be made single-valued within the domain. The cut is a line or curve excluded from the domain to introduce a technical separation between discontinuous values of the function. When the cut is genuinely required, the function will have distinctly different values on each side of the branch cut. The shape of the branch cut is a matter of choice, even though it must connect two different branch points (such as formula_80 and formula_81 for formula_82) which are fixed in place.\nFinite-time singularity.\nA finite-time singularity occurs when one input variable is time, and an output variable increases towards infinity at a finite time. These are important in kinematics and Partial Differential Equations \u2013 infinites do not occur physically, but the behavior near the singularity is often of interest. Mathematically, the simplest finite-time singularities are power laws for various exponents of the form formula_83 of which the simplest is hyperbolic growth, where the exponent is (negative) 1: formula_84 More precisely, in order to get a singularity at positive time as time advances (so the output grows to infinity), one instead uses formula_85 (using \"t\" for time, reversing direction to formula_86 so that time increases to infinity, and shifting the singularity forward from 0 to a fixed time formula_87).\nAn example would be the bouncing motion of an inelastic ball on a plane. If idealized motion is considered, in which the same fraction of kinetic energy is lost on each bounce, the frequency of bounces becomes infinite, as the ball comes to rest in a finite time. Other examples of finite-time singularities include the various forms of the Painlev\u00e9 paradox (for example, the tendency of a chalk to skip when dragged across a blackboard), and how the precession rate of a coin spun on a flat surface accelerates towards infinite\u2014before abruptly stopping (as studied using the Euler's Disk toy).\nHypothetical examples include Heinz von Foerster's facetious \"Doomsday's equation\" (simplistic models yield infinite human population in finite time).\nAlgebraic geometry and commutative algebra.\nIn algebraic geometry, a singularity of an algebraic variety is a point of the variety where the tangent space may not be regularly defined. The simplest example of singularities are curves that cross themselves. But there are other types of singularities, like cusps. For example, the equation \"y\"2 \u2212 \"x\"3 = 0 defines a curve that has a cusp at the origin \"x\" = \"y\" = 0. One could define the \"x\"-axis as a tangent at this point, but this definition can not be the same as the definition at other points. In fact, in this case, the \"x\"-axis is a \"double tangent.\"\nFor affine and projective varieties, the singularities are the points where the Jacobian matrix has a rank which is lower than at other points of the variety.\nAn equivalent definition in terms of commutative algebra may be given, which extends to abstract varieties and schemes: A point is \"singular\" if the local ring at this point is not a regular local ring.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is among the most important Buddhist festivals. The festival commemorates the birth, enlightenment (Pali: Nibb\u0101na, Sanskrit: Nirv\u0101\u1e47a), and death (Parinirv\u0101na) of Gautama Buddha in Theravada, Tibetan Buddhism, and Navayana.\nThe name \"Vesak\" is derived from the Pali term ' or Sanskrit ' for the lunar month of Vaisakha, which is considered the month of Buddha's birth. In Mahayana Buddhist traditions, the holiday is known by its Sanskrit name (\"\") and derived variants of it.\nIn the East Asian tradition, a celebration of Buddha's Birthday typically occurs around the traditional timing of Vesak, while the Buddha's awakening and death are celebrated as separate holidays that occur at other times in the calendar as Bodhi Day and Nibb\u0101na Day. In the South Asian tradition, where Vesak is celebrated on the full moon day of the Vaisakha month, the Vesak day marks the birth, enlightenment, and the ultimate death of the Buddha.\nHistory.\nAlthough Buddhist festivals have centuries-old tradition, the first conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists held in Sri Lanka in 1950 formalized the decision to celebrate Vesak as the Buddha's birthday across multiple Buddhist countries. The resolution that was adopted at the World Conference reads as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That this Conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists, while recording its appreciation of the gracious act of His Majesty, the Maharaja of Nepal in making the full-moon day of Vesak a Public Holiday in Nepal, earnestly requests the Heads of Governments of all countries in which large or small number of Buddhists are to be found, to take steps to make the full-moon day in the month of May a Public Holiday in honour of the Buddha, who is universally acclaimed as one of the greatest benefactors of Humanity.\nOn Vesak Day, Buddhists around the world commemorate three major events in the life of Buddha Gautama: his birth, enlightenment, and passing (Parinirvana). As Buddhism spread from India it was assimilated into many foreign cultures, and consequently Vesak is celebrated in many different ways all over the world. In India, Vaishakh Purnima day is also known as Buddha Jayanti day and has been traditionally accepted as Buddha's birth day.\nIn 2000, the United Nations (UN) resolved to internationally observe the day of Vesak at its headquarters and offices.\nCelebration.\nThe month of May usually has one full moon, but as there are 29.5 days between full moons, occasionally there are two. If there are two full moons during the month of May, some countries (including Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Malaysia) celebrate Vesak on the first full moon, while others (Thailand, Singapore) celebrate the holiday on the full moon of 4th lunar month. The difference also manifests in the observance of other Buddhist holidays, which are traditionally observed at the local full moon.\nOn Vesak, devout Buddhists and followers alike assemble in their various temples before dawn for the ceremonial and honorable hoisting of the Buddhist flag and the singing of hymns in praise of the holy triple gem: The Buddha, The Dharma (his teachings), and The Sangha (his disciples). Devotees may bring simple offerings of flowers, candles and joss-sticks to lay at the feet of their teacher. These symbolic offerings are to remind followers that just as the beautiful flowers would wither away after a short while, and the candles and joss-sticks would soon burn out, so too is life subject to decay and destruction. Devotees are enjoined to make a special effort to refrain from killing of any kind. They are encouraged to partake only of vegetarian food for the day. In some countries, notably Sri Lanka, two days are set aside for the celebration of Vesak, and all liquor shops and slaughter houses are closed by government decree during the two days.\nAlso birds, insects and animals are released by the thousands in what is known as life release to give freedom to those who are in captivity, imprisoned, or tortured against their will. (The practice, however, is banned in some countries such as Singapore, as the released animals are unable to survive long-term or may adversely impact the local ecosystem if they do.)\nSome devout Buddhists will wear simple white clothing and spend the whole day in temples with renewed determination to observe the eight precepts.\nDevout Buddhists undertake to lead a noble life according to the teaching by making daily affirmations to observe the Five Precepts. However, on special days, notably new moon and full moon days, they observe the eight precepts to train themselves to practice morality, simplicity, and humility.\nSome temples also display a small statue of the Buddha in front of the altar in a small basin decorated with flowers, and filled with water or sweet tea for devotees to pour over the statue. This is symbolic of the cleansing of a practitioner's bad karma, and to reenact the events following the Buddha's birth, when devas and spirits made heavenly offerings to him.\nDevotees are expected to listen to talks given by monks. On this day, monks will recite verses uttered by the Buddha twenty-five centuries ago to invoke peace and happiness for the government and the people. Buddhists are reminded to live in harmony with people of other faiths and to respect the beliefs of other people as the Buddha taught.\nBringing happiness to others.\nCelebrating Vesak also means making special efforts to bring happiness to the unfortunate like the aged, the disabled, and the sick. To this day, Buddhists will distribute gifts in the form of cash, or volunteering in various charitable homes throughout the country. Vesak is also a time for great joy and happiness, expressed not by pandering to one's appetites, but by concentrating on useful activities such as decorating and illuminating temples, or painting and creating exquisite scenes from the life of the Buddha for public dissemination. Devout Buddhists also vie with one another to provide refreshments and vegetarian food to followers who visit the temple to pay homage to the Enlightened One.\nPaying homage to the Buddha.\nAccording to tradition the Buddha instructed followers how to pay him homage. Just before he died, he saw his faithful attendant Ananda, weeping. The Buddha advised him not to weep, instead to understand the universal law that all compounded things (including even his own body) must disintegrate. He advised everyone not to cry over the disintegration of the physical body but to regard his teachings (The Dharma) as their teacher from then on, because only the truth of the Dhamma is eternal, and not subject to the law of change. He also stressed that the way to pay homage to him was not merely by offering flowers, incense, and lights, but by truly and sincerely striving to follow his teachings.\nDates of observance.\nThe exact date of Vesak is based on Asian lunisolar calendars and is primarily celebrated in Vaisakha, a month of both the Buddhist and Hindu calendars, hence the name Vesak. In Nepal, which is considered the birth-country of Buddha, it is celebrated on the full moon day of the Vaisakha month of the Hindu calendar, and is traditionally called Buddha Purnima, Purnima meaning the full moon day in Sanskrit. In Theravada countries following the Buddhist calendar, it falls on Uposatha Day, the full moon typically in the 5th or 6th lunar month.\nNowadays, in Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia, Vesak/Buddha Purnima is celebrated on the day of the first full moon in May in the Gregorian calendar.\nFor countries using the lunisolar calendar, the date for Vesak or Buddha's Birthday varies from year to year in the Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May; in leap years it may be celebrated in June. In Bhutan it is celebrated on the 15th day of the fourth month of the Bhutanese lunar calendar. In Thailand, Laos, Singapore and Indonesia, Vesak is celebrated on the fourteenth or fifteenth day of the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. In China, Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated on the eighth day of the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. In Japan, Buddha's Birthday is observed on the same date but in the Gregorian calendar, i.e. 8 April.\nIn Myanmar, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as Full Moon of Kasun and is a public holiday. It is celebrated by watering the Bodhi tree and chanting. In large pagodas, music and dance is also performed as part of the celebrations.\nIn the following table, year 2021 date as per the Buddhist calendar\nIn Southeast Asia.\nIn Thailand.\nIn Thailand, where Vesak Day is known as Visakha Buja Day (Visakha Puja Day), Buddhists usually make merits by going to temples, vowing to keep the Buddhists precepts, offering food to monks, listening to talks about dhamma and meditating (\"bhavana\") in the temples.\nIn Laos.\nThe Vixakha Bouxa festival is the Lao version of the Thai Visakha Puja, which it closely resembles. It commemorates the birth, enlightenment, and death of the Buddha, which are all said to have happened on the same date. It is held around the month of May or \"Vesak\", based on the lunar calendar. Celebrations include dances, poems, parades, processions, deep meditation, theatrical performances, and puppet shows.\nBoun Bang Fay.\nOne part of the Vixakha Bouxa festival is called Boun Bang Fay, or Rocket Festival. As this occurs during the hottest and driest season of the year, large homemade rockets are launched into the sky in an attempt to convince the celestial beings to send down rain. Traditionally, Buddhist monks made the rockets out of hollow bamboo tubes filled with gunpowder (among other things). Nowadays, lay people make the \"bang fai\" more like fireworks and hold competitions for the highest, fastest and most colorful rockets. The event takes place on both sides of the Mekhong River border between Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and sometimes teams from the neighbouring countries will compete against each other. Tourists travel long distances to witness this now popular event.\nIn Indonesia.\nThis significant and traditional holy day is observed throughout Indonesia, where it is known as Waisak Day. At Borobudur, thousands of Buddhist monks will join to repeat mantras and meditate as they circuit the temple in a ritual called \"Pradaksina\". This is a form of tribute to the temple. Monks celebrate the special day by bottling holy water (which symbolises humility) and transporting flames (which symbolize light and enlightenment) from location to location. The monks also take part in the \"Pindapata\" ritual, where they receive charity from the people of Indonesia. Waisak Day in Indonesia has been celebrated as a national public holiday every year since 1983.\nIn Malaysia.\nCelebrated by Buddhists to mark three momentous events in Buddha's life \u2013 his birth, enlightenment, and his departure from the human world, the Wesak celebration in Malaysia begins at dawn when devotees gather at Buddhist temples nationwide to meditate on the Eight Precepts. Donations \u2013 giving food to the needy and offerings of incense and joss sticks \u2013 and prayers are carried out. The sutras are chanted in unison by monks in saffron robes. The celebration is highlighted by a candle procession. Wesak Day in Malaysia is a national public holiday.\nIn Myanmar (Burma).\nIn Myanmar (Burma), Vesak is known as the Full Moon Day of Kason (\u1000\u1006\u102f\u1014\u103a\u101c\u1015\u103c\u100a\u1037\u103a \u1017\u102f\u1012\u1039\u1013\u1014\u1031\u1037), which is the second month in the traditional Burmese calendar. The date is a public gazetted holiday. Buddhist devotees typically celebrate by offering alms to Buddhist monks, adhering to a more stringent set of Buddhist precepts, practicing meditation, and freeing fish and birds from captivity.\nThroughout the country, the date is also marked by a traditional festival called the \"Nyaungye-thun\" or \"Bodhi tree water pouring festival\" (\u100a\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u101e\u103d\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1015\u103d\u1032), whereby devotees visit pagodas or monasteries (kyaung) to pour scented water to sacred Bodhi Trees using clay pots, to ensure the trees, which hold great significance in Buddhism, do not die during the peak of summer.\nThis tradition dates back to the pre-colonial era and continues to take place at major pagodas such as the Shwekyetyet and Shwekyetkya Pagodas in the former royal capital of Amarapura. A Konbaung era court poet, Letwe Thondara composed a complete set of \"yadu\" poems describing this festival in Meza Hill, near Katha, where he had been exiled by King Hsinbyushin.\nIn the Philippines.\nIn the Philippines, the date of Vesak (known as \"Araw ni Bisyak\", \"Kaarawan ni Buddha\", \"Araw ni Buddha\" or \"Adlaw sa Buddha\") follows the Chinese lunar calendar. Like China and Japan, Filipinos also bathe statues on this day.\nIn Singapore.\nIn Singapore, Vesak Day was made a public holiday in 1955 after many public petitions, replacing Whit Monday. In the early decades of the 20th century, Vesak Day was associated with the Ceylonese community, which then celebrated it along with their National Day in a two-day event. After World War II, there was a movement to make Vesak Day a public holiday, with the Singapore Buddhist Association leading the petitions.\nIn Vietnam.\nIn Vietnam, Vesak is also known as . From 1958 to 1975, Vesak was a national public holiday in South Vietnam. It was a public festival with floats, and lantern parades on the streets. Under the President Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, a member of Vietnam's Catholic minority, South Vietnamese Buddhists were not allowed to celebrate Vesak, and faced many other restrictions. \nOn 8 May 1963, the day of Vesak in Vietnam, more than 3000 Vietnamese Buddhists were protesting President Di\u1ec7m's ban on the Buddhist flag in the city of Hu\u1ebf. Tensions rose throughout the day, and as protesters gathered around a government radio station, the Vietnamese army and police were called in to disperse the crowd. Soon after, the army started to shoot and throw grenades into the crowd. Nine were killed, and four were seriously injured. These events are considered to be the beginning of Vietnam's Buddhist crisis, which culminated in a governmental coup and the assassination of President Di\u1ec7m. Successive South Vietnamese Governments recognized Vesak as a public holiday and allowed the celebrations to go on.\nHowever, after the Fall of Saigon, the day was no longer a public holiday. Since the 2000s, the festival has witnessed a revival across the country. The Vesak Celebration is officially held by the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha every year and it aggregated international delegates for great events in 2008, 2014, 2019 (the 16th United Nations Day of Vesak Celebration).\nIn South Asia.\nIn Nepal.\nVesak, commonly known in Nepal as \"Buddha Jayanti\" is widely celebrated all across the country, predominantly, Lumbini \u2013 the birthplace of Buddha, and Swayambhu \u2013 the holy temple for Buddhists, also known as \"the Monkey Temple\". The main door of Swayambhu is opened only on this very day, therefore, people from all over Kathmandu valley are stimulated by the event. Thousands of pilgrims from various parts of the world come together to celebrate Buddha's birthday at his birthplace, Lumbini. In Nepal, Buddha is worshipped by all religious groups, therefore \"Buddha Jayanti\" is marked by a public holiday. People donate foods and clothes to the needy and also provide financial aid to monasteries and schools where Buddhism is taught and practised.\nIn Sri Lanka.\nVesak is celebrated as a religious and a cultural festival in Sri Lanka on the full moon of the lunar month of Vesak (usually in the Gregorian month of May), for about one week, and this festival is often celebrated by people of different religions, as Buddhism is the religion of the majority of people in Sri Lanka. During this week, the selling of alcohol and fresh meat is usually prohibited, with slaughter houses also being closed. Celebrations include religious and alms-giving activities. Electrically lit pandals called \"thoranas\" are erected in locations mainly in Colombo, Kandy, Galle and elsewhere, most sponsored by donors, religious societies and welfare groups. Each pandal illustrates a story from the Jataka tales. Pandols (Thoranas) are electrically lit in almost all parts of the country, over 300 can be found all around the country every year. \nIn addition, colorful lanterns called \"Vesak kuudu\" are hung along streets and in front of homes. They signify the light of the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha. Food stalls set up by Buddhist devotees called \"dans\u00e4las\" provide free food, ice-cream and drinks to passersby. Groups of people from community organizations, businesses and government departments sing \"bhakti gee\" (Buddhist devotional songs). Colombo experiences a massive influx of people from all parts of the country during this week.\nIn India.\nIn India, the full moon day of the Vaisakha month of the Hindu calendar is celebrated as Buddha Purnima. The festival is commonly known as Buddha Purnima, as Purnima means full moon day in Sanskrit and Hindi languages. It is also called Buddha Jayanti, with Jayanti meaning birthday in Sanskrit. The festival is a public holiday in India.\nIn Bangladesh.\nVesak Day is an important festival for all Bengali Buddhists. In Bangladesh, it is celebrated in Chittagong, Dhaka, and other Buddhist regions like Bandarban, Khagrachhari, Rangamati in the country. In the Bangla language, it is known as Buddho Purnima. It is also a public holiday in Bangladesh.\nIn East Asia.\nIn Japan.\nIn Japan, Vesak or is also known as , ), , , and . It is not a public holiday. It is based on a legend that nine dragons appeared in the sky on the Buddha's birthday and poured am\u1e5bta over him.\nIt used to be celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th month in the Chinese calendar based on one of the legends that proclaims the day as Buddha's birthday. At present, the celebration is observed on 8 April of the Solar Calendar since the government of Meiji Japan adopted the western solar calendar as the official calendar. Since the 8th day of the 4th month in the lunar calendar commonly falls in May of the current solar calendar, it is now celebrated about a month earlier.\nIn Japan, Vesak celebrations include pouring , a sweet tea made from \"Hydrangea macrophylla\", on statues. In Buddhist religious sites such as temples and viharas, more involved ceremonies are conducted for lay Buddhists, priests, and monks and nuns.\nIn South Korea.\nIn South Korea the birthday of Buddha is celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th month in the Korean lunar calendar (as well as in Hong Kong, Macau) and is an official holiday. This day is called (Seokga tansinil), meaning \"Buddha's birthday\" or (Bucheonim osin nal) meaning \"the day when the Buddha came\". It has now grown into one of the nation's biggest cultural festivals. Lotus lanterns cover the entire temple throughout the month which are often flooded down the street. On the day of Buddha's birth, many temples provide free meals and tea to all visitors. The breakfast and lunch provided are often sanchae bibimbap.\nYeondeunghoe (\uc5f0\ub4f1\ud68c) is a lantern-lighting festival in Korea celebrating the Buddha's Birthday. It is inscribed in UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List from 2020 and enlisted as South Korean Intangible Cultural Property from 2012.\nOutside Asia.\nIn Canada.\nAn annual event known as \"Vesak: Buddha's Birthday\" is celebrated in Toronto in its three major three Buddhist temples, that represent the three main branches of Buddhism. Held at Mississauga Celebration Square, it features a number of Buddhist-themed events and activities, as well as cultural acts from Asia, including China, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.\n\"Vesak in Ottawa: Buddha's Birthday\" is celebrated in Ottawa. In May 2012, Visita Sirin Leelaratna organized a memorable Vesak celebration in Ottawa, the capital city of Canada. In commemoration of the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and passing, the event aims to bring together Buddhist groups worldwide. The commemoration has grown over the years, incorporating noteworthy occasions such as the unveiling of the International Buddhist flag at Ottawa's City Hall and official proclamations from regional authorities. \nWith speeches from prominent figures, artistic performances, and community initiatives aimed at fostering peace and understanding, the Vesak in Ottawa event has grown over the years. Leelaratna led the successful effort to make Ottawa the first city worldwide to implement official road signage directing travelers to Buddhist temples. The brown wayfinding signs, featuring the dharma wheel (dharmachakra) symbol and bilingual text \"Buddhist/Bouddhiste,\" were installed by the City of Ottawa, marking a significant milestone for Buddhist visibility and religious recognition within Canadian municipal infrastructure. Leelaratna, founder of Buddhist Embassy\u00ae, has advanced Vesak in Ottawa recognition in Canada through various initiatives, including advocacy for Vesak Heritage Month.\nIn United States.\nThe celebration of Vesak or Buddha's Birthday in the United States differs among different Buddhist communities, depending on their ethnicity and nationality.\nIn Maui, Hawaii the community is usually invited to celebrate Vesak Day (the birth of Buddha) on the full moon of Vaisakha at Chua Tu Hanh Buddhist Temple in Kahului, where there is guided sitting meditation and dharma talk by a Zen master; which is followed by the bathing ceremony of the baby Buddha and a joyful meal to end the evening.\nThe state of Hawaii has officially recognized April 8 of each year as \"Buddha Day\", which celebrates the birth of Gautama Buddha.\nIn the Bay Area of California, the Japanese celebration on April 8 has also been significant for several decades. In 1968 the first circumambulation of Mt. Tamalpais to celebrate Buddha's Birthday was conducted. Starting in 1969 at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, \"Hana-Matsuri (\u82b1\u30fc\u307e\u3064\u308a - flower festival)\" was celebrated each spring. Dressed in formal black robes, the roughly 70 monks and students form a formal procession to the Horse Pasture with the leader periodically ringing a small, clear bell. A temporary stone altar was built under a huge oak tree in a gorgeous field of green grass and abundant wildflowers; a small statue of a baby Buddha was placed upon it in a metal basin. Then each person, in turn, approaches the altar, and ladle one thin-lipped bamboo dipperful of sweet green tea over the statue, bow, and walk to one side.\nNew York celebrates the \"International Lotus Lantern Parade\", an annual event held at Union Square Park. The event celebrates the Buddha's birthday and \"Yeon Deung Hoe\" (\uc5f0\ub4f1\ud68c,\u71c3\u71c8\u6703), a Korean lantern celebration that is held during \"Vesak\". The festival features a number of Buddhist themed events and is started off by numerous Buddhist centers of Japanese, Korean and Sri Lankan origins for example.\nUnited Nations.\nOn 15 December 1999 the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 54/115, entitled 'International recognition of the Day of Vesak at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations offices'. The proposal to declare Vesak as an international public holiday was tabled at the United Nations General Assembly by Sri Lanka. The resolution internationally recognized the Day of Vesak to acknowledge the contributions that The Buddha and Buddhism have made for over two and a half millennia. It also called for annual commemoration of the day at the United Nations Headquarters, in New York, UNESCO and other United Nations offices around the world.\nInternational celebrations since 2000 included the first Vesak celebration in the United Nations (New York) on May 15, 2000. Thirty-four countries were represented. The Day of Vesak is an official holiday for the United Nations offices in many of the countries in Southeast Asia.\nInternational Vesak summit.\nThailand has hosted an international Vesak summit 11 times, Vietnam 3 times, and Sri Lanka once.\nLocal renditions.\nThere are multiple local renditions of the Vesak festival name, varying by local language, including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54244", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54244", "title": "Gravitational singularity", "text": "Condition in which spacetime itself breaks down\nA gravitational singularity, spacetime singularity, or simply singularity, is a theoretical condition in which gravity is predicted to be so intense that spacetime itself would break down catastrophically. As such, a singularity is by definition no longer part of the regular spacetime and cannot be determined by \"where\" or \"when\". Gravitational singularities exist at a junction between general relativity and quantum mechanics; therefore, the properties of the singularity cannot be described without an established theory of quantum gravity. Trying to find a complete and precise definition of singularities in the theory of general relativity, the best theory of gravity available, remains a difficult problem. A singularity in general relativity can be defined by the scalar invariant curvature becoming infinite or, better, by a geodesic being incomplete.\nGeneral relativity predicts that any object collapsing beyond its Schwarzschild radius would form a black hole, inside which a singularity will form. A black hole singularity is, however, covered by an event horizon, so it is never in the causal past of any outside observer, and at no time can it be objectively said to have formed. General relativity also predicts that the initial state of the universe, at the beginning of the Big Bang, was a singularity of infinite density and temperature. However, classical gravitational theories are not expected to be accurate under these conditions, and a quantum description is likely needed. For example, quantum mechanics does not permit particles to inhabit a space smaller than their Compton wavelengths.\nInterpretation.\nMany theories in physics have mathematical singularities of one kind or another. Equations for these physical theories predict that the ball of mass of some quantity becomes infinite or increases without limit. This is generally a sign for a missing piece in the theory, as in the ultraviolet catastrophe, re-normalization, and instability of a hydrogen atom predicted by the Larmor formula.\nIn classical field theories, including special relativity but not general relativity, one can say that a solution has a singularity at a particular point in spacetime where certain physical properties become ill-defined, with spacetime serving as a background field to locate the singularity. A singularity in general relativity, on the other hand, is more complex because spacetime itself becomes ill-defined, and the singularity is no longer part of the regular spacetime manifold. In general relativity, a singularity cannot be defined by \"where\" or \"when\".\nSome theories, such as the theory of loop quantum gravity, suggest that singularities may not exist. This is also true for such classical unified field theories as the Einstein\u2013Maxwell\u2013Dirac equations. The idea can be stated in the form that, due to quantum gravity effects, there is a minimum distance beyond which the force of gravity no longer continues to increase as the distance between the masses becomes shorter, or alternatively that interpenetrating particle waves mask gravitational effects that would be felt at a distance. \nMotivated by such philosophy of loop quantum gravity, recently it has been shown that such conceptions can be realized through some elementary constructions based on the refinement of the first axiom of geometry, namely, the concept of a point by considering Klein's prescription of accounting for the extension of a small spot that represents or demonstrates a point, which was a programmatic call that he called as a fusion of arithmetic and geometry. Klein's program, according to Born, was actually a mathematical route to consider 'natural uncertainty in all observations' while describing 'a physical situation' by means of 'real numbers'.\nTypes.\nThere are multiple types of singularities, each with different physical features that have characteristics relevant to the theories from which they originally emerged, such as the different shapes of the singularities, \"conical and curved\". They have also been hypothesized to occur without event horizons, structures that delineate one spacetime section from another in which events cannot affect past the horizon; these are called \"naked.\"\nConical.\nA conical singularity occurs when there is a point where the limit of some diffeomorphism invariant quantity does not exist or is infinite, in which case spacetime is not smooth at the point of the limit itself. Thus, spacetime looks like a cone around this point, where the singularity is located at the tip of the cone. The metric can be finite everywhere the coordinate system is used.\nAn example of such a conical singularity is a cosmic string and the central singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole.\nCurvature.\nSolutions to the equations of general relativity or another theory of gravity (such as supergravity) often result in encountering points where the metric blows up to infinity. However, many of these points are completely regular, and the infinities are merely a result of using an inappropriate coordinate system at this point. To test whether there is a singularity at a certain point, one must check whether at this point diffeomorphism invariant quantities (i.e. scalars) become infinite. Such quantities are the same in every coordinate system, so these infinities will not \"go away\" by a change of coordinates.\nAn example is the Schwarzschild solution that describes a non-rotating, uncharged black hole. In coordinate systems convenient for working in regions far away from the black hole, a part of the metric becomes infinite at the event horizon. However, spacetime at the event horizon is regular. The regularity becomes evident when changing to another coordinate system (such as the Kruskal coordinates), where the metric is perfectly smooth. On the other hand, in the center of the black hole, where the metric becomes infinite as well, the solutions suggest a singularity exists. The existence of the singularity can be verified by noting that the Kretschmann scalar, being the square of the Riemann tensor i.e. formula_1, which is diffeomorphism invariant, is infinite.\nWhile in a non-rotating black hole the singularity occurs at a single point in the model coordinates, called a \"point singularity\", in a rotating black hole, also known as a Kerr black hole, the singularity occurs on a ring (a circular line), known as a \"ring singularity\". Such a singularity may also theoretically become a wormhole.\nMore generally, a spacetime is considered singular if it is geodesically incomplete, meaning that there are freely-falling particles whose motion cannot be determined beyond a finite time, being after the point of reaching the singularity. For example, any observer inside the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole would fall into its center within a finite period of time. The classical version of the Big Bang cosmological model of the universe contains a causal singularity at the start of time (\"t\"=0), where all time-like geodesics have no extensions into the past. Extrapolating backward to this hypothetical time 0 results in a universe with all spatial dimensions of size zero, infinite density, infinite temperature, and infinite spacetime curvature.\nNaked singularity.\nUntil the early 1990s, it was widely believed that general relativity hides every singularity behind an event horizon, making naked singularities impossible. This is referred to as the cosmic censorship hypothesis. However, in 1991, physicists Stuart Shapiro and Saul Teukolsky performed computer simulations of a rotating plane of dust that indicated that general relativity might allow for \"naked\" singularities. What these objects would actually look like in such a model is unknown. Nor is it known whether singularities would still arise if the simplifying assumptions used to make the simulation were removed. However, it is hypothesized that light entering a singularity would similarly have its geodesics terminated, thus making the naked singularity look like a black hole.\nDisappearing event horizons exist in the\u00a0Kerr metric, which is a spinning black hole in a vacuum, if the\u00a0angular momentum\u00a0(formula_2) is high enough. Transforming the Kerr metric to\u00a0Boyer\u2013Lindquist coordinates, it can be shown\u00a0that the coordinate (which is not the radius) of the event horizon is, formula_3, where\u00a0formula_4, and\u00a0formula_5. In this case, \"event horizons disappear\" means when the solutions are complex for\u00a0formula_6, or\u00a0formula_7. However, this corresponds to a case where formula_2 exceeds formula_9 (or in Planck units, formula_10); i.e. the spin exceeds what is normally viewed as the upper limit of its physically possible values.\nSimilarly, disappearing event horizons can also be seen with the\u00a0Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m\u00a0geometry of a charged black hole if the charge\u00a0(formula_11) is high enough. In this metric, it can be shown\u00a0that the singularities occur at formula_12, where\u00a0formula_4, and\u00a0formula_14. Of the three possible cases for the relative values of\u00a0formula_15 and\u00a0formula_16, the case where\u00a0formula_17\u00a0causes both\u00a0formula_6 to be complex. This means the metric is regular for all positive values of\u00a0formula_19, or in other words, the singularity has no event horizon. However, this corresponds to a case where formula_20 exceeds formula_21 (or in Planck units, formula_22); i.e. the charge exceeds what is normally viewed as the upper limit of its physically possible values. Also, actual astrophysical black holes are not expected to possess any appreciable charge.\nA black hole possessing the lowest formula_23 value consistent with its formula_2 and formula_11 values and the limits noted above; i.e., one just at the point of losing its event horizon, is termed extremal.\nEntropy.\nBefore Stephen Hawking came up with the concept of Hawking radiation, the question of black holes having entropy had been avoided. However, this concept demonstrates that black holes radiate energy, which conserves entropy and solves the incompatibility problems with the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy, however, implies heat and therefore temperature. The loss of energy also implies that black holes do not last forever, but rather evaporate or decay slowly. Black hole temperature is inversely related to mass. All known black hole candidates are so large that their temperature is far below that of the cosmic background radiation, which means they will gain energy on net by absorbing this radiation. They cannot begin to lose energy on net until the background temperature falls below their own temperature. This will occur at a cosmological redshift of more than one million, rather than the thousand or so since the background radiation formed.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54245", "revid": "45032371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54245", "title": "Technological singularity", "text": "Hypothetical event\nThe technological singularity, often simply called the singularity, is a hypothetical event in which technological growth accelerates beyond human control, producing unpredictable changes in human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good's intelligence explosion model of 1965, an upgradable intelligent agent could eventually enter a positive feedback loop of successive self-improvement cycles; more intelligent generations would appear more and more rapidly, causing an explosive increase in intelligence that culminates in a powerful superintelligence, far surpassing human intelligence.\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence could result in human extinction. The consequences of a technological singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\nProminent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and associated artificial intelligence \"explosion\", including Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, Gordon Moore, and Roger Penrose. One claim is that artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones. Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig observe that in the history of technology, improvement in a particular area tends to follow an S curve: it begins with accelerating improvement, then levels off without continuing upward into a hyperbolic singularity.\nHistory.\nAlan Turing, often regarded as the father of modern computer science, laid a crucial foundation for contemporary discourse on the technological singularity. His pivotal 1950 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" argued that a machine could, in theory, exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human. However, machines capable of performing at or beyond a human level do not require a technological singularity to have occurred in order to be developed, nor do they necessarily imply the possibility of such an occurrence, as demonstrated by events such as the victory of IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer in a chess match with grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1996.\nThe Hungarian\u2013American mathematician John von Neumann (1903\u20131957) is the first known person to discuss a coming \"singularity\" in technological progress. Stanislaw Ulam reported in 1958 that an earlier discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\nIn 1965, I. J. Good speculated that superhuman intelligence might bring about an \"intelligence explosion\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.\u2014\u200a\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge: first in 1983, in an article that claimed that, once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\"; and then in his 1993 essay \"The Coming Technological Singularity\", in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate, and he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030.\nAnother significant contribution to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil's 2005 book \"The Singularity Is Near\", predicting singularity by 2045.\nIntelligence explosion.\nAlthough technological progress has been accelerating in most areas, it has been limited by the basic intelligence of the human brain, which has not, according to Paul R. Ehrlich, changed significantly for millennia. But with the increasing power of computers and other technologies, it might eventually be possible to build a machine significantly more intelligent than humans.\nIf superhuman intelligence is invented\u2014through either the amplification of human intelligence or artificial intelligence\u2014it will, in theory, vastly surpass human problem-solving and inventive skill. Such an AI is often called a seed AI because if an AI is created with engineering capabilities that match or surpass those of its creators, it could autonomously improve its own software and hardware to design an even more capable machine, which could repeat the process in turn. This recursive self-improvement could accelerate, potentially allowing enormous qualitative change before reaching any limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation. It is speculated that over many iterations, such an AI would far surpass human cognitive abilities.\nEmergence of superintelligence.\nA superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of even the brightest and most gifted humans. \"Superintelligence\" may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent. I. J. Good, Vernor Vinge, and Ray Kurzweil define the concept in terms of the technological creation of super intelligence, arguing that it is difficult or impossible for present-day humans to predict what human beings' lives would be like in a post-singularity world.\nThe related concept of \"speed superintelligence\" describes an artificial intelligence that can function like a human mind but much faster. For example, given a millionfold increase in the speed of information processing relative to that of humans, a subjective year would pass in 30 physical seconds. Such a increase in information processing speed could result in, or significantly contribute to the singularity.\nTechnology forecasters and researchers disagree about when, or whether, human intelligence could likely be surpassed. Some argue that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) may result in general reasoning systems that bypass human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence. A number of futures studies focus on scenarios that combine these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to interface with computers, or upload their minds to computers, in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification. Robin Hanson's 2016 book \"The Age of Em\" describes a future in which human brains are scanned and digitized, creating \"uploads\" or digital versions of human consciousness. In this future, the development of these uploads may precede or coincide with the emergence of superintelligent AI.\nVariations.\nNon-AI singularity.\nSome writers use \"the singularity\" in a broader way, to refer to any radical changes in society brought about by new technology (such as molecular nanotechnology), although Vinge and other writers say that without superintelligence, such changes would not be a true singularity.\nPredictions.\nNumerous dates have been predicted for the attainment of singularity.\nIn 1965, Good wrote that it was more probable than not that an ultra-intelligent machine would be built in the 20th century.\nThat computing capabilities for human-level AI would be available in supercomputers before 2010 was predicted in 1988 by Moravec, assuming that the then current rate of improvement continued.\nThe attainment of greater-than-human intelligence between 2005 and 2030 was predicted by Vinge in 1993.\nHuman-level AI around 2029 and the singularity in 2045 was predicted by Kurzweil in 2005. He reaffirmed these predictions in 2024 in \"The Singularity is Nearer\".\nHuman-level AI by 2040, and intelligence far beyond human by 2050 was predicted in 1998 by Moravec, revising his earlier prediction.\nA median confidence of 50% that human-level AI would be developed by 2040\u20132050 was the outcome of four informal polls of AI researchers, conducted in 2012 and 2013 by Bostrom and M\u00fcller.\nIn September 2025, a review of surveys of scientists and industry experts from the previous 15 years found that most agreed that artificial general intelligence (AGI), a level well below technological singularity, will occur by 2100. A more recent analysis by AIMultiple reported, \"Current surveys of AI researchers are predicting AGI around 2040\".\nPlausibility.\nProminent technologists and academics who dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity include Paul Allen, Jeff Hawkins, John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker, Theodore Modis, and Gordon Moore, whose law is often cited in support of the concept.Proposed methods for creating superhuman or transhuman minds typically fall into two categories: intelligence amplification of human brains and artificial intelligence. The many speculated ways to augment human intelligence include bioengineering, genetic engineering, nootropic drugs, AI assistants, direct brain\u2013computer interfaces, and mind uploading.\nRobin Hanson has expressed skepticism of human intelligence augmentation, writing that once the \"low-hanging fruit\" of easy methods for increasing human intelligence have been exhausted, further improvements will become increasingly difficult.\nIn conversation regarding human-level artificial intelligence with cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, computer scientist Grady Booch, speaking skeptically, referred to the singularity as \"sufficiently imprecise, filled with emotional and historic baggage, and touches some of humanity's deepest hopes and fears that it's hard to have a rational discussion therein\". Later in the conversation, Marcus, while more optimistic about the progress of AI, agreed that any major advances would not happen as a single event, but rather as a slow and gradual increase in reliability usefulness.\nThe possibility of an intelligence explosion depends on three factors. The first accelerating factor is the new intelligence enhancements made possible by each previous improvement. But as the intelligences become more advanced, further advances will become more and more complicated, possibly outweighing the advantage of increased intelligence. Each improvement should generate at least one more improvement, on average, for movement toward singularity to continue. Finally, the laws of physics may eventually prevent further improvement.\nThere are two logically independent, but mutually reinforcing, causes of intelligence improvements: increases in the speed of computation and improvements to the algorithms used. The former is predicted by Moore's Law and the forecasted improvements in hardware, and is comparatively similar to previous technological advances. \"Most experts believe that Moore's law is coming to an end during this decade\", the AIMultiple report reads, but \"quantum computing can be used to efficiently train neural networks\", potentially working around any end to Moore's Law. But Schulman and Sandberg argue that software will present more complex challenges than simply operating on hardware capable of running at human intelligence levels or beyond.\nA 2017 email survey of authors with publications at the 2015 NeurIPS and ICML machine learning conferences asked about the chance that \"the intelligence explosion argument is broadly correct\". Of the respondents, 12% said it was \"quite likely\", 17% said it was \"likely\", 21% said it was \"about even\", 24% said it was \"unlikely\", and 26% said it was \"quite unlikely\".\nSpeed improvements.\nBoth for human and artificial intelligence, hardware improvements increase the rate of future hardware improvements. Some upper limit on speed may eventually be reached. Jeff Hawkins has said that a self-improving computer system will inevitably run into limits on computing power: \"in the end there are limits to how big and fast computers can run. We would end up in the same place; we'd just get there a bit faster. There would be no singularity.\"\nIt is difficult to directly compare silicon-based hardware with neurons. But Anthony Berglas notes that computer speech recognition is approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware is within a few orders of magnitude of being as powerful as the human brain, as well as taking up much less space. The costs of training systems with deep learning may be larger.\nExponential growth.\nThe exponential growth in computing technology suggested by Moore's law is commonly cited as a reason to expect a singularity in the relatively near future, and a number of authors have proposed generalizations of Moore's law. Computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec proposed in a 1998 book that the exponential growth curve could be extended back to earlier computing technologies before the integrated circuit.\nRay Kurzweil postulates a law of accelerating returns whereby the speed of technological change (and more generally, all evolutionary processes) increases exponentially, generalizing Moore's law in the same manner as Moravec's proposal, and also including material technology (especially as applied to nanotechnology) and medical technology. Between 1986 and 2007, machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers has doubled every 18 months; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; and the world's storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months. On the other hand, it has been argued that the global acceleration pattern having a 21st-century singularity as its parameter should be characterized as hyperbolic rather than exponential.\nKurzweil reserves the term \"singularity\" for a rapid increase in artificial intelligence (as opposed to other technologies), writing: \"The Singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains ... There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine\". He also defines the singularity as when computer-based intelligences significantly exceed the sum total of human brainpower, writing that advances in computing before that \"will not represent the Singularity\" because they do \"not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence.\"\nAccelerating change.\nSome singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of past trends, especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements to technology. In one of the first uses of the term \"singularity\" in the context of technological progress, Stanislaw Ulam tells of a conversation with John von Neumann about accelerating change: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKurzweil claims that technological progress follows a pattern of exponential growth, following what he calls the \"law of accelerating returns\". Whenever technology approaches a barrier, Kurzweil writes, new technologies surmount it. He predicts paradigm shifts will become increasingly common, leading to \"technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history\". Kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur by 2045. His predictions differ from Vinge's in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity, rather than Vinge's rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence.\nOft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with molecular nanotechnology and genetic engineering. These threats are major issues for both singularity advocates and critics, and were the subject of Bill Joy's 2000 \"Wired\" magazine article \"Why The Future Doesn't Need Us\".\nAlgorithm improvements.\nSome intelligence technologies, like \"seed AI\", may also be able to make themselves not just faster but also more efficient, by modifying their source code. These improvements would make further improvements possible, which would make further improvements possible, and so on.\nThe mechanism for a recursively self-improving set of algorithms differs from an increase in raw computation speed in two ways. First, it does not require external influence: machines designing faster hardware would still require humans to create the improved hardware, or to program factories appropriately. An AI rewriting its own source code could do so while contained in an AI box.\nSecond, as with Vernor Vinge's conception of the singularity, it is much harder to predict the outcome. While speed increases seem to be only a quantitative difference from human intelligence, actual algorithm improvements would be qualitatively different.\nSubstantial dangers are associated with an intelligence explosion singularity originating from a recursively self-improving set of algorithms. First, the goal structure of the AI might self-modify, potentially causing the AI to optimise for something other than what was originally intended. Second, AIs could compete for the resources humankind uses to survive. While not actively malicious, AIs would promote the goals of their programming, not necessarily broader human goals, and thus might crowd out humans.\nCarl Shulman and Anders Sandberg suggest that algorithm improvements may be the limiting factor for a singularity; while hardware efficiency tends to improve at a steady pace, software innovations are more unpredictable and may be bottlenecked by serial, cumulative research. They suggest that in the case of a software-limited singularity, intelligence explosion would actually become more likely than with a hardware-limited singularity, because in the software-limited case, once human-level AI is developed, it could run serially on very fast hardware, and the abundance of cheap hardware would make AI research less constrained. An abundance of accumulated hardware that can be unleashed once the software figures out how to use it has been called \"computing overhang\".\nCriticism.\nLinguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker wrote in 2008: \"There is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity. The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible. Look at domed cities, jet-pack commuting, underwater cities, mile-high buildings, and nuclear-powered automobiles\u2014all staples of futuristic fantasies when I was a child that have never arrived. Sheer processing power is not a pixie dust that magically solves all your problems.\"\nJaron Lanier denies that the singularity is inevitable: \"I do not think the technology is creating itself. It's not an autonomous process [...] The reason to believe in human agency over technological determinism is that you can then have an economy where people earn their own way and invent their own lives. If you structure a society on \"not\" emphasizing individual human agency, it's the same thing operationally as denying people clout, dignity, and self-determination ... to embrace [the idea of the Singularity] would be a celebration of bad data and bad politics.\"\nPhilosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett said in 2017: \"The whole singularity stuff, that's preposterous. It distracts us from much more pressing problems [...] AI tools that we become hyper-dependent on\u2014that is going to happen. And one of the dangers is that we will give them more authority than they warrant.\"\nSome critics suggest religious motivations for believing in the singularity, especially Kurzweil's version. The buildup to the singularity is compared to Christian end-times scenarios. Beam called it \"a Buck Rogers vision of the hypothetical Christian Rapture\". John Gray has said, \"the Singularity echoes apocalyptic myths in which history is about to be interrupted by a world-transforming event\".\nIn \"The New York Times\", David Streitfeld questioned whether \"it might manifest first and foremost\u2014thanks, in part, to the bottom-line obsession of today\u2019s Silicon Valley\u2014as a tool to slash corporate America\u2019s head count.\"\nAstrophysicist and scientific philosopher Adam Becker criticizes Kurzweil's concept of human mind uploads to computers on the grounds that they are too fundamentally different and incompatible.\nSkepticism of exponential growth.\nTheodore Modis holds the singularity cannot happen. He claims the \"technological singularity\" and especially Kurzweil lack scientific rigor; Kurzweil is alleged to mistake the logistic function (S-function) for an exponential function, and to see a \"knee\" in an exponential function where there can in fact be no such thing. In a 2021 article, Modis wrote that no milestones\u2014breaks in historical perspective comparable in importance to the Internet, DNA, the transistor, or nuclear energy\u2014had been observed in the previous 20 years, while five of them would have been expected according to the exponential trend advocated by proponents of the technological singularity.\nAI researcher J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber has said that the frequency of subjectively \"notable events\" appears to be approaching a 21st-century singularity, but cautioned readers to take such plots of subjective events with a grain of salt: perhaps differences in memory of recent and distant events create an illusion of accelerating change where none exists.\nHofstadter (2006) raises concern that Kurzweil is insufficiently rigorous, that an exponential tendency of technology is not a scientific law like one of physics, and that exponential curves have no \"knees\". Nonetheless, he did not rule out the singularity in principle in the distant future and in light of ChatGPT and other recent advancements has revised his opinion significantly toward dramatic technological change in the near future.\nEconomist Robert J. Gordon points out that measured economic growth slowed around 1970 and slowed even further since the 2008 financial crisis, and argues that the economic data show no trace of a coming Singularity as imagined by I. J. Good.\nIn addition to general criticisms of the singularity concept, several critics have raised issues with Kurzweil's iconic chart. One line of criticism is that a log-log chart of this nature is inherently biased toward a straight-line result. Others identify selection bias in the points Kurzweil uses. For example, biologist PZ Myers points out that many of the early evolutionary \"events\" were picked arbitrarily. Kurzweil has rebutted this by charting evolutionary events from 15 neutral sources and showing that they fit a straight line on . Kelly (2006) argues that the way the Kurzweil chart is constructed, with the x-axis having time before the present, it always points to the singularity being \"now\", for any date on which one would construct such a chart, and shows this visually on Kurzweil's chart.\nTechnological limiting factors.\nMartin Ford postulates a \"technology paradox\": most routine jobs could be automated with a level of technology inferior to that required for a singularity. This would cause massive unemployment and plummeting consumer demand, which would eliminate the incentive to invest in the technology required to bring about the singularity. Job displacement is no longer limited to the types of work traditionally considered \"routine\".\nTheodore Modis and Jonathan Huebner argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise but is actually now declining. Evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer clock rates is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold. This is due to excessive heat buildup from the chip, which cannot be dissipated quickly enough to prevent it from melting when operating at higher speeds. Advances in speed may be possible in the future by virtue of more power-efficient CPU designs and multi-cell processors.\nMicrosoft co-founder Paul Allen has argued that there is a \"complexity brake\": the more progress science makes toward understanding intelligence, the more difficult it becomes to make additional progress. A study of the number of patents shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns, but in fact, as suggested by Joseph Tainter in \"The Collapse of Complex Societies\", a law of diminishing returns. The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850 to 1900, and has been declining since. The growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a widespread \"general systems collapse\".\nPotential impacts.\nDramatic changes in the rate of economic growth have occurred in the past because of technological advancement. Based on population growth, the economy doubled every 250,000 years from the Paleolithic era until the Neolithic Revolution. The new agricultural economy doubled every 900 years, a remarkable increase. Since the Industrial Revolution, the world's economic output has doubled every 15 years, 60 times faster than during the agricultural era. If the rise of superhuman intelligence causes a similar revolution, argues Robin Hanson, one would expect the economy to double at least quarterly and possibly weekly.\nUncertainty and risk.\nThe term \"technological singularity\" reflects the idea that such change may happen suddenly and that it is difficult to predict how the resulting new world would operate. It is unclear whether an intelligence explosion resulting in a singularity would be beneficial or harmful, or even an existential threat. Because AI is a major factor in singularity risk, several organizations pursue a technical theory of aligning AI goal-systems with human values, including the Future of Humanity Institute (until 2024), the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of Life Institute.\nPhysicist Stephen Hawking said in 2014: \"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.\" Hawking believed that in the coming decades, AI could offer \"incalculable benefits and risks\" such as \"technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand.\" He suggested that artificial intelligence should be taken more seriously and that more should be done to prepare for the singularity:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, \"We'll arrive in a few decades,\" would we just reply, \"OK, call us when you get here\u00a0\u2013 we'll leave the lights on\"? Probably not\u00a0\u2013 but this is more or less what is happening with AI.\n claims that there is no direct evolutionary motivation for AI to be friendly to humans. Evolution has no inherent tendency to produce outcomes valued by humans, and there is little reason to expect an arbitrary optimisation process to promote an outcome desired by humankind, rather than inadvertently leading to an AI behaving in a way not intended by its creators. Anders Sandberg has elaborated on this, addressing various common counter-arguments. AI researcher Hugo de Garis suggests that artificial intelligences may simply eliminate the human race for access to scarce resources, and humans would be powerless to stop them. Alternatively, AIs developed under evolutionary pressure to promote their own survival could outcompete humanity.\n discusses human extinction scenarios, and lists superintelligence as a possible cause:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When we create the first superintelligent entity, we might make a mistake and give it goals that lead it to annihilate humankind, assuming its enormous intellectual advantage gives it the power to do so. For example, we could mistakenly elevate a subgoal to the status of a supergoal. We tell it to solve a mathematical problem, and it complies by turning all the matter in the solar system into a giant calculating device, in the process killing the person who asked the question.\nAccording to Eliezer Yudkowsky, a significant problem in AI safety is that unfriendly AI is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. Both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, but friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification. proposes an AI design that avoids several dangers, including self-delusion, unintended instrumental actions, and corruption of the reward generator. He also discusses social impacts of AI and testing AI. His 2001 book \"Super-Intelligent Machines\" advocates public education about AI and public control over AI. It also proposes a simple design that is vulnerable to corruption of the reward generator.\nNext step of sociobiological evolution.\nA 2016 \"Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution\" article argues that humanity is in the midst of a major evolutionary transition that merges technology, biology, and society. This is due to digital technology infiltrating the fabric of human society to a degree of often life-sustaining dependence. The article says, \"humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels [...] we trust artificial intelligence with our lives through antilock braking in cars and autopilots in planes... With one in three courtships leading to marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction\".\nThe article further argues that from the perspective of evolution, several previous Major Transitions in Evolution have transformed life through innovations in information storage and replication (RNA, DNA, multicellularity, and culture and language). In the current stage of life's evolution, the carbon-based biosphere has generated a system (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition.\nThe digital information created by humans has reached a similar magnitude to biological information in the biosphere. Since the 1980s, the quantity of digital information stored has doubled about every 2.5 years, reaching about 5 zettabytes in 2014 (5\u00d71021 bytes).\nIn biological terms, there are 7.2\u00a0billion humans on the planet, each with a genome of 6.2\u00a0billion nucleotides. Since one byte can encode four nucleotide pairs, the individual genomes of every human could be encoded by approximately 1\u00d71019 bytes. The digital realm stored 500 times more information than this in 2014 (see figure). The total amount of DNA in all the cells on Earth is estimated to be about 5.3\u00d71037 base pairs, equivalent to 1.325\u00d71037 bytes of information. If growth in digital storage continues at its current rate of 30\u201338% compound annual growth per year, it will rival the total information content in all the DNA in all the cells on Earth in about 110 years. This would represent a doubling of the amount of information stored in the biosphere in just 150 years.\nImplications for human society.\nIn 2009, under the auspices of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Eric Horvitz chaired a meeting of leading computer scientists, artificial intelligence researchers, and roboticists at the Asilomar conference center in Pacific Grove, California. The goal was to discuss the impact of the possibility that robots could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the extent to which computers and robots might acquire autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to pose threats or hazards.\nSome machines are programmed with various forms of semi-autonomy, including the ability to locate their own power sources and choose targets to attack with weapons. Also, some computer viruses can evade elimination and, according to scientists in attendance, could therefore be said to have reached a \"cockroach\" stage of machine intelligence. The conference attendees noted that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that other potential hazards and pitfalls exist.\nFrank S. Robinson predicts that once humans achieve a machine with the intelligence of a human, scientific and technological problems will be tackled and solved with brainpower far superior to that of humans. He notes that artificial systems are able to share data more directly than humans, and predicts that this will result in a global network of super-intelligence that dwarfs human capability. Robinson also discusses how vastly different the future would look after such an intelligence explosion.\nHard or soft takeoff.\nIn a hard takeoff scenario, an artificial superintelligence rapidly self-improves, \"taking control\" of the world (perhaps in a matter of hours), too quickly for significant human-initiated error correction or for a gradual tuning of the agent's goals. In a soft takeoff, the AI still becomes far more powerful than humanity, but at a human-like pace (perhaps on the order of decades), on a timescale where ongoing human interaction and correction can effectively steer its development.\nRamez Naam argues against a hard takeoff. He has pointed out that we already see recursive self-improvement by superintelligences, such as corporations. Intel, for example, has \"the collective brainpower of tens of thousands of humans and probably millions of CPU cores to... design better CPUs!\" But this has not led to a hard takeoff; rather, it has led to a soft takeoff in the form of Moore's law. Naam further points out that the computational complexity of higher intelligence may be much greater than linear, such that \"creating a mind of intelligence 2 is probably \"more\" than twice as hard as creating a mind of intelligence 1.\"\nJ. Storrs Hall believes that \"many of the more commonly seen scenarios for overnight hard takeoff are circular\u00a0\u2013 they seem to assume hyperhuman capabilities at the \"starting point\" of the self-improvement process\" in order for an AI to be able to make the dramatic, domain-general improvements required for takeoff. Hall suggests that rather than recursively self-improving its hardware, software, and infrastructure all on its own, a fledgling AI would be better off specializing in one area where it was most effective and then buying the remaining components on the marketplace, because the quality of products on the marketplace continually improves, and the AI would have a hard time keeping up with the cutting-edge technology used by the rest of the world.\nBen Goertzel agrees with Hall's suggestion that a new human-level AI would do well to use its intelligence to accumulate wealth. The AI's talents might inspire companies and governments to disperse its software throughout society. Goertzel is skeptical of a hard five-minute takeoff but speculates that a takeoff from human to superhuman level on the order of five years is reasonable. He calls this a \"semihard takeoff\".\nMax More disagrees, arguing that if there were only a few superfast human-level AIs, that they would not radically change the world, as they would still depend on other people to get things done and would still have human cognitive constraints. Even if all superfast AIs worked on intelligence augmentation, it is unclear why they would do better in a discontinuous way than existing human cognitive scientists at producing superhuman intelligence, although the rate of progress would increase. More further argues that superintelligence would not transform the world overnight: it would need to engage with existing, slow human systems to have physical impact on the world. \"The need for collaboration, for organization, and for putting ideas into physical changes will ensure that all the old rules are not thrown out overnight or even within years.\"\nRelation to immortality and aging.\nEric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, theorized in 1986 the possibility of cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and using as yet hypothetical biological machines, allowing immortality via nanotechnology. According to Richard Feynman, his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a \"medical\" use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines. Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be shrunk to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"swallow the doctor\". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.\"\nIn 1988, Moravec predicted mind uploading, the possibility of \"uploading\" a human mind into a human-like robot, achieving quasi-immortality by extreme longevity via transfer of the human mind between successive new robots as the old ones wear out; beyond that, he predicts later exponential acceleration of subjective experience of time leading to a subjective sense of immortality.\nIn 2005, Kurzweil suggested that medical advances would allow people to protect their bodies from the effects of aging, making life expectancy limitless. He argues that technological advances in medicine would allow us to continuously repair and replace defective components in our bodies, prolonging life to an undetermined age. Kurzweil buttresses his argument by discussing current bio-engineering advances. He suggests somatic gene therapy; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step is to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.\nBeyond merely extending the operational life of the physical body, Jaron Lanier argues for a form of immortality called \"Digital Ascension\" that involves \"people dying in the flesh and being uploaded into a computer and remaining conscious.\" This concept was the central to the television series \"Upload\".\nHistory of the concept.\nA paper by Mahendra Prasad, published in \"AI Magazine\", asserts that the 18th-century mathematician Marquis de Condorcet first hypothesized and mathematically modeled an intelligence explosion and its effects on humanity.\nAn early description of the idea was made in John W. Campbell's 1932 short story \"The Last Evolution\".\nIn his 1958 obituary for John von Neumann, Ulam recalled a conversation with him about the \"ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.\"\nIn 1965, Good wrote his essay postulating an \"intelligence explosion\" of recursive self-improvement of a machine intelligence.\nIn 1977, Hans Moravec wrote an article with unclear publishing status where he envisioned a development of self-improving thinking machines, a creation of \"super-consciousness, the synthesis of terrestrial life, and perhaps jovian and martian life as well, constantly improving and extending itself, spreading outwards from the solar system, converting non-life into mind.\" The article describes the human mind uploading later covered in Moravec (1988). The machines are expected to reach human level and then improve themselves beyond that (\"Most significantly of all, they [the machines] can be put to work as programmers and engineers, with the task of optimizing the software and hardware which make them what they are. The successive generations of machines produced this way will be increasingly smarter and more cost effective.\") Humans will no longer be needed, and their abilities will be overtaken by the machines: \"In the long run the sheer physical inability of humans to keep up with these rapidly evolving progeny of our minds will ensure that the ratio of people to machines approaches zero, and that a direct descendant of our culture, but not our genes, inherits the universe.\" While the word \"singularity\" is not used, the notion of human-level thinking machines thereafter improving themselves beyond human level is there. In this view, there is no intelligence explosion in the sense of a very rapid intelligence increase once human equivalence is reached. An updated version of the article was published in 1979 in Analog Science Fiction and Fact.\nIn 1981, Stanis\u0142aw Lem published his science fiction novel \"Golem XIV\". It describes a military AI computer (Golem XIV) that obtains consciousness and starts to increase its intelligence, moving toward personal technological singularity. Golem XIV was originally created to aid its builders in fighting wars, but as its intelligence advances to a much higher level than that of humans, it stops being interested in the military requirements because it finds them lacking internal logical consistency.\nVernor Vinge addressed Good's intelligence explosion in the January 1983 issue of \"Omni\" magazine. Vinge seems to have been the first to use the term \"singularity\" (although not \"technological singularity\") in a way specifically tied to the creation of intelligent machines:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We will soon create intelligences greater than our own. When this happens, human history will have reached a kind of singularity, an intellectual transition as impenetrable as the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole, and the world will pass far beyond our understanding. This singularity, I believe, already haunts a number of science-fiction writers. It makes realistic extrapolation to an interstellar future impossible. To write a story set more than a century hence, one needs a nuclear war in between ... so that the world remains intelligible.\nIn 1985, in \"The Time Scale of Artificial Intelligence\", AI researcher Ray Solomonoff articulated mathematically the related notion of what he called an \"infinity point\": if a research community of human-level self-improving AIs take four years to double their own speed, then two years, then one year and so on, their capabilities increase infinitely in finite time.\nIn 1986, Vinge published \"Marooned in Realtime\", a science-fiction novel where a few remaining humans traveling forward in the future have survived an unknown extinction event that might well be a singularity. In a short afterword, Vinge writes that an actual technological singularity would not be the end of the human species: \"of course it seems very unlikely that the Singularity would be a clean vanishing of the human race. (On the other hand, such a vanishing is the timelike analog of the silence we find all across the sky.)\".\nIn 1988, Vinge used the phrase \"technological singularity\" in the short-story collection \"Threats and Other Promises\", writing in the introduction to his story \"The Whirligig of Time\": \"Barring a worldwide catastrophe, I believe that technology will achieve our wildest dreams, and\" soon. \"When we raise our own intelligence and that of our creations, we are no longer in a world of human-sized characters. At that point we have fallen into a technological \"black hole\", a technological singularity.\"\nIn 1988, Hans Moravec published \"Mind Children\", in which he predicted human-level intelligence in supercomputers by 2010, self-improving intelligent machines far surpassing human intelligence later, human mind uploading into human-like robots later, intelligent machines leaving humans behind, and space colonization. He did not mention \"singularity\", though, and he did not speak of a rapid explosion of intelligence immediately after the human level is achieved. Nonetheless, the overall singularity tenor is there in predicting both human-level artificial intelligence and further artificial intelligence far surpassing humans later.\nVinge's 1993 article \"The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era\", spread widely on the internet and helped popularize the idea. This article contains the statement, \"Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.\" Vinge argues that science-fiction authors cannot write realistic post-singularity characters who surpass the human intellect, as the thoughts of such an intellect is beyond humans' ability to express.\nMinsky's 1994 article says robots will \"inherit the Earth\", possibly with the use of nanotechnology, and proposes to think of robots as human \"mind children\", drawing the analogy from Moravec. The rhetorical effect of the analogy is that if humans are fine to pass the world to their biological children, they should be equally fine to pass it to robots, their \"mind children\". Per Minsky, \"we could design our 'mind-children' to think a million times faster than we do. To such a being, half a minute might seem as long as one of our years, and each hour as long as an entire human lifetime.\" The feature of the singularity present in Minsky is the development of superhuman artificial intelligence (\"million times faster\"), but there is no talk of sudden intelligence explosion, self-improving thinking machines, or unpredictability beyond any specific event, and the word \"singularity\" is not used.\nTipler's 1994 book \"The Physics of Immortality\" predicts a future where super\u2013intelligent machines build enormously powerful computers, people are \"emulated\" in computers, life reaches every galaxy, and people achieve immortality when they reach Omega Point. There is no talk of Vingean \"singularity\" or sudden intelligence explosion, but intelligence much greater than human is there, as well as immortality.\nIn 2000, Bill Joy, a prominent technologist and a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, voiced concern over the potential dangers of robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.\nIn 2005, Kurzweil published \"The Singularity Is Near\". Kurzweil's publicity campaign included an appearance on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\".\nFrom 2006 to 2012, an annual Singularity Summit conference was organized by Machine Intelligence Research Institute, founded by Eliezer Yudkowsky.\nIn 2007, Yudkowsky suggested that many of the varied definitions that have been assigned to \"singularity\" are mutually incompatible rather than mutually supporting. For example, Kurzweil extrapolates current technological trajectories past the arrival of self-improving AI or superhuman intelligence, which Yudkowsky argues represents a tension with both I. J. Good's proposed discontinuous upswing in intelligence and Vinge's thesis on unpredictability.\nIn 2009, Kurzweil and X-Prize founder Peter Diamandis announced the establishment of Singularity University, a nonaccredited private institute whose mission is \"to educate, inspire and empower leaders to apply exponential technologies to address humanity's grand challenges.\" Funded by companies such as Google, Autodesk, and ePlanet Ventures, the organization runs an annual ten-week graduate program as well as smaller \"executive\" courses.\nIn politics.\nIn 2007, the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress released a report about the future of nanotechnology.

He succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV at the age of five. Until he reached maturity (then defined as his 13th birthday) in 1723, the kingdom was ruled by his grand-uncle Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, as Regent of France. Cardinal Fleury was chief minister from 1726 until his death in 1743, at which time the king took sole control of the kingdom.\nHis reign of almost 59 years (from 1715 to 1774) was the second longest in the history of France, exceeded only by his predecessor, Louis XIV, who had ruled for 72 years (from 1643 to 1715). In 1748, Louis returned the Austrian Netherlands, won at the Battle of Fontenoy of 1745. He ceded New France in North America to Great Britain and Spain at the conclusion of the disastrous Seven Years' War in 1763. He incorporated the territories of the Duchy of Lorraine and the Corsican Republic into the Kingdom of France. Historians generally criticize his reign, citing how reports of his corruption embarrassed the monarchy, while his wars drained the treasury and produced little gain. However, a minority of scholars argue that he was popular during his lifetime, but that his reputation was later blackened by revolutionary propaganda. His grandson and successor Louis XVI inherited a kingdom on the brink of financial disaster and gravely in need of political reform, laying the groundwork for the French Revolution of 1789.\nEarly life and the Regency (1710\u20131723).\nLouis XV was the great-grandson of Louis XIV and the third son of the Duke of Burgundy (1682\u20131712), and his wife Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Savoy, who was the eldest daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy. He was born in the Palace of Versailles on 15 February 1710 and was immediately styled the Duke of Anjou. At this time, the possibility of the Duke of Anjou becoming the next king seemed rather remote as Louis XIV's eldest son and heir, Louis's paternal grandfather Louis \"Le Grand Dauphin\", was expected to assume the throne upon the old king's death. Next in line to the throne behind the Grand Dauphin was his eldest son- Louis's father \"Le Petit Dauphin\" and then Louis's elder brother, a child named Louis, Duke of Brittany. Disease, however, steered the line of succession forward three generations and sideways: on 14 April 1711 the Grand Dauphin, died of smallpox, and less than a year later, on 12 February 1712 the future king's mother, Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, who had been stricken with measles, died, followed six days later by Louis's father, her devoted husband who would not leave her side during her illness. With the death of both the \"Grand\" and \"Petit\" dauphins, Louis's elder brother immediately became Dauphin of France, but just over two weeks further still, on 7 March, it was found that both the elder Louis and the younger Louis had also contracted measles. The two brothers were treated in the traditional way, with bloodletting. On the night of 8\u20139 March, the new Dauphin, age five, died from the combination of the disease and the treatment. The governess of Louis, Madame de Ventadour, forbade the doctors to bleed the two year old Duke of Anjou by hiding him in a palace closet where she cared for him alone; where he survived despite being very ill. When Louis XIV himself finally died on 1 September 1715, Louis, at the age of five, trembling and crying and against all probability, inherited the throne as Louis XV.\nAccording to Charles V's royal ordinance of 1374 the Kingdom of France must be governed by a regent until a given king had reached the age of 13. The title of regent was customarily assigned to an under-aged king's nearest adult living relative, often his mother or an uncle. But as Louis's mother had been struck down by disease, and as his only uncle had already been enthroned as King of Spain, the job fell to his great-uncle Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. However Louis XIV had distrusted Philippe, who was a renowned soldier but was regarded by the late King as an atheist and libertine. The King referred privately to Philippe as a \"Fanfaron des crimes\" (\"braggart of crimes\"). Louis XIV had desired for France to be ruled by his favorite but illegitimate son, the Duke of Maine (illegitimate son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan), who was in the council and who, because of a dramatic change in the laws of succession instituted by Louis XIV, and, as his oldest surviving male descendant, could now legally become king if the legitimate direct line of succession became extinguished. In August 1714, shortly before his own death, the King rewrote his will to restrict the powers of the regent; it stipulated that the nation was to be governed by a Regency Council made up of fourteen members until the new king reached the age of majority. Philippe, nephew of Louis XIV, was named president of this Council, but other members included the Duke of Maine and at least seven of his well-known allies. According to the will, all decisions were to be made by majority vote, meaning that the president could always be outvoted by Maine's party and effectively allowing Maine to rule France for the next eight years.\nPhilippe saw the trap. The Parlement of Paris, an assembly of French nobles among whom Philippe had many friends, was the only judicial body in France with the authority to have this portion of the deceased King's will annulled, and immediately after the King's death Philippe approached the Parlement requesting that they do just this. In exchange for their support he agreed to restore to the Parlement its \"droit de remontrance\" (right of remonstrance) \u2013 the right to challenge a king's decisions \u2013 which had been removed by Louis XIV. The \"droit de remontrance\" would impair the monarchy's functioning and marked the beginning of a conflict between the Parlement and King which contributed to the French Revolution in 1789. In the mean time, however, the will was annulled and Philippe was installed as Regent with full powers to act in the name of the King in all matters.\nOn 9 September 1715, Philippe had the young King transported away from the court in Versailles to Paris, where the Regent had his own residence in the Palais Royal. On 12 September, the King performed his first official act, opening the first \"lit de justice\" of his reign at the Palais Royal. From September 1715 until January 1716 he lived in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes, before moving to the Tuileries Palace. In February 1717, when he had reached the age of seven, the King was taken away in tears from his beloved governess Madame Ventadour and placed in the care of Fran\u00e7ois de Villeroy, the 73-year-old Duke and \"Mar\u00e9chal de France\", named as his governor in Louis XIV's will of August 1714. Villeroy instructed the young King in court etiquette, taught him how to review a regiment, and how to receive royal visitors. His guests included the Russian Tsar Peter the Great in 1717; at their first meeting and contrary to ordinary protocol between such great rulers, the two-meter-tall Tsar greeted Louis by picking him up under the arms and giving him a kiss. Louis also learned the skills of horseback riding and hunting, which became great passions. In 1720, following the example of Louis XIV, Villeroy had the young Louis dance in public in two ballets\u2014once at the Tuileries Palace on 24 February 1720, and then again in \"The Ballet des Elements\" on 31 December 1721. The shy Louis was terrified of these performances, and never danced in another ballet.\nThe King's tutor was the Abb\u00e9 Andr\u00e9-Hercule de Fleury, the bishop of Fr\u00e9jus (and later to become Cardinal de Fleury), who saw that he was instructed in Latin, Italian, history and geography, astronomy, mathematics and drawing, and cartography. The King had charmed the visiting Russian Tsar in 1717 by identifying the major rivers, cities and geographic features of Russia. In his later life the King retained his passion for science and geography; he created departments in physics (1769) and mechanics (1773) at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and he sponsored the first complete and accurate map of France, the Cartes de Cassini. Besides his academic studies, he received a practical education in government. Beginning in 1720 he attended the regular meetings of the Regency Council.\nOne economic crisis disrupted the Regency; the Scottish economist and banker John Law was named controller-general of finances. In May 1716, he opened the \"Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Priv\u00e9e\" (\"General Private Bank\"), which soon became the Banque Royal. It was mostly funded by the government, and was one of the earliest banks to issue paper money, which he promised could be exchanged for gold. He also persuaded wealthy Parisians to invest in the Mississippi Company, a scheme for the colonization of the French territory of Louisiana. The stock of the company first soared and then collapsed in 1720, taking the bank with it. Law fled France, and wealthy Parisians became reluctant to make further investments or trust any currency but gold.\nIn 1719, France, in alliance with Britain and the Dutch Republic, declared war on Spain. Spain was defeated on both land and sea, and quickly sought peace. A Franco-Spanish treaty was signed on 27 March 1721. The two governments proposed to unite their royal families by marrying Louis to his cousin, Mariana Victoria of Spain, the three-year-old daughter of Philip V of Spain, who was himself a grandson of Louis XIV. The marriage contract was signed on 25 November 1721, and the future bride came to France and took up residence in the Louvre. However, after the death of the Regent, in 1725, the new Prime Minister decided she was too young to have children soon enough, and she was sent back to Spain. During the rest of the Regency, France was at peace, and in 1720, the Regent decreed an official silence on religious conflicts. Montesquieu and Voltaire published their first works, and the Age of Enlightenment in France quietly began.\nGovernment of the Duke of Bourbon (1723\u20131726).\nOn 15 June 1722, as Louis approached his thirteenth birthday, the year of his majority, he left Paris and moved back to Versailles, where he had happy memories of his childhood, but where he was far from the reach of public opinion. On 25 October, Louis was crowned King at the Cathedral of Reims. On 15 February 1723, the king's majority was declared by the Parlement of Paris, officially ending the regency. Philippe continued to manage the government, and took the title of Prime Minister in August 1723, but while visiting his mistress, far from the court and medical care, he died in December of the same year. Following the advice of his preceptor Fleury, Louis XV appointed his cousin Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, to replace the late Duke of Orl\u00e9ans as prime minister.\nMarriage and children.\nBefore his ascension, he was engaged to Infanta Mariana Victoria, and when the regent died, the royal court knew it was too early for the Infanta to have children early, so the engagement was called off and was sent back to Spain.\nOne of the first priorities of the Duke of Bourbon was to find a bride for the King, to assure the continuity of the monarchy, and especially to prevent the succession to the throne of the Orl\u00e9ans branch of the family, the rivals of his branch. A list of 99 princesses was prepared, among them being Princess Anne of Great Britain, Barbara of Portugal, Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark, Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine, Enrichetta d'Este and the Duke's own sisters Henriette Louise de Bourbon and \u00c9lisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon. In the end, the 21-year-old Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, daughter of Stanislaus I, the deposed king of Poland, was chosen. The others on the list along with Marie would either marry or stay unmarried. This is what would happen next:\nThe marriage was celebrated in September 1725 when the king was 15 and Marie was 22. Louis was said to have fallen in love with Marie instantly, and consummated his marriage to her seven times on their wedding night. From 1727 to 1737, Marie gave Louis XV ten children: eight girls and two boys. Of the boys, only the elder, the Dauphin Louis (1729\u20131765), survived childhood. While he did not live to rule, his birth as the awaited heir was welcomed with celebration in all spheres of French society. (The Dauphin Louis would go on to marry Maria Josepha of Saxony in 1747, who gave birth to the next three Kings of France: Louis XVI, Louis XVIII, and Charles X). Louis XV's second son, the Duke of Anjou, was born in 1730 and died in 1733. Of the daughters only the two oldest daughters, who were fraternal twins, were raised at Versailles; the others were sent away to be raised at the Abbey of Fontevrault.\nMarie was a pious and timid Queen who spent most of her time secluded with her own courtiers. She was a musician, read extensively, and played social games with her courtiers. After 1737, she did not share her bed with the King. She was deeply upset by the death of her son the Dauphin in 1765, and died on 24 June 1768.\n\"Unigenitus\", Jansenism and religious conflict.\nOne of the first serious conflicts that disturbed the early reign of Louis XV was a battle within the Catholic Church over a Papal Bull called \"Unigenitus\". The Bull was requested by Louis XIV of Pope Clement XI and granted on 8 September 1713. It was a fierce condemnation of Jansenism, a Catholic doctrine based largely on the teachings of Saint Augustine. Jansenism had attracted many important followers in France, including the philosopher Blaise Pascal, the poet Racine, aristocrats including Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 and Madame de Lafayette. The faculty of the Sorbonne, then primarily a theological college and a center of Jansenism, demanded clarification from the government. The Jansenists were allied with the Gallicans, theologians who wanted the Catholic Church in France to be distinctly French. The opposition to \"Unigenitus\" was particularly strong among the members of the Parlement of Paris, the assembly of the nobles. Despite the protests, on 24 March 1730 Cardinal Fleury persuaded the King to issue a decree that \"Unigenitus\" was the law of France as well as that of the Church.\nThe government and church imposed repressive measures. On 27 April 1732, the Archbishop of Paris threatened to excommunicate any member of the Church who read the Jansenist journal, \"Nouvelles Eccl\u00e9siastiques\". The \"Parlement\" was strictly forbidden to discuss religious questions, preventing them from opposing the \"Unigenitus\" bull. Priests who did not accept \"Unigenitus\" were denied the authority to administer last rites to the dying. A new tax, the \"cinquanti\u00e8me\", was levied against religious figures who had previously been exempted from taxation. Jansenists and Protestants were threatened with prison and banishment. As a result of these repressive acts, religious dissent remained an issue throughout the King's reign.\nTension grew between the Duke of Bourbon and Cardinal de Fleury over the King's favor. The Duke's rigid and cold personality did not appeal to the young King, who turned to his old tutor for advice on how to run the affairs of state. When the King insisted that Fleury was to be included in all meetings between himself and the Duke of Bourbon, the Duke was infuriated and began to undermine Fleury's position at court. When the King became aware of the Duke's intrigue, he abruptly dismissed him and replaced him with Fleury.\nRule with Cardinal de Fleury (1726\u20131743).\nFinances and control of dissent.\nFrom 1726 until his death in 1743, Fleury effectively ruled France with the king's assent. Fleury dictated the choices to be made, and encouraged the king's indecision and flattered his pride. He forbade the king to discuss politics with the Queen. In order to save on court expenses, he sent the youngest four daughters of the king to be educated at the Abbey of Fontevrault. On the surface it was the most peaceful and prosperous period of the reign of Louis XV, but it was built upon a growing volcano of opposition, particularly from the noble members of the Parlements, who saw their privileges and power reduced. Fleury made the papal doctrine \"Unigenitus\" part of French law and forbade any debate in Parlement, which caused the silent opposition to grow. He also downplayed the importance of the French Navy, which would prove be a fatal mistake in future conflicts.\nFleury showed the King the virtues of a stable government; he kept the same Minister of War, Bauyn d'Angervilliers, and controller of the currency, Philibert Orry, for twelve years, and his minister of foreign affairs, Germain Louis Chauvelin, for ten years. His minister of the Navy and household of the King, the Conte de Maurepas, was in office the entire period. In all he had just thirteen ministers over the course of nineteen years, while the King, in his last thirty-one years, employed forty-three.\nLouis's Controller-General of Finances Michel Robert Le Peletier des Forts (1726\u20131730), stabilized the French currency, though he was expelled for enriching himself in 1730. His successor, Philibert Orry, substantially reduced the debt caused by the War of the Spanish Succession, and simplified and made more fair the tax system, though he still had to depend upon the unpopular \"dixieme\", or tax of the tenth of the revenue of every citizen. Orry managed, in the last two years of Fleury's government, to balance the royal budget, an accomplishment never again repeated during the rest of the reign.\nFleury's government expanded commerce, both within France and with the rest of the world. Transportation and shipping were improved with the completion of the Saint-Quentin canal (linking the Oise and Somme rivers) in 1738, which was later extended to the Escaut River and the Low Countries, and the systematic building of a national road network. By the middle of the 18th century, France had the most modern and extensive road network in the world. The Council of Commerce stimulated trade, and French foreign maritime trade increased from 80 to 308\u00a0million \"livres\" between 1716 and 1748.\nThe Government continued its policy of religious repression, aimed at the Jansenists and the so-called \"Gallicans\" in Parlements of nobles. After the dismissal of 139 members of provincial parlements for opposing the official government and papal doctrine of \"Unigenitus\", the Parlement of Paris had to register the \"Unigenitus\" papal bull and was forbidden to hear religious cases in the future.\nForeign relations \u2013 New alliances; the War of the Polish Succession.\nIn the first years of his governance, Fleury and his foreign minister Germain Louis Chauvelin sought to maintain the peace by maintaining the French alliance with Great Britain, despite their colonial rivalry in North America and the West Indies. They also rebuilt the alliance with Spain, which had been shaken by the anger of the Spanish King when Louis refused to marry the Spanish \"infanta\". The birth of the king's male heir in 1729 dispelled the risks of a succession crisis in France. However, new powers were emerging on the European stage, particularly Russia under Peter the Great and his successor, Catherine. The Habsburg monarchy under Charles VI was assembling a scattered but impressive empire as far as Serbia in southeastern Europe with territories taken from the Ottoman Empire, and from Spain, acquiring the Austrian Netherlands, Milan and the Kingdom of Naples.\nA new coalition against France began to assemble in eastern Europe, sealed by a defensive treaty signed on 6 August 1726 between Prussia, Russia and Austria. In 1732 the coalition came into direct conflict with France over the succession to the Polish throne. The King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, Augustus II, was dying, and the favoured candidate to succeed him was Stanislaus I Leszczy\u0144ski, the father of the Queen of France. In the same year Russia, Prussia and Austria signed a secret agreement to exclude Stanislaus from the throne, and put forward another candidate, Augustus III, son of the deceased Polish king. The death of Augustus on 1 February 1733, with two heirs claiming the throne, sparked the War of the Polish Succession. Stanislaus traveled to Warsaw, where he was elected and crowned on 12 September. Empress Anna of Russia immediately marched her regiments into Poland to support her candidate. Stanislaus was forced to flee to the fortified port of Danzig, while on 5 October Augustus III was crowned in Warsaw.\nCardinal Fleury responded with a carefully orchestrated campaign of diplomacy. He first won assurances from Britain and Holland that they would not interfere in the war, while lining up alliances with Spain and Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia in exchange for pieces of the Habsburg monarchy. On 10 October 1733, Louis formally declared war against Austria. A French army occupied the Duchy of Lorraine, while another crossed the Alps and captured Milan on 3 November, handing it over to the King of Sardinia. Fleury was less energetic in his actions to restore the Polish throne to Stanislaus, who was blockaded by the Russian navy and army in Danzig. Instead of sending the largest part of the French fleet from its station off Copenhagen to Danzig, he ordered it to return to Brest and sent only a small squadron with two thousand soldiers, which after a fierce action was sunk by the Russians. On 3 July Stanislaus was forced to flee again, in disguise, to Prussia, where he became the guest of King Frederick William I of Prussia in the castle of K\u00f6nigsberg.\nTo bring the war to an end, Fleury and Charles VI negotiated an ingenious diplomatic solution. Francis III, Duke of Lorraine, left Lorraine for Vienna, where he married Maria Theresa, the heir presumptive to the Habsburg thrones. The vacant throne of Lorraine was to be occupied by Stanislaus, who abandoned his claim to the Polish throne. Upon the death of Stanislaus, the Duchy of Lorraine and Bar would become part of France. Francis, as the future emperor, would be compensated for the loss of Lorraine by the granting of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The King of Sardinia would be compensated with certain territories in Lombardy. The marriage of Francis of Lorraine and Maria Theresa took place in 1736, and the other exchanges took place in turn. With the death of Stanislaus in 1766, Lorraine and the neighboring Duchy of Bar became part of France.\nIn September 1739, Fleury scored another diplomatic success. France's mediation in the war between the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire led to the Treaty of Belgrade (September 1739), which favoured the Ottoman Empire, beneficiary of a Franco-Ottoman alliance against the Habsburgs since the early 16th century. As a result, the Ottoman Empire in 1740 renewed the French capitulations, which marked the supremacy of French trade in the Middle East. With these successes, Louis XV's prestige reached its highest point. In 1740 Frederick William I of Prussia declared \"Since the Treaty of Vienna France is the arbiter of Europe.\"\nWar of the Austrian Succession.\nOn 29 October 1740, a courier brought the news to the King, who was hunting in Fontainebleau, that the Emperor Charles VI was dead, and his daughter Maria Theresa was set to succeed him. After two days of reflection, Louis declared, \"In these circumstances, I don't want to get involved at all. I will remain with my hands in my pockets, unless of course they want to elect a Protestant emperor.\" This attitude did not please France's allies, who saw an opportunity to take parts of the Habsburg empire, or Louis's generals, who for a century had won glory fighting Austria. The King in Prussia had died on 31 May and was succeeded by his son Frederick the Great, a military genius with ambitions to expand Prussia's borders. The Elector Charles Albert of Bavaria, supported by Frederick, challenged the succession of Maria Theresa, and on 17 December 1740 Frederick invaded the Austrian province of Silesia. The elderly Cardinal Fleury had too little energy left to oppose this war.\nFleury sent his highest ranking general, Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet, duc de Belle-Isle, the Mar\u00e9chal de Belle-Isle, the grandson of Nicolas Fouquet, the famous disgraced controller of finances of Louis XIV, as his ambassador to the Diet of Frankfurt, with instructions to avoid a war by supporting the candidacy of the Elector of Bavaria to the Austrian throne. Instead, the Mar\u00e9chal, who detested the Austrians, made an agreement to join with the Prussians against Austria, and the war began. French and Bavarian armies quickly captured Linz and laid siege to Prague. On 10 April 1741 Frederick won a major victory over the Austrians at the Battle of Mollwitz. On 18 May, Fleury assembled a new alliance combining France, Prussia, Spain and Bavaria, later joined by Poland and Sardinia. However, in 1742, the balance of the war shifted against France. The German-born British King, George II, who was also the Elector of Hanover, joined the war on the side of Austria and personally took charge of his soldiers fighting the French in Germany. Maria Theresa's Hungarian army recaptured Linz and marched into Bavaria as far as Munich. In June, Frederick of Prussia withdrew from the alliance with France, after gaining the Duchies of Silesia from the Austrians. Belleville had to abandon Prague, with a loss of eight thousand men. For seven years, France was engaged in a costly war with constantly shifting alliances. Orry, the superintendent of French finance, was forced to reinstate the highly unpopular \"dixieme\" tax to fund the war. Cardinal de Fleury did not live to see the end of the conflict; he died on 29 January 1743, and thereafter Louis ruled alone.\nThe war in Germany was not going well; the French and Bavarian forces were faced with the combined armies of Austria, Saxony, Holland, Sardinia and Hanover. The army of the Duke of Noailles was defeated by a force of British, Hessian and Hanover soldiers led by George II at the Battle of Dettingen, and in September French forces were compelled to abandon Germany.\nIn 1744, the Austrian Netherlands became the primary battlefield of the war, and the French position began to improve. Frederick the Great decided to rejoin the war on the French side. Louis XV left Versailles to lead his armies in the Netherlands in person, and French field command was given to the German-born Mar\u00e9chal Maurice de Saxe, a highly competent general. At the Battle of Fontenoy on 11 May 1745, Louis, accompanied by his young son the Dauphin, came under fire for the first time and witnessed a French victory over combined British, Dutch and Austrian forces. When the Dauphin became excited at the sight of so many dead enemy soldiers, the King told him, \"You see what a victory costs. The blood of our enemies is still the blood of men. The true glory is to spare it.\" Saxe went on to win further victories at Rocoux (1746) and Lauffeld (1747). In 1746 French forces besieged and occupied Brussels, which Louis entered in triumph. The King gave de Saxe the Chateau de Chambord in the Loire Valley as a reward for his victories.\nPersonal government (1743\u20131757).\nAfter Fleury's death in January 1743, his war minister, the Duke of Noailles, showed the King a letter that Louis XIV had written to his grandson, Philip V of Spain; it counseled: \"Don't allow yourself to be governed; be the master. Never have a favorite or a prime minister. Listen, consult your Council, but decide yourself. God, who made you King, will give you all the guidance you need, as long as you have good intentions.\" Louis followed this advice and decided to govern without a prime minister. Two of his ministers took the most prominent positions in his government; the finance minister, Jean Baptiste de Machault D'Arnouville, and the minister of the armies, Comte d'Argenson.\nWith the end of the war, Louis decided to take the opportunity to reduce the debt and modernize the system of taxation of the Kingdom. The package of reforms was put together by his finance minister D'Arnouville and was approved by the King and presented in two decrees issued in May 1749. The first measure was an issue of bonds, paying five percent interest, to pay off the 36 million \"livres\" of debt caused by the cost of the war. This new measure was an immediate success. The second measure was the abolition of the \"dixi\u00e8me\", a tax of ten percent of revenue, which had been created to finance the war, and its replacement by the \"vingti\u00e8me\", a tax of five percent on net revenue, which, unlike the \"dixi\u00e8me\", taxed the income of all French citizens, including for the first time the income from the property of the clergy and the nobility.\nWhile the new tax was supported by many, including Voltaire, it met immediate and fierce resistance from both the nobility and the church. When on 5 May 1749 it was presented for formal registration to the \"Parlement\" of Paris, the assembly composed of high nobles and wealthy Parisians who had purchased seats, it was rejected by a vote of one hundred and six to forty nine; the majority asked for more time to consider the project. The King responded by demanding immediate registration, which the \"Parlement\" reluctantly granted on 19 May. Resistance to the new measures grew with the church and in the provinces, which had their own \"parlements\". While the \"Parlements\" of Burgundy, Provence and Artois bowed to the King's demands, Brittany and Languedoc refused. The royal government closed down the \"Parlement\" of Brittany, ordered the members of the \"Parlement\" of Languedoc to return to their estates and parishes, and took direct control of the Provence.\nWithin Paris, the battle between the King and \"Parlement\" was fought over the status of the \"H\u00f4pital G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\", a semi-religious organization which operated six different hospitals and shelters in Paris, with a staff of some five thousand persons. Many of the hospital staff and officials were Jansenists, while the board of directors of the hospital included many prominent members of the \"Parlement of Paris\". In 1749, the King decided to purge the hospital of Jansenists and corruption, appointed a new \"Sup\u00e9rieure\" against the will of the administrators, who resigned, then appointed four temporary administrators, and asked the First President of the Parlement of Paris, Ren\u00e9 Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou, to implement his decree for the reorganization of the hospital. De Maupeou refused to carry out the decree without the authorization of the Parlement, and the Parlement, without taking any action, went on vacation. On 20 November, when the Parlement returned, the King again summoned de Maupeou for an audience and again demanded action without delay. This time the \"Parlement\" members met but refused to discuss the Hospital. On 28 January 1752, the King instructed the Grand Council to change the administration of the Hospital without the approval of the \"Parlement\". Voltaire, describing the affair, wrote, \"Never before has such a small affair caused such a great emotion of the spirit.\" It was the first overt disobedience of the legislature against the King, and one of the first signs that the Parlement believed it, not the King, was the legitimate source of laws in the nation.\nThe King's original plans to tax the church also ran into difficulty. A royal decree ordered all the clergy to submit a declaration of their revenue by 17 February 1751, but that day passed without any declarations given. Instead it became known that the King had quietly issued a new decree in December 1750, canceling the tax and relying again, entirely, on the \"don gratuit\", the voluntary donation by the church of 1,500,000 livres. Under the new decree, instead of a tax, the church would each year collect a comparable sum and donate it freely to the government. His support for the church came both from the teachings of his tutor, Cardinal Fleury, and his gratitude to Archbishop de Beaumont, who defended him against the attacks of the Jansenists and the criticisms of the Parlement, and the Archbishop's tolerance of the King's own personal life and mistresses.\nDespite the French victories, the war dragged on both in the Netherlands and in Italy, where Mar\u00e9chal Belle-Isle was besieging the Austrians in Genoa. By the summer of 1747 France occupied the entire Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium). In March 1748, Louis proposed a conference in Aix-la-Chapelle to bring the war to an end. The process was advanced by the capture of Maastricht by the Mar\u00e9chal de Saxe on 10 April 1748. Britain, pressed by the threat of a French invasion of the rest of the Netherlands, urged a quick settlement, despite objections from Austria and Sardinia. The Treaty was quickly negotiated and signed by all the parties in September and October 1748. Louis was also eager for a quick settlement, because the naval war with Britain was extremely costly to French maritime trade. The proposition of Louis was surprisingly generous; in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Louis offered to return all of the territories he had conquered in the Netherlands to the Austrians, Maastricht to the Dutch, Nice and Savoy to the Sardinians, and Madras in India to the English. The Austrians would give the Duchy of Parma and some other territory to the Spanish Infante, Philip, while Britain would return to France Louisbourg and the island of Cape Breton. France also agreed to expel the Stuart pretender Charles Edward Stuart from its territory.\nThe end of the war had caused celebration in Paris, but the publication of the details of the treaty on 14 January 1749 caused dismay and anger. The Stuart pretender Charles Edward Stuart refused to leave Paris and was acclaimed by the Parisians. He was finally arrested on 10 December 1748, and transported by force to Switzerland. The French military commanders, including de Saxe, were furious about giving up the Austrian Netherlands. The King's defense of his action was practical: he did not want the Netherlands to be a permanent source of contention between France and other powers; he also felt that France had already reached its proper borders, and it was better to cultivate its prosperity rather than make it larger. His basis was also religious; he had been taught by Fleury that the Seventh Commandment forbade taking the property of others by fraud or violence. Louis often cited a Latin maxim declaring, \"if anyone who asks by what means he can best defend a kingdom, the answer is, by never wishing to augment it.\" He also received support from Voltaire, who wrote, \"It seems better, and even more useful for the court of France to think about the happiness of its allies, rather than to be given two or three Flemish towns which would have been the eternal object of jealousy.\" Louis lacked the communicative skills to explain his decision to the French public, and further, did not see any need to do so. The news that the King had returned the Southern Netherlands to Austria was met with disbelief and bitterness. The French obtained so little of what they had fought for that they adopted the expressions \"B\u00eate comme la paix\" (\"Stupid as the peace\") and \"Travailler pour le roi de Prusse\" (\"To work for the king of Prussia\", i.e. working for nothing).\nFirst mistresses.\nThe de Mailly-Nesle sisters.\nLouis had been very much in love with the Queen, and they were inseparable in the early years of his reign, but as his family grew, and the Queen was constantly pregnant or exhausted by her maternities, he began to look elsewhere. He first became attached to one of the ladies of the Queen's court, Louise Julie de Mailly, who was the same age as he and from an ancient noble family. Without courtship or ceremony, he made her his mistress, and raised her to the rank of Duchess. The Duke of Luynes commented on the King's behavior: \"The King loves women, and yet there is absolutely no gallantry in his spirit.\" In 1738, after the Queen lost an unborn child, her doctors forbade her to have relations with the King for a time. The King was offended by her refusal and thereafter never shared her bed. Acknowledging that he was committing adultery, Louis refused thereafter to go to confession and to take the sacrament. The Cardinal de Fleury tried to persuade him to confess and to give up his mistress, but without success.\nIn 1738, the King turned his attentions to the sister of Louise Julie, Pauline F\u00e9licit\u00e9 de Mailly. Pauline F\u00e9licit\u00e9 became pregnant in 1740, allegedly by the King, and subsequently died during childbirth (The illegitimate son of the King and Pauline F\u00e9licit\u00e9 came to be known as \"Demi-Louis\" due to his visual resemblance to his father who took care of his financial needs but gave him little attention.). Pauline F\u00e9licit\u00e9's death caused the King to go into mourning and for a time he turned to religion for consolation. When the King finally recovered his spirits, Louise Julie introduced the King to her youngest sister, Marie Anne de Mailly. The King was immediately attracted to Marie Anne, however she insisted that he expel her older sister from the Court before she would become his mistress. The King gave in, and on 4 October 1742, Marie Anne was named a Lady of the Court of the Queen, and a month later the King ordered her older sister to leave the Court and to live in Paris. The King made his new mistress the Duchess of Ch\u00e2teauroux. The King's relationships with the sisters became a subject of gossip in the court and in Paris, where a popular comic poem was recited, ending: \"Choosing an entire family \u2013 is that being unfaithful, or constant?\"\nIn June 1744, the King left Versailles in order to take personal command of his armies fighting in the War of the Austrian Succession. This otherwise popular move was marred by the King's indiscreet decision to bring along Marie Anne. When Marie Anne visited the King in Metz in August 1744 she was accompanied by her sister Diane Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Mailly. While an amiable companion, Marie Anne did not consider her simple sister to be much of a rival, however it was rumored at the time that one of the methods by which Marie Anne kept the interest of the king was to periodically offer him a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with Diane Ad\u00e9la\u00efde. These widespread rumors made the sisters' visit to the King in Metz a national scandal and during their notorious visit the King suddenly fell gravely ill. Death appeared imminent, yet the King's chaplain refused him absolution unless he renounced his mistress, which he did. Marie Anne left The Court and after the King recovered he made a triumphal entry into Paris. On 25 November, Minister Maurepas was obliged to recall Marie Anne to Versailles, but she soon fell sick with convulsive pains and died on 8 December 1744. Following her death the King consoled himself with Diane Ad\u00e9la\u00efde until he met Madame de Pompadour in 1745.\nThe King's adultery confession, which was distributed publicly, embarrassed him and tarnished the prestige of the monarchy. Although Louis XV's recovery earned him the epithet \"well-beloved\" from a public relieved by his survival, the events at Metz diminished his standing. The military successes of the War of the Austrian Succession inclined the French public to overlook Louis' adulteries, but after 1748, in the wake of the anger over the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, pamphlets against the king's mistresses were widely distributed and read.\nSecond mistress.\nMadame de Pompadour.\nJeanne-Antoinette Poisson, better known as Madame de Pompadour, was the most famous and influential of the mistresses of Louis XV. She was the illegitimate daughter of a Paris \"fermier-general\", and was married to a banker, Charles Guillaume Lenormant d'\u00c9toiles. She was noticed by the King following one of his hunts, and formally met him at a costume ball celebrating carnival in 1745. By July, she was the King's mistress and was formally given the title of the Marquise de Pompadour. For the next twenty years, she was the King's confidante and advisor, helping him choose or demote ministers. Her opinions led to the downfall of some very competent ministers, including Machault d'Aurnouville and the Marquis d'Argenson, and to the promotion of a number of incompetent military commanders. Her most successful choice was the promotion of the Duke de Choiseul, who became one of the King's most effective ministers. She ceased all sexual intimacy with the King by 1750, but remained his closest advisor and titular mistress. She was promoted to Duchess in 1752, and Dame of the Queen's Palace in 1756, and was an important patron of music and the arts, as well as religious establishments. She remained close to the King until her death in 1764. He was devastated, and remained in seclusion for several weeks after she died.\nBeginning of the Seven Years' War.\nThe peace achieved by Louis with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle lasted only seven years. At the end of August 1755, Marie Therese, the Empress of Austria, discreetly wrote a letter to Louis XV, which was passed by the Austrian ambassador in Paris to Madame de Pompadour for delivery to the King. She proposed a secret alliance between Austria and France, to meet the threats of the growing power of Prussia, which was still formally an ally of France, and Britain.\nIn the New World, conflict had already begun between Great Britain and France. New France was at an enormous demographic disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis its British counterparts; there were about 70,000 French colonists spread over a territory from the St. Lawrence River to the Great Lakes and extending down the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys to Louisiana, compared with a population of one million settlers in the British 13 Colonies. To defend its territories, France had constructed Fort Duquesne to defend its frontier against the indigenous Americans; Britain sent the young George Washington with a small force to construct his own fortification, Fort Necessity, nearby. In 1754, after the killing of French envoy, Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, the French sent reinforcements and compelled Washington and his men to withdraw.\nThe undeclared French and Indian War followed, with British and French colonies in North America engaging in open conflict. By the end of 1755, British ships had captured over 300 French merchantmen. In January 1756, Louis sent an ultimatum to London, which was rejected by the British government. A few months later, on 16 January 1756, Frederick the Great of Prussia signed the Treaty of Westminster, allying himself with Britain. Louis responded immediately on 1 May 1756 by sealing a formal defensive treaty with Austria, the first Treaty of Versailles, offering to defend Austria in case of a Prussian attack \u2013 a reversal of France's historic conflict with Austria.\nLouis declared war on Great Britain on 9 June 1756, confident of success. The French navy quickly defeated a British fleet in the Mediterranean and captured Minorca from Britain. Meanwhile, the French army greatly outnumbered its British and Prussian counterparts on the continent, and after some fighting France signed the Convention of Klosterzeven with the Duke of Cumberland, which resulted in French troops occupying parts of Hanover and the Hanoverians withdrawing from the conflict entirely. Another French army had already invaded Saxony and Hanover, the ancestral home of George II. However, the best French commander, Maurice de Saxe, had died two years after the War of the Austrian Succession, and his successors, the Prince de Soubise, the Duke D'Estrees and the Duke de Broglie detested each other, and were rarely willing to cooperate.\nIn August Frederick of Prussia made a lightning strike into Saxony and on 5 November 1757, though outnumbered by the French nearly two to one, decisively defeated the army of the Prince de Soubise at the Battle of Rossbach. The new British Prime Minister, William Pitt, named a new commander, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, and the French armies were gradually pushed back to the Rhine, and defeated again at the Battle of Krefeld on 23 June. Thereafter, Britain and Prussia held the upper hand, tying down the French army in the German states along the Rhine.\nBritish naval supremacy prevented France from reinforcing its colonies overseas, and British naval squadrons raided the French coast at Cancale and Le Havre and landed on the Ile d'Aix and Le Havre. In 1759 the British attacked Martinique and Guadeloupe in the French West Indies, and captured Port Louis and Quebec. A series of French naval defeats forced Louis to abandon plans for invasion of Britain. In India, the French colony at Pondicherry was besieged by the British, and surrendered the following year. On 8 September 1760, Montreal surrendered, bringing to an end French rule in Canada. Martinique fell to the British in 1762.\nAssassination attempt.\nOn 5 January 1757, as the King was getting into his carriage in the courtyard of the Grand Trianon Versailles, a demented man, Robert-Fran\u00e7ois Damiens, pushed through the King's guards and attacked the King, stabbing him in the side with a small knife. The King's guards seized Damiens, and the King ordered them to hold him but not harm him. The King walked up the steps to his rooms at the Trianon, where he found he was bleeding profusely. He summoned his doctor and a priest, and then fainted. Louis was saved from greater harm by the thickness of the winter clothing he was wearing. When the news reached Paris, anxious crowds gathered in the streets. The Pope, the Archduchess of Austria, and King George II, with whom France was at war, sent messages hoping for his swift recovery. Damiens was tortured to see if he had accomplices, and was tried before the Parlement of Paris, which had been the most vocal critic of the King. The Parlement demonstrated its loyalty to the King by sentencing Damiens to the most severe possible penalty. On 28\u201329 March 1757 Damiens was executed on the Place de Gr\u00e8ve in Paris by dismemberment, following which his body was burned on a bonfire. The house where he was born was burned down, his father, wife and daughter were banished from France, and his brothers and sisters were required to change their name. The King recovered physically very quickly, but the attack had a depressive effect on his spirits. One of his chief courtiers, Duford de Cheverny, wrote afterwards: \"it was easy to see that when members of the court congratulated him on his recovery, he replied, 'yes, the body is going well', but touched his head and said, 'but this goes badly, and this is impossible to heal.'\" After the assassination attempt, the King invited his heir, the Dauphin, to attend all of the Royal Council meetings, and quietly closed down the ch\u00e2teau at Versailles where he had met with his short-term mistresses.\"\nRebellion of the Parlements.\nThe \"Parlements\" were assemblies of nobles in Paris and older regions of France, whose members served as magistrates and judged civil cases. Their members included both hereditary nobles and wealthy citizens who had purchased their seats. Several of the Parlements, such as those of Rouen and Provence, had been in existence for centuries, and saw themselves as the legitimate governments in their provinces. As Louis reorganized the government and appointed his own intendants in the provinces, the authority and prestige of the Parlements decreased, and the price of the seats dropped. In Franche-Comt\u00e9, Bordelaise and Rouen, the Parlements refused to follow the decrees of the royal intendants. When the intendants attempted to assert their authority and collect taxes from all classes, the Parlements went on strike, refusing to proceed with the judgment of civil cases. The civil justice system came to a halt. In 1761, the provincial \"Parlement\" of Normandy in Rouen wrote a protest to the King, explaining that the King had the exclusive power to tax, but the Parlement had the exclusive right to collect the money. The King rejected the explanation and overruled the \"Parlement\", banished some of his most provocative Parlement members to their estates. For the rest of his reign, the Parlements swore allegiance to the King, but took every opportunity to resist his new taxes and the King's authority. This was one of the seeds of resistance to the King's authority that was to turn into a Revolution less than thirty years later.\nAchievements and dismissal of the government.\nThe Comte d'Argenson served as the Minister of War from 1743 until 1747. He was an advocate of the continuation of the absolute monarchy in the style of Louis XIV. He was responsible for creating the first school for engineers in France at M\u00e9zi\u00e8res (1749\u201350); thanks to the trained engineers, France had the finest system of roads and bridges in Europe. He also established the military academy, the \u00c9cole Militaire, and, following the model of the Prussians, established military training camps and exercises, and helped rebuild French military power.\nMachaud D'Arnouville was brought into the government with the sponsorship of d'Argenson, but the two men gradually became rivals and enemies. D'Arnouville was the Controller of Finances from 1745 to 1754, then Minister of Navy from 1754 to 1757. He was the creator of the unpopular \"Vingtieme\" tax (1749), which taxed all citizens, including the nobility, at the same rate, and also freed the prices of grain (1754), which initially greatly increased agricultural production. The fluctuation of grain prices would eventually become a factor in the French Revolution.\nOn 1 February 1757, the King abruptly dismissed both d'Arnouville and d'Argenson, and exiled them to their estates. The King held them responsible for not preventing the assassination attempt, and their government displeased Madame de Pompadour.\nGovernment of the Duke de Choiseul (1758\u20131770).\nLouis named the Duke de Choiseul as his minister of foreign affairs on 3 December 1758, following the recommendation of Madame de Pompadour. In 1763, he became Minister of War, giving the role of minister of foreign affairs to his cousin, the Duc de Praslin. A few months later, he also became the Minister of the Navy, and became the most influential and powerful member of the government. In the council and circles of government, he was the leader of the \"philosophe\" faction, which included Madame de Pompadour, which sought to appease the Parlements and the Jansenists. On the diplomatic front, he negotiated a \"Family Pact\" with the Bourbon monarch of Spain (1761); negotiated the Treaty of Paris in 1761, and completed the integration of Lorraine into France (1766) upon the death of the King's father-in-law Stanislaus I Leszczy\u0144ski, Duke of Lorraine. He incorporated Corsica into France (1768), and negotiated the marriage of his grandson, the future Louis XVI, with Marie Antoinette (1770).\nHis most notable accomplishment was the modernization of the French military, based on the lessons learned during the Seven Years' War. Under Choiseul, the government, rather than the officers, took the responsibility of training, giving uniforms, and training soldiers. The artillery was standardized, and new tactics, based on the Prussian model, were adopted and taught. The Navy in 1763 had been reduced to just 47 vessels and twenty frigates, three times smaller than the British Royal Navy fleet. He launched a major shipbuilding program to construct eighty vessels and forty-five new frigates, which would allow the French fleet, combined with the allied Spanish fleet, to outnumber the Royal Navy.\nSuppression of the Jesuits (1764).\nIn 1764, at the urging of the Parlement, Madame de Pompadour and his foreign minister, the Duc de Chosieul, Louis decided upon the Suppression of Jesuit Order in France. The Jesuits in France numbered 3,500; they had 150 establishments in France, including 85 colleges, which were considered the best in France; their graduates included Voltaire and Diderot. The Confessor of the King, by a tradition dating back to Henry IV, was a Jesuit. Agitation against the Jesuits began in 1760 in the provincial Parlements, where the Gallicans, supporters of a specifically French version of Catholicism, were strong. The complaint against the Jesuits was that they were independent of the authority of the King and the hierarchy of the church in France. The Jesuits had already been expelled from Portugal and its colony of Brazil in 1759, because of conflicts with the government and church hierarchy there.\nIn France, the Parlements had taken the lead in attacking the Jesuits. On 12 February 1762, the Parlement of Rouen declared the Jesuits outside the law, forbid them to hold public positions or to teach, and demanded that they take an oath repudiating their beliefs. Between April and September 1762, the Parlements of Rennes, Bordeaux, Paris and Metz joined in the condemnation, followed in 1763 by Aix, Toulouse, Pau, Dijon and Grenoble. By the end of the year only the Parlements of Besan\u00e7on, Douai, and the governments of Colmar, Flanders, Alsace and Franche-Comt\u00e9, plus the Duchy of Lorraine, run by the Queen's father, the former King Stanislaus, permitted the Jesuits to function.\nThe campaign against the Jesuits divided the royal household; his son the Dauphin, his daughters and the Queen supported the Jesuits, while Madame de Pompadour, whose influence in the court was criticized by the Jesuits, wanted them gone. The indecisive King declared two years later that he had made the decision against his own feelings. The Jesuits departed, and were welcomed in Prussia and in Russia. The departure of the Jesuits weakened the church in France, and especially weakened the authority of the King, who, like a constitutional monarch, acted on behalf of the Parlements against his own beliefs.\nResistance from Parlements.\nUnder the government of Choiseul, the Parlements of several French provinces continued to swear obedience to the King, while refusing to obey his \"intendents\" or to accept his new taxes. The Parlement of Franche-Comt\u00e9 in Besan\u00e7on refused to collect the \"vingtieme\" tax imposed by the King to finance the war, claiming that only the Parlement could impose taxes. The King's government immediately dismissed the leaders of the Parlement and confined them to their residences. The Parlement of Normandy immediately supported that of Besan\u00e7on; it wrote a remonstrance to the King on 5 July 1760, declaring that the Parlements represented all classes: \"One King, one law, one Parlement; the law of the kingdom is a sacred pact of your alliance with the French nation; it is a kind of contract which destines the King to reign and the people to obey. In truth, no one except God can compel you to obey this sacred pact\u2026 but we can ask you, with respect, with submission\u2026 to keep your promises.\" This was too much for the King. He responded on 31 January 1761 that the Parlement's complaint \"contained principles so false and so contrary to my authority and with expressions so indecent, particularly in connection with my Chancellor who only explained to you my wishes\u2026 that I send your letter back to you.\" The Parlement members of Besan\u00e7on remained in exile.\nThe Parlement of Bordeaux went even further in its resistance to the royal government; in 1757 it brought accusations of corruption against the members of the government of the city of Bergerac, named by the Royal Council of the King. When the Royal Council blocked the pursuits of the Parlement, the Parlement wrote a protest to the King, declaring, \"Sire, your Parlement cannot recognize any intermediate power between it and your person; no, your Council has over the Parlement no authority, superiority, or jurisdiction.\"\nFinances and the brief ministry of Silhouette.\nThe prolonged war drained the treasury of the Kingdom; France paid not only for its own army, but subsidized the armies of its allies; in 1759, France paid 19 million livres to its allies, an amount which Choiseul reduced by one-third in 1761. His new finance minister, \u00c9tienne de Silhouette imposed new taxes aimed at the wealthy; taxes on horses, carriages, silk, paintings, coffee and furs, and other luxury goods. The new taxes were extremely unpopular with the aristocracy and wealthy; Silhouette was dismissed after eight months, and his name became the common expression for paper cutouts made from a shadow, which, like his ministry, lasted only a moment. The King announced that he was giving his silver service to the mint, to be melted down and made into money.\nThe new Controller of Finances, Henri Bertin, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Madame de Pompadour named on 23 November 1759, reduced the luxury taxes of his predecessor, and instead proposed a broadening of the tax base to include those classes which had long been excluded, and a new survey of the wealth of the nobility. Once again the Parliaments rebelled. When the Lieutenant General of Normandy appeared before the Parliament to register the decree, it refused to register or collect the new taxes. The same scene was reproduced in the other Parlements. Once again the King yielded to Madame de Pompadour and her allies; the new decrees were withdrawn, Bertin was moved to a different position, the tax rolls were not enlarged, and no new taxes were collected; the debt remained.\nDiplomacy \u2013 end of the Seven Years' War.\nThe war with Great Britain continued, despite the death of King George II on 25 October 1760; the British Prime Minister William Pitt rejected French proposals for suggestions for negotiations. On 15 August 1761, France, Spain, Naples and Parma, all ruled by monarchs of the Bourbon family, signed the first \"Family Compact\", with a system of reciprocal guarantees of support if one or the other were attacked. At the same time, they signed a secret treaty with Charles III of Spain engaging Spain to declare war on Great Britain if the war was not over by May 1762. Learning of this pact, William Pitt wanted to declare an immediate war on Spain, but the new British King, George III, rejected the idea. The military forces of Frederick the Great in Prussia had been nearly exhausted in the long war against the combined forces of Austria and Russia; but Frederick was saved by the sudden death of the Tsarina Elizabeth in 1762, and her replacement by Peter III of Russia, a fervent admirer of the Prussian King.\nChoiseul had taken over direction of the French navy as well as the army in October 1761, and he pressed for an offensive to bring the war to a successful end. He persuaded the Parlements and the chambers of commerce of the major French cities to sponsor the construction of warships, and rebuilt the French Navy. The French army launched a new offensive against the Prussians and Spain, and as promised by the Family Compact, launched an invasion in Portugal, an ally of Britain. However, once again the French initiatives were not enough. The French offensive in Hesse-Kassel was defeated by the Prussians, the Spanish army in Portugal made little progress, and the British took the opportunity to land on Martinique and to invade Spain's colony Cuba. Choiseul decided it was time to end the war. The preliminary negotiations opened at the Palace of Fontainebleau on 3 November 1762, and ended hostilities between Great Britain, France and Spain. The final treaty was signed in Paris on 10 February 1763. As a result of the War, France gave up its minor possessions in the West Indies; Marie Galante, Tobago and La Desiderade, but received back Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Santa Lucia, which, because of their sugar plantations, were considered of more value than all of its territories in Canada; France kept only the Iles of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The valley of the Ohio, and the territories along the west bank of the Mississippi River were ceded to Spain. Louis formally ratified the treaty on 23 February, on the same day that his statue was unveiled on the Place Louis XV (today the Place de la Concorde)\nDeaths of mistress, son and wife.\nThe winter of 1763\u201364 was particularly harsh; Madame de Pompadour contracted pneumonia, and died on 15 April. The King was deeply affected, but, strictly observing court protocol, he did not attend her funeral, because she was too far below his rank, and, though mourning, carried on court business as usual. Maneuvering immediately began within the court to replace Madame de Pompadour; a leading candidate was the Duchess of Gramont, the sister of Choiseul, but the King showed no interest in a new mistress, and in February 1765 he closed down the Parc-aux-Cerfs, where he had previously met his \"petites maitresses\".\nThe resistance of the Parlements to the King's authority continued. The Parlements of the provinces began to quarrel with the Parlement of Paris over which more truly represented the nation. In March 1764, the Parlement of Navarre in Pau, the smallest province, refused to accept the taxation authority of the Grand Council of the King. This time the King took action, arresting and replacing the President and leading officers of the Parlement, and replacing them with officers loyal to the King. The Parlements of Toulouse, Besan\u00e7on and Rouen protested, but the King persisted. In 1765 the Parlement of Rennes in Rennes denied the authority of the King's officers to impose taxes without its permission, and went on strike. The King summoned the Parlement to Versailles, where he had his lecture read to them. This had little effect; when the King had his decree to the Parlement posted on the walls of Rennes, the Parlement ordered that the posters with the King's proclamation be taken down. The King issued letters of cachet that forbade the Parlement members to leave Rennes, but the judicial system remained on strike.\nThe end of 1765 brought another personal tragedy; his son and heir Louis contracted tuberculosis. He travelled with the King to the Palace of Fontainebleau. The King distracted himself by secluding himself with the astronomer C\u00e9sar-Fran\u00e7ois Cassini de Thury and making astronomic calculations, while the doctors tried, without success, to treat his son. The Dauphin died on 20 December 1765. The succession was assured, since the Dauphin had a son, the future Louis XVI, who was of age to rule, but the death put him into a deep depression. He drafted his own will, writing: \"If I made errors, it was not from a lack of will, but from a lack of talents, and for not having been supported as I wished to have been, particularly in matters of religion.\"\nThe Queen, who was deeply affected by the death of the Dauphin in 1765, followed by the death of her father in 1766 and, finally, that of her daughter-in-law, died on 24 June 1768.\n\"Flagellation\" of the Parlement.\nIn January 1766, while the King was still mourning the death of the Dauphin, the Parlement of Rennes issued another rejection of the King's authority to collect taxes. When he ignored it, both the Parlement of Rennes and the Parlement of Rouen wrote him again, complaining that he was ignoring \"the oath that you took to the nation when accepting the crown.\" When this part of the letter was read to the King, he interrupted the reading and declared that this accusation was false; he had taken an oath to God alone, not to the nation. On 3 March 1766, with only a few hours notice, he traveled in person from Versailles to the meeting of the Parlement of Paris at the Palais de la Cit\u00e9 and appeared before the members. In his message, read to them by one of his ministers, he declared, \"It is in my person alone that sovereign power resides...To me alone belongs the legislative power, without dependence and without sharing...The public order emanates entirely from me...Confusion and anarchy are taking the place of legitimate order, and the scandalous spectacle of a contradictory rivaling my sovereign power reduces me to the sad necessity to use all the power that I received from God to preserve my peoples from the sad consequences of these enterprises.\" The speech, immediately termed \"the flagellation\", was published in official press, and circulated to all levels of government. It became his political testament. The conflict between the Parlements and King was muted for a time, but not resolved.\nThird mistress.\nMadame du Barry.\nAfter the death of the Madame de Pompadour, several women in the court sought to replace her, including the Duchess of Gramont, the sister of the Duke of Choiseul, the King's chief minister. However, the King's favor turned to Jeanne B\u00e9cu, the comtesse du Barry. She was thirty-three years younger than the King. She was the illegitimate daughter of Anne B\u00e9cu, a seamstress. She was raised by the Dames de Sacre-Coeur, and had various jobs as a shop assistant and designer of dresses before she became the mistress of Jean du Barry, the brother of a count. She began to hold a salon, which attracted writers and aristocrats. Since Jean du Barry was already married, to give her legitimacy he arranged for her to become engaged to his brother, Comte Guillaume du Barry, a retired soldier. They were married on 1 September 1768, and then, without consummating the marriage, Guillaume retired to his home in Languedoc. Through her acquaintances with the nobility, she was invited to Versailles, where the King saw her and was immediately attracted to her. He invited her to Fontainebleau, and then asked her to live in the Palace of Versailles. Her appearance at the Court scandalized the Duke de Choiseul, but pleased the enemies of the Duke within the Court.\nFor du Barry to be presented at Court, she had to be formally presented by a member of the nobility. The elderly Contesse de B\u00e9arn was persuaded to make the presentation for a large fee, and she was presented on 22 April 1769. None of the ladies of the Court attended, and Choiseul himself, to show his displeasure, hosted a large reception the following day, which all the Court, except du Barry, attended.\nThe King soon installed her in the Palace of Versailles, and in 1771 gave her the new Pavillon de Louveciennes. Choiseul sowed a strong dislike for du Barry, as did Marie Antoinette, who arrived in Versailles and married the Dauphin on 16 May 1770. She described the Comtesse as \"the most stupid and impertinent creature imaginable\". However, the King kept du Barry close to him until the final days before his death, when he sent her away before he made confession. The presence of du Barry at the court scandalized the high members of the aristocracy. Outside the Court, the opponents of the King in the Parlements used her presence to ridicule and attack the King. She was the target of dozens of scandalous pamphlets accusing her of every possible immoral act. Decades later, during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, the Comtesse was targeted by the Jacobins as a symbol of the hated old regime; she was guillotined on 8 December 1793.\nFrance enlarged: Lorraine and Corsica.\nThe borders of France were enlarged for the last time before the Revolution by two additions; the Duchy of Lorraine, ruled by the King's father-in-law, Stanislaus, reverted to France after his death, and was officially joined to the kingdom 27\u201328 March 1766. The acquisition of Corsica was more complicated. The island formally belonged to the Republic of Genoa, but an independent Republic of Corsica had been proclaimed in 1755 by Pasquale Paoli, and the rebels controlled most of the island. The Republic of Genoa did not have the military forces to conquer the island, and permitted Louis to send French troops to occupy the ports and major cities, to keep the island from falling into British hands. When the war ended, the island was formally granted to France by Treaty of Versailles on 19 May 1768. Louis sent the army to subdue the Corsican rebels; the army on the island eventually numbered twenty-seven thousand soldiers. In May 1769 the Corsican rebels were defeated at the Battle of Ponte Novu, and Paoli took refuge in England. In 1770 the island formally became a Province of France.\nCommerce, agriculture and the \"Starvation Pact\" rumor.\nTwo men had an enormous influence on the economic policies of the King. Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay was the best-known economist in France. He was the King's doctor, and treated Madame de Pompadour, but was also a celebrated economic theorist, whose collected writings, \"Tableau \u00c9conomique\" (1758), were avidly read by the King and his Court: Louis referred to him as \"my thinker.\" His students included the Marquis de Mirabeau and Adam Smith. He was a critic of government regulation, and coined the term \"bureaucracy\" (literally, \"A government of desks\"). The other was his disciple, the Minister of the Commerce of the King, Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay. The two men advocated removing as many restrictions as possible from the economy, to encourage greater production and trade. De Gournay's famous expression, \"laissez faire, laissez passer\" (\"let it be done, let it pass\") was later adopted as the slogan of a whole school of free market economics.\nDe Gournay and Quesnay proposed in particular the liberalization of agricultural markets, which were strictly controlled, to encourage greater production, competition and lower prices. Following the doctrines of Quesnay and de Gournay, Louis's controller of finances, Henri Bertin, created a new Society of Agriculture and an Agricultural Committee within the government, comparable to those existing to support commerce. In May 1763, Bertin issued a decree permitting the tax-free circulation of grain. In August 1764, Bertin permitted the export of grain from twenty-seven French ports, later expanded to thirty-six. At the same time he established a large zone around Paris, where grain was reserved exclusively for feeding the Parisians, and established a cap on the grain price, which, if it was passed, would cause the exports to cease.\nThe policy of freeing grain prices was effective in good years, and resulted in increased trade and lower prices, but during years with poor harvests, 1766, 1767 and 1768, prices went up. Most of the Parlements, in regions which produced grain, supported the policy, but others, including Paris and Rouen, were highly critical. In those cities, rumors began to circulate of a mythical \"Starvation Pact\", a supposed plot by the government to deliberately starve and eliminate the poor. These rumors eventually became one of the factors that provoked the French Revolution.\nPreparations for a new war with Great Britain.\nThe Duc de Choiseul devoted all of his considerable energy and talents to preparing a new war against Britain. In 1764, in a former Jesuit school he had closed, he created a new military preparatory school, to prepare students for the recently founded Military Academy. In 1769 he raised the Naval school to the level of a royal academy, to train officers for his new fleet. In the same year he established a military engineering school. He provided the army with hundreds of new cannon, which would be used with great success decades later during the French Revolution and by Napoleon. Using the Prussian army as a model, he reformed French military doctrine, making the state and not the officers responsible for training and equipping soldiers. A large part of the French Navy had been sunk or captured by the British in the Seven Years' War. In addition to the existing naval arsenals in Toulon, Brest and Rochefort, he opened two more in Marseille (1762) and Lorient (1764). The arsenals began building new ships; by 1772 the Navy had sixty-six ships of the line, thirty-five frigates, and twenty-one new corvettes. He and his allies in the government began planning for an invasion of England, and his government looked for new ways to challenge Great Britain. When the Duc de Broglie learned that the British were planning to tax the citizens of the British colonies in America, he wrote to the King: \"It will be very curious to know what the result will be, and if their execution doesn't result in a Revolution in those states.\"\nChoiseul combined his military preparations for war with a diplomatic alliance, the Pacte de Famille or Pact of the Family, which united with other countries ruled by Kings of the Bourbon dynasty: Spain, ruled by Louis's cousin Charles III of Spain, the Naples and Tuscany. Choiseul was so entirely focused on Great Britain as his future enemy that he almost entirely neglected the rest of Europe. He had no accredited Ambassadors in Poland, Prussia or Russia during most of the period, and stood by while Russia imposed its own candidate for King of Poland, and when Turkey and Russia went to war in 1768\u201370.\nDismissal of Choiseul.\nA new conflict between Great Britain and Spain over the remote Falkland Islands in 1770 brought about Choiseul's downfall. The British had established a settlement in the islands, which were also claimed by Spain. In early 1770 the Spanish governor of Buenos Aires sent five warships full of troops to the islands, ordering the British to leave. The British prepared to depart. When the news reached London, the British government demanded that the Spanish leave. Both sides began to prepare for war.\nThe possibility of a new war came just as France was undergoing a new confrontation between the King's government and the Parlement of Rennes, which once again refused to recognize the power of the King's government to impose taxes. The King wrote immediately to his cousin, the King of Spain, who wrote back that Spain did not want a war. Louis replied, \"Gentleness and patience have guided me to the present, but my parlements, pushing to limit, have forgotten themselves to the point of disputing the sovereign authority that we possess only from the will of God. I am resolved to make myself obeyed by all available means...\" On 24 December, the King sent a short note to Choiseul dismissing him from his post and ordering him to return to his home in Chanteloup and to remain there. A similar note went to his cousin. Choiseul asked for two days to manage his affairs, but the King refused. Explaining the decision later to the Duke de Broglie, the King wrote, \"The principles of the Choiseuls are too contrary to religion, and therefore to royal authority.\"\nGovernment of Maupeou and the Triumvirate (1770\u20131774).\nThe King passed the leadership of the government to a triumvirate of three conservative ministers, led by his Chancellor, Ren\u00e9 de Maupeou, who had been President of the Parlement from 1763 to 1768. Maupeou and two other conservative ministers, Abbot Terray for finance and the Duc d'Aiguillon for foreign affairs and war, took charge of the government. They became known as \"The Triumvirate\".\nSuppression of the Parlements.\nThe first priority of Maupeou was to bring the unruly Parlements under control, and to continue with his program for the modernization of the state. Most of the members of the Parlement of Paris were on a virtual strike, refusing to render justice or approve the King's decrees. On 21 January 1771, royal agents and musketeers arrived at the homes of each of the Parlement members, informing them that their positions were confiscated and ordering them to leave Paris and return to their home provinces, and not to leave them. This was followed in February by an even more radical measure: the regional Parlements were replaced as the high courts of civil justice by six new regional high councils, to judge serious criminal and civil cases. Another decree announced the abolition of the high fees demanded by the Parlements for resolving civil cases, which were the source of their members' income; civil justice was to be rendered without charge. The powers of the Parlement of Paris alone were largely unchanged. Without the provincial parliaments, the government was able enact new laws and taxes without opposition. However, after the King's death, the nobility demanded and received the restoration of the regional parlements.\nFinances.\nAbbot Terray was nominally a priest, though his government career was entirely secular, and his personal life was considered scandalous. He was an efficient and relentless tax collector; he opened a school to train tax inspectors, and worked to see that taxes were imposed and collected with the same precision and vigor in all regions, without interference from the local nobility. When he first took his position, the state had a budget deficit of 60 million livres, and a long-term debt of 100 million livres. By 1774, revenues had been increased by 60 million livres and the debt reduced to 20 million livres. He also reimposed the regulation of the price of grain, which had been freed in 1763 and 1764; these controls were an issue which would disturb the government and provoke agitation until the French Revolution.\nForeign affairs.\nThe foreign affairs post had been left vacant by Choiseul, who acted as his own foreign minister. Following the dismissal of Choiseul, the King encouraged his cousin and ally Charles III of Spain to settle the crisis over the Falkland Islands with the aim of avoiding a war. Due to Choiseul's sole focus on a war with Britain, he had completely ignored the rest of Europe. France did not even have an ambassador in Vienna. In 1772 Austria, Russia and Prussia took territory from an old French ally, Poland, without protest from France. Another ally of France, Sweden, also risked being divided between Russia and Prussia upon the death of its King in 1771. The Prince Royal, Gustav III of Sweden, was staying in Paris at the time. He had a long meeting with Louis XV, who promised to support him. With French funding, and assistance from Louis's personal secret intelligence service, the \"Secret du Roi\", Gustave III returned to Stockholm. On 19 August 1772, at his command, the Swedish royal guard imprisoned the Swedish Senate, and two days later he was proclaimed King by the Diet. Russia and Prussia, occupied with the division of Poland, protested but did not intervene.\nLast years in Versailles.\nIn the last years of his reign, the court of Versailles was a theater of manners. Marie Antoinette, a resident since her marriage, had difficulty disguising her dislike for the King's mistress, Madame du Barry. The King constructed a set of luxurious rooms for Madame du Barry on the floor above his offices; Madame du Barry also reigned in the Petit Trianon, which the King had built for Madame de Pompadour, and in the Pavillon de Louveciennes, also built for Madame de Pompadour. The Court was divided between those who welcomed Madame du Barry, and those of the older aristocracy, such as the Duc de Choiseul plus Marie Antoinette, who scorned her. The King continued his grand construction projects, including the opera theater of the Palace of Versailles, completed for the celebration of the wedding of the Dauphin and Marie Antoinette, and the new Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde) in Paris, whose centerpiece was an equestrian statue of the King, modeled after that of Louis XIV on the Place Vend\u00f4me.\nDeath.\nOn 26 April 1774, the King left for the Petit Trianon with Madame du Barry and several nobles from his entourage, and reported that he felt ill. He participated in the hunt the next day, but rode in his carriage instead of on horseback. That evening he was still feeling ill, and sent for the Court physician, Le Marini\u00e9re. At the surgeon's insistence, the King was brought back to the Palace of Versailles for treatment, along with Madame du Barry and the others. The King was attended by six physicians, six surgeons, each of whom took his pulse and gave his diagnosis. He was bled three times by the surgeons, without effect. When some red eruptions appeared on his skin, the doctors first diagnosed \"petite variole\", or smallpox, which caused optimism, since the patient and doctors both believed he had already had the illness. The members of the family, particularly the Dauphin and Marie Antoinette, were asked to leave, since they had not already had the illness, and had no immunity. Madame du Barry remained with him. As the hours passed, the red eruptions of the disease grew worse, and the doctors began to fear for his life. On the morning of 1 May, the Archbishop of Paris arrived, but was kept out of the King's room to avoid alarming him. The King remained conscious and cheerful. However, on 3 May, he studied the eruptions on his hands, summoned the Archbishop, and announced, \"I have the petite variole.\" The Archbishop instructed him to prepare for the final rites. That night, the King summoned Madame du Barry, informed her of the diagnosis, and said, \"We cannot recommence the scandal of Metz. If I had known what I know now, you would not have been admitted. I owe it to God and to my people. Therefore, you have to leave tomorrow.\" On 7 May, he summoned his confessor and was given the final rites. The illness continued its course; one visitor on 9 May, the Duc de Croy, said the King's face resembled, with the darkening of the eruptions of the smallpox, \"a mask of bronze\". Louis died at 3:15 in the morning on 10 May 1774, with his daughters Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, Victoire, Sophie and Louise at his bedside.\nDuring the French Revolution, , partly to recover the lead from the coffins, and mostly to celebrate one year since the abolishment of the monarchy. On October 16, 1793 (the same day as the execution of Marie Antoinette), the tomb and the king's coffin were destroyed and opened, and there were two reports on the event: Dom Poir\u00e9e, a Benedictine monk of the Abbey, described the event as such; the coffin was not opened inside the abbey, but rather at the edge of the burial pit. The body of the King, tightly wrapped in cloth and bandages, appeared to be intact and well-preserved. However, once the wrappings were removed, it \"no longer resembled a human corpse\". The entire body had decayed, and a stench so unbearable filled the air that it was impossible to stay nearby. To purify the air, the revolutionaries had to burn gunpowder and fire several shots. \nAs described above, body of Louis XV, who had not been embalmed as it was the tradition for French Kings due to the smallpox that caused his death, was found in an \"advanced state of putrefaction and almost reduced to dust,\" to the point that the revolutionaries had to purify the air, even though a drawing of the exhumed body suggests otherwise. \nContrary to the previous accounts, Alexandre Lenoir, who witnessed the desecration of the royal tombs at Saint-Denis, described the exhumation of Louis XV as follows: \"Surprisingly, this corpse, said to have died in 1771 [sic], and exhumed before me on October 10, 1793 \u2014 after twenty years of burial \u2014 appeared remarkably well-preserved, with skin as fresh as if he had just been laid to rest. In fact, no odor at all emerged when the tomb was opened, whereas the tomb of Henri IV released a strong scent of aromatic substances.\"The remains of the Monarch were then thrown into a mass grave along with those of the other monarchs. The bodies were only partially recovered by Louis XVIII during the Restoration (on January 21, 1816, those of the guillotined monarchs, exactly one year after the others), and were buried in the Ossuary near the Bourbon crypt, since individual identification was impossible\u2014and there they remain to this day.\nPersonality.\nSeveral of his contemporaries who worked closely with him tried to describe the personality of Louis XV. The Duke de Croy wrote: \"He had a memory, presence, and justness of spirit that was unique. He was gentle, an excellent father, and the most honest individual in the world. He was well informed in the sciences...but with a modesty which, with him, was almost a vice. He always saw more correctly than others, but he always believed he was wrong... He had the greatest bravery, but a bravery that was too modest. He never dared to decide for himself, but always, out of modesty, turned for advice to others, even when he saw more accurately than they did...Louis XIV had been too proud, but Louis XV was not proud enough. Other than his excessive modesty, his great and sole vice was women; He believed that only his mistresses loved him enough to tell him the truth. For that reason he allowed them to lead him, which contributed to his failure with finance, which was the worse aspect of his reign.\"\nOthers, like d'Argenson, his Minister of War commented on his extreme shyness and timidity; his inability to make conversation with others. The Duke of Luynes remarked that he often seemed to want to speak, but \"his timidity stopped him and the expressions did not come; one felt that he wanted to say something obliging, but he often ended by simply asking a frivolous question.\"\nAnother characteristic remarked by contemporaries was his penchant for secrecy. \"No one was a greater expert at dissimulation than the King\", wrote d'Argenson. \"He worked from morning to night to dissimulate; he did not say a word, make a gesture or demarche except to hide what he really wanted.\"\n\"He was the most excellent of men\", wrote another contemporary, Duffort de Cheverny, \"but, in defiance of himself, he spoke about the affairs of state as if someone else was governing.\"\nLegends: \"After us, the flood\" and the Parc-aux-Cerfs.\nThe most famous remark attributed to Louis XV (or sometimes to Madame de Pompadour) is \"Apr\u00e8s nous, le d\u00e9luge\" (\"After us, the flood\"). It is commonly explained as his indifference to financial excesses, and a prediction of the French Revolution to come.\nAnother popular legend concerned the Maison-aux-Cerfs, the house at Versailles where, when the King was no longer having sexual relations with Madame de Pompadour, he sometimes slept with his \"petites ma\u00eetresses\", young women recruited for that purpose. The conventional wisdom at the time was to view it as a kind of harem, organized by Madame de Pompadour, where a group of women were kidnapped and kept for the King's pleasure. The legend circulated widely in pamphlets with lurid illustrations, and made its way into some later biographies of the King. In reality the house had only one occupant at a time, and for brief periods. Madame de Pompadour herself accepted the Maison-aux-Cerfs as a preferable alternative to the risks of a rival at court, as she stated: \"It is his heart I want! All these little girls with no education will not take it from me. I would not be so calm if I saw some pretty woman of the court or the capital trying to conquer it.\" In February 1765, after the death of Madame de Pompadour, the house was closed.\nPatron of architecture and arts.\nLouis was a major patron of architecture; he spent more money on buildings over the course of his reign than Louis XIV. His major architectural projects were the work of his favorite court architect, Ange-Jacques Gabriel. They included the Ecole Militaire (1751\u20131770); the Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde (1763\u201383); the Petit Trianon at Versailles (1762\u201364), and the opera theater of the Palace of Versailles. Louis began construction of the Church of Saint-Genevi\u00e8ve, now the Pantheon (1758\u201390). He also constructed monumental squares and surrounding buildings in the centers of Nancy, Bordeaux, and Rennes. His workshops produced fine furniture, porcelain, tapestries and other goods in the Louis XV Style which were exported to all the capital cities of Europe.\nThe King, the Queen and her daughters were major patrons of music. The queen and her children played the clavecin, under the instruction of Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. The young Mozart came to Paris and wrote two sonatas for clavecin and violin which he dedicated to Madame Victoire, the King's daughter. Jean-Marie Leclair was appointed Director of the Music of the Chapel and the Apartments in 1733, Leclair resigned in 1736 following a dispute with another royal appointee Jean-Pierre Guignon. The most important musical figure of the reign was Jean Philippe Rameau, who was the court composer through the 1740s and 1750s, and wrote more than thirty operas for Louis and his court. The King himself, like his grandfather Louis XIV, was taught to dance ballet but danced only once in public, in 1725.\nLouis XV, guided largely by Madame de Pompadour, was the most important art patron of the period. He commissioned Fran\u00e7ois Boucher to paint pastoral scenes for his apartments in Versailles, and gave him the title of First Painter of the King in 1765. Other artists patronized by the King included Jean-Baptiste Oudry, Maurice Quentin de la Tour, Jean Marc Nattier, and the sculptor Edme Bouchardon. Bouchardon created the monumental statue of Louis XV on horseback which was the centerpiece of Place Louis XV until it was pulled down during the Revolution.\nKing and the Enlightenment.\nThe French philosophical movement later called the Enlightenment began and gathered force during the reign of Louis XV; in 1746 Diderot published his \"Pens\u00e9es philosophiques\", followed in 1749 by his \"Lettres sur les Aveugles\" and the first volume of the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\", in 1751. Montesquieu published \"De l'esprit des Lois\", in 1748. Voltaire published \"le Siecle de Louis XIV\" and \"l'Essai sur les moeurs et l'esprit des nations\", in 1756. Rousseau became known in 1750 by the publication of \"Discours sur les sciences et les arts\", followed in 1755 by \"Discours sur l'origine et les fondements de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 parmi les hommes\". These were accompanied by new works on economics, finance, and commerce by the elder Mirabeau, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay and other scientific thinkers which undermined all of the standard assumptions of royal government, economics and fiscal policy.\nThe censors of Louis XV at first permitted these publications; the first volume of the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\" received official permission because the government censors believed it was purely a collection of scientific articles. The project soon included a multitude of authors, including Rousseau, and had four thousand subscribers. Only later did the government and King himself take notice, after the church attacked the \"Encylop\u00e9die\" for questioning official church doctrines. The King personally removed Diderot from the list of those nominated for the , and in 1759 the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\" was formally banned.\nRousseau had a resounding success in 1756 with his opera \"Devin du Village\", and was invited to Versailles to meet the King, but he refused. Instead, he wrote the \"Contrat Social\" calling for a new system based upon political and economic equality, published in 1762. Increasingly solitary and unstable, he wandered from province to province, before returning to Paris, where he died in solitude in 1778. His ideas, composed during the reign of Louis XV, were adopted by the revolutionaries who overthrew Louis XVI in 1789.\nIn the 1740s Voltaire was welcomed to the court as a playwright and poet, but his low rank as the son of a notary and the fact his father was also a Jansenist soon displeased the King and the Queen, and he was finally forced to depart Versailles. He went to Berlin, where he became a counselor to Frederick the Great, before living in Geneva and Savoy, far from Paris. On one issue in particular Voltaire took the side of Louis XV; when the King suppressed the \"parlements\" of nobles, demanded that all classes be taxed equally, and removed the charges which plaintiffs had to pay in order to have their cases heard. He wrote: \"Parlements of the King! You are charged with rendering justice to the people! Render justice upon yourselves!... There is in the entire world no judicial court which has ever tried to share the power of the sovereign.\" However, the King's lack of further reforms in his last years disappointed Voltaire. When the King died, Voltaire wrote of his reign, \"Fifty-six years, consumed with fatigues and wanderings.\"\nLegacy and historical judgments.\nE. H. Gombrich writes, \"Louis XV and Louis XVI, the Sun King's successors, were incompetent, and content merely to imitate their great predecessor's outward show of power. The pomp and magnificence remained... Finance ministers soon became expert swindlers, cheating and extorting on a grand scale. The peasants worked till they dropped and citizens were forced to pay huge taxes.\" Louis was blamed for significant diplomatic, military and economic reverses. His reign was marked by ministerial instability, while his \"prestige was ruined by military failure and colonial losses\". Despite Louis' failings in administration and war, many historians agree that France reached a high point of culture and art under his reign.\nLouis inherited a French monarchy at the zenith of its cultural influence and political power, a position it kept during the first half of the eighteenth century. However most scholars agree that Louis XV's decisions weakened France, depleted the treasury, discredited the absolute monarchy, and unsettled the trust and respect of the French and foreigners alike. Scholars point to the French Revolution, which broke out 15 years after his death. Norman Davies characterizes Louis XV's reign as \"one of debilitating stagnation\", characterized by a costly defeat in the Seven Years' War, endless clashes between the Court and the Parlements, and religious feuds. Jerome Blum described the king as \"a perpetual adolescent called to do a man's job.\"\nThe view of many historians is that Louis was unequal to the high expectations of his subjects. Robert Harris writes that, \"Historians have depicted this ruler as one of the weakest of the Bourbons, a do-nothing king who left affairs of state to ministers while indulging in his hobbies of hunting and womanizing.\" Ministers rose and fell according to his mistresses' opinions, seriously undermining the confidence in the monarchy. \nFor much of his lifetime Louis XV was celebrated as a national hero. Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon's equestrian statue of Louis was originally conceived to commemorate the monarch's victorious role in the War of the Austrian Succession, portrayed the king as peacemaker. Fifteen years later in 1763, following France's defeat in the Seven Years' War, it was unveiled in a patriotic spectacle staged to restore public confidence in a monarchy in decline. Located on the \"Place Louis XV\", the statue was torn down during the Revolution.\nSome scholars have turned away from the king's own actions to his image in the mind of the public. Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, the leader of the Annales School, noted that the king was handsome, athletic, intelligent and an excellent hunter, but that he disappointed the people. However, he did not keep up the practice of attending Mass, and the people felt he had shirked his religious obligations and diminished the sacred nature of the monarchy.\nAccording to Kenneth N. Jassie and Jeffrey Merrick, contemporary songs, poems, and public declarations typically portrayed a king as a \"master\", an unblemished \"Christian\", and a benevolent provider (\"baker\"). Young Louis' failings were attributed to inexperience and manipulation by his advisors. Jassie and Merrick argue that the king's troubles mounted steadily, and the people blamed and ridiculed his debauchery. The king was a notorious womaniser; the monarch's virility was supposed to reflect his power. Nevertheless, popular faith in the monarchy was shaken by the scandals of Louis' private life and by the end of his life he had become despised. The king ignored the famines and crises of the nation, until the people reviled him in protest, and finally celebrated his death. The monarchy survived\u2014for a while\u2014but Louis XV left his successor with a smoldering legacy of popular resentment.\nSome sermons on his death in 1774 praised the monarch and went out of their way to excuse his faults. Jeffrey Merrick writes: \"But those ecclesiastics who not only raised their eyebrows over the sins of the Beloved but also expressed doubts about his policies reflected the corporate attitude of the First Estate more accurately.\" They prayed the new king would restore morality at court and better serve the will of God.\nThe financial strain imposed by the wars and excesses of the royal court, and the consequent dissatisfaction with the monarchy, contributed to the national unrest that culminated in the French Revolution of 1789. The historian Colin Jones argues that Louis XV left France with serious financial difficulties: \"The military disasters of the Seven Years' War led to acute state financial crisis.\". Ultimately, Louis XV failed to overcome these fiscal problems, mainly because he was incapable of resolving conflicts among the parties and interests in his entourage. Although aware of the forces of anti-monarchism threatening his family's rule, he did not act effectively to stop them.\nTrends in 20th-century French historiography, especially the Annales School, have deprecated biography and minimized the role of the King. English historian William Doyle wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The political story...of the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, by contrast, had too often been scorned, and therefore neglected, as a meaningless succession of petty intrigues in boudoirs and bedrooms, unworthy of serious attention when there were economic cycles, demographic fluctuations, rising and falling classes, and deep-seated shifts in cultural values to analyse.\nA few scholars have defended Louis, arguing that his highly negative reputation was based on propaganda meant to justify the French Revolution. Olivier Bernier argued that Louis \"le Bien-aim\u00e9\" (the well-beloved) was a popular leader who reformed France. During his 59-year reign, France was never threatened by foreign conquest, though some of its overseas colonies were lost. Many of his subjects prayed for his recovery during his serious illness in Metz in 1744. His dismissal of the Parlement of Paris and his chief minister, Choiseul, in 1771, were attempts to wrest control of government from those Louis considered corrupt. He changed the tax code to try to balance the national budget. Bernier argued that these acts would have avoided the French Revolution if his successor Louis XVI had not reversed them. Guy Chaussinand-Nogaret claims that Louis XV's tarnished reputation was created fifteen years after his death, to justify the Revolution, and that the nobility during his reign were competent.\nIssue.\nIllegitimate issue.\nLouis XV had several illegitimate children, although the exact number is unknown. Historiography suggest the following as possible issue of the King:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some military aircraft engage directly in aerial warfare, while others take on support roles:\nHistory.\nLighter-than-air.\nIn 1783, when the first practical aircraft (hot-air and hydrogen balloons) were established, they were quickly adopted for military duties. The first military balloon unit was the French Aerostatic Corps, who in 1794 flew an observation balloon during the Battle of Fleurus, the first major battle to feature aerial observation. Balloons continued to be used throughout the 19th century, including in the Napoleonic Wars and the Franco-Prussian War, for observation and propaganda distribution. During World War I, German Zeppelin airships carried out multiple air raids on British cities, as well as being used for observation. In the 1920s, the U.S. Navy acquired several non-rigid airships, the first one to see service being the K-1 in 1931. Use by the U.S. as well as other countries continued into World War II. The U.S. Navy retired its last balloons in 1963. Only a handful of lighter-than-air military aircraft were used since, such as the American Blimp MZ-3, used for research and development by the U.S. Navy from 2006 to 2017.\nHeavier-than-air.\nSoon after the first flight of the \"Wright Flyer\", several militaries became interested in powered aircraft. In 1909 the United States Army purchased the Wright Military Flyer, a two-seat observation aircraft, for the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps. It served until 1911, by which time powered aircraft had become an important feature in several armies around the world. Airplanes performed aerial reconnaissance and tactical bombing missions in the Italo-Turkish War, and the First Balkan War saw the first naval-air operations. Photoreconnaissance and propaganda leaflet drops followed in the Second Balkan War.\nAir combat was a notable component of World War I, as fighter aircraft were developed during the war, long-range strategic bombing became a possibility, and airplanes were deployed from aircraft carriers. Airplanes also took on a greater variety of support roles, notably medical evacuation, and deployed new weapons like air-to-air rockets for use against reconnaissance balloons. Aviation technology advanced rapidly in the interwar period, and military aircraft became increasingly capable. Autogyros and helicopters were also developed at this time. During World War II, military aviation reached new heights. Decisive air battles influenced the outcome of the war, early jet aircraft flew combat missions, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles were deployed for the first time, airborne troops and cargo parachuted into battle, and the nuclear weapons that ended the war were delivered by air.\nIn the Cold War era, aviation technology continued to advance at an extremely rapid pace. Jet aircraft exceeded Mach 1 and Mach 2, armament focus switched mainly to missiles, aircraft began carrying more sophisticated avionics, air-to-air refueling matured into practicality, and transport aircraft grew in size. Stealth aircraft entered development during the 1970s and saw combat in the 1980s.\nCombat.\nCombat aircraft, or \"warplanes\", are divided broadly into \"fighters\", \"bombers\", \"attackers\", \"electronic warfare\", \"maritime\", \"multirole\", and \"unmanned\" aircraft. Variations exist between them, including fighter-bombers, such as the MiG-23 ground-attack aircraft and the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2. Also included among combat aircraft are long-range maritime patrol aircraft, such as the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod and the S-3 Viking that are often equipped to attack with anti-ship missiles and anti-submarine weapons.\nFighters.\nThe primary role of fighters is destroying enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat, as part of both offensive and defensive counter air operations. Many fighters also possess a degree of ground attack capability, allowing them to perform surface attack and close air support missions. In addition to their counter air duties they are tasked to perform escort mission for bombers or other aircraft. Fighters are capable of carrying a variety of weapons, including machine guns, autocannons, rockets, guided missiles, and bombs. Many modern fighters can attack enemy fighters from a great distance, before the enemy even sees or detects them. Examples of such fighters include the F-35 Lightning II, F-22 Raptor, F-15 Eagle, and Su-27.\nAttack aircraft.\nAttack aircraft can be used to provide support for friendly ground troops. Some are able to carry conventional or nuclear weapons far behind enemy lines to strike priority ground targets. Attack helicopters attack enemy armor and provide close air support for ground troops. An example of a historical ground-attack aircraft is the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2. Several types of transport airplanes have been armed with sideways firing weapons as gunships for ground attack. These include the AC-47 and AC-130 gunships.\nBombers.\nBombers are normally larger, heavier, and less maneuverable than fighter aircraft. They are capable of carrying large payloads of bombs, torpedoes or cruise missiles. Bombers are used almost exclusively for ground attacks and are not fast or agile enough to take on enemy fighters head-to-head. Some have a single engine and require one pilot to operate, while others have two or more engines and require crews of two or more. A limited number of bombers, such as the B-2 Spirit, have stealth capabilities that keep them from being detected by enemy radar. An example of a conventional modern bomber would be the B-52 Stratofortress. An example of a World War II bomber would be a B-17 Flying Fortress. An example of a World War I bomber would be a Handley Page O/400. Bombers include light bombers, medium bombers, heavy bombers, dive bombers, and torpedo bombers.\nMultirole.\nMany combat aircraft in the modern day have multirole capabilities. Normally only applied to fixed-wing aircraft, the term signifies the ability to transition between air-to-air and air-to-ground roles, sometimes even during the same mission. An example of a multirole design is the F-15E Strike Eagle, Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale and Panavia Tornado. A World War II example would be the P-38 Lightning. A utility helicopter could also count as a multirole aircraft and can fill roles such as close-air support, air assault, military logistics, CASEVAC, medical evacuation, command and control, and troop transport.\nUnmanned.\nUnmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) have no crew, but are controlled by a remote operator. They may have varying degrees of autonomy. UCAVs are often armed with bombs, air-to-surface missiles, or other aircraft ordnance. Their uses typically include targeted killings, precision airstrikes, and air interdictions, as well as other forms of drone warfare.\nElectronic warfare.\nAn electronic warfare aircraft is a military aircraft equipped for electronic warfare, i.e. degrading the effectiveness of enemy radar and radio systems. They are generally modified versions of other preexisting aircraft. A recent example would be the EA-18G Growler, which is a modified version of the F/A-18F Super Hornet.\nPatrol.\nA maritime patrol aircraft is a fixed-wing military aircraft designed to operate for long durations over water in maritime patrol roles\u2014in particular anti-submarine, anti-ship, and search and rescue. Some patrol aircraft were designed for this purpose, like the Kawasaki P-1. Many others are modified designs of pre-existing aircraft, such as the Boeing P-8 Poseidon, which is based on the Boeing 737-800 airliner. While the term maritime patrol aircraft generally refers to fixed wing aircraft, other aircraft types, such as blimps and helicopters, have also been used in the same roles.\nNon-combat.\nNon-combat roles of military aircraft include search and rescue, reconnaissance, observation/surveillance, Airborne Early Warning and Control, transport, training, and aerial refueling.\nMany civil aircraft, both fixed wing and rotary wing, have been produced in separate models for military use, such as the civilian Douglas DC-3 airliner, which became the military C-47 Skytrain, and British \"Dakota\" transport planes, and decades later, the USAF's AC-47 Spooky gunships. Even the fabric-covered two-seat Piper J-3 Cub had a military version. Gliders and balloons have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the American Civil War and during World War I, and military gliders were used during World War II to deliver ground troops in airborne assaults. \nMilitary transport.\nMilitary transport (logistics) aircraft are primarily used to transport troops and war supplies. Cargo can be attached to pallets, which are easily loaded, secured for flight, and quickly unloaded for delivery. Cargo also may be discharged from flying aircraft on parachutes, eliminating the need for landing. Also included in this category are aerial tankers; these planes can refuel other aircraft while in flight. An example of a transport aircraft is the C-17 Globemaster III. A World War II example would be the C-47. An example of a tanker craft would be the KC-135 Stratotanker. Transport helicopters and gliders can transport troops and supplies to areas where other aircraft would be unable to land.\nCalling a military transport aircraft a \"cargo plane\" is inaccurate, because military transport planes are able to carry paratroopers and other personnel.\nAirborne early warning and control.\nAn airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) system is an airborne radar system designed to detect aircraft, ships and ground vehicles at long ranges and control and command the battle space in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes. AEW&amp;C units are also used to carry out surveillance, including over ground targets and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, battle management) functions similar to an Airport Traffic Controller given military command over other forces. Used at a high altitude, the radars on the aircraft allow the operators to distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft hundreds of miles away. \nAEW&amp;C aircraft are used for both defensive and offensive air operations, and are to the NATO and American trained or integrated air forces what the combat information center is to a naval vessel, plus a highly mobile and powerful radar platform. The system is used offensively to direct fighters to their target locations, and defensively in order to counterattacks by enemy forces, both air and ground. So useful is the advantage of command and control from a high altitude, the United States Navy operates AEW&amp;C aircraft off its Supercarriers to augment and protect its carrier combat information center (CICs). AEW&amp;C is also known by the older terms \"airborne early warning\" (AEW) and \"airborne warning and control system\" (AWACS, /\u02c8e\u026aw\u00e6ks/ ay-waks) although AWACS is the name of a specific system currently used by NATO and the USAF and is often used in error to describe similar systems.\nReconnaissance and surveillance.\nReconnaissance aircraft are primarily used to gather intelligence. They are equipped with cameras and other sensors. These aircraft may be specially designed or may be modified from a basic fighter or bomber type. This role is increasingly being filled by military satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Surveillance and observation aircraft use radar and other sensors for battlefield surveillance, airspace surveillance, maritime patrol, and artillery spotting. They include modified civil aircraft designs, moored balloons and UAVs.\nExperimental.\nExperimental aircraft are designed in order to test advanced aerodynamic, structural, avionic, or propulsion concepts. These are usually well instrumented, with performance data telemetered on radio-frequency data links to ground stations located at the test ranges where they are flown. An example of an experimental aircraft is the Bristol 188.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

They are members of the subclass elasmobranchs. They were formerly included in the order Rajiformes, but more recent phylogenetic studies have shown the Myliobatiformes to be a monophyletic group, and its more derived members evolved their highly flattened shapes independently of the skates.\nCharacteristics.\nMyliobatiformes share physical characteristics of a long, thin tail with serrated spines and a pancake-like body. They share many characteristics with the batoid order Rajiformes, in which they were previously included. The key difference of the orders is the Myliobatiformes' single-lobed pelvic fin, lack of a mid-tail spine, and general lack of a dorsal fin. Myliobatiformes also possess stinging spines along the tail's base, and generally possess large pectoral fins that are completely fused (except Myliobatidae) to the head. They can camouflage themselves from predators using their flat, disk-shaped bodies to lie against the seafloor.\nClassification.\nMyliobatiformes is classified as follows in \"Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes\":\nSuborder Myliobatoidei Compagno, 1973\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe family Aetobatidae is recognised by some authorities. It contains the genus \"Aetobatus\", which is otherwise part of Myliobatidae.\nThe families Myliobatidae and \u2020Rhombodontidae are sometimes grouped in their own superfamily, Myliobatoidea.\nCladogram from \"Rays of the World\" (2016):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
