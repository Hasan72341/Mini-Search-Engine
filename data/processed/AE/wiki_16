A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church, or temple, and may also serve as an oratory, or in the case of communities anything from a single building housing only one senior and two or three junior monks or nuns, to vast complexes and estates housing tens or hundreds. A monastery complex typically comprises a number of buildings which include a church, dormitory, cloister, refectory, library, and infirmary and outlying granges. Depending on the location, the monastic order and the occupation of its inhabitants, the complex may also include a wide range of buildings that facilitate self-sufficiency and service to the community. These may include a hospice, a school, and a range of agricultural and manufacturing buildings such as a barn, a forge, or a brewery.\nIn English usage, the term \"monastery\" is generally used to denote the buildings of a community of monks. In modern usage, \"convent\" tends to be applied only to institutions of female monastics (nuns), particularly communities of teaching or nursing religious sisters. Historically, a convent denoted a house of friars (reflecting the Latin), now more commonly called a \"friary\". Various religions may apply these terms in more specific ways.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"monastery\" comes from the Greek word \"\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\", neut. of \"\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\" \u2013 \"monasterios\" from \"\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" \u2013 \"monazein\" \"to live alone\" from the root \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" \u2013 \"monos\" \"alone\" (originally all Christian monks were hermits); the suffix \"-terion\" denotes a \"place for doing something\". The earliest extant use of the term \"monast\u0113rion\" is by the 1st century AD Jewish philosopher Philo in \"On The Contemplative Life,\" ch. III.\nIn England, the word \"monastery\" was also applied to the habitation of a bishop and the cathedral clergy who lived apart from the lay community. Most cathedrals were not monasteries, and were served by canons secular, which were communal but not monastic. However, some were run by monasteries orders, such as Durham Cathedral. Westminster Abbey was for a short time a cathedral, and was a Benedictine monastery until the Reformation, and its Chapter preserves elements of the Benedictine tradition. See the entry cathedral. They are also to be distinguished from collegiate churches, such as St George's Chapel, Windsor.\nTerms.\nThe term \"monastery\" is used generically to refer to any of a number of types of religious community. In the Roman Catholic religion and to some extent in certain branches of Buddhism, there is a somewhat more specific definition of the term and many related terms.\nBuddhist monasteries are generally called vihara (Pali language el). Viharas may be occupied by men or women, and in keeping with common English usage, a vihara populated by females may often be called a nunnery or a convent. However, vihara can also refer to a temple. In Tibetan Buddhism, monasteries are often called gompa. In Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, a monastery is called a \"wat\". In Burma, a monastery is called a \"kyaung\".\nA Christian monastery may be an abbey (i.e., under the rule of an abbot), or a priory (under the rule of a prior), or conceivably a hermitage (the dwelling of a hermit). It may be a community of men (monks) or of women (nuns). A charterhouse is any monastery belonging to the Carthusian order. In Eastern Christianity, a very small monastic community can be called a skete, and a very large or important monastery can be given the dignity of a lavra.\nThe great communal life of a Christian monastery is called cenobitic, as opposed to the anchoretic (or anchoritic) life of an anchorite and the eremitic life of a hermit. There has also been, mostly under the Osmanli occupation of Greece and Cyprus, an \"idiorrhythmic\" lifestyle where monks come together but being able to own things individually and not being obliged to work for the common good.\nIn Hinduism monasteries are called matha, mandir, koil, or most commonly an ashram.\nJains use the Buddhist term vihara.\nMonastic life.\nIn most religions, life inside monasteries is governed by community rules that stipulate the gender of the inhabitants and require them to remain celibate and own little or no personal property. The degree to which life inside a particular monastery is socially separate from the surrounding populace can also vary widely; some religious traditions mandate isolation for purposes of contemplation removed from the everyday world, in which case members of the monastic community may spend most of their time isolated even from each other. Others focus on interacting with the local communities to provide services, such as teaching, medical care, or evangelism. Some monastic communities are only occupied seasonally, depending both on the traditions involved and the local climate, and people may be part of a monastic community for periods ranging from a few days at a time to almost an entire lifetime.\nLife within the walls of a monastery may be supported in several ways: by manufacturing and selling goods, often agricultural products; by donations or alms; by rental or investment incomes; and by funds from other organizations within the religion, which in the past formed the traditional support of monasteries. There has been a long tradition of Christian monasteries providing hospitable, charitable and hospital services. Monasteries have often been associated with the provision of education and the encouragement of scholarship and research, which has led to the establishment of schools and colleges and the association with universities. Monastic life has adapted to modern society by offering computer services, accounting services and management as well as modern hospital and educational administration.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhist monasteries, known as vih\u0101ra in Pali and in Sanskrit, emerged sometime around the fourth century BCE from the practice of vassa, a retreat undertaken by Buddhist monastics during the South Asian wet season. To prevent wandering monks and nuns from disturbing new plant-growth or becoming stranded in inclement weather, they were instructed to remain in a fixed location for the roughly three-month period typically beginning in mid-July.\nThese early fixed \"vassa\" retreats took place in pavilions and parks that wealthy supporters had donated to the sangha. Over the years, the custom of staying on property held in common by the \"sangha\" as a whole during the \"vassa\" retreat evolved into cenobitic monasticism, in which monks and nuns resided year-round in monasteries.\nIn India, Buddhist monasteries gradually developed into centres of learning where philosophical principles were developed and debated; this tradition continues in the monastic universities of Vajrayana Buddhists, as well as in religious schools and universities founded by religious orders across the Buddhist world. In modern times, living a settled life in a monastery setting has become the most common lifestyle for Buddhist monks and nuns across the globe.\nWhereas early monasteries are considered to have been held in common by the entire sangha, in later years this tradition diverged in a number of countries. Despite \"vinaya\" prohibitions on possessing wealth, many monasteries became large landowners, much like monasteries in medieval Christian Europe. In Chinese Buddhism, peasant families worked monastic-owned land in exchange for paying a portion of their yearly crop to the resident monks in the monastery, just as they would to a feudal landlord. In Sri\u00a0Lanka and in Tibetan Buddhism, the ownership of a monastery often became vested in a single monk, who would often keep the property within the family by passing it on to a nephew ordained as a monk. In Japan, where civil authorities permitted Buddhist monks to marry, the position of head of a temple or monastery sometimes became hereditary, passed from father to son over many generations.\nForest monasteries \u2013 most commonly found in the Theravada traditions of Southeast Asia and Sri\u00a0Lanka \u2013 are monasteries dedicated primarily to the study and cultivation of Buddhist meditation, rather than to scholarship or ceremonial duties. Forest monasteries often function like early Christian monasteries, with small groups of monks living an essentially hermit-like life gathered loosely around a respected elder teacher. While the wandering lifestyle practised by the Buddha and by his disciples continues to be the ideal model for forest-tradition monks in Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and elsewhere, practical concerns\u2014including shrinking wilderness areas, lack of access to lay supporters, dangerous wildlife, and dangerous border conflicts\u2014dictate that increasing numbers of \"meditation\" monks live in monasteries, rather than wandering.\nTibetan Buddhist monasteries or gompas are sometimes known as lamaseries, with their monks sometimes (mistakenly) known as lamas. Helena Blavatsky's Theosophical Society named its initial New York City meeting-place \"the Lamasery\".\nNotable Buddhist monasteries include:\nFor a further list of Buddhist monasteries see list of Buddhist temples.\nTrends.\nBuddhist monasteries include some of the largest in the world. Drepung Monastery in Tibet housed around 10,000 monks prior to the Chinese invasion\nin 1950\u20131951. As of 2020[ [update]] the relocated monastery in India houses around 8,000.\nChristianity.\nAccording to tradition, Christian monasticism began in Egypt with Anthony the Great. Originally, all Christian monks were hermits seldom encountering other people.\nA transitional form of monasticism was later created by Ammonas in which \"solitary\" monks lived close enough to one another to offer mutual support as well as gathering together on Sundays for common services.\nIt was Pachomius the Great who developed the idea of cenobitic monasticism: having renunciates live together and worship together under the same roof. Some attribute his mode of communal living to the barracks of the Roman Army in which Pachomios served as a young man. Soon the Egyptian desert blossomed with monasteries, especially around Nitria (Wadi El Natrun), which was called the \"Holy City\". Estimates are that upwards of 50,000 monks lived in this area at any one time. Eremetism never died out though, but was reserved only for those advanced monks who had worked out their problems within a cenobitic monastery.\nThe idea caught on, and other places followed:\nWestern Christianity.\nIn the Western Christian Church, the life of prayer and communal living was one of rigorous schedules and self-sacrifice. Prayer was their work, and the Office prayers took up much of a monk's waking hours \u2013 Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, daily Mass, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. In between prayers, monks were allowed to sit in the cloister and work on their projects of writing, copying, or decorating books. These would have been assigned based on a monk's abilities and interests. The non-scholastic types were assigned to physical labour of varying degrees.\nThe main meal of the day took place around noon, often taken at a refectory table, and consisted of the most simple foods e.g.,\u00a0poached fish, bread, vegetables, eggs, cheese, boiled oats. While they ate, scripture would be read from a pulpit above them. Since no other words were allowed to be spoken, monks developed communicative gestures. Abbots and notable guests were honoured with a seat at the high table, while everyone else sat perpendicular to that in the order of seniority. This practice remained when some monasteries became universities after the first millennium, and can still be seen at Oxford University and Cambridge University.\nMonasteries were important contributors to the surrounding community. They were centres of intellectual progression and education. They welcomed aspiring priests to come and study and learn, allowing them even to challenge doctrine in dialogue with superiors. The earliest forms of musical notation are attributed to a monk named Notker of St Gall, and was spread to musicians throughout Europe by way of the interconnected monasteries. Since monasteries offered respite for weary pilgrim travellers, monks were obligated also to care for their injuries or emotional needs. Over time, lay people started to make pilgrimages \"to\" monasteries instead of just using them as a stopover. By this time, they had sizeable libraries that attracted learned tourists. Families would donate a son in return for blessings. During the plagues, monks helped to till the fields and provide food for the sick.\nA Warming House, or calefactory, is a common part of a medieval monastery, where monks went to warm themselves. It was often the only room in the monastery where a fire was lit.\nCatholic.\nA number of distinct monastic orders developed within Roman Catholicism:\nWhile in English most mendicant Orders use the monastic terms of monastery or priory, in the Latin languages, the term used by the friars for their houses is convent, from the Latin \"conventus\", e.g.,\u00a0() or (), meaning \"gathering place\". Franciscans commonly call their house a \"friary\". \nLutheran.\nAfter the foundation of the Lutheran Churches, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as Amelungsborn Abbey near Negenborn and Loccum Abbey in Rehburg-Loccum) and convents (such as Ebstorf Abbey near the town of Uelzen and Bursfelde Abbey in Bursfelde) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.\nIn 1947 Mother Basilea Schlink and Mother Martyria founded the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary, in Darmstadt, Germany. \nIn 1948, Bavarian Lutheran priest Walter H\u00fcmmer and his wife Hanna founded the Communit\u00e4t Christusbruderschaft Selbitz.\nIn 1958, Arthur Kreinheder established The Congregation of the Servants of Christ at St. Augustine's House in Oxford, Michigan. It is a Lutheran monastery in the Benedictine tradition. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden (\u00d6stanb\u00e4ck Monastery) and in Germany the (Priory of St. Wigbert). \nIn Germany, Communit\u00e4t Casteller Ring is a Benedictine Lutheran community for women.\nAnglican.\nIn the 19th-century monasticism was revived in the Church of England, leading to the foundation of such institutions as the House of the Resurrection, Mirfield (Community of the Resurrection), Nashdom Abbey (Benedictine), Cleeve Priory (Community of the Glorious Ascension) and Ewell Monastery (Cistercian), Benedictine orders, Franciscan orders and the Orders of the Holy Cross, Order of St.\u00a0Helena.\nEastern Orthodox.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Church, both monks and nuns follow a similar ascetic discipline, and even their religious habit is the same (though nuns wear an extra veil, called the \"apostolnik\"). Unlike Roman Catholic monasticism, the Eastern Orthodox do not have distinct religious orders, but a single monastic form throughout the Eastern Orthodox Church. Monastics, male or female, live away from the world, in order to pray for the world.\nMonasteries vary from the very large to the very small. There are three types of monastic houses in the Eastern Orthodox Church:\nOne of the great centres of Eastern Orthodox monasticism is Mount Athos in Greece, which, like Vatican City, is self-governing. It is located on an isolated peninsula approximately long and wide, and is administered by the heads of the 20 monasteries. Today the population of the Holy Mountain is around 2,200 men only and can only be visited by men with special permission granted by both the Greek government and the government of the Holy Mountain itself.\nOriental Orthodox.\nThe Oriental Orthodox churches, distinguished by their Miaphysite beliefs, consist of the Armenian Apostolic Church, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria (whose Patriarch is considered first among equals for the following churches), Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Indian Orthodox Church, and Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch.\nThe monasteries of St. Macarius (\"Deir Abu Makaria\") and St. Anthony (\"Deir Mar Antonios\") are the oldest monasteries in the world and under the patronage of the Patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church.\nOthers.\nThe last years of the 18th\u00a0century marked in the Christian Church the beginnings of growth of monasticism among Protestant denominations. The center of this movement was in the United States and Canada beginning with the Shaker Church, which was founded in England and then moved to the United States. In the 19th\u00a0century many of these monastic societies were founded as Utopian communities based on the monastic model in many cases. Aside from the Shakers, there were the Amana Colonies, the Anabaptists, and others. Many did allow marriage but most had a policy of celibacy and communal life in which members shared all things communally and disavowed personal ownership.\nAmong Conservative Anabaptists are the Bruderhof Communities, which have experienced extensive growth around the world.\nOther Protestant Christian denominations also engage in monasticism, including other Reformed (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist) denominations. In the 1960s, experimental monastic groups were formed in which both men and women were members of the same house and also were permitted to be married and have children\u00a0\u2013 these were operated on a communal form.\nTrends.\nThere is a growing Christian neo-monasticism, particularly among evangelical Christians.\nHinduism.\nAdvaita Vedanta.\nIn Hinduism, monks have existed for a long time, and with them, their respective monasteries, called mathas. Important among them are the chatur-amnaya mathas established by Adi Shankara which formed the nodal centres of under whose guidance the ancient Order of Advaitin monks were re-organised under ten names of the Dashanami Sampradaya.\nSri Vaishnava.\nRamanuja heralded a new era in the world of Hinduism by reviving the lost faith in it and gave a firm doctrinal basis to the Vishishtadvaita philosophy which had existed since time immemorial. He ensured the establishment of a number of mathas of his Sri Vaishnava creed at different important centres of pilgrimage.\nLater on, other famous Sri Vaishnava theologians and religious heads established various important mathas such as\nNimbarka Vaishnava.\nNimbarka Sampradaya of Nimbarkacharya is popular in North, West and East India and has several important Mathas.\nDvaita Vedanta.\nAshta matha (eight monasteries) of Udupi were founded by Madhvacharya (Madhwa acharya), a dwaitha philosopher.\nJainism.\nJainism, founded by Mahavira c.\u2009570 BC, has had its own monasteries since the 5th century BC.\nSufism.\nIslam discourages monasticism, which is referred to in the Quran as \"an invention\". However, the term \"Sufi\" is applied to Muslim mystics who, as a means of achieving union with Allah, adopted ascetic practices including wearing a garment made of coarse wool called \"s\u016bf\". The term \"Sufism\" comes from \"s\u016bf\u012b\" meaning the person who wears \"s\u016bf\". But in the course of time, Sufi has come to designate all Muslim believers in mystic union.\nMonasteries in literature.\nMatthew Lewis's 1796 gothic novel \"The Monk\" has as parts of its setting both a fictional monastery and nunnery in Spain at the time of the Inquisition. Many have interpreted Lewis's novel as a critique of Catholicism. Jane Austen sets the latter half of her 1818 novel \"Northanger Abbey\" in an out of use monastery, reflecting on Henry VIII's abolition of monasticism in England and the contemporary abolition of monasticism in France in the wake of the French Revolution. Convents for female monastics, or nunneries, were often portrayed as punishments for women unable or unwilling to marry. \nIn the 1880 novel \"The Brothers Karamazov\", Fyodor Dostoyevsky was inspired by real-life accounts of Orthodox monasticism. Parts of the novel focus in particular on the controversy surrounding the institution of \"elderhood\" in Orthodox monasticism. Dostoyevsky's understanding of the tradition of elderhood is taken largely from \"Life of Elder Leonid of Optina\" by Father Kliment Zeder-gol'm, from which he quotes directly in chapter 5, book 1 of the Brother's Karamazov. \nThe 1980 historical novel The Name of the Rose, by Italian author, philosopher, and semiotician Umberto Eco, is set in a monastery in Italy in the year 1327, and the book creates a tableau of monastic life in the 14th century. It is an intellectual murder mystery; said to be a postmodernist work, combining metanarrative and semiotics with biblical analysis and medieval studies. The narrative itself takes place at a Benedictine abbey during the controversy regarding the doctrines about the absolute poverty of Christ and apostolic poverty between branches of the Franciscan and Dominican orders. The setting was inspired by the monumental Saint Michael's Abbey in Susa Valley, Piedmont.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such a polynomial must have coefficients that are positive real numbers. The term is sometimes restricted to polynomials whose roots have real parts that are strictly negative, excluding the imaginary axis (i.e., a Hurwitz stable polynomial).\nA polynomial function \"P\"(\"s\") of a complex variable s is said to be Hurwitz if the following conditions are satisfied:\nHurwitz polynomials are important in control systems theory, because they represent the characteristic equations of stable linear systems. Whether a polynomial is Hurwitz can be determined by solving the equation to find the roots, or from the coefficients without solving the equation by the Routh\u2013Hurwitz stability criterion.\nExamples.\nA simple example of a Hurwitz polynomial is:\nformula_1\nThe only real solution is \u22121, because it factors as\nformula_2\nIn general, all quadratic polynomials with positive coefficients are Hurwitz.\nThis follows directly from the quadratic formula:\nformula_3\nwhere, if the discriminant \"b\"2\u22124\"ac\" is less than zero, then the polynomial will have two complex-conjugate solutions with real part \u2212\"b\"/2\"a\", which is negative for positive \"a\" and \"b\".\nIf the discriminant is equal to zero, there will be two coinciding real solutions at \u2212\"b\"/2\"a\". Finally, if the discriminant is greater than zero, there will be two real negative solutions,\nbecause formula_4 for positive \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\".\nProperties.\nFor a polynomial to be Hurwitz, it is necessary but not sufficient that all of its coefficients be positive (except for quadratic polynomials, which also imply sufficiency). A necessary and sufficient condition that a polynomial is Hurwitz is that it passes the Routh\u2013Hurwitz stability criterion. A given polynomial can be efficiently tested to be Hurwitz or not by using the Routh continued fraction expansion technique.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the sum of everything everybody in a company knows that gives it a competitive edge. The term is used in academia in an attempt to account for the value of intangible assets not listed explicitly on a company's balance sheets. On a national level, intellectual capital refers to national intangible capital (NIC).\nA second meaning that is used in academia and was adopted in large corporations is focused on the recycling of knowledge via knowledge management and intellectual capital management (ICM). Creating, shaping and updating the stock of intellectual capital requires the formulation of a strategic vision, which blends together all three dimensions of intellectual capital within the organisational context through exploration, exploitation, measurement, and disclosure. Intellectual capital is used in assessing the wealth of organizations. A metric for the value of intellectual capital is the amount by which the enterprise value of a firm exceeds the value of its tangible (physical and financial) assets. Directly visible on corporate books is capital embodied in its physical assets and financial capital; however all three make up the value of an enterprise. Measuring the real value and the total performance of intellectual capital's components is a critical part of running a company in the knowledge economy and Information Age. Understanding the intellectual capital in an enterprise allows leveraging of its intellectual assets. For a corporation, the result will optimize its stock price.\nThe IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) committee developed the International Accounting System 38 with the purpose of prescribing the accounting treatment for intangible assets. IAS 38.8 defines an intangible asset as an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. An asset is a resource that is controlled by the entity as the result of past events (for example purchase or self-creation) and from which future economic benefits (inflows of cash or other benefits) are expected.\nClassification.\nIntellectual capital is normally classified as follows:\nManagement.\nThe intangible nature of many knowledge products and processes, in combination with the increasing importance of their value in corporate balance sheets leads to a growing interest in management of intellectual capital. Creating, shaping and updating the stock of intellectual capital requires the formulation of a strategic vision, which blends together all three dimensions of intellectual capital (human, structural and relational capital) within the organisational context through exploration and exploitation, measurement and disclosure. Therefore, the organisational value of intellectual capital is developed via an ongoing and emergent process focused on the capability to leverage, develop and change the dimensions. The management of intellectual capital is conceptualised as occurring via a multiple stage process, governed by an evolutionary logic. Intellectual capital management is defined as a cycle of four inter-related sets of practices: strategic alignment, exploration and exploitation, measurement, and reporting of intellectual capital.\nThe recognizing and managing of intellectual capital within organizations is not always evident and straightforward; for example, what IC means differ from organization to organization; thus requiring a contextual understanding.\nExploitation.\nThe management of intellectual capital is conceptualised as occurring via a multiple stage process, governed by an evolutionary logic. For a business, translating the potential of its intellectual capital is crucial. Works that focus on the subset, namely the patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, ignore the benefits of their use with the business. Other terms include \"intangible assets\". While corporate reports often stress the value and the know-how of its staff, this crucial asset cannot be considered property. The term \"workforce-in-place\" can be used as a category when companies with their staff are purchased. Without that category, most of the excess purchase price over the tangible book value would just appear as goodwill. In order to profit from intellectual capital, knowledge management has become a task for management. Often, intellectual capital, or at least rights to it, are moved off-shore for exploitation, which entails risks that are hard to value. The transfer of rights to intellectual capital to offshore subsidiaries is a major enabler of corporate tax avoidance.\nMeasurement.\nAn intellectual capital audit is an audit of a company's intellectual capital to monitor and oversee the intellectual capital of a firm in order to capitalize on intellectual capital already within the company, and to identify opportunities to increase the intellectual capital of the company.\nEarly methods of intellectual capital measurement include the balanced scorecard (BSC) framework, the Skandia Navigator, and the Intangible Asset Monitor. Additionally, the Value-Added Intellectual Coefficient method (VAIC) was introduced in 1993 to measure the \"value\" created by intellectual capital.\nIntellectual capital and stock returns growth.\nChanges in stock returns are primarily determined by external factors such as inflation, exchange rates, and socioeconomic conditions. Intellectual capital does not affect a company stock's current earnings. Intellectual capital contributes to a stock's return growth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

NCSA is currently led by Professor Bill Gropp.\nHistory.\nNCSA is one of the five original centers in the National Science Foundation's Supercomputer Centers Program. The idea for NCSA and the four other supercomputer centers arose from the frustration of its founder, Larry Smarr, who wrote an influential paper, \"The Supercomputer Famine in American Universities\", in 1982, after having to travel to Europe in summertime to access supercomputers and conduct his research.\nSmarr wrote a proposal to address the future needs of scientific research. Seven other University of Illinois professors joined as co-principal investigators, and many others provided descriptions of what could be accomplished if the proposal were accepted. Known as the Black Proposal (after the color of its cover), it was submitted to the NSF in 1983. It met the NSF's mandate and its contents immediately generated excitement. However, the NSF had no organization in place to support it, and the proposal itself did not contain a clearly defined home for its implementation.\nThe NSF established an Office of Scientific Computing in 1984 and, with strong congressional support, it announced a national competition that would fund a set of supercomputer centers like the one described in the Black Proposal. \nThe result was that four supercomputer centers would be chartered (Cornell, Illinois, Princeton, and San Diego), with a fifth (Pittsburgh) added later.\nThe Black Proposal was approved in 1985 and marked the foundation of NCSA, with $42,751,000 in funding from 1 January 1985 through 31 December 1989. This was also noteworthy in that the NSF's action of approving an unsolicited proposal was unprecedented. NCSA opened its doors in January 1986.\nIn 2007, NCSA was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to build \"Blue Waters\", a supercomputer capable of performing quadrillions of calculations per second, a level of performance known as petascale.\nBlack Proposal.\nThe 'Black Proposal' was a short, ten-page proposal for the creation of a supercomputing center that eventually led to funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create supercomputing centers, including the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. In this sense, the significant role played by the U.S. Government in funding the center, and the first widely popular web browser (NCSA's Mosaic), cannot be denied.\nThe Black Proposal described the limitations on any scientific research that required computer capabilities, and it described a future world of productive scientific collaboration, centered on universal computer access, in which technical limitations on scientific research would not exist. Significantly, it expressed a clear vision of how to get from the present to the future. The proposal was titled \"A Center for Scientific and Engineering Supercomputing\", and was ten pages long.\nThe proposal's vision of the computing future were then unusual or non-existent, but elements of it are now commonplace, such as visualization, workstations, high-speed I/O, data storage, software engineering, and close collaboration with the multi-disciplinary user community.\nModern readers of the Black Proposal may gain insight into a world that no longer exists. Today's computers are easy to use, and the web is omnipresent. Employees in high-tech endeavors are given supercomputer accounts simply because they are employees. Computers are universally available and can be used by almost anyone of any age, applicable to almost anything.\nAt the time the proposal was written, computers were available to almost no one. For scientists who needed computers in their research, access was difficult if available at all. The effect on research was crippling. Reading publications from that time gives no hint that scientists were required to learn the arcane technical details of whatever computer facilities were available to them, a time-consuming limitation on their research, and an exceedingly tedious distraction from their professional interests.\nThe implementation of the Black Proposal had a primary role in shaping the computer technology of today, and its impact on research (both scientific and otherwise) has been profound. The proposal's description of the leading edge of scientific research may be sobering, and the limitations on computer usage at major universities may be surprising. A comprehensive list of the world's supercomputers shows the best resources that were then available. The thrust of the proposal may seem obvious now, but was then novel.\nThe National Science Foundation announced funding for the supercomputer centers in 1985; The first supercomputer at NCSA came online in January 1986.\nNCSA quickly came to the attention of the worldwide scientific community with the release of NCSA Telnet in 1986. A number of other tools followed, and like NCSA Telnet, all were made available to everyone at no cost. In 1993, NCSA released the Mosaic web browser, the first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in expanding the growth of the World Wide Web. NCSA Mosaic was written by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, who went on to develop the Netscape Web browser. Mosaic was later licensed to Spyglass, Inc. which provided the foundation for Internet Explorer. The server-complement was called NCSA HTTPd, which later became known as Apache HTTP Server.\nOther notable contributions by NCSA were the black hole simulations supporting the development of LIGO in 1992, the tracking of Comet Hale\u2013Bopp in 1997, the creation of a PlayStation 2 Cluster in 2003, and the monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic and creation of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nFacilities.\nInitially, NCSA's administrative offices were in the Water Resources Building and employees were scattered across the campus. NCSA is now headquartered within its own building directly north of the Siebel Center for Computer Science, on the site of a former baseball field, Illini Field. NCSA's supercomputers are at the National Petascale Computing Facility.\n The latest supercomputing system at NCSA today is the DeltaAI, funded by the National Science Foundation.\nMovies and visualization.\nNCSA's visualization department is internationally well-known. Donna Cox, leader of the Advanced Visualization Laboratory at NCSA and a professor in the School of Art and Design at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and her team created visualizations for the Oscar-nominated IMAX film \"Cosmic Voyage\", the PBS NOVA episodes \"Hunt for the Supertwister\" and \"Runaway Universe\", as well as Discovery Channel documentaries and pieces for CNN and NBC Nightly News. Cox and NCSA worked with the American Museum of Natural History to produce high-resolution visualizations for the Hayden Planetarium's 2000 Millennium show, \"Passport to the Universe\", and for \"The Search for Life: Are We Alone?\" She produced visualizations for the Hayden's \"Big Bang Theatre\" and worked with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science to produce high-resolution data-driven visualizations of terabytes of scientific data for \"Black Holes: The Other Side of Infinity\", a digital dome program on black holes.\nPrivate business partners.\nReferred to as the Industrial Partners program when it began in 1986, NCSA's collaboration with major corporations ensured that its expertise and emerging technologies would be relevant to major challenges outside of the academic world, as those challenges arose. Business partners had no control over research or the disposition of its results, but they were well-situated to be early adopters of any benefits of the research. This program is now called NCSA Industry.\nPast and current business partners include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It exhibits similarities to Romansh, which is spoken in Switzerland, as well as to Friulian, which is spoken in northeast Italy.\nThe precise extent of the Ladin language area is a subject of scholarly debate. A narrower perspective includes only the dialects of the valleys around the Sella group, while wider definitions comprise the dialects of adjacent valleys in the Province of Belluno and even dialects spoken in the northwestern Trentino.\nA standard variety of Ladin () has been developed by the Office for Ladin Language Planning as a common communication tool across the whole Ladin-speaking region.\nGeographic distribution.\nLadin is recognized as a minority language in 54 Italian municipalities belonging to the provinces of South Tyrol, Trentino and Belluno. It is not possible to assess the exact number of Ladin speakers, because only in the provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino are the inhabitants asked to identify their native language in the general census of the population, which takes place every 10 years.\nSouth Tyrol.\nIn the 2011 census, 20,548 inhabitants of South Tyrol declared Ladin as their native language. Ladin is an officially recognised language, taught in schools and used in public offices (in written as well as spoken forms).\nThe following municipalities of South Tyrol have a majority of Ladin speakers:\nTrentino.\nIn the 2011 census, 18,550 inhabitants of Trentino declared Ladin as their native language. It is prevailing in the following municipalities of Trentino in the Fassa Valley, where Ladin is recognized as a minority language:\nThe Nones language in the Non Valley and the related Solandro language found in the Sole Valley are Gallo-Romance languages and often grouped together into a single linguistic unit due to their similarity. They are spoken in 38 municipalities but have no official status. Their more precise classification is uncertain. Both dialects show a strong resemblance to Trentinian dialect and Eastern Lombard, and scholars debate whether they are Ladin dialects or not.\nAbout 23% of the inhabitants from Val di Non and 1.5% from Val di Sole declared Ladin as their native language at the 2011 census. The number of Ladin speakers in those valleys amounts to 8,730, outnumbering the native speakers in the Fassa Valley. In order to stress the difference between the dialects in Non and Fassa valleys, it has been proposed to distinguish between \"ladins dolomitiches\" (Dolomitic Ladinians) and \"ladins nonejes\" (Non Valley Ladinians) at the next census.\nProvince of Belluno.\nThere is no linguistic census in the Province of Belluno, but the number of Ladin speakers has been estimated using a 2006 survey. In this area, there are about 1,166 people who speak the standard Ladin and 865 who speak the dialect of Ladin, so out of 8,495 inhabitants they are the 23.9%. They live in the part of the province that was part of the County of Tyrol until 1918, comprising the communes of Cortina d'Ampezzo (15.6% Ladin), Colle Santa Lucia (50.6% Ladin) and Livinallongo del Col di Lana (54.3% Ladin).\nThe provincial administration of Belluno has enacted to identify Ladin as a minority language in additional municipalities. Those are: Agordo, Alleghe, Auronzo di Cadore, Borca di Cadore, Calalzo di Cadore, Canale d'Agordo, Cencenighe Agordino, Cibiana di Cadore, Comelico Superiore, Danta di Cadore, Domegge di Cadore, Falcade, Forno di Zoldo, Gosaldo, La Valle Agordina, Lozzo di Cadore, Ospitale di Cadore, Perarolo di Cadore, Pieve di Cadore, Rivamonte Agordino, Rocca Pietore, San Nicol\u00f2 di Comelico, San Pietro di Cadore, San Tomaso Agordino, San Vito di Cadore, Santo Stefano di Cadore, Selva di Cadore, Taibon Agordino, Vallada Agordina, Valle di Cadore, Vigo di Cadore, Vodo di Cadore, Voltago Agordino, Zoldo Alto, Zopp\u00e8 di Cadore. Ladinity in the province of Belluno is more ethnic than linguistic. The varieties spoken by Ladin municipalities are Venetian alpine dialects, which are grammatically no different to those spoken in municipalities that did not declare themselves as Ladin. Their language is called \"Ladino Bellunese\".\nAll Ladin dialects spoken in the province of Belluno, including those in the former Tyrolean territories, enjoy a varying degree of influence from Venetian.\nHistory.\nThe name derives from Latin, because Ladin is originally a Vulgar Latin language left over from the Romanized Alps. Ladin is often attributed to be a relic of Vulgar Latin dialects associated with Rhaeto-Romance languages. Whether a proto-Rhaeto-Romance language ever existed is controversially discussed amongst linguists and historians, a debate known as . Starting in the 6th century, the Bavarii started moving in from the north, while from the south Gallo-Italic languages started pushing in, which further shrank the original extent of the Ladin area. Only in the more remote mountain valleys did Ladin survive among the isolated populations.\nStarting in the very early Middle Ages, the area was mostly ruled by the County of Tyrol or the Bishopric of Brixen, both belonging to the realms of the Austrian Habsburg rulers. The area of Cadore was under the rule of the Republic of Venice. During the period of the Holy Roman Empire and, after 1804, the Austrian Empire, the Ladins underwent a process of Germanization.\nAfter the end of World War I in 1918, Italy annexed the southern part of Tyrol, including the Ladin areas. The Italian nationalist movement of the 19th and 20th centuries regarded Ladin as an \"Italian dialect\", a notion rejected by various Ladin exponents and associations, despite their having been counted as Italians by the Austrian authorities as well. The programme of Italianization, professed by fascists such as Ettore Tolomei and Benito Mussolini, added further pressure on the Ladin communities to subordinate their identities to Italian. This included changing Ladin place names into the Italian pronunciation according to Tolomei's .\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement of 1946 between Austria and Italy introduced a level of autonomy for Trentino and South Tyrol but did not include any provisions for the Ladin language. Only in the second autonomy statute for South Tyrol in 1972 was Ladin recognized as a partially official language.\nStatus.\nLadin is officially recognised in Trentino and South Tyrol by provincial and national law. Italy signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 1991, but it has not ratified it so far. The charter calls for minority rights to be respected and minority languages, to which Ladin belongs, to be appropriately protected and promoted. Starting in the 1990s, the Italian parliament and provincial assembly have passed laws and regulations protecting the Ladin language and culture. A cultural institute was founded to safeguard and educate in the language and culture. School curricula were adapted in order to teach in Ladin, and street signs are being changed to bilingual.\nLadin is also recognized as a protected language in the Province of Belluno in Veneto region pursuant to the Standards for Protection of Historic Language Minorities Act No. 482 (1999). In comparison with South Tyrol and Trentino, the wishes of the Ladins have barely been addressed by the regional government. In a popular referendum in October 2007, the inhabitants of Cortina d'Ampezzo overwhelmingly voted to leave Veneto and return to South Tyrol. The redrawing of the provincial borders would return Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livinallongo del Col di Lana and Colle Santa Lucia to South Tyrol, to which they traditionally belonged when part of the County of Tyrol or the Bishopric of Brixen.\nAlthough the Ladin communities are spread out over three neighbouring regions, the \"Union Generala di Ladins dles Dolomites\" is asking that they be reunited. The Ladin Autonomist Union and the Fassa Association run on a Ladin list and have sought more rights and autonomy for Ladin speakers. Ladins are also guaranteed political representations in the assemblies of Trentino and South Tyrol due to a reserved seats system.\nIn South Tyrol, in order to reach a fair allocation of jobs in public service, a system called \"ethnic proportion\" was established in the 1970s. Every 10 years, when the general census of population takes place, each citizen has to identify with a linguistic group. The results determine how many potential positions in public service are allocated for each linguistic group. This has theoretically enabled Ladins to receive guaranteed representation in the South Tyrolean civil service according to their numbers.\nThe recognition of minority languages in Italy has been criticised since the implementation of Act No. 482 (1999), especially due to alleged financial benefits. This applies also to the Ladin language, especially in the province of Belluno.\nSubdivisions.\nA possible subdivision of Ladin language identifies six major groups.\nAthesian Group of the Sella.\nThe dialects of the Athesian group (from the river Adige Basin) of the Sella are spoken in South Tyrol:\nThe South Tyrolean dialects are most similar to the original Ladin.\nTrentinian Group of the Sella.\nThe names of the Ladin dialects spoken in the Fassa Valley in Trentino are Moenat, Brach, and Cazet. 82.8% of the inhabitants of Fassa Valley are native Ladin speakers; the Ladin language in Fassa is influenced by Trentinian dialects.\nAgordino Group of the Sella.\nIn the Province of Belluno the following dialects are considered as part of the Agordino group:\nAmpezzan Group.\nSpoken in Cortina d'Ampezzo (\"Anpezo\"), similar to Cadorino dialect.\nEven in Valle di Zoldo (from Forno-F\u00f4r upwards) there are elements of the Ampezzan Group.\nCadorino Group.\nSpoken in Cadore and Comelico and best known as Cadorino dialect.\nNones and Solandro Group.\nIn Western Trentino, in Non Valley, Val di Sole, Val di Peio, Val di Rabbi, and part of Val Rendena, detached from the Dolomitic area, dialects are spoken that are often considered to be part of the Ladin language (Anaunic Ladin), but have strong influences from Trentinian and Eastern Lombard dialects.\nSample texts.\nLord's Prayer.\nThe first part of the 'Lord's Prayer' in Standard Ladin, Latin, and Italian for comparison, as well as other Romance languages and English:\nPhonology.\nAn vowel, spelled \u27e8\u00eb\u27e9, as in \"Urtij\u00ebi\" (), and two front rounded vowels [, ], spelled \u27e8\u00f6, \u00fc\u27e9, occur in some local dialects (such as Val Badia) but are not a part of Standard Ladin.\nWriting system.\nGrave is used to mark stress at the last syllable and circumflex is used to mark long vowels.\nEncoding.\nThe IETF language tags register subtags for the different standards:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45871", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45871", "title": "Loudspeaker", "text": "Converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound\nA loudspeaker (commonly referred to as a speaker or, more fully, a speaker system) is a combination of one or more speaker drivers, an enclosure, and electrical connections (possibly including a crossover network). The speaker driver is an electroacoustic transducer that converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound.\nThe driver is a linear motor connected to a diaphragm, which transmits the motor's movement to produce sound by moving air. An audio signal, typically originating from a microphone, recording, or radio broadcast, is electronically amplified to a power level sufficient to drive the motor, reproducing the sound corresponding to the original unamplified signal. This process functions as the inverse of a microphone. In fact, the \"dynamic speaker\" driver\u2014the most common type\u2014shares the same basic configuration as a dynamic microphone, which operates in reverse as a generator.\nThe dynamic speaker was invented in 1925 by Edward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice. When the electrical current from an audio signal passes through its voice coil\u2014a coil of wire capable of moving axially in a cylindrical gap containing a concentrated magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet\u2014the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday's law of induction; this attaches to a diaphragm or \"speaker cone\" (as it is usually conically shaped for sturdiness) in contact with air, thus creating sound waves. In addition to dynamic speakers, several other technologies are possible for creating sound from an electrical signal, a few of which are in commercial use.\nFor a speaker to efficiently produce sound, especially at lower frequencies, the speaker driver must be baffled so that the sound emanating from its rear does not cancel out the (intended) sound from the front; this generally takes the form of a speaker enclosure or \"speaker cabinet\", an often rectangular box made of wood, but sometimes metal or plastic. The enclosure's design plays an important acoustic role thus determining the resulting sound quality. Most high fidelity speaker systems (picture at right) include two or more sorts of speaker drivers, each specialized in one part of the audible frequency range. The smaller drivers capable of reproducing the highest audio frequencies are called tweeters, those for middle frequencies are called mid-range drivers and those for low frequencies are called woofers. In a two-way or three-way speaker system (one with drivers covering two or three different frequency ranges) there is a small amount of passive electronics called a crossover network which helps direct components of the electronic signal to the speaker drivers best capable of reproducing those frequencies. In a \"powered speaker\" system, the power amplifier actually feeding the speaker drivers is built into the enclosure itself; these have become more and more common, especially as computer and Bluetooth speakers.\nSmaller speakers are found in devices such as radios, televisions, portable audio players, personal computers (computer speakers), headphones, and earphones. Larger, louder speaker systems are used for home hi-fi systems (\"stereos\"), electronic musical instruments, sound reinforcement in theaters and concert halls, and in public address systems.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology.\nThe term \"loudspeaker\" may refer to individual transducers (also known as \"drivers\") or to complete speaker systems consisting of an enclosure and one or more drivers.\nTo adequately and accurately reproduce a wide range of frequencies with even coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ more than one driver, particularly for higher sound pressure level (SPL) or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named subwoofers (for very low frequencies); woofers (low frequencies); mid-range speakers (middle frequencies); tweeters (high frequencies); and sometimes supertweeters, for the highest audible frequencies and beyond. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds is divided between the woofer and tweeter. When multiple drivers are used in a system, a filter network, called an audio crossover, separates the incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with \"n\" separate frequency bands is described as \"n-way speakers\": a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker drivers of the type pictured are termed \"dynamic\" (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from other sorts including moving iron speakers, and speakers using piezoelectric or electrostatic systems.\nHistory.\nJohann Philipp Reis installed an electric loudspeaker in his \"telephone\" in 1861; it was capable of reproducing clear tones, but later revisions could also reproduce muffled speech. Alexander Graham Bell patented his first electric loudspeaker (a moving iron type capable of reproducing intelligible speech) as part of his telephone in 1876, which was followed in 1877 by an improved version from Ernst Siemens. During this time, Thomas Edison was issued a British patent for a system using compressed air as an amplifying mechanism for his early cylinder phonographs, but he ultimately settled for the familiar metal horn driven by a membrane attached to the stylus. In 1898, Horace Short patented a design for a loudspeaker driven by compressed air; he then sold the rights to Charles Parsons, who was issued several additional British patents before 1910. A few companies, including the Victor Talking Machine Company and Path\u00e9, produced record players using compressed-air loudspeakers. Compressed-air designs are significantly limited by their poor sound quality and their inability to reproduce sound at low volume. Variants of the design were used for public address applications, and more recently, other variations have been used to test space-equipment resistance to the very loud sound and vibration levels that the launching of rockets produces.\nMoving-coil.\nThe first experimental moving-coil (also called \"dynamic\") loudspeaker was invented by Oliver Lodge in 1898. The first practical moving-coil loudspeakers were manufactured by Danish engineer Peter L. Jensen and Edwin Pridham in 1915, in Napa, California. Like previous loudspeakers these used horns to amplify the sound produced by a small diaphragm. Jensen was denied patents. Being unsuccessful in selling their product to telephone companies, in 1915 they changed their target market to radios and public address systems, and named their product Magnavox. Jensen was, for years after the invention of the loudspeaker, a part owner of The Magnavox Company.\nThe moving-coil principle commonly used today in speakers was patented in 1925 by Edward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice. The key difference between previous attempts and the patent by Rice and Kellogg is the adjustment of mechanical parameters to provide a reasonably flat frequency response.\nThese first loudspeakers used electromagnets, because large, powerful permanent magnets were generally not available at a reasonable price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by a current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a choke coil, filtering the power supply of the amplifier that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated by the action of passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight alnico magnets after World War II.\nFirst loudspeaker systems.\nIn the 1930s, loudspeaker manufacturers began to combine two and three drivers or sets of drivers each optimized for a different frequency range in order to improve frequency response and increase sound pressure level. In 1937, the first film industry-standard loudspeaker system, \"The Shearer Horn System for Theatres\", a two-way system, was introduced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It used four 15\" low-frequency drivers, a crossover network set for 375\u00a0Hz, and a single multi-cellular horn with two compression drivers providing the high frequencies. John Kenneth Hilliard, James Bullough Lansing, and Douglas Shearer all played roles in creating the system. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, a very large two-way public address system was mounted on a tower at Flushing Meadows. The eight 27\" low-frequency drivers were designed by Rudy Bozak in his role as chief engineer for Cinaudagraph. High-frequency drivers were likely made by Western Electric.\nAltec Lansing introduced the \"604\", which became their most famous coaxial Duplex driver, in 1943. It incorporated a high-frequency horn that sent sound through a hole in the pole piece of a 15-inch woofer for near-point-source performance. Altec's \"Voice of the Theatre\" loudspeaker system was first sold in 1945, offering better coherence and clarity at the high output levels necessary in movie theaters. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; they made it the film house industry standard in 1955.\nIn 1954, Edgar Villchur developed the acoustic suspension principle of loudspeaker design. This allowed for better bass response than previously obtainable from drivers mounted in larger cabinets. He and his partner Henry Kloss formed the Acoustic Research company to manufacture and market speaker systems using this principle. Subsequently, continuous developments in enclosure design and materials led to significant audible improvements.\nThe most notable improvements to date in modern dynamic drivers, and the loudspeakers that employ them, are improvements in cone materials, the introduction of higher-temperature adhesives, improved permanent magnet materials, improved measurement techniques, computer-aided design, and finite element analysis. At low frequencies, Thiele/Small parameters electrical network theory has been used to optimize bass driver and enclosure synergy since the early 1970s.\nSpeaker systems.\nSpeaker system design involves subjective perceptions of timbre and sound quality, measurements and experiments. Adjusting a design to improve performance is done using a combination of magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and materials science theory, and tracked with high-precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, acoustic lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an anechoic chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.\nIndividual electrodynamic drivers provide their best performance within a limited frequency range. Multiple drivers (e.g. subwoofers, woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters) are generally combined into a complete loudspeaker system to provide performance beyond that constraint. The three most commonly used sound radiation systems are the cone, dome and horn-type drivers.\nFull-range drivers.\nA full- or wide-range driver is a speaker driver designed to be used alone to reproduce an audio channel without the help of other drivers and therefore must cover the audio frequency range required by the application. These drivers are small, typically in diameter to permit reasonable high-frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range drivers are found, for instance, in public address systems, in televisions, small radios, intercoms, and some computer speakers.\nIn hi-fi speaker systems, the use of wide-range drivers can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues but also may limit frequency response and output abilities (most especially at low frequencies). Hi-fi speaker systems built with wide-range drivers may require large, elaborate or, expensive enclosures to approach optimum performance.\nFull-range drivers often employ an additional cone called a \"whizzer\": a small, light cone attached to the joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high-frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing to keep up with the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.\nLimited-range drivers, also used alone, are typically found in computers, toys, and clock radios. These drivers are less elaborate and less expensive than wide-range drivers, and they may be severely compromised to fit into very small mounting locations. In these applications, sound quality is a low priority.\nSubwoofer.\nA subwoofer is a woofer driver used only for the lowest-pitched part of the audio spectrum: typically below 200\u00a0Hz for consumer systems, below 100\u00a0Hz for professional live sound, and below 80\u00a0Hz in THX-approved systems. Because the intended range of frequencies is limited, subwoofer system design is usually simpler in many respects than for conventional loudspeakers, often consisting of a single driver enclosed in a suitable enclosure. Since sound in this frequency range can easily bend around corners by diffraction, the speaker aperture does not have to face the audience, and subwoofers can be mounted in the bottom of the enclosure, facing the floor. This is eased by the limitations of human hearing at low frequencies; Such sounds cannot be located in space, due to their large wavelengths compared to higher frequencies which produce differential effects in the ears due to shadowing by the head, and diffraction around it, both of which we rely upon for localization clues.\nTo accurately reproduce very low bass notes, subwoofer systems must be solidly constructed and properly braced to avoid unwanted sounds from cabinet vibrations. As a result, good subwoofers are typically quite heavy. Many subwoofer systems include integrated power amplifiers and electronic subsonic-filters, with additional controls relevant to low-frequency reproduction (e.g. a crossover knob and a phase switch). These variants are known as \"active\" or \"powered\" subwoofers. In contrast, \"passive\" subwoofers require external amplification.\nIn typical installations, subwoofers are physically separated from the rest of the speaker cabinets. Because of propagation delay and positioning, their output may be out of phase with the rest of the sound. Consequently, a subwoofer's power amp often has a phase-delay adjustment which may be used improve performance of the system as a whole. Subwoofers are widely used in large concert and mid-sized venue sound reinforcement systems. Subwoofer cabinets are often built with a bass reflex port, a design feature which if properly engineered improves bass performance and increases efficiency.\nWoofer.\nA woofer is a driver that reproduces low frequencies. The driver works with the characteristics of the speaker enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies. Some loudspeaker systems use a woofer for the lowest frequencies, sometimes well enough that a subwoofer is not needed. Additionally, some loudspeakers use the woofer to handle middle frequencies, eliminating the mid-range driver.\nMid-range driver.\nA mid-range speaker is a loudspeaker driver that reproduces a band of frequencies generally between 1\u20136\u00a0kHz, otherwise known as the \"mid\" frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be compression drivers (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the throat of a horn for added output level and control of radiation pattern.\nTweeter.\nA tweeter is a high-frequency driver that reproduces the highest frequencies in a speaker system. A major problem in tweeter design is achieving wide angular sound coverage (off-axis response), since high-frequency sound tends to leave the speaker in narrow beams. Soft-dome tweeters are widely found in home stereo systems, and horn-loaded compression drivers are common in professional sound reinforcement. Ribbon tweeters have gained popularity as the output power of some designs has been increased to levels useful for professional sound reinforcement, and their output pattern is wide in the horizontal plane, a pattern that has convenient applications in concert sound.\nCoaxial drivers.\nA coaxial driver is a loudspeaker driver with two or more combined concentric drivers. Coaxial drivers have been produced by Altec, Tannoy, Pioneer, KEF, SEAS, B&amp;C Speakers, BMS, Cabasse and Genelec.\nSystem design.\nCrossover.\nUsed in multi-driver speaker systems, the crossover is an assembly of filters that separate the input signal into different frequency bands according to the requirements of each driver. Hence the drivers receive power only in the sound frequency range they were designed for, thereby reducing distortion in the drivers and interference between them. Crossovers can be \"passive\" or \"active\".\nA passive crossover is an electronic circuit that uses a combination of one or more resistors, inductors and capacitors. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, passive crossovers have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in damping factor before the voice coil.\nAn active crossover is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands \"before\" power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each band. Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.\nSome loudspeaker designs use a combination of passive and active crossover filtering, such as a passive crossover between the mid- and high-frequency drivers and an active crossover for the low-frequency driver.\nPassive crossovers are commonly installed inside speaker boxes and are by far the most common type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24\u00a0dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses, and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting.\nEnclosures.\nMost loudspeaker systems consist of drivers mounted in an enclosure, or cabinet. The role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves emanating from the back of a driver from interfering destructively with those from the front. The sound waves emitted from the back are 180\u00b0 out of phase with those emitted forward, so without an enclosure they typically cause cancellations which significantly degrade the level and quality of sound at low frequencies.\nThe simplest driver mount is a flat panel (\"baffle\") with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength longer than the baffle dimensions are canceled out because the antiphase radiation from the rear of the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.\nSince panels of infinite dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear radiation from the moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce the transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, internal bracing and lossy wall material.\nHowever, a rigid enclosure reflects sound internally, which can then be transmitted back through the loudspeaker diaphragm\u2014again resulting in degradation of sound quality. This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorptive materials such as glass wool, wool, or synthetic fiber batting, within the enclosure. The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed to reduce this by reflecting sounds away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where they may then be absorbed.\nOther enclosure types alter the rear sound radiation so it can add constructively to the output from the front of the cone. Designs that do this (including \"bass reflex\", \"passive radiator\", \"transmission line\", etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase the low-frequency output of the driver.\nTo make the transition between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time align the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver is in the same vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the driver back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.\nThe speaker mounting scheme (including cabinets) can also cause diffraction, resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions.\nHorn loudspeakers.\nHorn loudspeakers are the oldest form of loudspeaker system. The use of horns as voice-amplifying megaphones dates at least to the 17th century, and horns were used in mechanical gramophones as early as 1877. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high-pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low-pressure condition at the mouth of the horn. This improves the acoustic\u2014electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.\nThe size of the throat, mouth, the length of the horn, as well as the area expansion rate along it must be carefully chosen to match the driver to properly provide this transforming function over a range of frequencies. The length and cross-sectional mouth area required to create a bass or sub-bass horn dictates a horn many feet long. \"Folded\" horns can reduce the total size, but compel designers to make compromises and accept increased cost and construction complications. Some horn designs not only fold the low-frequency horn but use the walls in a room corner as an extension of the horn mouth. In the late 1940s, horns whose mouths took up much of a room wall were not unknown among hi-fi fans. Room-sized installations became much less acceptable when two or more were required.\nA horn-loaded speaker can have a sensitivity as high as 110\u00a0dBSPL at 2.83 volts (1 watt at 8 ohms) at 1 meter. This is a hundredfold increase in output compared to a speaker rated at 90\u00a0dB sensitivity (given the aforementioned specifications) and is invaluable in applications where high sound levels are required or amplifier power is limited.\nTransmission line loudspeaker.\nA transmission line loudspeaker is a loudspeaker enclosure design that uses an acoustic transmission line within the cabinet, compared to the simpler enclosure-based designs. Instead of reverberating in a fairly simple damped enclosure, sound from the back of the bass speaker is directed into a long (generally folded) damped pathway within the speaker enclosure, which allows greater control and efficient use of speaker energy.\nWiring connections.\nMost home hi-fi loudspeakers use two wiring points to connect to the source of the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or receiver). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have binding posts, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper electrical polarity, the loudspeakers are said to be \"out of phase\" or more properly \"out of polarity\". Given identical signals, motion in the cone of an out of polarity loudspeaker is in the opposite direction of the others. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.\nWith sound reinforcement system, PA system and instrument amplifier speaker enclosures, cables and some type of jack or connector are typically used. Lower- and mid-priced sound system and instrument speaker cabinets often use 1/4\" jacks. Higher-priced and higher-powered sound system cabinets and instrument speaker cabinets often use Speakon connectors. Speakon connectors are considered to be safer for high-wattage amplifiers, because the connector is designed so that human users cannot touch the connectors.\nWireless speakers.\nWireless speakers are similar to wired powered speakers, but they receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. There is an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not enough to drive the speaker. Wireless speakers still need power, so require a nearby AC power outlet, or onboard batteries. Only the wire for the audio is eliminated.\nSpecifications.\nSpeaker specifications generally include:\nand optionally:\nElectrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers.\nTo make sound, a loudspeaker is driven by modulated electric current (produced by an amplifier) that passes through a \"speaker coil\" which then (through inductance) creates a magnetic field around the coil. The electric current variations that pass through the speaker are thus converted to a varying magnetic field, whose interaction with the driver's magnetic field moves the speaker diaphragm, which thus forces the driver to produce air motion that is similar to the original signal from the amplifier.\nThe load that a driver presents to an amplifier consists of a complex electrical impedance\u2014a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), and the effects of air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.\nElectrical models of loudspeakers are available that address these effects in detail.\nElectromechanical measurements.\nExamples of typical loudspeaker measurement are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under one or more conditions (e.g. square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g. horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); harmonic and intermodulation distortion vs. sound pressure level (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e. ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is commonly expressed as decibels relative to 20 \u03bcPa (\"dBSPL\").\nEfficiency vs. sensitivity.\nLoudspeaker efficiency is defined as the sound power output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor impedance match between air and the driver.\nDriver ratings based on the SPL for a given input are called \"sensitivity ratings\" and are notionally similar to efficiency. Sensitivity is usually expressed as the SPL (\"dBSPL\" by common usage meaning \"dB relative to \") at 1\u00a0W electrical input, measured at 1 meter, often at a single frequency. The voltage used is often 2.83\u00a0VRMS, which results in 1\u00a0watt into a nominal 8\u00a0\u03a9 speaker impedance. Measurements taken with this reference are typically quoted as dBSPL with 2.83\u00a0V @ 1\u00a0m.\nThe sound pressure output is measured at (or mathematically scaled to be equivalent to a measurement taken at) one meter from the loudspeaker and on-axis (directly in front of it), under the condition that the loudspeaker is radiating into an infinitely large space and mounted on an infinite baffle. Clearly then, sensitivity does not correlate precisely with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the acoustic environment in front of the actual loudspeaker. For example, a cheerleader's horn produces more sound output in the direction it is pointed by concentrating sound waves from the cheerleader in one direction, thus \"focusing\" them. The horn also improves impedance matching between the voice and the air, which produces more acoustic power for a given speaker power.\nSince sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties, a driver with a higher maximum power rating cannot necessarily be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one. In the example that follows, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective passbands, and that power compression and distortion are insignificant. A speaker 3\u00a0dB more sensitive than another produces very nearly double the sound power (is 3\u00a0dB louder) for the same electrical power input. Thus, a 100\u00a0W driver (A) rated at 92\u00a0 dBSPL for 1\u00a0W\u00a0@ 1\u00a0m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200\u00a0W driver (B) rated at 89\u00a0 dBSPL for 1\u00a0W\u00a0@ 1\u00a0m when both are driven with 100\u00a0W of electrical power. In this example, when driven at 100\u00a0W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or loudness as speaker B would produce with 200\u00a0W input. Thus, a 3\u00a0dB increase in the sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier\u2014and often, to reduced overall system cost.\nIt is typically not possible to combine high efficiency (especially at low frequencies) with compact enclosure size and adequate low-frequency response. One can, for the most part, choose only two of the three parameters when designing a speaker system. So, for example, if extended low-frequency performance and small box size are important, one must accept low efficiency. This rule of thumb is sometimes called Hofmann's Iron Law (after J.A. Hofmann, the H in KLH).\nListening environment.\nThe interaction of a loudspeaker system with its environment is complex and is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present a more or less reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g. from resonant room modes), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is sensitive to small variations in reflected sound, and this is part of the reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.\nA significant factor in the sound of a loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due to a lack of absorption and diffusion.\nPlacement.\nIn a typical rectangular listening room, the hard, parallel surfaces of the walls, floor and ceiling cause primary acoustic resonance nodes in each of the three dimensions: left\u2013right, up\u2013down and forward\u2013backward. Furthermore, there are more complex resonance modes involving up to all six boundary surfaces combining to create standing waves. This is called speaker boundary interference response (SBIR). Low frequencies excite these modes the most, since long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture compositions or placement. The mode spacing is critical, especially in small and medium-sized rooms like recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios. The proximity of the loudspeakers to room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are excited as well as affecting the relative strength at each frequency. The location of the listener is critical, too, as a position near a boundary can have a great effect on the perceived balance of frequencies. This is because standing-wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the Schroeder frequency, depending on room size.\nDirectivity.\nAcousticians, in studying the radiation of sound sources have developed some concepts important to understanding how loudspeakers are perceived. The simplest possible radiating source is a point source. An ideal point source is an infinitesimally small point radiating sound. It may be easier to imagine a tiny pulsating sphere, uniformly increasing and decreasing in diameter, sending out sound waves in all directions equally.\nAny object radiating sound, including a loudspeaker system, can be thought of as being composed of combinations of such simple point sources. The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources is not the same as for a single source but depends on the distance and orientation between the sources, the position relative to them from which the listener hears the combination, and the frequency of the sound involved. Using mathematics, some simple combinations of sources are easily solved.\nOne simple combination is two simple sources separated by a distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair is known as a dipole, and the radiation of this combination is similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure-8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimum output to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources\u00a0\u2013 the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as point sources or dipoles. If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out-of-phase waves are allowed to interact, peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes an approximate point-source radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase drivers (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.\nIn real life, individual drivers are complex 3D shapes such as cones and domes, and they are placed on a baffle for various reasons. Deriving a mathematical expression for the directivity of a complex shape, based on modeling combinations of point sources, is usually not possible, but in the far field, the directivity of a loudspeaker with a circular diaphragm is close to that of a flat circular piston, so it can be used as an illustrative simplification for discussion.\nFar-field directivity of a flat circular piston in an infinite baffle is\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2, formula_3 is the pressure on axis, formula_4 is the piston radius, formula_5 is the wavelength (i.e. formula_6), formula_7 is the angle off axis and formula_8 is the Bessel function of the first kind.\nA planar source such as this radiates sound uniformly for wavelengths longer than the dimensions of the planar source, and as frequency increases, the sound from such a source focuses into an increasingly narrower angle. The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this narrowing of directivity occurs. Even if the diaphragm is not perfectly circular, this effect occurs such that larger sources are more directive. Several loudspeaker designs approximate this behavior. Most are electrostatic or planar magnetic designs.\nVarious manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements to create a specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal. An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially as the Bose 2201.\nDirectivity is an important issue because it affects the frequency balance of sound a listener hears, and also the interaction of the speaker system with the room and its contents. A very directive (sometimes termed \"beamy\") speaker (i.e. on an axis perpendicular to the speaker face) may result in a reverberant field lacking in high frequencies, giving the impression the speaker is deficient in treble, even though on-axis measurements indicate sufficient treble. This is part of the reason why on-axis frequency response measurement is not a complete characterization of the sound of a given loudspeaker.\nOther speaker designs.\nWhile dynamic cone speakers remain the most popular choice, many other speaker technologies exist.\nWith a diaphragm.\nMoving-iron loudspeakers.\nUnlike the newer dynamic (moving coil) design, a moving-iron speaker uses a stationary coil to vibrate a magnetized piece of metal (called the iron, reed, or armature). The metal is either attached to the diaphragm or is the diaphragm itself. The original loudspeaker design used moving iron. This design originally appeared in the early telephone.\nMoving iron drivers are inefficient and have limited frequency response. They require large magnets and coils to increase sound output.\nBalanced armature drivers (a type of moving iron driver) use an armature that moves like a see-saw or diving board. Since they are not damped, they are highly efficient, but they also produce strong resonances. They are still used today for high-end earphones and hearing aids, where small size and high efficiency are important.\nPiezoelectric speakers.\nPiezoelectric speakers are frequently used as beepers in watches and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: They are resistant to overloads that can destroy other high-frequency drivers, and, due to their electrical properties, they can be used without a crossover. Piezoelectric speakers can have extended high-frequency output, and this is useful in some specialized circumstances; for instance, sonar applications in which piezoelectric variants are used as both output devices (generating underwater sound) and as input devices (acting as the sensing components of underwater microphones). They have other advantages in these applications, not the least of which is simple and solid-state construction that resists seawater better than a ribbon or cone-based device would. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers may oscillate when driving capacitive loads like piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response is typically inferior to that of other technologies.\nIn 2013, Kyocera introduced piezoelectric ultra-thin medium-size film speakers with only one millimeter of thickness and seven grams of weight for their 55\" OLED televisions.\nMagnetostatic loudspeakers.\nInstead of a voice coil driving a speaker cone, a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The magnetic field produced by signal current flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent bar magnets mounted behind them. The force produced moves the membrane and so the air in front of it. Typically, these designs are less efficient than conventional moving-coil speakers.\nMagnetostrictive speakers.\nTransducers based on magnetostriction have been predominantly used as ultrasonic sound wave radiators for sonar, but their use has also spread to audio speaker systems, including subwoofers. Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: they can provide greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies and low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex and FeONIC.\nElectrostatic loudspeakers.\nElectrostatic loudspeakers use a high-voltage electric field (rather than a magnetic field) between two conductive planes to drive a thin statically charged membrane between them. Because the driving force is applied over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they potentially provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning comparable to studio monitors. However, their optimum listening area is small and they are not very efficient speakers. Diaphragm excursion is severely limited due to practical construction limitations\u2014the further apart the planes are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable output. This increases the tendency for electrical arcs, as well as increasing the speaker's tendency to attract dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.\nElectrostatics are inherently dipole radiators and due to the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low-frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers. Due to this and the low excursion capability, full-range electrostatic loudspeakers are large by nature, and the bass rolls off at a frequency corresponding to a quarter wavelength of the narrowest panel dimension. To reduce the size of commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high-frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles the bass frequencies effectively.\nElectrostatics are usually driven through a step-up transformer that multiplies the voltage swings produced by the power amplifier. This transformer also multiplies the capacitive load that is inherent in electrostatic transducers, which means the effective impedance presented to the power amplifiers varies widely by frequency. A speaker that is nominally 8 ohms may actually present a load of 1 ohm at higher frequencies, which is challenging to some amplifier designs.\nRibbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers.\nA ribbon speaker consists of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create the sound. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little mass; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding a very good high-frequency response. Ribbon loudspeakers are often very fragile. Most ribbon tweeters emit sound in a dipole pattern. A few have backings that limit the dipole radiation pattern. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on the ribbon length. Ribbon designs generally require exceptionally powerful magnets, which makes them costly to manufacture. Ribbons have a very low resistance that most amplifiers cannot drive directly. As a result, a step down transformer is typically used to increase the current through the ribbon. The amplifier \"sees\" a load that is the ribbon's resistance times the transformer turns ratio squared. The transformer must be carefully designed so that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not degrade the sound, further increasing cost and complication relative to conventional designs.\nPlanar magnetic speakers (having printed or embedded conductors on a flat diaphragm) are sometimes described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e. front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field of carefully placed magnets on either side of the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.\nBending wave loudspeakers.\nBending wave transducers use a diaphragm that is intentionally flexible. The rigidity of the material increases from the center to the outside. Short wavelengths radiate primarily from the inner area, while longer waves reach the edge of the speaker. To prevent reflections from the outside back into the center, long waves are absorbed by a surrounding damper. Such transducers can cover a wide frequency range and have been promoted as being close to an ideal point sound source. This uncommon approach is being taken by only a very few manufacturers, in very different arrangements.\nThe Ohm Walsh loudspeakers use a unique driver designed by Lincoln Walsh, who had been a radar development engineer in WWII. He became interested in audio equipment design and his last project was a unique, one-way speaker using a single driver. The cone faced down into a sealed, airtight enclosure. Rather than move back and forth as conventional speakers do, the cone rippled and created sound in a manner known in RF electronics as a \"transmission line\". The new speaker created a cylindrical sound field. Lincoln Walsh died before his speaker was released to the public. The Ohm Acoustics firm has produced several loudspeaker models using the Walsh driver design since then. German Physiks, an audio equipment firm in Germany, also produces speakers using this approach.\nThe German firm Manger has designed and produced a bending wave driver that at first glance appears conventional. In fact, the round panel attached to the voice coil bends in a carefully controlled way to produce full-range sound. Josef W. Manger was awarded with the Rudolf-Diesel-Medaille for extraordinary developments and inventions by the German institute of inventions.\nFlat panel loudspeakers.\nThere have been many attempts to reduce the size of speaker systems, or alternatively to make them less obvious. One such attempt was the development of \"exciter\" transducer coils mounted to flat panels to act as sound sources, most accurately called exciter/panel drivers. These can then be made in a neutral color and hung on walls where they are less noticeable than many speakers, or can be deliberately painted with patterns, in which case they can function decoratively. There are two related problems with flat panel techniques: first, a flat panel is necessarily more flexible than a cone shape in the same material, and therefore moves as a single unit even less, and second, resonances in the panel are difficult to control, leading to considerable distortions. There have been several flat panel systems commercially produced in recent years.\nHeil air motion transducers.\nOskar Heil invented the air motion transducer in the 1960s. In this approach, a pleated diaphragm is mounted in a magnetic field and forced to close and open under control of a music signal. Air is forced from between the pleats in accordance with the imposed signal, generating sound. The drivers are less fragile than ribbons and considerably more efficient (and able to produce higher absolute output levels) than ribbon, electrostatic, or planar magnetic tweeter designs. ESS, a California manufacturer, licensed the design, employed Heil, and produced a range of speaker systems using his tweeters during the 1970s and 1980s. Lafayette Radio, a large US retail store chain, also sold speaker systems using such tweeters for a time. There are several manufacturers of these drivers (at least two in Germany\u2014one of which produces a range of high-end professional speakers using tweeters and mid-range drivers based on the technology) and the drivers are increasingly used in professional audio. Martin Logan produces several AMT speakers in the US and GoldenEar Technologies incorporates them in its entire speaker line.\nTransparent ionic conduction speaker.\nIn 2013, a research team introduced a transparent ionic conduction speaker which has two sheets of transparent conductive gel and a layer of transparent rubber in between to make high voltage and high actuation work to reproduce good sound quality. The speaker is suitable for robotics, mobile computing and adaptive optics fields.\nDigital speakers.\nDigital speakers have been the subject of experiments performed by Bell Labs as far back as the 1920s. The design is simple; each bit controls a driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate sound reproduction quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent analog-to-digital conversion problems, the effect of aliasing is unavoidable, so that the audio output is \"reflected\" at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the Nyquist limit (half the sampling frequency), causing an unacceptably high level of ultrasonics to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.\nWithout a diaphragm.\nPlasma arc speakers.\nPlasma arc loudspeakers use electrical plasma as a radiating element. Since plasma has minimal mass, but is charged and therefore can be manipulated by an electric field, the result is a very linear output at frequencies far higher than the audible range. Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the Plasmatronics Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from helium gas. This avoided the ozone and NOx produced by RF decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s.\nA less expensive variation on this theme is the use of a flame for the driver, as flames contain ionized (electrically charged) gases.\nThermoacoustic speakers.\nIn 2008, researchers of Tsinghua University demonstrated a thermoacoustic loudspeaker (or \"thermophone\") of carbon nanotube thin film, whose working mechanism is a thermoacoustic effect. Sound frequency electric currents are used to periodically heat the CNT and thus result in sound generation in the surrounding air. The CNT thin film loudspeaker is transparent, stretchable and flexible.\nIn 2013, researchers of Tsinghua University further present a thermoacoustic earphone of carbon nanotube thin yarn and a thermoacoustic surface-mounted device. They are both fully integrated devices and compatible with Si-based semiconducting technology.\nRotary woofers.\nA rotary woofer is essentially a fan with blades that constantly change their pitch, allowing them to easily push the air back and forth. Rotary woofers are able to efficiently reproduce subsonic frequencies, which are difficult to impossible to achieve on a traditional speaker with a diaphragm. They are often employed in movie theaters to recreate rumbling bass effects, such as explosions.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

First strike capability is an attacking country's ability to significantly cripple another nuclear power's second strike retaliatory capacity. The preferred methodology is to attack the opponent's strategic nuclear weapon facilities (missile silos, submarine bases, bomber airfields), command and control sites (a decapitation strike), and storage depots first. The strategy is called counterforce.\nDuring the 1950s, first strike strategy required strategic bomber sorties taking place over hours and days. In the 1960s, the deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles cut the first strike duration to 30 minutes. Also during the Cold War, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, such as those involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis and Euromissile Crisis, as well as submarine-launched ballistic missiles, reduced the time even further, often below 10 minutes.\nSecond strike countermeasures to effectively deter first strikes include early warning systems, launch on warning for missile silos, continuous nuclear-capable submarine stealth patrols, and continuous airborne patrols. \nHistorical background.\n\"First-strike attack\", the use of a nuclear first strike capability, was greatly feared during the Cold War between NATO and the Soviet Bloc. At various points, fear of a first strike attack existed on both sides. Misunderstood changes in posture and well understood changes in technology used by either side often led to speculation regarding the enemy's intentions.\n1948\u20131961.\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the leadership of the Soviet Union feared the United States would use its nuclear superiority to initiate a full-scale attack, as from 1945 to 1948 the U.S. was the only state possessing nuclear weapons and until the late 1960s preserved an overwhelming superiority. The USSR countered by rapidly developing their own nuclear weapons, surprising the US with their first test in 1949. In turn, the U.S. countered by developing the vastly more powerful thermonuclear weapon, testing their first hydrogen bomb in 1952 at Ivy Mike, but the USSR quickly countered by testing their own thermonuclear weapons, with a test in 1953 of a semi-thermonuclear weapon of the Sloika design, and in 1956, with the testing of Sakharov's Third Idea \u2013 equivalent to the Castle Bravo device. Meanwhile, tensions between the two nations rose as 1956 saw Soviet invasion of Hungary; the U.S. and European nations drew certain conclusions from that event, while in the U.S., a powerful social backlash was afoot, prompted by Senator Joseph McCarthy, the House Un-American Activities Committee, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, U.S. citizens executed in 1953 after conviction of espionage. This atmosphere was further inflamed by the 1957 launch of Sputnik, which led to fears of Communists attacking from outer space, as well as concerns that if the Soviets could launch a device into orbit, they could equally cause a device to re-enter the atmosphere and impact any part of the planet. John F. Kennedy capitalized on this situation by emphasizing the bomber gap and the missile gap, areas in which the Soviets were (inaccurately) perceived as leading the United States, while heated Soviet rhetoric added to political pressure. The 1960 U-2 incident, involving Francis Gary Powers, as well as the Berlin Crisis, along with the test of the Tsar Bomba, escalated tensions still further.\nCuban Missile Crisis.\nThis escalating situation came to a head with the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The arrival of Soviet missiles in Cuba was conducted by the Soviets on the rationale that the US already had nuclear missiles stationed in Turkey, as well as the desire by Fidel Castro to increase his power, his freedom of action, and to protect his government from US invasion, such as had been attempted during the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. During the crisis, Fidel Castro wrote Khrushchev a letter about the prospect that the \"imperialists\" would be \"extremely dangerous\" if they responded militarily to the Soviet stationing of nuclear missiles aimed at US territory, less than 90 miles away in Cuba. The following quotation from the letter suggests that Castro was calling for a Soviet first strike against the US if it responded militarily to the placement of nuclear missiles aimed at the US in Cuba:\nIf the second variant takes place and the imperialists invade Cuba with the aim of occupying it, the dangers of their aggressive policy are so great that after such an invasion the Soviet Union must never allow circumstances in which the imperialists could carry out a nuclear first strike against it. I tell you this because I believe that the imperialists' aggressiveness makes them extremely dangerous, and that if they manage to carry out an invasion of Cuba\u2014a brutal act in violation of universal and moral law\u2014then that would be the moment to eliminate this danger forever, in an act of the most legitimate self-defense. However harsh and terrible the solution, there would be no other.\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis resulted in Nikita Khrushchev publicly agreeing to remove the missiles from Cuba, while John F. Kennedy secretly agreed to remove his country's missiles from Turkey. Both sides in the Cold War realized how close they came to nuclear war over Cuba, and decided to seek a reduction of tensions, resulting in US-Soviet d\u00e9tente for most of the 1960s and 1970s.\nNonetheless, this reduction of tensions only applied to the US and the USSR. Recently declassified interviews with high level former Soviet nuclear and military\u2013industrial planners reveal that Fidel Castro continued to favour nuclear options, even during the later Cold War \u2013 according to former Soviet General Andrian Danilevich, \"(...in the early 1980s...) Cuban leader Fidel Castro pressed the USSR to take a tougher line against the United States, including possible nuclear strikes. The Soviet Union, in response, sent experts to spell out for Castro the ecological consequences for Cuba of nuclear strikes on the United States. Castro, according to the general, quickly became convinced of the undesirability of such outcomes.\"\n1970s/1980s.\nHowever, tensions were inflamed again in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 Saber and the SS-18 Satan, and the decision of NATO to deploy the new Pershing II IRBM as well as the Tomahawk Ground Launched Cruise Missile, along with U.S. President Ronald Reagan's talk of 'limited' nuclear war. This increased Soviet fears that NATO was planning an attack. NATO's deployment of these missiles was a response to the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 Saber, which could hit most European NATO bases within minutes of launch. These mutual deployments led to a destabilizing strategic situation, which was exacerbated by malfunctioning U.S. and Soviet missile launch early warning systems, a Soviet intelligence gap that prevented the Soviets from getting a \"read\" on the strategic intentions of U.S. leaders, as well as inflammatory U.S. rhetoric combined with classical Soviet mistrust of the NATO powers. This culminated in a war scare that occurred during 1983 due to the inopportune timing of a NATO exercise called Able Archer, which was a simulation of a NATO nuclear attack on the Soviet Union; this exercise happened to occur during a massive Soviet intelligence mobilization called VRYAN, that was designed to discover intentions of NATO to initiate a nuclear first-strike. This poor timing drove the world close to nuclear war, possibly even closer than the Cuban Missile Crisis over 20 years before.\nLikely first strike weapons systems.\nBecause of the low accuracy (large circular error probable) of early generation intercontinental ballistic missiles (and especially submarine-launched ballistic missiles), counterforce strikes were initially only possible against large, undefended targets like bomber airfields and naval bases. Later generation missiles with much improved accuracy made counterforce attacks against the opponent's hardened military facilities (like missile silos and command and control centers) possible. This is due to the inverse-square law, which predicts that the amount of energy dispersed from a single point release of energy (such as a thermonuclear blast) dissipates by the inverse of the square of distance from the single point of release. The result is that the power of a nuclear explosion to rupture hardened structures is greatly decreased by the distance from the impact point of the nuclear weapon. So a near-direct hit is generally necessary, as only diminishing returns are gained by increasing bomb power.\nFirst-strike enabling weapons systems.\nAny missile defense system capable of wide-area (e.g., continental) coverage, and especially those enabling destruction of missiles in the boost phase, is a first-strike-enabling weapon because it allows for a nuclear strike to be launched with reduced fear of mutual assured destruction. Such a system has never been deployed, although a limited continental missile defense capability has been deployed by the U.S., but it is capable of defending against only a handful of missiles.\nThis does not apply, in general, to terminal missile defense systems, such as the former U.S. Safeguard Program or the Russian A-35/A-135 systems. Limited-area terminal missile defense systems, defending such targets as ICBM fields, or C4ISTAR facilities may, in fact, be stabilizing, because they ensure survivable retaliatory capacity, and/or survivable de-escalation capacity.\nThis also might not apply to a \"non-discriminatory\" space-based missile defense system, even if it is\u2014actually, precisely because it is\u2014of global reach. Such a system would be designed to destroy all weapons launched by any nation in a ballistic trajectory, negating any nation's capability to launch any strike with ballistic missiles, assuming the system was sufficiently robust to repel attacks from all potential threats, and built to open standards openly agreed upon and adhered to. No such system has yet been seriously proposed.\nAnti-first-strike countermeasures.\nAccording to the theories of nuclear deterrence and mutual assured destruction, full countervalue retaliation would be the likely fate for any state that unleashed a first strike. To maintain credible deterrence, nuclear-weapons states have taken measures to give their enemies reason to believe that a first strike would lead to unacceptable results.\nThe main strategy relies on creating doubt among enemy strategists regarding nuclear capacity, weapons characteristics, facility and infrastructure vulnerability, early warning systems, intelligence penetration, strategic plans, and political will. In terms of military capabilities, the aim is to create the impression of the maximum possible force and survivability, which leads the enemy to make increased estimates of the probability of a disabling counterstrike, and in terms of strategy and politics, the aim is to cause the enemy to believe that such a second strike would be forthcoming in the event of a nuclear attack.\nSecond strike.\nOne of the main reasons to deter a first strike is the possibility of the victim of the first-strike launching a retaliatory second strike on the attacker.\nIncreasing SSBN deployment.\nNuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) carrying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), commonly known as \"boomers\" in the US and \"bombers\" in the UK, are widely considered the most survivable component of the nuclear triad. The depths of the ocean are extremely large, and nuclear submarines are mobile, quiet, have virtually unlimited range, and can generate their own oxygen and potable water. In essence, their undersea endurance is limited only by food supply. It is unlikely that any conceivable opponent of any nuclear power deploying ballistic missile submarines can locate and neutralize every ballistic missile submarine before it launches a retaliatory strike in the event of war. Therefore, to increase the percentage of nuclear forces surviving a first strike, a nation can simply increase SSBN deployment and the deployment of reliable communications links with SSBNs.\nHardening or mobilizing land-based nuclear assets.\nIn addition, land-based ICBM silos can be hardened. No missile launch facility can really defend against a direct nuclear hit, but a sufficiently hardened silo could defend against a near miss, especially if the detonation is not from a multimegaton thermonuclear weapon. In addition, ICBMs can be placed on road or rail-mobile launchers (RT-23 Molodets, RT-2PM2 Topol-M, DF-31, Agni 5, Agni 6, MGM-134 Midgetman), which can then be moved around. As an enemy has nothing fixed at which to aim, that increases its survivability.\nIncreasing alert state and readiness.\nThe effectiveness of a first strike is contingent upon the aggressor's ability to deplete its enemy's retaliatory capacity immediately to a level that would make a second strike impossible, mitigable, or strategically undesirable. Intelligence and early warning systems increase the probability that the enemy has the time to launch its own strike before its warmaking capacity has been significantly reduced, which renders a first strike pointless. Alert states such as DEFCON conditions, apart from serving a purpose in the internal management of a country's military, can have the effect of advising a potential aggressor that an escalation towards first strike has been detected and therefore that effective retaliatory strikes could be made in the event of an attack.\nMaintaining survivable C4ISTAR links.\nLooking Glass, Nightwatch, and TACAMO are US airborne nuclear command posts and represent survivable communication links with US nuclear forces. In the event of significant political-military tensions between the nuclear powers, they would take to the skies and provide survivable communications in the event of enemy attack. They are capable of the full exercise of all available MAOs (Major Attack Options), as well as the full SIOP, in the event of a first strike or the destruction of the NCA. They can directly initiate launch of all American ICBMs via radio and satellite communication, signal SLBMs to launch and send bombers on their strike missions. In addition to those airborne assets, the US government has several command and control bunkers, the most famous of which is that of NORAD, which is tunneled a few thousand feet into the granite of Cheyenne Mountain Complex, outside Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is believed to be able to withstand and to continue to operate after a nuclear direct hit. Other US C4ISTAR bunkers include an installation called Site R, located at Raven Rock, Pennsylvania, which is believed to be the Pentagon's relocation site if Washington, DC, is destroyed, as well as Mount Weather, located in Virginia, which is believed to be the relocation site for top executive branch officials. The Greenbrier, located in West Virginia, was once the site of the Supreme Court of the United States and Congress's relocation bunker, but it is no longer a secret but is now a tourist attraction.\nThe Russians have a system called SPRN (\u0421\u041f\u0420\u041d), which can detect nuclear launches and providing early warning so that any such strike would not be undetected until it is too late. However, their unique and special capability can be found with their Dead Hand fail-deadly computerized nuclear release system, which is based at Kosvinsky Kamen in the Urals. Apparently, Dead Hand, named for either the dead man's hand in poker or the dead man's switch in dangerous or deadly machinery, can be turned on whenever the Russian leadership fears a nuclear attack. Allegedly, once Dead Hand is activated, if it detects a loss of communications with Moscow as well as nuclear detonations inside Russian territory, it can give final authority for the release of nuclear weapons to military officers in a bunker under Kosvinsky Kamen, who can then, if they so determine, launch Russia's arsenal.\nDecreasing tensions by mutual adoption of minimum credible deterrent posture.\nInstead of relying on sophisticated communications links and launch-on-warning postures, the French, the British, and the Chinese have chosen to assume different nuclear postures more suited to minimum credible deterrence or the capability to inflict unacceptable losses to prevent the use of nuclear weapons against them, rather than pursuing types of nuclear weapons suitable to first-strike use.\nChina is believed to pursue a minimum credible deterrent/second strike strategy with regards to the US. That may or may not be true with regards to China's stance with regard to Russia, as few Chinese nuclear platforms are intercontinental, and most of the platforms are deployed on the Russian-Chinese border. Unlike relations of the US and China, Russia and China have had military conflicts in the past. In recent years, China has improved its early warning systems and has renovated certain of its platforms for intercontinental strike, which may or may not be due to the US missile defense system. In general, it appears that China's leaders do not greatly fear a first strike, because of their posture of inflicting unacceptable losses upon an adversary, as opposed to the American and Russian policy of trying to \"win\" a nuclear war. The Chinese arsenal is considered to suffice in ensuring that such a first strike would not go unavenged.\nThe United Kingdom and France have sophisticated nuclear weapons platforms, and their nuclear strategies are minimum credible deterrent-based. Both have ballistic missile submarines, armed with intercontinental submarine-launched ballistic missiles, to ensure a second-strike retaliation anywhere in the world. France also has a number of nuclear capable fighter aircraft. Both have nuclear policies that are believed to be effective deterrence towards a would-be nuclear strike against themselves, NATO, European Union members, and other allies.\nDestabilizing role of land-based MIRVed ICBMs.\nMIRVed land-based ICBMs are generally considered suitable for a first strike or a counterforce strike, due to:\nUnlike a decapitation strike or a countervalue strike, a counterforce strike might result in a potentially more constrained retaliation. Though the Minuteman III of the mid-1960s was MIRVed with 3 warheads, heavily MIRVed vehicles threatened to upset the balance; these included the SS-18 Satan which was deployed in 1976, and was considered to threaten Minuteman III silos, which led some neoconservatives (\"Team B\") to conclude a Soviet first strike was being prepared for. This led to the development of the aforementioned Pershing II, the Trident I and Trident II, as well as the MX missile, and the B-1 Lancer.\nMIRVed land-based ICBMs are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on striking first. When a missile is MIRVed, it is able to carry multiple warheads (up to 8 in existing U.S. missiles, limited by New START, though Trident II is capable of carrying up to 12) and deliver them to separate targets. If it is assumed that each side has 100 missiles, with 5 warheads each, and further that each side has a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing 2 warheads at each silo, then the attacking side can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about 5 by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads, and keeping the rest of 60 missiles in reserve. As such, this type of weapon was intended to be banned under the START II agreement, however the START II agreement was never activated, and neither Russia nor the US has adhered to the agreement.\nDestabilizing role of missile defense.\nAny defense system against nuclear missiles such as SDI will be more effective against limited numbers of missiles launched. At small numbers of targets, each defensive asset will be able to take multiple shots at each warhead, and a high kill ratio could be achieved easily. As the number of targets increases, the defensive network becomes \"saturated\" as each asset must target and destroy more and more warheads in the same window of time. Eventually the system will reach a maximum number of targets destroyed and after this point all additional warheads will penetrate the defenses. This leads to several destabilizing effects.\nFirst, a state that is not building similar defenses may be encouraged to attack before the system is in place, essentially starting the war while there is no clear advantage instead of waiting until they will be at a distinct disadvantage after the defenses are completed. Second, one of the easiest ways to counter any proposed defenses is to simply build more warheads and missiles, reaching that saturation point sooner and hitting targets through a strategy of attrition. Third, and most importantly, since defenses are more effective against small numbers of warheads, a nation with a defense system is actually encouraged to engage in a counterforce first strike. The smaller retaliatory strike is then more easily destroyed by the defense system than a full attack would be. This undermines the doctrine of MAD by discrediting a nation's ability to punish any aggressor with a lethal retaliatory second strike.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Print speeds of 600 lines per minute (approximately 10 pages per minute) were achieved in the 1950s, later increasing to as much as 1200 lpm. Line printers print a complete line at a time and have speeds in the range of 150 to 2500 lines per minute. \nSome types of impact line printers are drum printers, band-printers, and chain printers. Non-impact technologies have also been used, e.g., thermal line printers were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, some inkjet and laser printers produce output a line or a page at a time. \nDesigns.\nMany impact printers, such as the daisywheel printer and dot matrix printer, used a print head that printed a character then moved on until an entire line was printed. Line printers were much faster, as each impact printed an entire line.\nThere have been five principal designs:\nBecause all of these printing methods were noisy, line printers of all designs were enclosed in sound-absorbing cases of varying sophistication.\nTiming-sensitive designs.\nSeveral designs of printers have similar characteristics.\nDrum printer.\nIn a typical drum printer design, a fixed font character set is engraved onto the periphery of a number of print wheels, the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer can print. The wheels, joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed. Paper and an inked ribbon are stepped (moved) past the print position. As the desired character for each column passes the print position, a hammer strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the continuous paper. Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers has to be very fast. Typically, they are driven by voice coils mounted on the moving part of the hammer.\nLarge mechanical and electric stresses occur when the line to be printed requires firing all of the hammers simultaneously. With simple type layouts, this happens when the line consists of a single character repeated in all columns, such as a line of dashes (\"----...---\") To avoid this problem, some printers use a staggered arrangement, with the characters in each column rotated around the drum by a different amount. Then simultaneous firing occurs only if the printed line matches the character layout on the drum, which should not happen in normal text.\nLower-cost printers do not use a hammer for each column. Instead, a hammer is provided for every other column, and the entire hammer bank is arranged to shift left and right, driven by an additional voice coil. For this style of printer, two complete revolutions of the character drum are required to print each line, with one revolution being used to print all the \"odd\" columns and another revolution being used to print all of the \"even\" columns. This requires only half (plus one) the number of hammers, magnets, and the associated channels of drive electronics.\nAt least one low-cost printer, made by CDC, achieves the same end by moving the paper laterally while keeping the hammer bank at rest.\nDataproducts was a typical vendor of drum printers, often selling similar models with both a full set of hammers (delivering, for example, 600 lines-per-minute of output) and a half set of hammers (delivering 300 LPM).\nPrinters with horizontally moving print elements.\nChain printer.\nChain printers place the type on a horizontally-moving circular chain. As with the drum printer, as the correct character passes by each column, a hammer is fired from behind the paper. Compared to drum printers, chain printers have the advantage that the type chain can usually be changed by the operator. A further advantage is that vertical registration of characters in a line is much improved over drum printers, which need extremely precise hammer timing to achieve a reasonably straight line of print. By selecting chains that have a smaller character set (for example, just numbers and a few punctuation marks), the printer can print much faster than if the chain contains the entire upper- and lower-case alphabet, numbers, and all special symbols. This is because, with many more instances of the numbers appearing in the chain, the time spent waiting for the correct character to \"pass by\" is greatly reduced. Common letters and symbols appear more often on the chain, according to the frequency analysis of the likely input. IBM was probably the best-known chain printer manufacturer, and the IBM 1403 is probably the most famous example of a chain printer.\nTrain printer.\nTrain printers place the type on a horizontally-moving circular train of print slugs. with multiple characters per slug, on a track, The technology is almost identical to print chains. \nBand printer.\nBand printers are a variation of chain printers in which a thin steel band is used instead of a chain, with the characters embossed or etched onto the band. Again, a selection of different bands are generally available with a different mix of characters so a character set best matched to the characters commonly printed can be chosen. Dataproducts was a well known manufacturer of band printers, with their B300, B600, and B1000 range, the model number representing the lines per minute rate of the printer. (The B300 is effectively a B600 with only half the number of hammers\u2014one per two character positions. The hammer bank moves back and forth one character position, increasing the average number of band movements required for each line.)\nBar printer.\nBar printers were similar to chain printers but were slower and less expensive. Rather than a chain moving continuously in one direction, the characters were on fingers mounted on a bar that moved left-to-right and then right-to-left in front of the paper. An example was the IBM 1443.\nCommon characteristics.\nIn all four designs, timing of the hammers (the so-called \"flight time\") was critical, and was adjustable as part of the servicing of the printer. For drum printers, incorrect timing of the hammer resulted in printed lines that wandered vertically, albeit with characters correctly aligned horizontally in their columns. For train and bar printers, incorrect timing of the hammers resulted in characters shifting horizontally, printed closer or farther from the next character, or blurred on one side, albeit on vertically-level printed lines. The vertical misalignment of drum printers is more noticeable and annoying to human vision (see the sample pictured in this article).\nMost drum, chain, and bar printers were capable of printing up to 132 columns, but a few designs could only print 80 columns and some other designs as many as 160 columns.\nComb printer.\nComb printers, also called line matrix printers, printed a matrix of dots instead of individual characters in the same way as single-character dot matrix printers, but using a comb of hammers to print a portion of an entire row of pixels at one time (for example, every eighth pixel). By oscillating the comb or \"print shuttle\" left and right a short distance, the entire pixel row could be printed (continuing the example, in eight cycles). The paper then advanced and the next pixel row was printed. Because far less print head motion was involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers were much faster, and competitive in speed with formed-character line printers without being restricted to a set of available characters, thus being able to print dot-matrix graphics and variable-sized characters.\nPrintronix and TallyGenicom are well-known vendors of comb printers. In 2009, TallyGenicom was acquired by Printronix.\nWheel printers.\nIn 1949 IBM introduced the IBM 407 Accounting Machine with a wheel print mechanism that could print 150 alphanumeric lines a minute. Each of the 120 print positions had its own type wheel which rotated under electromechanical control. Once all were in position, print hammers struck the wheels against a ribbon and the paper. The 407 or its wheel line printer mechanism was attached to a variety of early IBM computers, including the IBM 650, most members of the IBM 700/7000 series and the IBM 1130, the last introduced in 1965.\nPaper (forms) handling.\nAll line printers used continuous form paper provided in boxes of continuous fan-fold forms rather than cut-sheets. The paper was usually perforated to tear into cut sheets if desired and was commonly printed with alternating white and light-green areas, allowing the reader to easily follow a line of text across the page. This was the iconic \"green bar\", \"blue bar\" or \"music-ruled\" form paper that dominated the early computer age in several variants. Standard \"green bar\" page sizes included portrait-format pages of 8\u00bd \u00d7 11 inches (letter size), usually printed at 80 columns by 66 lines of characters (at 6 lines per inch) or 88 lines (at 8 LPI), and landscape-format pages of 14 \u00d7 11 inches, usually printed at 132 columns by 66 or 88 lines. Also common were landscape-format pages of 14 \u00d7 8\u00bd inches (legal size), allowing for 132 columns by 66 lines (at 8 LPI) on a more compact page.\nPre-printed forms were also commonly used (for printing cheques, invoices, etc.). A common task for the system operator was to change from one paper form to another as one print job completed and another was to begin. Some line printers had covers that opened automatically when the printer required attention. These continuous forms were advanced through the printer by means of \"tractors\" (sprockets or sprocket belts). Depending on the sophistication of the printer, there might simply be two tractors at the top of the printer (pulling the paper) or tractors at the top and bottom (thereby maintaining paper tension within the printer). The horizontal position of the tractors was usually adjustable to accommodate different forms. The earliest printers by IBM used a hydraulic motor to move the forms. In later line printers, high-speed servomechanisms usually drove the tractors, allowing very rapid positioning of the paper, both for advancing line-by-line and slewing to the top of the next form. The faster line printers, of necessity, also used \"stackers\" to re-fold and stack the fan-fold forms as they emerged from the printer.\nThe high-speed motion of the paper often developed large electrostatic charges. Line printers frequently used a variety of discharge brushes and active (corona discharge-based) static eliminators to discharge these accumulated charges.\nMany printers supported ASA carriage control characters which provided a limited degree of control over the paper, by specifying how far to advance the paper between printed lines. Various means of providing vertical tabulation were provided, ranging from a paper carriage control tape loop to fully electronic (software-controllable) tab simulation.\nOrigins.\nTabulators built by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1910 census could print their results. Prior to that, tabulator operators had to write down totals from counter wheels onto tally sheets. IBM developed a series of printing accounting machines, beginning in 1920. The 285 Numeric Printing Tabulator could read 150 cards per minute. The 405, introduced in 1934, could print at 80 lines per minute. It had 88 type bars, one for each print position, with 43 alphanumeric bars on the left, followed by 45 numeric-only bars. The IBM 402 series, introduced after World War II, had a similar print arrangement and was used by IBM in early computing devices, including the IBM Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator.\nIBM's first commercial computer, the IBM 701, introduced in 1952, used a line printer, the IBM 716, that was based on the type wheel IBM 407 accounting machine. The 716 was incorporated in subsequent mainstream computers in the IBM 700/7000 series.\nAn early drum printer was the \"Potter Flying Typewriter\", in 1952. \"Instead of working laboriously, one character at a time, it prints whole lines at once, 300 lines per minute, on a paper band. ... Heart of the machine is a continuously spinning disk with the necessary letters and numbers on its rim. ... As the disk revolves, 80 electrically operated hammers tap the back of the paper against an inked ribbon in contact with the disk, thus printing the proper characters in the proper places on the line.\"\nInfluence on hardware and software.\nThe names of the codice_1 and codice_2 commands in Unix were derived from the term \"line printer\". Analogously, many other systems call their printing devices \"LP\", \"LPT\", or some similar variant, whether these devices are in fact line printers or other types of printers. These references served to distinguish formatted final output from normal interactive output from the system, which in many cases in line printer days was also printed on paper (as by a teletype) but not by a line printer. Line printers printed characters, letters and numbers line by line. The parallel ports of computers so equipped were usually designated LPTx, for line printer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital of the autonomous province of Trento. In the 16th century, the city was the location of the Council of Trent. It was part of Austria and Austria-Hungary before it was annexed by Italy in 1919. With 118,142 inhabitants (2022), Trento is the third largest municipality in the Alps and second largest in the historical region of Tyrol.\nTrento is an educational, scientific, financial and political centre in Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol, in Tyrol and Northern Italy in general. The city contains a picturesque Medieval and Renaissance historic centre, with ancient buildings such as Trento Cathedral and the Castello del Buonconsiglio.\nTogether with other Alpine towns Trento engages in the Alpine Town of the Year Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. Trento was awarded the title of Alpine Town of the Year 2004.\nThe city often ranks highly among Italian cities for quality of life, standard of living, and business and job opportunities, being ranked 3rd in 2023. Trento is also one of the nation's wealthiest and most prosperous cities, with its province being one of the richest in Italy, with a GDP per capita of \u20ac46,100 and a nominal GDP of \u20ac25.5 billion in 2023.\nThe University of Trento, founded in 1962 as a Higher University Institute of Social Sciences, is one of the most prestigious medium-small Italian universities, with a strong international vocation. It ranks 1st among 'medium-sized' Universities in the \"Censis\" ranking and 2nd in the ranking of Italian universities. \nThe School of International Studies of the University of Trento is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (Apsia), a selected group of institutions for higher education in the field of international relations. It is the first, and currently unique, Italian institute and one of the few Europeans present in the club of the best international study schools in the world that form policy makers.\nIn the last twenty years, thanks to the gradual creation of various research centers (Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Edmund Mach Foundation) and laboratories in the IT, engineering and sciences fields, Trento and its university have been nicknamed the \"Silicon Valley of the Alps\".\nHistory.\nThe origins of this city on the river-route to Bolzano and the low Alpine passes of Brenner and the Reschen Pass over the Alps are disputed. Some scholars maintain it was a Rhaetian settlement: the Adige area was however influenced by neighbouring populations, including the (Adriatic) Veneti, the Etruscans and the Gauls (a Celtic population). According to other theories, the latter instead founded the city during the 4th century BC.\nTrento was conquered by the Romans in the 1st century BC, after several clashes with the Rhaetian tribes. Before the Romans, Trento was a Celtic village. Julius Caesar re-founded it as a Roman municipality when Rome extended citizenship to the part of Cisalpine Gaul north of the River Po. The Latin name given to the settlement was \"Tridentum\", meaning \"Three-tooth place\" or \"Trident-town\" ( \"three\" + \"tooth\"). The reason for the name is uncertain: the new town may have been consecrated to the god Neptune, or possibly named after the three hills that surround the city (known in Italian as \"Doss Trento\", \"Doss di Sant'Agata\" and \"Doss di San Rocco\"). The Latin name is the source of the adjective \"tridentine\". On the old city hall, a Latin inscription is still visible: \"Montes argentum mihi dant nomenque Tridentum\" (\"Mountains give me silver and the name of Trento\"), attributed to Fra' Bartolomeo da Trento (died in 1251). Tridentum became an important stop on the Roman road that led from Verona to Innsbruck.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the independent bishopric of Trento was conquered by Ostrogoths, Byzantines, Lombards and Franks, finally becoming part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1027, Emperor Conrad II created the Prince-Bishops of Trento, who wielded both temporal and religious powers. In the following centuries, however, the sovereignty was divided between the Bishopric of Trent and the County of Tyrol (from 1363 part of the Habsburg monarchy). Around 1200, Trento became a mining center of some significance: silver was mined from the Monte Calisio \u2013 Khalisperg, and Prince-Bishop Federico Wanga issued the first mining code of the alpine region.\nIn the 14th century, the Habsburg Family that ruled as dukes of Austria were also the counts of Tyrol.\nA dark episode in the history of Trento was the murder of a 3-year-old Christian boy, Simonino, later known as Simon of Trent, who disappeared in 1475 on the eve of Good Friday; the city's small Jewish community was accused of killing him and draining his blood for Jewish ritual purposes. Eight Jews were tortured and burned at the stake, and their families forced to convert to Christianity. The bishop of Trento, Johannes Hinderbach, sought (without success) to have Simonino canonized and published the first book printed in Trento, \"Story of a Christian Child Murdered at Trento\", embellished with 12 woodcuts. In a governmental ceremony in the 1990s, Trento apologized to the Jewish community for this dark episode and unveiled a plaque commemorating the formal apology.\nIn the 16th century, Trento became notable for the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563), a council that convened to create a formal reply to the Protestant Reformation, which was a major event in the Counter-Reformation. The adjective \"Tridentine\" (as in \"Tridentine Mass\") literally means pertaining to Trento, but can also refer to that specific event. Among the notable prince-bishops of this time were Bernardo Clesio (who governed the city from 1514 to 1539 and managed to steer the council to Trento) and Cristoforo Madruzzo (who governed from 1539 to 1567), both able European politicians and Renaissance humanists, who greatly expanded and embellished the city.\nDuring this period, and as an expression of this Humanism, Trento was also known as the site of a Jewish printing press. In 1558 Cardinal Madruzzo granted the privilege of printing Hebrew books to Joseph Ottolengo, a German rabbi. The actual printer was Jacob Marcaria, a local physician; after his death in 1562, the activity of the press of Riva di Trento ceased. Altogether, 34 works were published in the period from 1558 to 1562, most of them bearing the coat of arms of Madruzzo.\nPrince-bishops governed Trento until the Napoleonic era, when it changed hands among various states. Under the reorganization of the Holy Roman Empire in 1802, the Bishopric was secularized and annexed to the Habsburg territories. The Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 ceded Trento to Bavaria, and the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn four years later gave it to Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy.\nThe population staged armed resistance to French domination. The resistance leader was Andreas Hofer. During his youth, he lived in Italian Tyrol, where he learned the Italian language. When Hofer recovered Trento for the Austrians (1809), he was welcomed with enthusiasm by the population of Trento. Approximately 4,000 Trentinian volunteers (\"S\u00eczzeri\" or \"Sch\u00fctzen\") died in battle against the French and Bavarian troops. In 1810, Hofer was captured and brought to Mantua, and was shot by French soldiers on the express order of Napoleon.\nWith Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Trento was annexed by the Habsburg Empire. Church government was finally extinguished, and Trento was henceforth governed by the secular administration of Tyrol. In the following decades, Trento experienced a modernization of administration and economy with the first railroad in the Adige valley opening in 1859. The entire Mediterranean basin was at risk of malaria, a factor that affected the entire Italian peninsula and this Alpine region was not spared. Even Tuscany was particularly hard hit; malaria existed far inland into the Veneto area, reaching the Italian Alps. From 1918 to 1940, government figures show Italy's malaria deaths decreased by 96%, due to the efforts of the Rockefeller Foundation and Italy's own malaria experts, who themselves were international leaders in malariology.\nDuring the late 19th century, Trento and Trieste, cities with ethnic Italian majorities still belonging to the Austrians, became icons of the Italian irredentist movement. Benito Mussolini briefly joined the staff of a local newspaper in 1909, but left Trento because they could not create an anti-Austrian group. There was dissatisfaction with the lack of provincial autonomy and the failure to establish a university for the region. Feelings of loyalty were focused on the 'father-figure' emperor, not for Austria. \nThe nationalist cause led Italy into World War I. Damiano Chiesa and the deputy in the Austrian parliament Cesare Battisti were two well-known local irredentists who had joined the Italian Army to fight against Austria-Hungary with the aim of bringing the territory of Trento into the new Kingdom of Italy. The two men were taken prisoners at the nearby southern front. They were put on trial for high treason and executed in the courtyard of Castello del Buonconsiglio.\nThe region was greatly affected during the war, and some of its fiercest battles were fought on the surrounding mountains in the southernmost regions and the southeast. Of a population of just less than 400,000 in the province, 55,000 men served in the Imperial and Royal Army of whom 11,000 died. Most served on the Galician front; 700 served with the Italian Army. After World War I, Trento and its Italian-speaking province, along with Bolzano (Bozen) and the part of Tyrol that stretched south of the Alpine watershed (which was primarily German-speaking, as still is to this day), were annexed by Italy.\nIn July 1943 Mussolini was removed as Prime Minister when the allies invaded Sicily. Italy surrendered to the Allies, and declared war on Germany. German troops promptly invaded northern Italy and the provinces of Trento, Belluno and South Tyrol became part of the Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills, annexed to Germany. Some German-speakers wanted revenge upon Italian-speakers living in the area, but were mostly prevented by the occupying German troops, who still considered Mussolini head of the Italian Social Republic and wanted to preserve good relations with the Italians. From November 1944 to April 1945, Trento was bombed as part of the so-called \"Battle of the Brenner\". War supplies from Germany to support the Gothic Line were for the most part routed via the rail line through the Brenner Pass. Over 6,849 sorties were flown by the Allies over targets from Verona to the Brenner Pass, with 10,267 tons of bombs dropped. Parts of the city were hit by the Allied bombings, including the church of S. Maria Maggiore, the Church of the Annunciation and several bridges over the Adige river. In spite of the bombings, most of the medieval and renaissance city center was spared. It was finally liberated on 3 May 1945.\nIn 1947, Trento became the host of the Rally Stella Alpina.\nSince the 1950s, the region has enjoyed prosperous growth, thanks in part to its special autonomy from the central Italian government.\nOn 4 August 2015, the cathedral tower caught fire by \"spontaneous combustion\". The clock stopped at 10:50 AM, a matter of minutes after the fire began.\nIn 2020, Trento was listed as the most sustainable city in Italy, according to the Smart City Index.\nGeography.\nThe township of Trento encompasses the city centre as well as many suburbs of extremely varied geographical and population conditions (from the industrial suburb of Gardolo, just north of the city, to tiny mountain hamlets on Monte Bondone). Various distinctive suburbs still retain their traditional identity of rural or mountain villages.\nTrento lies in a wide glacial valley known as the Adige valley, just south of the Dolomite Mountains, where the Fersina River and Avisio rivers join the Adige River (the second longest river in Italy). River Adige is one of the three primary south-flowing Alpine rivers; its broadly curving course alongside Trento was straightened in 1850. The valley is surrounded by mountains, including Vigolana (), Monte Bondone (), Paganella (), Marzola () and Monte Calisio (). Nearby lakes include Lake Caldonazzo, Lake Levico, Lake Garda and Lake Toblino.\n\"Frazioni\".\n\"Frazioni\", or subdivisions of Trento:\nClimate.\nThe municipality of Trento stretches across a wide range of altitude levels, going from just under 200 m above sea level at the city centre, to 400 m in Povo and Cognola, to 2000 m above sea level at Monte Bondone, boroughs at higher elevation, for instance Viote, have a colder alpine climate (\"Dw\"). Urban Trento has a humid subtropical-continental climate (\"Cfa\"-\"Dfa\") according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Monthly average temperatures range between 1.6\u00a0\u00b0C (January) and 23.4\u00a0\u00b0C (July). Average annual precipitation exceeds 900\u00a0mm spread out on an average of 87 days, with peaks in late spring (May\u2013June, 90\u00a0mm monthly average in 9\u201310 rain days) and autumn (October\u2013November: 100\u2013110\u00a0mm monthly average in 7\u20138 days), and lows in winter (January\u2013February, 30\u201340\u00a0mm monthly average in 3\u20134 rain days). Winters are cold to freezing, with infrequent snowfall but usual frost from mid-November to mid-March. In winter, daytime highs may not exceed 5\u00a0\u00b0C and lows may rarely dip down to -10\u00a0\u00b0C, but the former usually stand around 8\u00b0C, while the latter usually hover between -3\u00a0\u00b0C to 0\u00a0\u00b0C. Spring brings unpredictable weather with wind blowing north to south or vice-versa through the valley. Many spring days are pleasant, but the transition may be very quick, for example going from frosty mornings to 30\u00a0\u00b0C in two months. In May, it is possible to have either rainy days with daytime highs below 18\u00a0\u00b0C, or sunny days with the temperature soaring up to 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Summers are hot, sometimes sweltering, with highs getting to 35\u00a0\u00b0C at least for a week a year and more rarely to 38\u00a0\u00b0C. Summer nights can be hot as well, with overnight lows hovering around 22-24\u00a0\u00b0C (in the hilly suburbs east, north and west of Trento summer nights can be much cooler, with overnight temperature differing by up to 6\u00a0\u00b0C from the ones experienced in the city centre). Early fall is pleasant, with foliage starting around mid-October at higher elevations, late October in the uphill suburbs and in November downtown. Fall days can be humid, grey and dim, with temperatures rapidly declining through October and November. The first snowfall in the suburbs may occur as early as late November, with December and early January being the snowiest period of the year.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;As of December 2023, there were 119.180 people residing in Trento, of whom 48% were male and 52% were female. Children (ages 14 and younger) totalled 12.6 percent of the population compared to the elderly (ages 65 and above) who numbered 24.4 percent. The average age of Trento residents is 45.5 compared to the Italian average of 46.8. In the five years between 2018 and 2023, the population of Trento grew by 0.72 percent, while Italy as a whole declined by 1.51 percent. The current birth rate of Trento is 9.61 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\nAs of 2006[ [update]], 92.68% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mostly Albania, Romania): 4.13%, North Africa: 1.08%, and the Americas: 0.85%.\nEconomy.\nThe city owes much of its unique economy to its position along the main communication route between Italy and Northern Europe and to the Adige river which, prior to its diversion in the mid-19th century, ran through the center of the city. The Adige river was formerly a navigable river and one of the main commercial routes in the Alps. The original course of the river is now covered by the Via Torre Vanga, Via Torre Verde and the Via Alessandro Manzoni.\nAs late as World War II, Trento depended on wine-making and silk. Sparkling wine made in the Trentino province is part of the Trento DOC classification. The manufacturing industry installed in the post-war period has been mostly dismantled. Today, Trento thrives on commerce, services, tourism, high-quality agriculture and food industry (including wine and fruit), as a research and conference center thanks to a small but renowned university and internationally renowned research centers such as \"Fondazione Bruno Kessler\", active in both fundamental and applied research, the Italian-German Historical Institute, the Centre for Computational and Systems Biology and ECT*, active in theoretical nuclear studies and part of FBK, and as logistics and transportation thoroughfare.\nValued pink and white porphyry are still excavated from some surrounding areas (Pila). This stone can be seen in many of Trento's buildings, both new and old.\nThe city has two long-running annual sporting events: the Giro al Sas (a professional road running competition) was first held in the city in 1907 and continues to the present, while the Giro del Trentino is an annual road cycling race which the city has hosted every year since 1963.\nEconomy Festival of Trento.\nThe Festival dell\u2019Economia di Trento (Economy Festival of Trento) was brought into being in 2006 in order to enable and facilitate discussions between economists and a broad public. The aim of this festival is to put economic terminology across to everyone. The festival takes place every year at the end of May on the historic Palazzi of the old town in Trento. Well known economists explain and interpret current economic issues, both from an economic-scientific as well as from a social and entrepreneurial viewpoint. In the course of recent years, numerous economic scholars and managers such as Sir Anthony Atkinson, Fan Gang, Zygmunt Bauman and the Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker took an active part.\nPolitics.\nGovernment.\nTrento is governed by the City Council of Trento. Voters elect directly 40 councilors and the mayor of Trento every five years. The current mayor of Trento is Franco Ianeselli, elected for the first time on 21 September 2020. Ianeselli, a former trade unionist, was elected as a left-leaning independent with the support of a wide coalition of parties. These parties ranged from the left (as in the case of Europa Verde) to the Catholic centre (including Partito Autonomista Trentino Tirolese, and Insieme per Trento). When determining the composition of his Giunta (the equivalent of a City Cabinet), Ianeselli selected seven members of the City Council: Monica Baggia, Elisabetta Bozzarelli, Mariachiara Franzoia, Chiara Maule, Salvatore Panetta, Roberto Stanchina, and Paolo Zanella. However, in late November 2020 Paolo Zanella announced he would leave his position as a member of the Giunta, in order to fill a vacancy in one of the 35 seats of the legislative assembly of the Trentino province, upon the resignation of member Paolo Ghezzi. Shortly after, mayor Ianeselli announced Ezio Facchin as Zanella's successor.\nEuroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino.\nIn 1996, a joint session between the states, further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino was mutually agreed on. This activity was steadily extended, eventually followed by the creation of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino in 2011.\nMain sights.\nAlthough off the beaten path of mass tourism, Trento offers rather interesting monuments. Its architecture has a unique feel, with both Italian Renaissance and Roman influences. The city center is small, and most Late-Medieval and Renaissance buildings have been restored to their original pastel colours and wooden balconies. Part of the medieval city walls is still visible in Piazza Fiera, along with a circular tower. Once, these walls encircled the entire city and were connected to the Castello del Buonconsiglio.\nThe main monuments of the city include:\nTrento also sports modernist architecture, including the train station and the central post office, both by rationalist architect Angiolo Mazzoni. In particular, the train station (1934\u201336) is considered a landmark building of Italian railways architecture and combines many varieties of local stone with the most advanced building materials of the time: glass, reinforced concrete, metal. The post office was once decorated with colored windows by Fortunato Depero, but these were destroyed during bombings in World War II. Other buildings of that time include the Grand Hotel by Giovanni Lorenzi with some guest rooms furnished with futurist furniture by Depero, and the \"R. Sanzio\" Primary School built in 1931\u201334 and designed by Adalberto Libera.\nEducation.\nThe University of Trento was founded in 1962 and has its headquarters in the city of Trento. The other university location is in Rovereto. In total, over 16,000 students study in Trento. Through the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino, the university also works closely together with the universities of Innsbruck and Bolzano.\nTransport.\nThe Autostrada A22 (part of the European route E45) highway connects Trento to Verona and to Bolzano, Innsbruck and Munich.\nTrento railway station, opened in 1859, forms part of the Brenner railway (Verona\u2013Innsbruck), which is the main rail connection between Italy and Germany. The station is also a junction with the Valsugana railway, which connects Trento to Venice. Trento has several other railway stations, including Trento FTM railway station, terminus of the Trento-Mal\u00e8-Marilleva railway (FTM).\nBus or train services operate to the main surrounding valleys: Fassa, Fiemme, Gudicarie, Non, Primiero, Rendena, Sole, Tesino, Valsugana.\nThe public transport network within the city consists of 20 bus lines operated by Trentino Trasporti and a cable car service to Sardagna. The various railway stations within Trento's city limits are integrated into the public transport network.\nTrento-Mattarello Airport is an airfield located south of Trento. The nearest passenger airports are Bolzano Airport, located north, Verona Villafranca Airport, located south and Venice Marco Polo Airport, located south east.\nSport.\nSports venues.\nPalaTrento, now known as BLM Group Arena, opened in 2000, is an indoor arena with a capacity of 4300 seats.

Churches with the function of \"cathedral\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and some Lutheran churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appeared in Italy, Gaul, Spain, and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures, and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches, and episcopal residences. The cathedral is more important in the hierarchy than the church because it is from the cathedral that the bishop governs the area under his or her administrative authority.\nFollowing the Protestant Reformation, the Christian church in several parts of Western Europe, such as Scotland, the Netherlands, certain Swiss Cantons and parts of Germany, adopted a presbyterian polity that did away with bishops altogether. Where ancient cathedral buildings in these lands are still in use for congregational worship, they generally retain the title and dignity of \"cathedral\", maintaining and developing distinct cathedral functions, but void of hierarchical supremacy. From the 16th century onwards, but especially since the 19th century, churches originating in Western Europe have undertaken vigorous programmes of missionary activity, leading to the founding of large numbers of new dioceses with associated cathedral establishments of varying forms in Asia, Africa, Australasia, Oceania and the Americas. In addition, both the Catholic Church and Orthodox churches have formed new dioceses within formerly Protestant lands for converts and migrant co-religionists. Consequently, it is not uncommon to find Christians in a single city being served by three or more cathedrals of differing denominations. \"For example, London is home to the Anglican St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, the Catholic Westminster Cathedral &amp; St George's Cathedral, and several Eastern Orthodox cathedrals serving different national communities.https://\"\nEtymology and definition.\nThe word \"cathedral\" is derived from the French , which came from the Latin and from the ('seat'), and ultimately from the Ancient Greek (), 'seat, bench', from () 'down' and () 'seat, base, chair'.\nThe word refers to the presence and prominence of the bishop's or archbishop's chair or throne, raised above both clergy and laity, and originally located facing the congregation from behind the high altar. In the ancient world, the chair, on a raised dais, was the distinctive mark of a teacher or rhetor and thus symbolises the bishop's role as teacher. A raised throne within a basilican hall was also definitive for a Late Antique presiding magistrate; and so the \"cathedra\" also symbolises the bishop's role in governing his diocese.\nThe word \"cathedral\", as the seat of a bishop, is found in most languages; however in Europe a cathedral church can be referred to as a (in Italian) or (e.g. German, Dutch, etc.), from the Latin term (house of the church) or (episcopal house). While the terms are not synonymous (a \"duomo\" is a collegiate church, similar to the English \"minster\") many cathedral churches are also collegiate churches, so that , and , have become the common names for a cathedral in those countries. It is also common in parts of the Iberian Peninsula to use \"S\u00e9\" (in Portuguese), and \"Seu\" (in Catalan, with its Spanish form \"Seo\"), all of them from the Latin term , meaning \"episcopal seat\".\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Latin word \"cathedral\" commonly translates as ( in Slavic languages), meaning 'assembly', but this title is also applied to monastic and other major churches without episcopal responsibilities. When the church at which an archbishop or \"metropolitan\" presides is specifically intended, the term (lit.\u2009'cathedral temple') is used.\nThe episcopal throne embodies the principle that only a bishop makes a cathedral, and this still applies even in those churches that no longer have bishops, but retain cathedral dignity and functions in ancient churches over which bishops formerly presided. But the throne can also embody the principle that a cathedral makes a bishop; both specifically, in that the bishop is elected within the cathedral and is inaugurated by being enthroned within the cathedral by acclamation of clergy and laity; and also generally, in that the bishops' essential qualifications of regular prayer, higher learning and musical worship were for many centuries, primarily accessible through cathedral functions. In this there is a distinction between those church traditions, predominantly those of Eastern Orthodox Christianity but formerly also including Celtic churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, whose bishops came to be made in monasteries; and those church traditions whose bishops have tended predominantly to arise through the ranks of cathedral clergy.\nIn the Catholic or Roman Catholic tradition, the term \"cathedral\" correctly applies only to a church that houses the seat of the bishop of a diocese. The abbey church of a territorial abbey serves the same function (that is, houses the seat of the abbot), but does not acquire the title. In any other jurisdiction canonically equivalent to a diocese but not canonically erected as such (prelature, vicariate, ordinariate, prefecture, apostolic administration), the church that serves this function is correctly called the \"principal church\" of the respective entity\u2014though some have coopted the term \"cathedral\" anyway. The Catholic Church also uses the following terms.\nThe cathedral church of a metropolitan bishop is called a \"metropolitan cathedral\".\nThe term \"cathedral\" actually carries no implication as to the size or ornateness of the building, although many cathedrals are impressive edifices simply because diocesan celebrations typically require the capacity of one of the larger churches in the diocese. Thus, the term \"cathedral\" is often applied colloquially to large and impressive churches that do not function as cathedrals (e.g. the Arctic Cathedral in Troms\u00f8, Norway). Simon Jenkins' guidebook on European cathedrals intentionally includes several churches that have never been cathedrals (Ulm Minster and the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, a minor basilica in Barcelona) or that were formerly designated so (Westminster Abbey and Basel Minster).\nHistory and organization of the Early Church.\nOrigins and characteristics of the first cathedrals in Europe.\nThe history of cathedrals commenced in the year 313, when the emperor Constantine the Great personally adopted Christianity and initiated the Peace of the Church. Indeed, in strict terminology, there could not have been \"cathedrals\" before that date, as before the 4th century there were no Christian \"cathedrae\"; bishops were never seated when leading congregational worship, but instead presided standing on a raised platform or \"pulpitum\". In the third century, the phrase \"ascending the platform\", \"ad pulpitum venire\", becomes the standard term for Christian ordination. During the siege of Dura Europos in 256, a complete Christian house church, or \"domus ecclesiae\" was entombed in a defensive bank, surviving when excavated, in places to wall-top height. The Dura church had been converted out of a large urban courtyard house of standard form, in which two rooms had been knocked together to make an assembly hall, capable of holding 60-75 standing; while a tank had been inserted in a room on the opposite side of the courtyard as a baptistery, with rich wall paintings above it. The large room was indeed found to have a raised pulpitum at one end, big enough for one person in turn to read, preach and preside from; but too low to have been surmounted by a throne, and too small to have contained an altar. Otherwise the large room had no decoration or distinctive features at all.\nIn 269, soon after Dura fell to the Persian army, a body of clerics assembled a charge sheet against the bishop of Antioch, Paul of Samosata, in the form of an open letter. Amongst the accusations was that Paul, who had received the civil rank of \"ducenarius\" due to contacts in the imperial court, had improperly erected an enclosure, or \"secretum\", for himself in the church of Antioch; that within this enclosure he had erected a throne from which he presided in worship; and that he had trained a female choir to sing hymns of his own devising. These practices were all condemned as innovations, improperly importing the symbols of his secular Roman magistracy into church ritual; while presumptuously and blasphemously asserting that the person of the bishop in eucharistic worship is seated in the place of Christ himself. Still in a hundred years, all bishops in the Mediterranean world had cathedrals, all sat on thrones within an enclosed sanctuary space, and all had established trained choirs to enhance eucharistic worship.\nThe driving principle underlying this change was the acceptance by bishops, more or less willingly, of an imperial invitation to adopt and maintain the duties, dignity and insignia proper to a public magistrate. Characteristically a Roman magistrate presided from a raised throne in a large, richly decorated and aisled rectangular hall called a \"basilica\"; and now bishops would do the same. The earliest of these new basilican cathedrals of which substantial remains are still visible (and maybe amongst the very earliest to be built) is below the Cathedral of Aquileia on the northern tip of the Adriatic sea. Dated from a mosaic inscription between 313 and 319, the complex consisted of two parallel east\u2013west aisled halls of similar size; with a third smaller north\u2013south cross-hall connecting them, which has been interpreted as the presence hall of the \"episcopium\" or bishop's residence. The three halls create an open courtyard, in which was originally located a separate baptistery. Surviving from both large basilican halls are rich mosaic pavements showing (amongst other scenes) Jonah and the Whale, and a series of, mainly female, donor portraits. It appears that similar cathedrals of double-basilica and baptistry were soon afterwards erected in Milan, Trier and Pavia; but that subsequently single-basilican churches became the more common cathedral model.\nConstantine's declaration of imperial favour towards Christianity transformed all aspects of Christian life in the Roman Empire. From being a minority religion, largely confined to urban areas and restricted social groupings, and subject to official hostility and occasional persecution; Christianity acquired greatly expanded numbers of potential adherents of all classes, initially still within city areas, but eventually extending out to the \"pagus\", the city's rural hinterland. The consequence was a radical expansion in the buildings, funding and personnel of associated Church establishments throughout the 4th century. The first cathedrals represent this expansion in material form.\nBuildings.\nThe location and layout of the first cathedrals varied substantially from city to city, although most, as at Aquileia, tended to be sited within the city walls but away from the urban centre; certain elements are almost always found.\nBasilicas.\nBasilican halls had previously been characteristic of major civic complexes and military headquarters buildings; but now became the standard structure for accommodating large Christian congregations. From now on, the term basilica denotes any substantial church building. These new basilicas were wholly different in scale from earlier Christian assembly halls, as they were also different in form from any Roman non-Christian temple or religious structure. The halls were longitudinal, aisled, and flooded with light from large clerestory windows. Floors and walls were richly decorated with mosaic and inlay\u00a0\u2013 usually in abstract or floral patterns. The two original double basilicas at Aquileia had both been about 37m by 17m in size, but within 30 years one hall was quadrupled to 73m by 31m. This expanded basilica now demonstrated three additional features that became characteristic of early cathedrals: an enclosure at the eastern end of the church surrounding the altar; a \"\" east of the altar facing west, and consisting of a raised dais with a centrally place bishop's throne and benches either side for the clergy of his \"familia\"; and a partitioned-off \"narthex\" at the western end into which \"catechumens\" would withdraw during the central act of the Eucharistic liturgy.\nBaptisteries.\nThe baptistery in the Dura church was about 1m square and 1m deep; baptismal candidates could stand in it, but could not be immersed. In the new cathedrals, as had been the case before, only bishops baptised; and ceremonies were held not more than twice a year to allow for suitable periods of instruction. So baptisteries needed to be greatly increased in size, with associated accommodation to ensure privacy in undressing, anointing and redressing; and the baptismal tank, commonly octagonal, was now fully deep enough for total immersion, and wide enough to accommodate both the candidate and an assisting male or female deacon. Baptisteries commonly adopted centralised plan forms derived from funerary chapels; and are invariably separate from the congregational basilica.\nEpiscopium.\nNo one lived in the house church at Dura; such residential facilities as the latrine and kitchen were removed in the conversion. But cathedral complexes always included an episcopal residence. Prominent amongst the charges that had been directed against Paul of Samosata had been his alleged over-familiarity with pious women. As was common, Paul had been married when elected bishop; and again, as was universally expected for a bishop, he had then ceased sexual contact with his wife and no longer cohabited with her. But his accusers charged that, by continuing to associate with other women (even without any indication of actual impropriety) he was creating an unacceptable potential for scandal. To avoid similar such occasions arising, it was necessary for the new cathedrals to create male-only living quarters for the bishop and his entire establishment; and since, in churches in the West, all presbyters and deacons were also expected to live apart from their wives after ordination, these living quarters, the \"episcopium\", were necessarily substantial in extent. In addition to eating and sleeping quarters for ordained boys and men, the episcopium also commonly provided private dining halls for the hospitality expected of the bishop's enhanced social status, a private oratory or chapel for the bishop, and often a bath house.\nFinances.\nJust as the episcopal residence was integral within the complex of cathedral buildings, so too there was no distinction between episcopal, diocesan and cathedral property and endowments. In principle, all diocesan income was paid into a common fund, and divided into four fixed shares for each main area of expenditure; the Bishop himself; the cathedral clergy; the fabric and lighting of cathedral and city churches; and charitable donations. Many diocese already held substantial endowments, but income increased enormously with the Peace of the Church; partly due to imperial subsidies in kind, but mainly from private bequests and regular private benefactions (often called 'first fruits'); although at this date, tithe was never paid to the church. In addition, many individual landowners supported private chapels and oratories on their own property; and endowed independent charitable institutions, and eventually monasteries and nunneries too.\nBishop's share.\nAugustine of Hippo estimated his personal income as being 20 times that of his father, a minor civil servant; and Augustine was by no means the wealthiest bishop in North Africa. But in accepting from Constantine the status of civil magistrates, bishops were now also committed to substantial expenditure to maintain their new style and status; and also to fulfil the associated duties, for instance in employing qualified legal assessors to support them when sitting as civil judges.\nClergy share.\nAll ordained clerics attached to the cathedral were paid through stipends from the general fund. This applied both to the clergy working directly within the cathedral itself, and also to the clergy, called \"canonici\" attached to churches founded by the bishop within the city. From the end of the 4th century, as the mission of the church extended more into rural areas, 'baptistery churches' were founded in more distant villages, so that rural populations could receive the bishop's baptism locally; and the clergy in these churches also counted as \"canonici\" and drew a regular stipend.\nFabric share.\nPlentiful donor inscriptions show that most new church building programmes; mosaics, roofs, furnishings, were financed by private donations. The costs of maintenance and lighting, however, fell on the general fund. This also applied to the churches, known as \"tituli\", served directly by the bishop's clergy, generally also including any surviving house churches from the period before the Peace of the Church and the rural baptistery churches; but not to the chapels, called \"parochiae\", established by rural landowners for the convenience of their tenants. The bishop, in respect of his civil status, was expected to contribute to public works of general benefit; aqueducts, bridges, watercourses.\nCharitable share.\nIn all cities, bishops dedicated substantial sums to the support of widows, orphans and the poor. Such donations had been a strong feature of the church in earlier centuries, but tended then to be specifically directed to the Christian needy. Now the charitable compass became general. Bishops were especially expected to take responsibility for raising ransom funds, where local persons had fallen captive. In addition, it was expected that each diocese would support a \"xenodochium\", a hostel for the homeless and strangers.\nPersonnel.\nJust as the status of the bishop was transformed at the Peace of the Church; so too was that of the male clergy. With the bishop now resident in the \"episcopium\" the other male clergy came to be recognised as his formal \"familia\", in mark of which male clergy now received the tonsure by shaving of their heads; this being originally a Roman badge of adoption. The early church had recognised the orders of bishop, presbyter (priest) and deacon, but a range of minor orders had since grown up in addition; and all were tonsured. These orders now tended to be understood as clerical 'ranks', equivalent to those in the military, such that the male clergy are now often referred to as a \"clerical militia\". And as in the Roman military or civil service, promotion was expected to follow the principle of \"cursus honorum\", rising through the ranks, with the expectation that ideally, a minimum period would be served in each. The female orders of virgin, widow and (female) deacon remained explicitly outside the bishop's familia; and so they did not receive the tonsure and nor did they progress through the \"cursus honorum\". But all orders of cathedral clergy, male and female, increased dramatically in numbers. Around 540 Justinian ordered that the clerical payroll of Hagia Sophia be strictly limited to 60 presbyters, 100 male deacons, 90 subdeacons, 110 lectors, 25 singers, 100 doorkeepers and 40 female deacons; 525 in all.\nBishops.\nBishops were at the head of the local church; but not explicitly within the \"cursus honorum\", as appointment was by election from the local clergy and people. The clergy tended to favour appointment of bishops from within the ranks of cathedral presbyters; but local lay choice often tended rather to outsiders, either a spectacular holy man, hermit or ascetic; or otherwise a senior civil servant or diplomat, who might have favourable contacts to exploit at court. But most bishops came from the \"curial\" class, that is those holding the hereditary rank of decurion with the obligation to serve on the city council, as only persons of this class and above would be likely to have a full rhetorical education in Greek and Latin grammar; without which it was not possible for a boy raised with a knowledge only of Late Antique vernacular speech to express himself in approved classical linguistic forms.\nPriests and archpriests.\nIt was expected that the normal president at both the Eucharist and Baptism would be the bishop, who would celebrate in the cathedral and in titular churches in turn. However, in practice, the bishop needed deputies for the Eucharist and also for the Divine Office of daily prayer, and this duty fell to the priests. The bishop selected a senior priest as archpriest who acted as his official deputy in all ritual matters and as head of the familia. The archpriest was also responsible for the cathedral school. After the 5th century, there were no longer state-supported secular teachers of rhetoric and grammar in the West (other than in parts of Italy) and so the church would have to educate its own.\nDeacons, subdeacons and archdeacons.\nJust as the presbyters deputised for the bishop in ritual matters, so the deacons deputised in administrative and financial matters, especially in the raising and delivering of charity. At the head of the diaconate was the archdeacon; the bishop's main deputy in managerial affairs. Originally inferior in rank to the archpriest, the archdeacon by the sixth century had established clear pre-eminence. Subdeacons assisted the deacons, but unlike them were allowed to marry after ordination; consequently many clerics stopped the cursus honorum at this point, and it was not unusual for a subdeacon to be elected bishop; and even Pope.\nDoorkeepers, exorcists, lectors, acolytes and primicerius.\nIn practice, the first three of these orders tended to be given together, and were typically applied to boys as young as seven. These boy lectors were too young for the grammar school, but were valued as choristers, and so were included in the \"Schola Cantorum\" or choir school. Originally under the responsibility of the deacons, the organisation of choirs was reformed by Pope Gregory the Great, who introduced the office of \"primicerius\" or head cantor for this purpose. This proved a vital reform; as without any comprehensive system of musical notation, the only way that sacred music could be maintained and passed on was through professional choirs of sound musical training undertaking cathedral worship\u00a0\u2013 and such skills are not guaranteed to be present in high-ranking ecclesiastics.\nWomen's orders: virgins, widows and deaconesses.\nThese orders had been of considerable importance in earlier centuries; but tended to be sidelined in cathedrals from the 4th century onwards. So long as adult baptism continued as a regular occurrence, female deacons would continue to be needed for that service; but otherwise the main factor maintaining these orders was a knock-on effect from the rule of continence applied to bishops, presbyters and deacons. When a man became ordained, and moved into the episcopium with the rest of the bishop's \"familia\"; then there would usually also be a requirement for support to their mothers, wives and daughters; and the orders of widows and virgins respectively continued largely for this purpose.\nFunctions.\nNotwithstanding wide differences over time in institutional structures and wider historical contexts; the key functions established for the first cathedrals have tended to remain as distinctive cathedral functions down the centuries; a regular cycle of choral prayer; providing a forum for civic leadership; a commitment to higher learning; and the promotion and dissemination of music.\nCathedral churches since 800 AD.\nRule of the clergy.\nEarly Middle Ages: religious communities.\nThe history of the body of clergy attached to the cathedral church is obscure, and in each case local considerations affected its development, however the main features were more or less common to all.\nOriginally the bishop and cathedral clergy formed a kind of religious community, which, while not in the true sense a monastery, was nevertheless often called a \"monasterium\", the word not having the restricted meaning that it afterwards acquired. In this lies the reason for the apparent anomaly that churches like York Minster and Lincoln Cathedral, which never had any monks attached to them, have inherited the name of minster or monastery. In these early communities the clergy often lived apart in their own dwellings, and were not infrequently married.\nIn the 8th century Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz (743\u2013766), compiled a code of rules for the clergy of the cathedral churches, which, though widely accepted in Germany and other parts of the continent, gained little acceptance in England.\nAccording to Chrodegang's rule, the cathedral clergy were to live under a common roof, occupy a common dormitory and submit to the authority of a special officer. The rule of Chrodegang was, in fact, a modification of the Benedictine rule. Gisa, a native of Lorraine, who was bishop of Wells from 1061 to 1088, introduced it into England, and imposed its observance on the clergy of his cathedral church, but it was not followed for long there, or elsewhere in England.\nLate Middle Ages: monastic and secular cathedrals.\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries, the cathedral clergy became more definitely organised and were divided into two classes. One was that of a monastic establishment of some recognised order of monks, often the Benedictines, while the other class was that of a college of clergy, bound by no vows except those of their ordination, but governed by a code of statutes or canons: hence the name of \"canon\". In this way arose the distinction between the monastic and secular cathedral churches. Outside Great Britain, monastic cathedrals are known only at Monreale in Sicily and Downpatrick in Ireland.\nIn the case of monastic cathedral churches, the internal government was that of the religious order to which the chapter belonged and all the members kept perpetual residence.\nThe alternative of this was the cathedral ruled by a secular chapter; the dignities of provost, dean, precentor, chancellor, treasurer, etc., came into being for the regulation and good order of the church and its services, while the non-residence of the canons, rather than their perpetual residence, became the rule, and led to their duties being performed by a body of \"vicars\", who officiated for them at the services of the church.\nReformation.\nPrior to the Reformation all cathedrals of Western Europe were of the Roman Catholic Church. In England, much of the structure of the monastic and cathedral system was reconstituted during the English Reformation. Although the cathedrals were retained by the now independent and established Church of England, the monastic cathedral chapters were dissolved by King Henry VIII and, with the exceptions of Bath and Coventry, were refounded by him as chapters of canons with a dean as the head and other clergy as minor canons.\nIn Germany and other parts of Europe, with the spread of the Lutheran Church, some ancient churches, like Nidaros Cathedral, Norway, and L\u00fcbeck Cathedral, Germany, became the seats of Protestant bishops, as in England. Many new churches were built which serve the regional administrative function of a cathedral. However, not all churches that function as the seat of a bishop are known as \"cathedral\", the custom varying from place to place, according to local tradition. Some are simply designated \"church\", as occurs at Budolfi Church, the Lutheran cathedral of Aalborg in Denmark.\nRoles.\nProvosts.\nIn most of Europe, the earliest head of a secular church seems to have been the provost (\"praepositus\", \"probst\", etc.), who was charged not only with the internal regulation of the church and oversight of the members of the chapter and control of the services, but was also the steward or seneschal of the lands and possessions of the church. The latter often mainly engaged his attention, to the neglect of his domestic and ecclesiastical duties, and complaints were soon raised that the provost was too much mixed in worldly affairs, and was too frequently absent from his spiritual duties.\nThis led, in many cases, to the institution of a new officer called the \"dean\", who had charge of that portion of the provost's duties that related to the internal discipline of the chapter and the services of the church.\nIn some cases, the office of provost was abolished, but in others it was continued: the provost, who was occasionally an archdeacon as well, remaining head of the chapter. This arrangement was most commonly followed in Germany. In England the provost was almost unknown. Bishop Gisa introduced a provost as head of the chapter of Wells Cathedral, but the office was afterwards subordinated to the other dignities and the provost became simply the steward of certain of the prebendal lands. The provost of the collegiate church of Beverley Minster was the most notable instance of such an officer in England, but at Beverley he was an external officer with authority in the government of the church, no stall in the choir and no vote in chapter.\nIn Germany and Scandinavia, and in a few of the cathedral churches in the south of France, the provost was the ordinary head of the cathedral chapter, but the office was not common elsewhere. As regards France, of 136 cathedral churches existing at the Revolution, 38 only, and those either on the borders of Germany or in the extreme south, had a provost as the head of the chapter. In others the provost existed as a subordinate officer. There were two provosts at Autun, and Lyon and Chartres had four each, all as subordinate officers.\nSecular chapter.\nThe normal constitution of the chapter of a secular cathedral church comprised four dignitaries (there might be more), in addition to the canons. These are the dean, the precentor, the chancellor and the treasurer. These four dignitaries, occupying the four corner stalls in the choir, are called in many of the statutes the \"quatuor majores personae\" of the church.\nDeans.\nThe role of dean (from \"decanus\") seems to have derived its designation from the Benedictine \"dean\" who had ten monks under his charge. The role of dean came into existence to supply the place of the provost in the internal management of the church and chapter. In England every secular cathedral church was headed by a dean who was originally elected by the chapter and confirmed in office by the bishop. The dean is president of the chapter, and within the cathedral has charge of the performance of the services, taking specified portions of them by statute on the principal festivals. The dean sits in the chief stall in the choir, which is usually at the west end of the south side.\nPrecentors.\nNext to the dean (as a rule) is the precentor (\"primicerius\", \"cantor\", etc.), whose special duty is that of regulating the musical portion of the services. The precentor presides in the dean's absence, and occupies the corresponding stall on the north side, although there are exceptions to this rule, where, as at St Paul's, the archdeacon of the cathedral city ranks second and occupies what is usually the precentor's stall.\nChancellors.\nThe third dignitary is the chancellor (\"scholasticus\", \"\u00e9coldtre\", \"capiscol\", \"magistral\", etc.), who must not be confounded with the chancellor of the diocese. The chancellor of the cathedral church is charged with the oversight of its schools, ought to read divinity lectures, and superintend the lections in the choir and correct slovenly readers. The chancellor is often the secretary and librarian of the chapter. In the absence of the dean and precentor, the chancellor is president of the chapter, and within the cathedral is usually assigned the easternmost stall, on the dean's side of the choir.\nTreasurers.\nThe fourth dignitary is the treasurer (\"custo\", \"sacrisla\", \"cheficier\") who is guardian of the fabric, and of all the furniture and ornaments of the church, and whose duty was to provide bread and wine for the Eucharist, and candles and incense. The treasurer also regulated such matters as the ringing of the bells. The treasurer's stall is opposite to that of the chancellor.\nOther clergy.\nIn many cathedral churches are additional dignitaries, as the praelector, subdean, vice-chancellor, succentor-canonicorum, and others, whose roles came into existence to supply the places of the other absent dignitaries, for non-residence was the fatal blot of the secular churches, and in this they contrasted very badly with the monastic churches, where all the members were in continuous residence. Besides the dignitaries there were the ordinary canons, each of whom, as a rule, held a separate prebend or endowment, besides receiving his share of the common funds of the church.\nFor the most part the canons also speedily became non-resident, and this led to the distinction of residentiary and non-residentiary canons, until in most churches the number of resident canons became definitely limited in number, and the non-residentiary canons, who no longer shared in the common funds, became generally known as prebendaries only, although by their non-residence they did not forfeit their position as canons, and retained their votes in chapter like the others.\nThis system of non-residence led also to the institution of vicars choral, each canon having his own vicar, who sat in his stall in his absence, and when the canon was present, in the stall immediately below, on the second form. The vicars had no place or vote in chapter, and, though irremovable except for offences, were the servants of their absent canons whose stalls they occupied, and whose duties they performed. Outside Britain they were often called demi-prebendaries. As time went on the vicars were themselves often incorporated as a kind of lesser chapter, or college, under the supervision of the dean and chapter.\nRelationship of chapter and bishop.\nThere was no distinction between the monastic cathedral chapters and those of the secular canons, in their relation to the bishop or diocese. In both cases the chapter was the bishop's consilium that he was bound to consult on all important matters and without doing so he could not act. Thus, a judicial decision of a bishop needed the confirmation of the chapter before it could be enforced. He could not change the service books, or \"use\" of the church or diocese, without capitular consent, and there are episcopal acts, such as the appointment of a diocesan chancellor, or vicar general, which still need confirmation by the chapter, but the older theory of the chapter as the bishop's council in ruling the diocese has become a thing of the past, in Europe.\nIn its corporate capacity the chapter takes charge sede vacante of a diocese. In England, however (except as regards Salisbury and Durham), this custom has never obtained, the two archbishops having, from time immemorial, taken charge of the vacant dioceses in their respective provinces. When, however, either of the sees of Canterbury or York is vacant the chapters of those churches take charge, not only of the diocese, but of the province as well, and incidentally, therefore, of any of the dioceses of the province that may be vacant at the same time.\nFunctions of a cathedral.\nThe role of the cathedral is chiefly to serve God in the community, through its hierarchical and organisational position in the church structure. The building itself, by its physical presence, symbolises both the glory of God and of the church. A cathedral, its bishop and dignitaries have traditional functions that are mostly religious in nature, but may also be closely associated with the civil and communal life of the city and region.\nSymbolic functions of the building.\nThe cathedral is frequently the most imposing building, and one of the most ancient buildings in its town. The great size and splendor of the cathedral may be out of all proportion to the town itself. The money and talents expended on the building are seen as honoring God, and may also demonstrate both the devotion and the status of the patrons.\nCathedrals are very often oriented east/west, so that the worshipers look towards the rising sun, symbolizing the Risen Christ. The architectural form of the building most frequently has the ground plan of a cross. This form is both functional and symbolic, its symbolism referring to the cross on which Jesus was crucified. The form is liturgically functional as it allows the building to be divided into sections where different activities take place, or that are occupied by different people, such as the clergy, the choir and the laity.\nThe main body of the building, making the longer arm of the cross, is called the nave, and is where worshipers congregate; the term is from the Latin word for ship. The cathedral is symbolically a ship bearing the people of God through the storms of life. The nave is also used for major processions, which gather or enter at the furthest door (liturgically generally called the West Door). The aisles on each side of the nave facilitate the movement of people within the building, without disrupting worshipers in the central space.\nThe arms of the cross are called the transepts and often contain a number of chapels. Farthest from the main entry is the \"sanctuary\" where the Blessed Sacrament is laid on the altar or communion table for the consecration. \"Sanctuary\" means \"Holy Place\". The word has passed into modern English with an altered meaning because traditionally a criminal who could gain access to this area without capture was thereby given the sanctuary of the church.\nCathedral buildings of the Western European tradition symbolize the progression of the Christian soul towards Salvation. Many cathedrals of Eastern European tradition are centrally planned. These churches are almost always domed. The symbolism in these cathedral structures is of the hierarchy of Earth and Heaven, and often reveals its meaning through the internal decoration of the building with frescoes or mosaics.\nReligious functions.\nApart from its organisational function as the seat of the bishop, and the meeting place for the chapter of the diocese, the cathedral has a liturgical function in offering daily church services. Most cathedrals have at least three services of worship every day, often taking the form of matins, Holy Communion and an evening service which is often sung by the precentor and choir. There are often additional services on Sunday. Cathedrals generally have an area dedicated to the performance of choral services and with seating specifically for the choir and dignitaries of the church and town. This part of the building is called the Choir or Quire, and is generally located between the sanctuary and the nave. Because music often plays an important part in the performance of the liturgy, cathedrals generally have a pipe organ to accompany the choir.\nCathedrals always have a font or water basin at which the rite of baptism is performed, in which a person is formally accepted into the Christian church. The font is often placed towards the door because the Baptism signifies entry into the community of the church. In some cathedrals, most particularly in Italy, the rite of baptism is performed in a separate building. One of the functions of the cathedral is the reading and expounding upon the Holy Scripture. The cathedral generally has a lectern from which the scripture is read. This often takes the form of an eagle of brass or carved wood which supports the book on its outstretched wings and is the symbol of John the Evangelist. However, some cathedrals retain elaborate medieval structures on either side of the church, one for the reading of the Gospel and the other for the reading of the Epistle.\nThe function of expounding on the scriptures is traditionally performed from the pulpit, which is generally constructed in such a way that the voice of the preacher is projected out to the congregation. The pulpit is often decorated with the winged figures of a man, a lion, a bull and an eagle, representing the Gospel writers, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.\nThe services that are held within the cathedral follow an annual cycle. The designated scriptural readings for each day of the church's year establish a pattern that alternates periods of introspection and penitence with periods of celebration, and is punctuated by the two great celebrations of Christmas and Easter.\nMany cathedrals are places of pilgrimage to which people travel in order to worship or venerate a holy object or the reliquary of a saint. Many cathedrals are regarded as places that have provided rewarding religious experiences, where prayers have been answered or miracles have taken place. Pilgrimage was particularly popular in the late medieval period. Some cathedrals such as Santiago de Compostela continue to attract pilgrims.\nCivic and social functions.\nThe formal cathedral services are linked to the cycle of the year and respond to the seasons of the Northern Hemisphere, Christmas falling in the winter and Easter in the spring. Cathedrals often hold a service of thanksgiving called Harvest Festival in the autumn.\nBirths, marriages and deaths are often celebrated by services at cathedrals and the cathedral often acts as a repository of local history by recording these events. The cathedral marks times of national and local civic celebration and sadness with special services. The funerals of those famous within the community are invariably held at cathedrals. People who have served the community or the church are often buried within the cathedral with which they are associated. Alternatively, they may be commemorated by a memorial. Some cathedrals, such as Aachen and Reims are the traditional coronation places of monarchs.\nAnother civic function of the cathedral is the imparting of significant civil information. Announcements may be to the populace from the steps of the cathedral, or within the cathedral itself.\nMost cathedrals have a bell or bells. These are used to announce that a service is soon to take place. They are also used to convey information and celebration. The ringing of peals signifies a time of rejoicing, such as a wedding. An extended ringing of peals or \"changes\" conveys a time of great civic celebration. The slow tolling of the deepest bell signifies a death or disaster. Many cathedrals have a clock with associated chimes that announce the time. The bells of a cathedral are traditionally used to signal the outbreak and the ending of war.\nCathedrals are often associated with significant secular organisations such as the office of the local mayor and council, the local court, the local regiment, schools, sporting organisations and service clubs. The cathedral often has its own school, primarily for the education of choristers, but often including other children as well.\nThe cathedral, often being a large building, serves as a meeting place for many people. The cathedral often forms a centre of different activities related to community service, youth activities, study, music and decorative arts.\nBuildings.\nCathedral buildings, especially those dating from the Medieval period, are frequently the grandest of churches in the diocese (and country). The ancient cathedrals of England, of Northern France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Sicily, the Baroque cathedrals of South America, and many individual cathedrals from Italy and other parts of Europe, are among the largest and finest religious buildings. Many are renowned for their architecture or their decorative features such as sculpture, stained glass and frescos.\nWhile cathedral buildings, in general, tend to be large, size and grandeur have rarely been essential requirements. Early Celtic and Saxon cathedrals tended to be of diminutive size, as is the Byzantine so-called \"Little Metropole Cathedral\" of Athens. In Italy, with a few notable exceptions such as Florence Cathedral and Milan Cathedral, cathedrals are numerous and are often similar in form and size to monastic or large parish churches. In modern times, where functionality is the foremost consideration and where church attendance is low in many countries, a cathedral church may be a modest structure.\nCathedrals of monastic foundation, and some of secular clergy, have cloisters, which traditionally provided an open area where secular activities took place protected from wind and rain. Some cathedrals also have a chapter house where the chapter could meet. In England, where these buildings have survived, they are often octagonal. A cathedral may front onto the main square of a town, as in Florence, or it may be set in a walled \"close\" as at Canterbury. There may be a number of associated monastic or clergy buildings, a bishop's palace and often a school to educate the choristers.\nArtworks, treasures and tourism.\nMany cathedral buildings are very famous for their architecture and have local and national significance, both artistically and historically. Many are listed among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nMany cathedrals, because of their large size and the fact that they often have towers, spires or domes, have until the 20th century, been the major landmarks in cities or in views across the countryside. With highrise building, civil action has been taken in some cases, such as Cologne Cathedral to prevent the vista of the cathedral from being spoiled.\nBecause many cathedrals took centuries to build and decorate, they constitute a major artistic investment for the city in which they stand. Not only may the building itself be architecturally significant, but the church often houses treasures such as stained glass, stone and wood statues, historic tombs, richly carved furniture and objects of both artistic and religious significance such as reliquaries. Moreover, the cathedral often plays a major role in telling the story of the town, through its plaques, inscriptions, tombs, stained glass and paintings.\nFor these reasons, tourists have travelled to cathedrals for hundreds of years. Many cathedrals cater for tourists by charging a fee to any visitors outside service times or requesting a donation or making a charge to take photos. Cathedrals that are particularly popular tourist venues sometimes provide guides, leaflets, souvenirs and cafes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45884", "revid": "47338540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45884", "title": "Leeuwarden", "text": "Leeuwarden (; ; ; ) is a city and municipality in Friesland, Netherlands, with a population of 127,073 (2023). It is the provincial capital and seat of the Provincial Council of Friesland.\nThe region has been continuously inhabited since the 10th century. It came to be known as Leeuwarden in the early 9th century AD and was granted city privileges in 1435. It is the main economic hub of Friesland, situated in a green and water-rich environment. Leeuwarden is a former royal residence and has a historic city centre, many historically relevant buildings, and a large shopping centre with squares and restaurants. Leeuwarden was awarded the title European Capital of Culture for 2018. Also, Leeuwarden has been a UNESCO City of Literature since 2019.\nThe (Eleven Cities Tour), an ice skating tour passing the eleven cities of Friesland, starts and finishes in Leeuwarden.\nThe following towns and villages within the municipality have populations in excess of 1,000 people: Leeuwarden, Stiens, Grou, Goutum, Wergea, Jirnsum, Reduzum, and Wirdum. The municipality is governed by the mayor Sybrand van Haersma Buma and a coalition of the Labour Party, Christian Democratic Appeal, and GreenLeft.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Leeuwarden\" (or older variants of it) first came into use for , the most important of the three villages (the other two being and ) which in the early 9th century merged into Leeuwarden (Villa Lintarwrde c.\u00a0825). There is much uncertainty about the origin of the city's name. Historian and archivist summed up a total of over 200 different spelling variants, of which \"Leeuwarden\" (Dutch), \"Liwwadden\" (Stadsfries), and \"Ljouwert\" (West Frisian) are still in use.\nThe second part of the name is easily explained: \"Warden\", West Frisian/Dutch/Low German for an artificial dwelling-hill, is a designation of terps, reflecting the historical situation.\nThe first part of the name, \"leeuw\", means lion in modern standard Dutch. This interpretation corresponds with the coat of arms adopted by the city, canting arms featuring a heraldic lion. However, modern standard Dutch was not used in this region in the Middle Ages, when the city was called \"Lintarwrde\". Some scholars argue that the name of the city is derived from \"leeu-\", a corruption of \"luw-\" (Dutch for 'sheltered from the wind', cf. the maritime term leeward) or from \"lee-\" (a Dutch word for waterway). 'Sheltered landing place or harbour' could be the original meaning. This suits the watery province of Friesland and the position of the original three villages at the end of an important estuary called Middelzee.\nThe name is also similar to that of the French commune Lewarde, located in the Nord Department, an originally Flemish-speaking area annexed to France in the 17th century. Western Flemish was related to Frisian and also to Saxon up to the 11th century.\nHistory.\nThe oldest remains of houses date back to the 2nd century AD in the Roman era and were discovered during an excavation near the Oldehove. Inhabited continuously since the 10th century, the city's first reference as a population centre is in German sources from 1285, and records exist of city privileges granted in 1435. Situated along the Middelzee, it was an active centre of maritime trade. The waterway silted-up in the 13th century.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Grote or Jacobijnerkerk () is the oldest building in the city. The 15th century was the period of the two opposing Frisian factional parties Vetkopers and Schieringers. The bastions and a moat were built in the period 1481\u20131494. In 1747 William IV, Prince of Orange was the last stadtholder residing in the Stadhouderlijk Hof. In the first half of the 19th century the fortifications were demolished.\nFrom 1580 to 1752, a provincial mint operated in the city, minting gold, silver and copper coins of Friesland.\nThe Jewish community of Leeuwarden was one of the earliest in the Netherlands aside from Amsterdam, and was first mentioned in 1645. By 1670, the city council granted a man referred to as \"Jacob the Jew\" (in Dutch) permission to build a Jewish cemetery, meaning that there were enough Jews living there to require a cemetery and other communal institutions. Land for 'The Jodenkerkhof' (Jews' cemetery) was purchased in 1679, near the Oldehove tower.\nThe first synagogue in the city was built in the 17th century, and was also used by the city's Catholics who were not allowed to build a house of worship of their own because of the Protestant city authorities. The Jewish community enjoyed generally good relations with authorities in the 18th century and continued to expand throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak population of 1,236 in 1860.\nIn 1901 the city's population was 32,203.\nLeeuwarden, like the rest of the Netherlands, was occupied by German forces in 1940\u20131945. This ended when elements of the Royal Canadian Dragoons seized the initiative and advanced into the heavily-defended city on 15 April 1945, ignoring direct orders to wait for supporting infantry. German forces had been driven out by the end of the next day. (The anniversary is marked by both the Dragoons and the city, by flying each other's flags every 15 April.)\n\"Kneppelfreed\" () was an incident on 16 November 1951 in front of the courthouse at Wilhelminaplein (Wilhelmina Square), when the police used batons against Frisian language activists during a protest against the exclusive use of Dutch in the courts. A committee of inquiry recommended that the Frisian language should receive legal status as a minority language.\nOn 19 October 2013, a fire broke out in a clothes shop on a busy pedestrian street. The fire started late in the afternoon and burned through the night, destroying five shops and eleven flats. The only casualty was a 24-year-old man who was living in one of the flats. The birthplace of Mata Hari was at first thought to be destroyed, but survived, albeit with considerable smoke and water damage.\nHeraldry.\nThe coat of arms of Leeuwarden is the official symbol of the municipality. It consists of a blue escutcheon, a golden lion, and a crown. The fact that Leeuwarden carries a lion in its seal seems logical, considering that \"Leeuw\" is Dutch for \"Lion\". However, it is very plausible the oldest name of the city conceals an indication of water rather than an animal, and some sources suggest that the lion may have only been added after the name became official. It is also possible the coat of arms was a gift to the city from the powerful \"Minnema\" family.\nGeography.\nLeeuwarden is located centrally in Friesland. The military Leeuwarden Air Base lies northwest of the city. East of the city lies recreational area and nature reserve \"De Groene Ster\". It contains the windmill Himriksmole, a golf course and \"AquaZoo Friesland\".\nPopulation centres.\nOn 1 January 2014 parts of the neighbouring Boarnsterhim municipality were added to Leeuwarden. On 1 January 2018 it was enlarged by Leeuwarderadeel and parts of former municipality of Littenseradiel.\nHamlets.\nThe hamlets within the municipality are: Abbenwier, Angwier, Baarderbuorren, Bartlehiem (partially), De Him, De Hoek, De Trije Romers, Domwier, Finsterbuorren, F\u00fbns, Groote Bontekoe, Goatum, Hesens, Hoarne, Hoptille, It Hofl\u00e2n, It Wiel, Marwert, Midsbuorren, Narderbuorren, Noardein, Oude Schouw (partially), Poelhuzen, Rewert (partially), Skillaerd, Skrins, Suderbuorren, Suorein, Tichelwurk, Truerd, Tsienzerbuorren, Tsjaard, Tsjeintgum, Vierhuis, Vrouwbuurtstermolen (partially), Wammert and Wieuwens\nDemographics.\nAs of 2020, Leeuwarden had a total population of 124,084.\nCulture.\nMuseums.\nMuseums in the city of Leeuwarden: \nArchitecture.\nThere are over 800 Rijksmonuments (national heritage sites) in the municipality of Leeuwarden. The Oldehove, a leaning unfinished church tower, is a symbol of the city. Other well-known buildings in the city centre include the \"Kanselarij\" (former chancellery), the Stadhouderlijk Hof (former residence of the stadtholders of Friesland), the city hall (1715), the \"Waag\" (old weigh house), the Saint Boniface church (an important part of the neogothic movement) and the \"Centraal Apotheek\", a pharmacy in the Art Nouveau style. The \"Blokhuispoort\" is a former prison that has been transformed into a public library, hostel and restaurant.\nThe \"Froskep\u00f4lemolen\" (built in 1896), is the last surviving windmill to have stood in Leeuwarden. The remains of the \"Cammingha-Buurstermolen\" were demolished in 2000. The Slauerhoffbrug is a fully automatic bascule bridge named after the poet Jan Jacob Slauerhoff. It uses two arms to swing a section of road in and out of place within the road itself. This movable bridge is also known as the 'Flying' Drawbridge.\nThe tallest building in the city is the Achmeatoren (Achmea insurance tower), built in 2001 and designed by Abe Bonnema \u2013 who also designed the second-tallest building, Averotoren at .\nCultural events and festivals.\nOn 6 September 2013 Leeuwarden was voted European Capital of Culture for the year 2018. Many events were organised throughout the year. The largest art project was the \"11Fountains\", fountains in the Frisian eleven cities. The \"Love Fountain\", located in front of the train station, was designed by artist Jaume Plensa. The fountain is seven metres high and consists of two white heads of a boy and a girl, their eyes closed and dreaming.\nAnnual music festivals are \"Cityrock\", \"Dancetour\", \"Welcome To The Village\", \"Into the Grave\", \"Explore the North\" and \"Fries straatfestival\". Other festivals are \"Noordelijk Film Festival\" (an event for film makers), photofestival \"Noorderlicht\" and the \"Media Art festival\". Other events are \"Racing Expo\" and a large flower market (held on Ascension Day). There is also a weekly cattle market.\nTransport.\nLeeuwarden railway station (opened on 27 October 1863) is the main railway station of Leeuwarden. It is a terminus station of the NS railway line from Zwolle. Regional trains, served by Arriva, operate to Groningen in the east, Harlingen in the west and Stavoren in the southwest. The other stations in the municipality are Leeuwarden Camminghaburen, and Grou-Jirnsum. A fourth station Leeuwarden Werpsterhoeke was planned to be opened after 2018.\nNear the train station is the bus station. Qbuzz runs several city, regional and national buses. Route 66 Leeuwarden-Holwerd connects with the ferry to Ameland, bus route 50 to Lauwersoog connects with the departures of the ferry to Schiermonnikoog and route 350 via the Afsluitdijk connects to Alkmaar in North Holland.\nThe motorway A31 passes Leeuwarden and the A32 connects Leeuwarden to Meppel. The Van Harinxmakanaal is a major canal and connects Harlingen to Leeuwarden.\nEducation.\nLeeuwarden has a number of respected schools of applied science (HBO in Dutch), (21,480 students in 2017), such as the Van Hall Instituut (agricultural and life sciences) and the NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences (hotel management, economical and media management). In addition to higher education, the city is also home to three regional vocational schools (MBO): the Friese Poort, Friesland College, and Nordwin College.\nAlthough the city has no university of its own, several satellite campuses are located here, including \"Campus Frysl\u00e2n\" (University of Groningen), \"Dairy Campus\" (Wageningen University and Research) and the \"Academie voor Popkultuur\" (Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen) \nTechnological Top Institute Wetsus does research into water-related technologies. Centre of Expertise Water Technology (CEW) is the knowledge and innovation centre for applied research and product development in the field of water technology and the Wadden Academy to study and research the Wadden Sea.\nEconomy.\nAmong the 10 largest employers in Leeuwarden are Medical Center Leeuwarden (MCL), ING, The Central Judicial Collection Agency (CJIB), Achmea, NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences, Leeuwarden Air Base and FrieslandCampina. WTC Expo is the largest events complex in the Northern Netherlands.\nSports.\nThe city's local football team, SC Cambuur, are playing in the second tier Eerste Divisie. Their home ground is the Kooi Stadion, which has a capacity of 15,000. The city's basketball team, Aris Leeuwarden, has played in the Dutch Basketball League since 2004.\nThe \"Elfstedenhal\" is a sport venue. The stadium is used for long track speed skating, short track speed skating, ice hockey, figure skating and curling. The 400m indoor speed skating oval is named after speed skater Atje Keulen-Deelstra. The ice hockey club is \"IJshockeyclub Capitals Leeuwarden\" (IJCCL).\nLeeuwarden is the starting and finishing point for the celebrated , a speed skating race over the Frisian waterways that is held when winter conditions in the province allow. As of 2018,[ [update]] it last took place in January 1997, preceded by the races of 1986 and 1985. In 1986, the Dutch king Willem-Alexander participated in the Eleven cities tour, with the pseudonym W.A. van Buren, which is the pseudonym of the royal family of the Netherlands.\n\"Loop Leeuwarden\" is an annual road running competition (5\u00a0km, 10\u00a0km and half marathon races). The race was first held in 1985 and takes place in May. It attracts amateur runners. The city of Leeuwarden has two sailing boats (sk\u00fbtsje) racing in the yearly sailing competition Sk\u00fbtsjesilen.\nLeeuwarden was to be the host of the World Flying Disc Federation 2020 World Ultimate and Guts Championships from the 11th to the 18th of July. The event was expected to have over 2500 athletes from 40 countries. The event was cancelled (COVID-19 pandemic).\nMedia.\nThe Leeuwarder Courant and Friesch Dagblad are daily newspapers mainly written in Dutch (published by the NDC Mediagroep). Omrop Frysl\u00e2n is a public broadcaster with radio and TV programs mainly in Frisian.\nPolitics.\nIn the Netherlands, a municipality is governed by the college of mayor and aldermen and the municipal council. Sybrand van Haersma Buma of the CDA has been mayor of Leeuwarden since 26 August 2019. Since the 2014 municipal elections, the Labour Party (3 aldermen), Christian Democratic Appeal (2 aldermen), PAL GroenLinks (1 alderman) form a coalition. The municipal council of Leeuwarden has 39 seats.\nAs provincial capital, Leeuwarden is also the seat of the King's Commissioner Arno Brok and the Provincial Council of Friesland.\nInternational relations.\nThe city of Leeuwarden is twinned with \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For a positive integer formula_2, if a composite integer formula_7 divides formula_8 then formula_7 is called a Fermat pseudoprime to base formula_2. \nIn other words, a composite integer is a Fermat pseudoprime to base formula_2 if it successfully passes the Fermat primality test for the base formula_2. The false statement that all numbers that pass the Fermat primality test for base 2 are prime is called the Chinese hypothesis.\nThe smallest base-2 Fermat pseudoprime is 341. It is not a prime, since it equals 11\u00b731, but it satisfies Fermat's little theorem: formula_13 and thus passes the\nFermat primality test for the base 2.\nPseudoprimes to base 2 are sometimes called Sarrus numbers, after P. F. Sarrus who discovered that 341 has this property, Poulet numbers, after P. Poulet who made a table of such numbers, or Fermatians (sequence in the OEIS).\nA Fermat pseudoprime is often called a pseudoprime, with the modifier Fermat being understood.\nAn integer formula_7 that is a Fermat pseudoprime for all values of formula_2 that are coprime to formula_7 is called a Carmichael number.\nProperties.\nDistribution.\nThere are infinitely many pseudoprimes to any given base formula_17. In 1904, Cipolla showed how to produce an infinite number of pseudoprimes to base formula_17: let formula_19 and let formula_20, where formula_1 is a prime number that does not divide formula_22. Then formula_23 is composite, and is a pseudoprime to base formula_2. For example, if formula_25 and formula_26, then formula_27, formula_28, and formula_29 is a pseudoprime to base formula_30.\nIn fact, there are infinitely many strong pseudoprimes to any base greater than 1 (see Theorem 1 of\n) and infinitely many Carmichael numbers, but they are comparatively rare. There are three pseudoprimes to base 2 below 1000, 245 below one million, and 21853 less than 25\u00b7109. There are 4842 strong pseudoprimes base 2 and 2163 Carmichael numbers below this limit (see Table 1 of ).\nStarting at 17\u00b7257, the product of consecutive Fermat numbers is a base-2 pseudoprime, and so are all Fermat composites and Mersenne composites.\nThe probability of a composite number n passing the Fermat test approaches zero for formula_31. Specifically, Kim and Pomerance showed the following: The probability that a random odd number formula_32 is a Fermat pseudoprime to a random base formula_33 is even, then formula_34 is a Fermat pseudoprime to the trivial base formula_35.\nIf composite formula_34 is odd, then formula_34 is a Fermat pseudoprime to the trivial bases formula_38.\nFor any composite formula_34, the \"number\" of distinct bases formula_40 modulo formula_34, for which formula_34 is a Fermat pseudoprime base formula_40, is\nformula_44\nwhere formula_45 are the distinct prime factors of formula_34. This includes the trivial bases.\nFor example, for formula_47, this product is formula_48. For formula_49, the smallest such nontrivial base is formula_50.\nEvery odd composite formula_34 is a Fermat pseudoprime to at least two nontrivial bases modulo formula_34 unless formula_34 is a power of 3.\nFor composite \"n\" &lt; 200, the following is a table of all bases \"b\" &lt; \"n\" which \"n\" is a Fermat pseudoprime. If a composite number \"n\" is not in the table (or \"n\" is in the sequence ), then \"n\" is a pseudoprime only to the trivial base 1 modulo \"n\".\nFor more information (\"n\" = 201 to 5000), see (Table of pseudoprimes 16\u20134999). Unlike the list above, that page excludes the bases 1 and \"n\"\u22121. When \"p\" is a prime, \"p\"2 is a Fermat pseudoprime to base \"b\" if and only if \"p\" is a Wieferich prime to base \"b\". For example, 10932 = 1194649 is a Fermat pseudoprime to base 2, and 112 = 121 is a Fermat pseudoprime to base 3.\nThe number of the values of \"b\" for \"n\" are (For \"n\" prime, the number of the values of \"b\" must be \"n\" \u2212 1, since all \"b\" satisfy the Fermat little theorem)\n1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 10, 1, 12, 1, 4, 1, 16, 1, 18, 1, 4, 1, 22, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, 28, 1, 30, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 36, 1, 4, 1, 40, 1, 42, 1, 8, 1, 46, 1, 6, 1, ...

For any given base \"b\", all Fermat pseudoprimes are weak pseudoprimes, and all weak pseudoprimes coprime to \"b\" are Fermat pseudoprimes. However, this definition also permits some pseudoprimes which are \"not\" coprime to \"b\". For example, the smallest even weak pseudoprime to base 2 is 161038 (see (sequence in the OEIS)).\nThe least weak pseudoprime to bases \"b\" = 1, 2, ... are:\n4, 341, 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 10, 4, 4, 14, 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 22, 4, 4, 9, 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 9, 4, 4, 38, 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 46, 4, 4, 10, ... OEIS:\u00a0\nCarmichael numbers are weak pseudoprimes to all bases, thus all terms in this list are less than or equal to the smallest Carmichael number, 561. Except for 561 = 3\u22c511\u22c517, only semiprimes can occur in the above sequence. Not all semiprimes less than 561 occur; a semiprime \"pq\" (\"p\" \u2264 \"q\") less than 561 occurs in the above sequences if and only if \"p\" \u2212 1 divides \"q\" \u2212 1 (see (sequence in the OEIS)). The least Fermat pseudoprime to base \"b\" (also not necessary exceeding \"b\") ((sequence in the OEIS)) is \"usually\" semiprime, but not always; the first counterexample is (648) = 385 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11.\nIf we require \"n\" &gt; \"b\", the least weak pseudoprimes (for \"b\" = 1, 2, ...) are:\n4, 341, 6, 6, 10, 10, 14, 9, 12, 15, 15, 22, 21, 15, 21, 20, 34, 25, 38, 21, 28, 33, 33, 25, 28, 27, 39, 36, 35, 49, 49, 33, 44, 35, 45, 42, 45, 39, 57, 52, 82, 66, 77, 45, 55, 69, 65, 49, 56, 51, ... OEIS:\u00a0\nEuler\u2013Jacobi pseudoprimes.\nAnother approach is to use more refined notions of pseudoprimality, e.g. strong pseudoprimes or Euler\u2013Jacobi pseudoprimes, for which there are no analogues of Carmichael numbers. This leads to probabilistic algorithms such as the Solovay\u2013Strassen primality test, the Baillie\u2013PSW primality test, and the Miller\u2013Rabin primality test, which produce what are known as industrial-grade primes. Industrial-grade primes are integers for which primality has not been \"certified\" (i.e. rigorously proven), but have undergone a test such as the Miller\u2013Rabin test which has nonzero, but arbitrarily low, probability of failure.\nApplications.\nThe rarity of such pseudoprimes has important practical implications. For example, public-key cryptography algorithms such as RSA require the ability to quickly find large primes. The usual algorithm to generate prime numbers is to generate random odd numbers and test them for primality. However, deterministic primality tests are slow. If the user is willing to tolerate an arbitrarily small chance that the number found is not a prime number but a pseudoprime, it is possible to use the much faster and simpler Fermat primality test.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1885 as the Michigan Mining School, the first post-secondary institution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nThe university comprises five colleges and schools: the College of Engineering, the College of Computing, the College of Sciences and Arts, the College of Business, and the College of Forest Resources and Environmental Science. They offer more than 140 degree programs to nearly 7,000 graduate and undergraduate students. Its main campus sits on on a bluff overlooking Portage Lake. The campus consists of 36 buildings, the first of which was built in 1908.\nMichigan Tech's athletic teams are nicknamed the Huskies and compete primarily in the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC). The men's hockey team competes in Division I as a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), and has won three national championships. The women's basketball team was national runners-up in 2011.\nMichigan Tech is classified as \"Research 1\" by the Carnegie Classification, the highest classification for research activity.\nHistory.\nMichigan Tech was founded in 1885 as the Michigan Mining School. After much agitation by Jay Abel Hubbell, the state legislature established the school to train mining engineers. Hubbell donated land for the school's first buildings.\nThe school started with four faculty members and twenty-three students. It was housed in the Houghton Fire Hall from 1886 through 1889.\nMTU's first president was Marshman E. Wadsworth (1887\u20131898). Enrollment grew to such a point that its name no longer reflected its purpose. The name was then changed to the Michigan College of Mines in 1897. This name lasted through World War I until 1925, but by this time the school had begun offering a wider variety of degrees and once again decided to change its name to the Michigan College of Mining and Technology in 1927.\nFred W. McNair (1899\u20131924) was the college's second president. By 1931, enrollment had reached nearly 600.\nUnder President Grover C. Dillman (1935\u20131956), the school underwent many notable changes, including the construction of the Memorial Union Building, the purchasing of an ice rink and a golf course as well as the procurement of the village of Alberta, Michigan.\nIn 1956, J. Robert Van Pelt became the new president of the university. He restarted many PhD programs and created a focus on research. This included the school's first analog computation class in 1956\u201357.\nIn 1964, one of the final years of his presidency, the school changed from a college to a university, changing its name a final time to Michigan Technological University. The change from the Michigan College of Mining and Technology was necessary for two reasons, according to Van Pelt. First, the college had expanded too greatly and the current name was no longer an accurate title. Also, including \"mining\" in the name of the college was misleading. The name \"Michigan Technological University\" was chosen in order to retain the nickname \"Michigan Tech\" that had already been in use since 1927. Along with its new name, the school also gained new constitutional status in 1964. This gave responsibility for control of the university to its Board of Control rather than the state legislature.\nThe university has historically been focused on engineering, and as of November 2022, 57% of students are enrolled in the College of Engineering. Michigan Tech offers a broad range of programs beyond engineering, with 149 undergraduate programs and 103 graduate programs offered.\nWomen at Michigan Tech.\nWomen began to attend classes at the Michigan College of Mines around 1890. The early female students were mostly daughters of professors or wealthy businessmen of the Houghton and Hancock area. They were allowed to take classes and were given special student status, which meant that they could be enrolled in courses, but were not able to receive a degree.\nThe first woman to receive a degree from the Michigan College of Mines was Margaret R. Holley, who was born in Lake Linden and who had received a liberal arts degree at a different university outside of the Upper Peninsula. She then moved back to Houghton to work on a chemistry degree, which she received in 1933. Two years later, she also received a master's degree in chemistry from the Michigan College of Mines.\nThe first female faculty member of the Michigan College of Mines was Ella Wood, who was hired as an assistant professor for the Humanities department in 1927. She was made an associate professor by 1928, a full professor by 1935, and the head of geography and languages by 1937. Professor Wood was hired by the university five years before women were allowed to pursue degrees. She also worked in the library and taught meteorology to assist with pilot training sessions to students during WWII. Her presence encouraged many young women to apply for special student status and take classes at the school and ultimately allowed women to receive degrees at this school. As co-ed enrollment increased, she promoted women involvement on campus and co-educational programs. She also became the academic advisor to all female students and thoroughly enjoyed the role of \"mother\" that she was able to play here to all of her students. Wood also held the title \"Dean of Women\", making her the first woman to receive the title dean at the university.\nMargaret Holley Chapman was the first woman to complete a degree program from Michigan College of Mining and Technology, which would become Michigan Technological University in 1964. She earned a Bachelor of Science in General Science in 1933, and another in chemistry the following year. Margaret went on to become a candidate for a master's degree in General Science. Not only was she the first woman to receive a degree from Michigan Tech, she was also the first female trustee and requested that a scholarship be established to help other female students to finance their education. The Margaret H. Chapman Endowed Scholarship is still active to this day.\nThe first woman to graduate with a degree in Chemical Engineering was Alice Runge in 1942. Following shortly behind was the first woman to graduate with High Honors in Metallurgical &amp; Materials Engineering, Lilian (Heikkinen) Beck, in 1947. She was also the first woman from Michigan Tech to be inducted into the Alpha Sigma Mu honorary fraternity of the International Metallurgical Society. One year later, Marian Ione (Smith) Scott was the first woman to earn a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.\nWomen in athletics.\nThe first female varsity athlete was Nada J. Fenton, who was a member of the rifle team during the 1950s. She was a graduate of Houghton High school and entered MTU in 1952. Nada holds the record of being the first woman to ever fire on a varsity rifle team in the world.\nToday Michigan Tech has seven women's varsity sports including basketball, cross country, Nordic skiing, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and soccer.\nToday.\nAs of the fall semester in 2021, the total enrollment at Michigan Technological University is 6,977. Of those students, 2,054 of them were women (an all-time high), which means female students make up about 29% of the enrollment at Michigan Tech.\nCampus.\nThe main Michigan Tech campus is mainly situated on US-41 in Houghton. The main part of campus can be traversed in about 10 minutes. The Lakeshore Center in downtown Houghton houses the offices of Human Relations, Vice President for Research, and other departments.\nFaculty are involved in several distance education programs with clients including General Motors.\nThe Portage Lake Golf Course opened for play in April 1902. In 1945, the members could no longer support the needs of the course and sold it to Michigan Tech for one dollar. Since then, many improvements have been made such as the addition of another nine holes in 1969. In 1984, the new clubhouse was constructed. In 1996, a sprinkler system was installed to modernize the course and keep it playable. The Portage Lake Golf Course is located two miles (3\u00a0km) southeast of campus. With 18 holes on 160 acres, it offers two nines of distinctly different flavors and challenges.\nMont Ripley is the oldest ski area in Michigan (established in the 1900s) in the snowiest city in the Midwest. It is also university-owned, so Michigan Tech students ski or snowboard for free. Mont Ripley has twenty-two trails, a terrain park, a tubing park, sits on 112 acres, and has a scenic overlook of the Keweenaw Waterway. It is about two miles from campus; the hill is viewable from most campus buildings. In 2019, Michigan Tech's Mont Ripley earned the university a No. 13 rating on College Census' 25 Best Colleges for Skiing and Snowboarding list.\nThe Michigan Tech Trails, commonly referred to as Tech Trails, is a year-round trail system owned by Michigan Tech. It originally started as a simple path through the woods until 2001, when Michigan Tech implemented a plan to develop the trails as a way to secure funding for the Michigan Tech Varsity Nordic skiing program and to create facility to attract outdoor-loving students. The Michigan Tech College of Forest Resources and Environmental Science proposed that revenue could be generated from timber harvesting to support the team and upgrade the trails. The university's cross country ski trail system is located near the Student Development Complex in the Michigan Tech Recreational Forest. It includes 33\u00a0km of groomed cross country ski trails (both classic and skate sections) and 11.7\u00a0km of groomed snowshoe/bike trails. 7.5\u00a0km of the trail is lighted. The Tech Trails are nationally recognized for the quality of skiing, consistency of grooming and variety of terrain. The trail system, with the help of hundreds of volunteers, hosted the US Junior National Championships, U.S. Senior National championships, and the 2023 US Cross Country Ski Championships along with regional races. With Houghton's average snowfall of 218 inches, the season usually opens in early December and continues into April. Students ski free; community members can purchase a pass.\nThe Ford Center is a historical village that once owned and operated as a sawmill by Henry Ford located 40 miles south of Michigan Tech's main campus in Alberta, Michigan. The Ford Motor Company donated the Ford Center to Michigan Tech in the 1950s. Since 1954, the Ford Center has been an outdoor and environmental education center utilized by Michigan Tech students enrolled in forestry, ecology, wildlife ecology, and natural resource management. Referred to as \"Fall Camp\" by the students, this center boasts 4906 acres of forest and wetlands where the students attend outdoor classes. The center also contains several buildings that the students use for their dormitory, recreation and indoor classes. The Ford Motor Company gave Michigan Tech a grant in 1996 to turn the sawmill into a museum. The museum is open to the public as well as the center itself for holding conferences and reunions.\nAcademics.\nUndergraduate admissions.\nUndergraduate admission to Michigan Tech is considered \"selective\" by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\". For the Class of 2025 (enrolling Fall 2021), Michigan Tech received 8,041 applications and accepted 6,895 (85.7%), with 1,479 enrolling. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolling freshmen was 1138\u20131320. The middle 50% ACT composite score range was 25\u201331. The average overall ACT scores for incoming students is 27.2 in fall 2017, compared to 21.2 nationally.\nDivisions.\nMichigan Tech offers more than 120 undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering, natural and physical sciences, computing, business and economics, technology, environmental studies, arts, humanities, and social sciences. Home to the first college of computing in the state of Michigan, the university is divided into five colleges: Business; Computing; Engineering; Forest Resources and Environmental Science; and Sciences and Arts.\nMichigan Tech's Enterprise Program provides students with real-world design, engineering, and entrepreneurial experiences. Enterprises develop engineering skills by allowing students to work in businesslike environments on real-world projects while completing their education. Enterprises include Open Source Technologies, Nanotechnology Innovations, Hybrid Transportation, Aerospace, Blue Marble Security, Husky Game Development, Boardsports Technologies, and Wireless Communications Enterprises.\nIts three most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021\u201322 graduates, were Mechanical Engineering (266), Electrical Engineering (93), and Chemical Engineering (88).\nRankings.\nIn their 2024 rankings, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) ranked over 248 schools and surveyed a total of 55,102 students, with Michigan Technological University achieving the top ranking for academic freedom and viewpoint tolerance.\nIn 2024, \"Washington Monthly\" ranked Michigan Tech 90th among 438 national universities in the U.S. based on Michigan Tech's contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.\nResearch.\nMichigan Tech ranked 172nd of 600 US colleges and universities in research and development expenditures in 2007. Research expenditures exceeded $81 million in the 2021\u201322 school year.\nThe university has 16 research centers and institutes and 271,962 square feet of research space and labs.\nThere are 12 research areas including Space Sciences, Electronics, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Ocean Sciences, and Robotics. There are 18 research centers on and off campus including the Michigan Tech Research Institute.\nStudent body.\nIn the 2023\u20132024 academic year, 68% of Michigan Technological University students were from the state of Michigan, 22% were from other states in the US, and 10% were from other countries. The first to second year retention rate for first-time students was 84.5% and the six-year graduation rate was 72.2%. The student to faculty ratio was 13:1. In the fall of 2021, the university enrolled its largest freshman class since 1982.\nThe student body consisted of 7,324 students, including 1,421 graduate students and 473 faculty members. In 2017, Michigan Tech students were primarily from Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois.\nOrganization and administration.\nThe university is governed by an eight-member board of trustees whose members are appointed by the governor of Michigan and confirmed by the Michigan Senate.\nStudent organizations.\nMichigan Tech currently recognizes more than two hundred student organizations.\nGreek life.\nMichigan Tech is currently host to twelve fraternities and seven sororities on campus.\nAthletics.\nAs the school mascot is the husky (specifically, Blizzard T. Husky), the school's sports teams are known as the Huskies. Michigan Tech competes primarily in the NCAA's Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC), while the men's hockey team competes in Division I as a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). Michigan Tech owns a downhill skiing/snowboarding hill, Mont Ripley, just across Portage Lake from campus, and maintains extensive cross-country skiing trails (used for mountain biking in summer).\nSchool songs.\nMichigan Tech has both an official fight song and an official Alma Mater. At most sporting events, however, both the \"Engineer's Song\" and \"In Heaven There Is No Beer\" are played by the Huskies Pep Band.\nHuskies Pep Band.\nThe Huskies Pep Band is the university's scramble band. The Huskies Pep Band performs at all home football, basketball, volleyball, and ice hockey games, as well as parades and other local events. The band is often recognized as one of the best bands in NCAA Division 1 hockey because of their sheer power and energy, and their firm roots in tradition. The band was formed in the fall of 1928 as the Michigan Tech ROTC Band, under the baton of E. E. Melville.\nThey are known for performing traditional songs such as \"In Heaven There Is No Beer\" and \"The Engineers\" along with a variety of selections in popular music. Some cheers and songs have been around since the 1930s and '40s, such as the \"Blue Skirt Waltz\" in which the pep band (along with the audience) would link arms and sway back and forth. This tradition began during Winter Carnival in 1948 after Frankie Yankovic had recently performed there and has been since dubbed \"The Copper Country Anthem.\" Some of the antics of the band are considered Monty Python-esque, often performing songs from the sketches themselves and shouting the phrase \"Run away!\" when they exit from the performance. The band also incorporates other non-traditional ensemble instruments, including electric bass guitar, bagpipes, kazoos, cowbells, accordions, an electric viola, a toaster, an oven, and at one point a large inflatable lobster.\nTraditions.\nFrom 1976 to 2017 this fair was held at Mclain State Park. This halted after severe weather damage in June 2018. \"K-Day\" has been held at Chassell Centennial Park in Chassell, MI since then with the exception of 2020 because of COVID. \nRecords.\nMichigan Tech holds a world record, the largest snowball (21' 3\" circumference), which they accomplished in 2006, as verified by \"Guinness World Records\" officials.\nThey originally held three world records, the third of which was the largest snowball fight (3,745) and most people making snow angels simultaneously in a single venue (3,784). This latter was taken from the city of Bismarck, North Dakota, but about a year later, Bismarck took the record back with 8,962 snow angels.\nIn 2018, students and community members unofficially broke the world record for most snowmen in one hour (2,228).\nNotable people.\nFaculty.\nAs of 2025, Michigan Tech has 495 faculty. Notable faculty include: Elias C. Aifantis, Stephen Bowen, Margaret Burnett, Robert Schneider, Kathy Halvorsen, Lyon Bradley King, Nancy Langston, Robert J. Nemiroff, Joseph Rallo, Donald Shell, Martha E. Sloan, David R. Shonnard, and Svitlana Winnikow.\nAlumni.\nThere are over 79,000 Michigan Tech alumni living in all 50 states and over 100 countries. Some notable alumni include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45896", "revid": "47545712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45896", "title": "The Stranger (Camus novel)", "text": "1942 French novella by Albert Camus\nThe Stranger ( , lit.\u2009'The Foreigner'), also published in English as The Outsider, is a 1942 novella written by French author Albert Camus. The first of Camus' novels to be published, the story follows Meursault, an indifferent settler in French Algeria, who, weeks after his mother's funeral, kills an unnamed Arab man in Algiers. The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault's first-person narrative before and after the killing.\nCamus completed the initial manuscript by May 1941, with revisions suggested by Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Jean Paulhan, and Raymond Queneau that were adopted in the final version. The original French-language first edition of the novella was published on 19 May 1942, by Gallimard, under its original title; it appeared in bookstores from that June but was restricted to an initial 4,400 copies, so few that it could not be a bestseller. Even though it was published during the Nazi occupation of France, it went on sale without censorship or omission by the Propaganda-Staffel.\nIt began being published in English from 1946, first in the United Kingdom, where its title was changed to \"The Outsider\" to avoid confusion with the translation of Maria Kuncewiczowa's novel of the same name; after being published in the United States, the novella retained its original name, and the British-American difference in titles has persisted in subsequent editions. \"The Stranger\" gained popularity among anti-Nazi circles following its focus in Jean-Paul Sartre's 1947 article \"\" ('Analysis of \"The Stranger\"').\nConsidered a classic of 20th-century literature, \"The Stranger\" has received critical acclaim for Camus' philosophical outlook, absurdism, syntactic structure, and existentialism (despite Camus's rejection of the label), particularly within its final chapter. \"Le Monde\" ranked \"The Stranger\" as number one on its 100 Books of the 20th Century. In \"Le Temps\" it was voted the third best book written in French in the 20th and 21st century by a jury of 50 literary connoisseurs.\nThe novella has been adapted for film three times: \"Lo Straniero\" (1967) and \"Yazg\u0131\" (2001), has seen numerous references and homages in television and music (notably \"Killing an Arab\" by The Cure), and was retold from the perspective of the unnamed Arab man's brother in Kamel Daoud's 2013 novel \"The Meursault Investigation\". On August 26, 2025, a trailer for an adaptation directed by Fran\u00e7ois Ozon was released for a production starring Benjamin Voisin, Rebecca Marder, Pierre Lottin, Swann Arlaud, and Denis Lavant, set to premiere in competition at the 82nd Venice International Film Festival.\nPlot.\nPart 1.\nMeursault learns of the death of his mother, who has been living in an old age home in the country. He takes time off from work to attend her funeral but seems to show no signs of grief or mourning to the people around him. When asked if he wishes to view her body, he declines, and he smokes and drinks regular (white) coffee\u2014not the obligatory black coffee\u2014at the vigil held by the coffin the night before the burial with the caretaker.\nThe day after the funeral Meursault returns to Algiers and encounters Marie, a former secretary of his firm. The two become re-acquainted, swim together, and that evening watch a comedy film and begin to have an intimate relationship.\nOver the next few days, Meursault helps Raymond Sint\u00e8s\u2014a neighbor and friend who is rumored to be a pimp, but says he works in a warehouse\u2014to get revenge on a Moorish mistress who, Raymond suspects, has been accepting gifts and money from another man. Raymond asks Meursault to write a letter inviting the girl over to Raymond's apartment solely so that he can have sex with her and then spit in her face and throw her out. While listening to Raymond, Meursault is unfazed by any feelings of empathy, does not express concern that she would be emotionally hurt by this plan and agrees to write the letter.\nThe girl visits Raymond on a Sunday morning, and the police get involved when he beats her for slapping him after he tries to kick her out. He asks Meursault to testify that the girl had been unfaithful when he is called to the police station, and Meursault agrees. Ultimately, Raymond is let off with a warning.\nWhile this is going on, Meursault's boss asks him if he would like to work at a branch their firm is thinking about opening in Paris and Marie asks him if he wants to get married. In both cases, Meursault does not have strong feelings about the matter but is willing to move or get married if it will please the other party. Also, Salamano, Meursault's and Raymond's elderly neighbor, loses his abused and diseased dog and, despite outwardly maintaining his usual spiteful and uncaring attitude toward the creature, goes to Meursault for comfort and advice a few times. During one of these conversations, Salamano, who adopted the dog as a companion shortly after his wife's death, mentions that some neighbors had 'said nasty things' about Meursault after he sent his mother to a retirement home. Meursault is surprised to learn about this negative impression of his actions.\nOne weekend, Raymond invites Meursault and Marie to a friend's beach cabin. There they see the brother of Raymond's spurned mistress along with another Arab, who Raymond has mentioned have been following him around recently. The Arabs confront Raymond and Meursault, and the brother wounds Raymond with a knife before running away. Later, Meursault walks back along the beach alone, armed with a revolver he took from Raymond to prevent him from acting rashly, and encounters the brother of Raymond's mistress. Disoriented and on the edge of heatstroke, Meursault shoots when the Arab flashes his knife at him. It is a fatal shot, but Meursault shoots the man four more times after a pause.\nPart 2.\nMeursault is incarcerated. His general detachment and ability to adapt to any external circumstance seem to make living in prison tolerable, especially after he gets used to the idea of being restricted and unable to have sex with Marie, though he does realize at one point that he has been unknowingly talking to himself for a number of days. For almost a year, he sleeps, looks out the small window of his cell, and mentally lists the objects in his old apartment while waiting for his day in court.\nMeursault never denies the murder he committed, so, at his trial, the prosecuting attorney focuses more on his inability or unwillingness to cry at his mother's funeral than on the details of the murder. He portrays Meursault's quietness and passivity as demonstrating his criminality and lack of remorse and denounces Meursault as a soulless monster who deserves to die for his crime. Although several of Meursault's friends testify on his behalf and his attorney tells him the sentence will likely be light, Meursault is sentenced to be publicly decapitated.\nPut in a new cell, Meursault obsesses over his impending doom and appeal and tries to imagine some way in which he can escape his fate. He refuses to see the prison chaplain, but one day the chaplain visits him anyway. Meursault says he does not believe in God and is not even interested in the subject, but the chaplain persists in trying to lead Meursault away from atheism (or, perhaps more precisely, apatheism). The chaplain believes Meursault's appeal will succeed in getting him released from prison, but says such an outcome will not rid him of his feelings of guilt or fix his relationship with God. Eventually, Meursault accosts the chaplain in a rage. He attacks the chaplain's worldview and patronizing attitude and asserts that, in confronting the certainty of the nearness of his death, he has had insights about life and death that he is confident are beyond those the chaplain possesses. He says that, although what we say or do or feel can cause our deaths to happen at different times or under different circumstances, none of those things can change the fact that we are all condemned to die one day, so nothing ultimately matters.\nAfter the chaplain leaves, Meursault finds some comfort in thinking about the parallels between his situation and how he thinks his mother must have felt when she was surrounded by death and slowly dying at the retirement home. Yelling at the chaplain had emptied him of all hope or thoughts of escape or a successful appeal, so he manages to open his heart 'to the benign indifference of the universe' and decides that he has been, and still is, happy. His indifference to the universe makes him feel as if he belongs to it. He even hopes there will be a large, hateful crowd at his execution, which will bring everything to a consummate end.\nCritical analysis.\nIn his 1956 analysis of the novel, Carl Viggiani wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On the surface, \"L'\u00c9tranger\" gives the appearance of being an extremely simple though carefully planned and written book. In reality, it is a dense and rich creation, full of undiscovered meanings and formal qualities. It would take a book at least the length of the novel to make a complete analysis of meaning and form and the correspondences of meaning and form, in \"L'\u00c9tranger\".\nVictor Brombert has analysed \"L'\u00c9tranger\" and Sartre's \"Explication de \"L'\u00c9tranger\"\" in the philosophical context of the Absurd. Louis Hudon dismissed the characterisation of \"L'\u00c9tranger\" as an existentialist novel in his 1960 analysis. The 1963 study by Ignace Feuerlicht begins with an examination of the themes of alienation, in the sense of Meursault being a 'stranger' in his society. In his 1970 analysis, Leo Bersani commented that \"L'\u00c9tranger\" is \"mediocre\" in its attempt to be a \"'profound' novel\", but describes the novel as an \"impressive if flawed exercise in a kind of writing promoted by the New Novelists of the 1950s\". Paul P. Somers Jr. has compared Camus's \"L'\u00c9tranger\" and Sartre's \"Nausea\", in light of Sartre's essay on Camus's novel. Sergei Hackel has explored parallels between \"L'\u00c9tranger\" and Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\".\nTerry Otten has studied in detail the relationship between Meursault and his mother. Gerald Morreale examines Meursault's killing of the Arab and the question of whether Meursault's action is an act of murder. Ernest Simon has examined the nature of Meursault's trial in \"L'\u00c9tranger\", with respect to earlier analysis by Richard Weisberg and jurist Richard A. Posner. Ren\u00e9 Girard has critiqued the relative nature of 'indifference' in the character of Meursault in relation to his surrounding society.\nKamel Daoud has written a novel \"The Meursault Investigation\" (2013/2014), first published in Algeria in 2013, and then republished in France to critical acclaim. This post-colonialist response to \"The Stranger\" counters Camus's version with elements from the perspective of the unnamed Arab victim's brother (naming him and presenting him as a real person who was mourned) and other protagonists. Daoud explores their subsequent lives following the withdrawal of French authorities and most pied-noirs from Algeria after the conclusion of the Algerian War of Independence in 1962.\nAs a depiction of autism.\nSome have noted that the actions and beliefs of the main character could be explained by autism. Meursault displays difficulties in communicating with others, sensory issues, difficulties in displaying emotions and difficulties in understanding the emotions of others. Although there was very limited knowledge of autism at the time, Camus based the main character on the behavior and attitude of a close friend, Pierre Galindo, who could be described as autistic. Thus it is possible that Camus unwittingly created the first description of autism in literature, and the actions and beliefs of the character should be re-examined.\nPublication history and English translations.\nOriginal French publication.\nOn 27 May 1941, Camus was informed about the changes suggested by Andr\u00e9 Malraux after he had read the manuscript and took his remarks into account. For instance, Malraux thought the minimalist syntactic structure was too repetitive. Some scenes and passages (the murder, the conversation with the chaplain) should also be revised.\nThe manuscript was then read by editors Jean Paulhan and Raymond Queneau. Gerhard Heller, a German editor, translator and lieutenant in the Wehrmacht working for the Censorship Bureau offered to help.\nThe original French-language novel was published in Paris on 19 May 1942 by Gallimard as \"L'\u00c9tranger\". The book started appearing in bookstores in June 1942, at a price of 25 francs. Only 4,400 copies of it were printed. As a marketing ploy, the title pages and rear wrappers were inscribed to give the false impression that there were eight different editions. At the time, Camus was suffering from a recurring bout of tuberculosis in Oran and could not travel to France and therefore could not keep with the French publishing tradition of presenting copies of his new book to journalists. He was also unable to read the first reviews published in newspapers or witness the distribution in bookstores. Upon publication, twenty copies were sent to him, but they never arrived and it was not until 17 June that Camus finally received a single copy. Camus was further diagnosed with tuberculosis in both lungs in July 1942 and left Algeria for Panelier, a village near Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in the mountains of south-central France.\nEnglish translations.\nIn 1946, the first English translation, by British author Stuart Gilbert, was published, based on the first French edition. For more than 30 years, Gilbert's version was the standard English translation. Gilbert's choice of title, \"The Stranger\", was changed by publisher Hamish Hamilton to \"The Outsider\", because it considered it \"more striking and appropriate\" and because Maria Kuncewiczowa's Polish-language novel \"Cudzoziemka\" had recently been published in London as \"The Stranger\". In the United States, Knopf had already typeset the manuscript using Gilbert's original title when informed of the name change and so disregarded it; the British\u2013American difference in titles has persisted in subsequent editions. Several scholars, including Helen Sebba, John E. Gale, and Eric Du Plessis, along with commentators such as James Campbell, have noted inaccuracies in the Stuart Gilbert translation and their resulting distortions of the tone of Camus' original French text in his English translation.\nIn 1982, the British publisher Hamish Hamilton, which had issued Gilbert's translation, published a translation by Joseph Laredo, also as \"The Outsider.\" Penguin Books bought this version in 1983 for a paperback edition.\nIn 1982, the American publisher University Press of America published a translation by Kate Griffith, titled \"The Stranger\".\nIn 1988, Vintage published a version in the United States with a translation by American Matthew Ward under the standard American title of \"The Stranger.\" Camus was influenced by American literary style, and Ward's translation expresses American usage and adheres more closely to Camus' original prose and tone.\nIn 2012, a translation by Sandra Smith was published by Penguin as \"The Outsider.\"\nDifference between translations.\nA critical difference among these translations is the expression of emotion in the sentence towards the close of the novel: \"I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe\" in Gilbert's translation, versus Laredo's \"I laid my heart open to the gentle indifference of the universe\" (original French: ; literally, \"the tender indifference of the world\"). The Penguin Classics 2000 reprint of Laredo's translation has \"gentle\" changed to \"benign\". Smith's 2012 translation uses the literal translation, \"tender\", stating in her Translator's Note that using \"benign\" \"fails to capture the paradoxical nuance of 'tender'\".\nThe ending lines differ as well: Gilbert translates 'on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration', which contrasts with Laredo's and Smith's translation of 'greet me with cries of hatred'. This passage describes a scene that would serve as a foil to the prior 'indifference of the world'. In French, the phrase is . Ward translates this as 'with cries of hate'. Gilbert juxtaposes 'execration' with 'execution'.\n is the opening sentence of the novel. English translations have rendered the first sentence as 'Mother died today', 'Maman died today', or a variant thereof. In 2012, Ryan Bloom argued that it should be translated as 'Today, Maman died'. He believes this better expresses the character of Meursault, as developed in the novel, as someone who 'lives for the moment', 'does not consciously dwell on the past', and 'does not worry about the future'.\nAdaptations.\nComics.\nJacques Ferrandez made the 2013 comic-book adaptation \"The Stranger\" for the 100th anniversary of Camus' birth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n\u2014the French version of the novella"}

Dick\nThe Man in the High Castle is an alternative history novel by Philip K. Dick, first published in 1962, which imagines a world in which the Axis powers won World War II. The story occurs in 1962, fifteen years after the end of the war in 1947, and depicts the life of several characters living under Imperial Japan or Nazi Germany as they rule a partitioned United States. The eponymous character is the mysterious author of a novel-within-the-novel entitled \"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\", a subversive alternative history of the war in which the Allied powers are victorious.\nDick's thematic inspirations include the alternative history of the American Civil War, \"Bring the Jubilee\" (1953), by Ward Moore, and the \"I Ching\", a Chinese book of divination that features in the story and the actions of the characters. \"The Man in the High Castle\" won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1963, and was adapted to television for Amazon Prime Video as \"The Man in the High Castle\" in 2015.\nSynopsis.\nBackground.\nIn the alternative history imagined in \"The Man in the High Castle\", Giuseppe Zangara assassinates President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, resulting in the continuation of the Great Depression and the policy of United States non-interventionism at the start of World War II in 1939. American inaction allows Nazi Germany to conquer and annex continental Europe and the Soviet Union into the Reich. The exterminations of the Jews, the Romani, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Slavs, and all other peoples whom the Nazis considered subhuman ensued. The Axis powers then jointly conquered Africa, and still compete for the control of South America in 1962. Imperial Japan won the war in the Pacific and invaded the West Coast of the United States, while Nazi Germany invaded the East Coast; the surrender of the Allies ended World War II in 1947.\nBy 1962, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany are the world's superpowers, fighting a geopolitical cold war over the world, and in particular over the former United States and South America. Japan extended the Co-Prosperity Pacific Alliance with the establishment of the Pacific States of America (PSA), with the politically neutral Rocky Mountain States acting as a buffer against the Nazi territory to the east. Nazi North America is composed of two countries: The South, and the northeastern part of the former contiguous United States of America, which is referred to as \"the U.S.\" in the book, both of which are ruled by collaborationist pro-Nazi puppet regimes. Canada remains an independent country.\nThe aged Adolf Hitler is incapacitated by tertiary syphilis, Martin Bormann is the acting Chancellor of Germany, and many high-ranking Nazi leaders\u2014Joseph Goebbels, Reinhard Heydrich, Hermann G\u00f6ring, and Arthur Seyss-Inquart\u2014still survive and vie to succeed Hitler as the \"F\u00fchrer\" of the Greater Germanic Reich. Technologically, the Nazis have drained the Mediterranean Sea for \"Lebensraum\" and farmland, developed and used the hydrogen bomb, developed rockets for traveling throughout the world and into outer space, and have undertaken colonization missions to the Moon and to the planets Venus and Mars.\nPlot.\nIn 1962, it has been fifteen years since Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany won World War II. In San Francisco, in the Pacific States of America, Japanese judicial racism has enslaved black people and reduced the Chinese residents to second-class citizens. Businessman Robert Childan owns an antique shop there that specializes in Americana for a Japanese clientele who is obsessed with cultural artifacts of the former United States. One day, Childan receives a request from Nobusuke Tagomi, a high-ranking trade official, who seeks a gift to impress a Swedish industrialist named Baynes. Childan cannot fulfill Tagomi's original request (a civil war recruiting poster) but is able to present alternatives because he is well-stocked with counterfeit antiques made by the metal works Wyndam-Matson Corporation.\nRecently fired from his job at a Wyndam-Matson factory, Frank Frink (formerly Fink) is a secret Jew and war veteran who agrees to join a former co-worker to start a business making and selling jewelry. In the Rocky Mountain States, Frank's ex-wife, Juliana Frink, works as a judo instructor in Canon City, Colorado and, in her private life, has begun a sexual relationship with Joe Cinnadella, an Italian truck driver and ex-soldier.\nFrink blackmails the Wyndam-Matson Corporation for money to finance his jewelry business, threatening to expose that they are supplying counterfeit antiques to Childan. Tagomi and Baynes meet, but Baynes repeatedly delays conducting any real business because he awaits a third party from Japan. The Nazi news media announce that Chancellor of Nazi Germany Martin Bormann has died after a short illness. Childan takes some of Frink's \"authentic metalwork\" jewelry on consignment to curry favor with a Japanese client, who, to Childan's surprise, says it possesses much \"Wu\", spiritual awareness. Juliana and Joe travel by road to Denver, Colorado, but en route Joe impulsively decides that they take a side trip to Cheyenne, Wyoming, to meet Hawthorne Abendsen, the mysterious author of \"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\", a novel of speculative fiction that presents an alternate history of World War II wherein the Allies defeat the Axis. The Nazis banned the book in the U.S., but the Japanese allow its publication and sale in the Pacific States of America. Supposedly, Abendsen lives in a heavily guarded estate named the High Castle. The Nazi news media inform the public that Joseph Goebbels is the new Chancellor of Nazi Germany.\nAfter much delay, Baynes and Tagomi meet their Japanese contact, while the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD), the security service of the SS, is close to arresting Baynes, who is a Nazi defector, Rudolf Wegener. Baynes warns his contact, a Japanese general, of the existence of Operation Dandelion, Goebbels's plan for a Nazi sneak attack upon the Japanese Home Islands, with the goal of destroying the Empire of Japan. Frink is exposed as a crypto-Jew and arrested by the San Francisco police. Elsewhere, two SD agents confront Baynes and Tagomi, who uses his antique American pistol to kill both agents. In Colorado, Joe changes his appearance and mannerisms before the side trip to the High Castle in Wyoming; Juliana infers that Joe intends to assassinate Abendsen. Joe reveals himself to be a Swiss Nazi when he confirms his intention; Juliana kills Joe and goes to warn Abendsen.\nWegener flies back to Germany and learns that Reinhard Heydrich (a member of the faction against Operation Dandelion) has launched a coup d'\u00e9tat against Goebbels, to install himself as Chancellor of Nazi Germany. Tagomi is shocked at having killed the SD agents and goes to the antiques shop to sell the pistol back to Childan; instead, sensing the spiritual energy from one of Frink's jewelry creations, Tagomi buys the jewelry. Tagomi then undergoes an intense spiritual experience during which he momentarily perceives an alternative version of San Francisco, evinced by the Embarcadero freeway, which he has never seen and by the fact that white people do not defer to Japanese people.\nTagomi later meets with the German consul in San Francisco and compels the Germans to free Frink, whom Tagomi has never met, by refusing to sign the order of extradition to Nazi Germany. Juliana has a spiritual experience when she arrives in Cheyenne. She discovers that Abendsen lives with his family in a normal house, having abandoned the High Castle because of a changed outlook on life; thus the possibility of being assassinated no longer worries him. After evading Juliana's questions about his literary inspiration, Abendsen says he used the \"I Ching\", a Chinese book of divination, to guide the writing of his novel. Before leaving, Juliana infers then that Truth wrote the novel to reveal the Inner Truth that Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany did lose World War II in 1945.\n\"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\".\nSeveral characters in \"The Man in the High Castle\" read the popular novel \"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\", by Hawthorne Abendsen, the title of which the readers presume derives from the Bible verse fragment: \"The grasshopper shall be a burden\" (). As an alternative history of the Second World War, wherein the Allies defeat the Axis Powers, the Nazi regime bans \"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\" in the South, whereas the Pacific States of America allow the publication and sale of the counterfactual novel.\n\"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\" postulates that President Roosevelt survives the 1933 assassination attempt but chooses not to seek re-election in 1940. The next president, Rexford Tugwell, moves the American Pacific Fleet from Pearl Harbor, saving it from attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy, which ensures that the country is better equipped to fight the war. Having retained most of their military-industrial capabilities, the United Kingdom contributes more to the Allied war effort, which facilitates the defeat of Erwin Rommel in the North African Campaign. The British fight the Axis armies through the Caucasus to join the Soviet Union and defeat the Nazis in the Battle of Stalingrad; the Kingdom of Italy reneges its membership in the Axis and betrays the Nazis; the British Army joins the Red Army in the Battle of Berlin, the decisive defeat of Nazi Germany. At war's end in 1945, Hitler and the Nazi leaders are tried as war criminals and are put to death, with Hitler's last words being \"Deutsche, hier steh' ich\" (\"Germans, here I stand\"), in imitation of Martin Luther.\nAfter the war, Tugwell promulgates the New Deal for the countries of the world, which finances a decade of rebuilding in China and the education of illiterate peoples in the undeveloped countries of Africa and Asia, who receive television sets by which they are taught to read and write, are instructed in digging wells and in purifying water. The New Deal financial assistance facilitates American businesses building factories in the undeveloped countries of Asia and Africa. American society is peaceful and harmonious and is at peace with the other countries of the world; the war ends the Soviet Union. Ten years after the war, still headed by Winston Churchill, the British Empire becomes militaristic, anti-American and establishes prison camps in India for Chinese subjects considered disloyal. Suspecting that the United States is sponsoring the anti-colonial subversion of British colonial rule in Asia, Churchill provokes a cold war for global hegemony; the geopolitical rivalry leads to an Anglo-American war won by the United Kingdom.\nInspirations.\nDick said that he imagined the story of \"The Man in the High Castle\" (1962) from his reading of the novel \"Bring the Jubilee\" (1953), by Ward Moore, which is an alternative history of the U.S. civil war won by the Confederacy. In the acknowledgements page of \"The Man in the High Castle\", Dick mentions the thematic influences of the popular history \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany\" (1960), by William L. Shirer; the biography \"\" (1952), by Alan Bullock; \"The Goebbels Diaries\" (1948); \"Foxes of the Desert\" (1960), by Paul Carrell; and the 1950 translation of the \"I Ching\", by Richard Wilhelm. As a novelist, Dick used the \"I Ching\" to craft the themes, plot and story of \"The Man in the High Castle\", whose characters also use the \"I Ching\" to inform and guide their decisions.\nDick cites the thematic influences of Japanese and Tibetan poetry upon the narrative of \"The Man in the High Castle\"; (i) The \"haiku\" in page 48 of the novel is from the first volume of the \"Anthology of Japanese Literature\" (1955), edited by Donald Keene; (ii) the \"waka\" poem in page 135 is from \"Zen and Japanese Culture\" (1955), by D. T. Suzuki and (iii) the Tibetan book of the dead, the \"Bardo Thodol\" (1960), edited by Walter Evans-Wentz and mentions the sociologic influences of the expressionist novella \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" (1933), by Nathanael West, in which an unhappy newspaper reporter pseudonymously writes the \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" advice column, through which he dispenses advice to emotionally forlorn readers during the Great Depression. Despite his job as Miss Lonelyhearts, the reporter seeks consolation in religion, sexual promiscuity, rural vacations and much work; no activity provides him with a sense of personal authenticity derived from his intellectual and emotional engagement with the world.\nReception.\nAvram Davidson praised the novel as a \"superior work of fiction\", citing Dick's use of the \"I Ching\" as \"fascinating\". Davidson concluded that \"It's all here\u2014extrapolation, suspense, action, art, philosophy, plot, [and] character\". \"The Man in the High Castle\" secured for Dick the 1963 Hugo Award for Best Novel. In a review of a paperback reprint of the novel, Robert Silverberg wrote in \"Amazing Stories\" magazine, \"Dick's prose crackles with excitement, his characters are vividly real, his plot is stunning\".\nIn \"The Religion of Science Fiction\", Frederick A. Kreuziger explores the theory of history implied by Dick's creation of the two alternative realities\nNeither of the two worlds, however, the revised version of the outcome of WWII nor the fictional account of our present world, is anywhere near similar to the world we are familiar with. But they could be! This is what the book is about. The book argues that this world, described twice, although differently each time, is exactly the world we know and are familiar with. Indeed, it is the only world we know: the world of chance, luck, fate.\nIn her introduction to the Folio Society edition of the novel, Ursula K. Le Guin writes that \"The Man in the High Castle\" \"may be the first, big lasting contribution science fiction made to American literature.\"\nAdaptations.\nAudiobook.\nAn unabridged \"The Man in the High Castle\" audiobook, read by George Guidall and running approximately 9.5 hours over seven audio cassettes, was released in 1997. Another unabridged audiobook version was released in 2008 by Blackstone Audio, read by Tom Wyner (credited as Tom Weiner) and running approximately 8.5 hours over seven CDs. A third unabridged audiobook recording was released in 2014 by Brilliance Audio, read by Jeff Cummings with a running time of 9 hours 58 minutes.\nTelevision.\nAfter a number of attempts to adapt the book to the screen, in October 2014, Amazon's film production unit began filming the pilot episode of \"The Man in the High Castle\" in Roslyn, Washington, for release through the Amazon Prime Video streaming service. The pilot episode was released by Amazon Studios on January 15, 2015, and was Amazon's \"most watched pilot ever\" according to Amazon Studios' vice president, Roy Price. On February 18, 2015, Amazon green-lit the series. The show became available for streaming on November 20, 2015.\nIncomplete sequel.\nIn a 1976 interview, Dick said he planned to write a sequel novel to \"The Man in the High Castle\": \"And so there's no real ending on it. I like to regard it as an open ending. It will segue into a sequel sometime.\" Dick said that he had \"started several times to write a sequel\" but progressed little, because he was too disturbed by his original research for \"The Man in the High Castle\" and could not mentally bear \"to go back and read about Nazis again\". He suggested that the sequel would be a collaboration with another author:Somebody would have to come in and help me do a sequel to it. Someone who had the stomach for the stamina to think along those lines, to get into the head; if you're going to start writing about Reinhard Heydrich, for instance, you have to get into his face. Can you imagine getting into Reinhard Heydrich's face?\nTwo chapters of the proposed sequel were published in \"The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick\", a collection of his essays and other writings. Eventually, Dick admitted that the proposed sequel became an unrelated novel, \"The Ganymede Takeover\", co-written with Ray Nelson (known for writing the short story \"Eight O'Clock in the Morning\" filmed as \"They Live\").\nDick's novel \"Radio Free Albemuth\" is rumored to have started as a sequel to \"The Man in the High Castle\". Dick described the plot of this early version of \"Radio Free Albemuth\"\u2014then titled \"VALISystem A\"\u2014writing:... a divine and loving ETI [extraterrestrial intelligence]\u00a0... help[s] Hawthorne Abendsen, the protagonist-author in [\"The Man in the High Castle\"], continue on in his difficult life after the Nazi secret police finally got to him\u00a0... VALISystem A, located in deep space, sees to it that nothing can prevent Abendsen from finishing his novel.\nThe novel eventually became a new story unrelated to \"The Man in the High Castle\". Dick ultimately abandoned the \"Albemuth\" book, unpublished during his lifetime, though portions were salvaged and used for 1981's \"VALIS\". \"Radio Free Albemuth\" was published in 1985, three years after Dick's death.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45906", "revid": "4842600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45906", "title": "Exponential distribution", "text": "Probability distribution\nIn probability theory and statistics, the exponential distribution or negative exponential distribution is the probability distribution of the distance between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate; the distance parameter could be any meaningful mono-dimensional measure of the process, such as time between production errors, or length along a roll of fabric in the weaving manufacturing process. It is a particular case of the gamma distribution. It is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, and it has the key property of being memoryless. In addition to being used for the analysis of Poisson point processes it is found in various other contexts.\nThe exponential distribution is not the same as the class of exponential families of distributions. This is a large class of probability distributions that includes the exponential distribution as one of its members, but also includes many other distributions, like the normal, binomial, gamma, and Poisson distributions.\nDefinitions.\nProbability density function.\nThe probability density function (pdf) of an exponential distribution is\nformula_1\nHere \"\u03bb\" &gt; 0 is the parameter of the distribution, often called the \"rate parameter\". The distribution is supported on the interval\u00a0[0, \u221e). If a random variable \"X\" has this distribution, we write\u00a0\"X\" ~ Exp(\"\u03bb\").\nThe exponential distribution exhibits infinite divisibility.\nCumulative distribution function.\nThe cumulative distribution function is given by\nformula_2\nAlternative parametrization.\nThe exponential distribution is sometimes parametrized in terms of the scale parameter \"\u03b2\" = 1/\"\u03bb\", which is also the mean:\nformula_3\nProperties.\nMean, variance, moments, and median.\nThe mean or expected value of an exponentially distributed random variable \"X\" with rate parameter \"\u03bb\" is given by\nformula_4\nIn light of the examples given below, this makes sense; a person who receives an average of two telephone calls per hour can expect that the time between consecutive calls will be 0.5 hour, or 30 minutes.\nThe variance of \"X\" is given by\nformula_5\nso the standard deviation is equal to the mean.\nThe moments of \"X\", for formula_6 are given by\nformula_7\nThe central moments of \"X\", for formula_6 are given by\nformula_9\nwhere !\"n\" is the subfactorial of \"n\"\nThe median of \"X\" is given by\nformula_10\nwhere ln refers to the natural logarithm. Thus the absolute difference between the mean and median is\nformula_11\nin accordance with the median-mean inequality.\nMemorylessness property of exponential random variable.\nAn exponentially distributed random variable \"T\" obeys the relation\nformula_12\nThis can be seen by considering the complementary cumulative distribution function:\nformula_13\nWhen \"T\" is interpreted as the waiting time for an event to occur relative to some initial time, this relation implies that, if \"T\" is conditioned on a failure to observe the event over some initial period of time \"s\", the distribution of the remaining waiting time is the same as the original unconditional distribution. For example, if an event has not occurred after 30 seconds, the conditional probability that occurrence will take at least 10 more seconds is equal to the unconditional probability of observing the event more than 10 seconds after the initial time.\nThe exponential distribution and the geometric distribution are the only memoryless probability distributions.\nThe exponential distribution is consequently also necessarily the only continuous probability distribution that has a constant failure rate.\nQuantiles.\nThe quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution function) for Exp(\"\u03bb\") is\nformula_14\nThe quartiles are therefore:\nAnd as a consequence the interquartile range is ln(3)/\"\u03bb\".\nConditional Value at Risk (Expected Shortfall).\nThe conditional value at risk (CVaR) also known as the expected shortfall or superquantile for Exp(\"\u03bb\") is derived as follows:\nformula_15\nBuffered Probability of Exceedance (bPOE).\nThe buffered probability of exceedance is one minus the probability level at which the CVaR equals the threshold formula_16. It is derived as follows:\nformula_17\nKullback\u2013Leibler divergence.\nThe directed Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence in nats of formula_18 (\"approximating\" distribution) from formula_19 ('true' distribution) is given by\nformula_20\nMaximum entropy distribution.\nAmong all continuous probability distributions with support [0, \u221e) and mean \"\u03bc\", the exponential distribution with \"\u03bb\" = 1/\"\u03bc\" has the largest differential entropy. In other words, it is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate \"X\" which is greater than or equal to zero and for which E[\"X\"] is fixed.\nDistribution of the minimum of exponential random variables.\nLet \"X\"1, ..., \"X\"\"n\" be independent exponentially distributed random variables with rate parameters \"\u03bb\"1, ..., \"\u03bbn\". Then\nformula_21\nis also exponentially distributed, with parameter\nformula_22\nThis can be seen by considering the complementary cumulative distribution function:\nformula_23\nThe index of the variable which achieves the minimum is distributed according to the categorical distribution\nformula_24\nA proof can be seen by letting formula_25. Then,\nformula_26\nNote that\nformula_27\nis not exponentially distributed, if \"X\"1, ..., \"X\"\"n\" do not all have parameter 0.\nJoint moments of i.i.d. exponential order statistics.\nLet formula_28 be formula_29 independent and identically distributed exponential random variables with rate parameter \"\u03bb\".\nLet formula_30 denote the corresponding order statistics.\nFor formula_31 , the joint moment formula_32 of the order statistics formula_33 and formula_34 is given by\nformula_35\nThis can be seen by invoking the law of total expectation and the memoryless property:\nformula_36\nThe first equation follows from the law of total expectation.\nThe second equation exploits the fact that once we condition on formula_37, it must follow that formula_38. The third equation relies on the memoryless property to replace formula_39 with formula_40.\nSum of two independent exponential random variables.\nThe probability distribution function (PDF) of a sum of two independent random variables is the convolution of their individual PDFs. If formula_41 and formula_42 are independent exponential random variables with respective rate parameters formula_43 and formula_44 then the probability density of formula_45 is given by\nformula_46\nThe entropy of this distribution is available in closed form: assuming formula_47 (without loss of generality), then\nformula_48\nwhere formula_49 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and formula_50 is the digamma function.\nIn the case of equal rate parameters, the result is an Erlang distribution with shape 2 and parameter formula_51 which in turn is a special case of gamma distribution.\nThe sum of n independent Exp(\"\u03bb)\" exponential random variables is Gamma(n, \"\u03bb)\" distributed.\nRelated distributions.\nOther related distributions:\nStatistical inference.\nBelow, suppose random variable \"X\" is exponentially distributed with rate parameter \u03bb, and formula_82 are \"n\" independent samples from \"X\", with sample mean formula_83.\nParameter estimation.\nThe maximum likelihood estimator for \u03bb is constructed as follows.\nThe likelihood function for \u03bb, given an independent and identically distributed sample \"x\" = (\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\") drawn from the variable, is:\nformula_84\nwhere:\nformula_85\nis the sample mean.\nThe derivative of the likelihood function's logarithm is:\nformula_86\nConsequently, the maximum likelihood estimate for the rate parameter is:\nformula_87\nThis is not an unbiased estimator of formula_51 although formula_89 is an unbiased MLE estimator of formula_90 and the distribution mean.\nThe bias of formula_91 is equal to\nformula_92\nwhich yields the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator\nformula_93\nAn approximate minimizer of mean squared error (see also: bias\u2013variance tradeoff) can be found, assuming a sample size greater than two, with a correction factor to the MLE:\nformula_94\nThis is derived from the mean and variance of the inverse-gamma distribution, formula_95.\nFisher information.\nThe Fisher information, denoted formula_96, for an estimator of the rate parameter formula_97 is given as:\nformula_98\nPlugging in the distribution and solving gives:\nformula_99\nThis determines the amount of information each independent sample of an exponential distribution carries about the unknown rate parameter formula_97.\nConfidence intervals.\nAn exact 100(1 \u2212 \u03b1)% confidence interval for the rate parameter of an exponential distribution is given by:\nformula_101\nwhich is also equal to\nformula_102\nwhere \u03c7 is the 100(\"p\") percentile of the chi squared distribution with \"v\" degrees of freedom, n is the number of observations and x-bar is the sample average. A simple approximation to the exact interval endpoints can be derived using a normal approximation to the \"\u03c7\" distribution. This approximation gives the following values for a 95% confidence interval:\nformula_103\nThis approximation may be acceptable for samples containing at least 15 to 20 elements.\nBayesian inference with a conjugate prior.\nThe conjugate prior for the exponential distribution is the gamma distribution (of which the exponential distribution is a special case). The following parameterization of the gamma probability density function is useful:\nformula_104\nThe posterior distribution \"p\" can then be expressed in terms of the likelihood function defined above and a gamma prior:\nformula_105\nNow the posterior density \"p\" has been specified up to a missing normalizing constant. Since it has the form of a gamma pdf, this can easily be filled in, and one obtains:\nformula_106\nHere the hyperparameter \"\u03b1\" can be interpreted as the number of prior observations, and \"\u03b2\" as the sum of the prior observations.\nThe posterior mean here is:\nformula_107\nBayesian inference with a calibrating prior.\nThe exponential distribution is one of a number of statistical distributions with group structure. As a result of the group structure, the exponential has an associated Haar measure, which is formula_108The use of the Haar measure as the prior (known as the Haar prior) in a Bayesian prediction gives probabilities that are perfectly calibrated, for any underlying true parameter values. Perfectly calibrated probabilities have the property that the predicted probabilities match the frequency of out-of-sample events exactly. For the exponential, there is an exact expression for Bayesian predictions generated using the Haar prior, given by\nformula_109\nThis is an example of calibrating prior prediction, in which the prior is chosen to improve calibration (and, in this case, to make the calibration perfect). Calibrating prior prediction for the exponential using the Haar prior is implemented in the R software package fitdistcp.https://\nThe same prediction can be derived from a number of other perspectives, as discussed in the prediction section below.\nOccurrence and applications.\nOccurrence of events.\nThe exponential distribution occurs naturally when describing the lengths of the inter-arrival times in a homogeneous Poisson process.\nThe exponential distribution may be viewed as a continuous counterpart of the geometric distribution, which describes the number of Bernoulli trials necessary for a \"discrete\" process to change state. In contrast, the exponential distribution describes the time for a continuous process to change state.\nIn real-world scenarios, the assumption of a constant rate (or probability per unit time) is rarely satisfied. For example, the rate of incoming phone calls differs according to the time of day. But if we focus on a time interval during which the rate is roughly constant, such as from 2 to 4 p.m. during work days, the exponential distribution can be used as a good approximate model for the time until the next phone call arrives. Similar caveats apply to the following examples which yield approximately exponentially distributed variables:\nExponential variables can also be used to model situations where certain events occur with a constant probability per unit length, such as the distance between mutations on a DNA strand, or between roadkills on a given road.\nIn queuing theory, the service times of agents in a system (e.g. how long it takes for a bank teller etc. to serve a customer) are often modeled as exponentially distributed variables. (The arrival of customers for instance is also modeled by the Poisson distribution if the arrivals are independent and distributed identically.) The length of a process that can be thought of as a sequence of several independent tasks follows the Erlang distribution (which is the distribution of the sum of several independent exponentially distributed variables).\nReliability theory and reliability engineering also make extensive use of the exponential distribution. Because of the memoryless property of this distribution, it is well-suited to model the constant hazard rate portion of the bathtub curve used in reliability theory. It is also very convenient because it is so easy to add failure rates in a reliability model. The exponential distribution is however not appropriate to model the overall lifetime of organisms or technical devices, because the \"failure rates\" here are not constant: more failures occur for very young and for very old systems.\nIn physics, if you observe a gas at a fixed temperature and pressure in a uniform gravitational field, the heights of the various molecules also follow an approximate exponential distribution, known as the Barometric formula. This is a consequence of the entropy property mentioned below.\nIn hydrology, the exponential distribution is used to analyze extreme values of such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes.\nThe blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the exponential distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.\nIn operating-rooms management, the distribution of surgery duration for a category of surgeries with no typical work-content (like in an emergency room, encompassing all types of surgeries).\nPrediction.\nHaving observed a sample of \"n\" data points from an unknown exponential distribution a common task is to use these samples to make predictions about future data from the same source. A common predictive distribution over future samples is the so-called plug-in distribution, formed by plugging a suitable estimate for the rate parameter \"\u03bb\" into the exponential density function. A common choice of estimate is the one provided by the principle of maximum likelihood, and using this yields the predictive density over a future sample \"x\"\"n\"+1, conditioned on the observed samples \"x\" = (\"x\"1, ..., \"xn\") given by\nformula_110\nThe Bayesian approach provides a predictive distribution which takes into account the uncertainty of the estimated parameter, although this may depend crucially on the choice of prior.\nA predictive distribution free of the issues of choosing priors that arise under the subjective Bayesian approach is\nformula_111\nwhich can be considered as\nThe accuracy of a predictive distribution may be measured using the distance or divergence between the true exponential distribution with rate parameter, \"\u03bb\"0, and the predictive distribution based on the sample \"x\". The Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence is a commonly used, parameterisation free measure of the difference between two distributions. Letting \u0394(\"\u03bb\"0||\"p\") denote the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between an exponential with rate parameter \"\u03bb\"0 and a predictive distribution \"p\" it can be shown that\nformula_113\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to the exponential distribution with rate parameter \"\u03bb\"0 \u2208 (0, \u221e), and \u03c8( \u00b7 ) is the digamma function. It is clear that the CNML predictive distribution is strictly superior to the maximum likelihood plug-in distribution in terms of average Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence for all sample sizes \"n\" &gt; 0.\nRandom variate generation.\nA conceptually very simple method for generating exponential variates is based on inverse transform sampling: Given a random variate \"U\" drawn from the uniform distribution on the unit interval (0, 1), the variate\nformula_114\nhas an exponential distribution, where \"F\"\u22121 is the quantile function, defined by\nformula_115\nMoreover, if \"U\" is uniform on (0, 1), then so is 1 \u2212 \"U\". This means one can generate exponential variates as follows:\nformula_116\nOther methods for generating exponential variates are discussed by Knuth and Devroye.\nA fast method for generating a set of ready-ordered exponential variates without using a sorting routine is also available.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heinlein\nBeyond This Horizon is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was originally published as a two-part serial in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (April, May 1942, under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) and then as a single volume by Fantasy Press in 1948. It was awarded a Retro-Hugo award for best novel in 2018.\nOverview.\nThe novel depicts a world in which genetic selection for increased health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified \"control naturals\" are a carefully managed and protected minority. Duels and the carrying of arms are socially accepted ways of maintaining civility in public. A brassard can be worn for immunity to duels, but this results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic utopia; the \"economic dividend\" is so high that work has become optional. The chief economic problem uses up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods cost less than those of lower quality. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but it has the side effect of further increasing productivity a decade or more later, and so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus.\nHamilton Felix (surname first), is the penultimate step in a \"star line\" designed to breed for the highest-quality human characteristics. However, he lacks eidetic memory, which disqualifies him for what he considers to be humanity's most important occupation: that of an \"encyclopedic synthesist\", who analyzes the sum total of human knowledge for untapped potential. As such, he finds his life and the society in which he lives to be enjoyable but meaningless. However, when the synthesists Mordan Claude seeks him out and inquires when he plans to continue his line, he finds himself drawn into an adventure that gives him purpose and also convinces him to continue his line.\nFelix is the product of generations of genetic engineering. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In the second half of the book, his genetically engineered son Theobald is born, the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding and a genetically perfect human. As Theobald grows, he begins to develop almost-superhuman mental abilities and is found to be a telepath.\nAs the novel draws to a close, Theobald suspects that his unborn sister is the reincarnation of Carvala, a government official who died shortly after meeting with Felix's wife and enquiring on when she would have a daughter. This is investigated, but is left vague by the end of the novel.\nReception.\nAnthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas characterized \"Beyond This Horizon\" as among \"the finest science fiction novels of the modern crop\". P. Schuyler Miller reviewed the novel favorably, saying: \"in true Heinlein manner the basic theme of the book smashes the screen of action only in the closing pages\".\nIn popular culture.\nIn the Japanese visual novel \"Eden*\", the term \"Felix\" is used in the setting to refer to genetically engineered humans with abilities similar to those described in the book, and the connection to Heinlein's work is referred to in dialogue.\nMordan Claude\u2019s quote \"An armed society is a polite society\" is often cited by pro-gun groups in justifying the proposal of universal carrying of arms. The context of the quote is usually omitted, though:\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Well, in the first place an armed society is a polite society. Manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life. For me, politeness is a sine qua non of civilization. That\u2019s a personal evaluation only. But gun-fighting has a strong biological use. We do not have enough things that kill off the weak and the stupid these days. But to stay alive as an armed citizen a man has to be either quick with his wits or with his hands, preferably both.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heinlein\n\"Rocket Ship\" Galileo, a juvenile science-fiction novel by the American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published in 1947, features three teenagers who participate in a pioneering flight to the Moon. It was the first in the Heinlein juveniles, a long and successful series of science-fiction novels published by Scribner's. Heinlein originally envisioned the novel as the first of a series of books called \"Young Rocket Engineers\". Publishers initially rejected the script, judging going to the Moon as \"too far out\".\nPlot summary.\nAfter World War II, three teenage rocket experimenters are recruited by one boy's uncle, Dr. Cargraves, a renowned physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project, to refit a conventionally powered surplus mail rocket. It is to be converted to run on a thorium nuclear pile which boils zinc as a propellant. They use a cleared area in a military weapons test range in the desert for their work, despite prying and sabotage attempts by unknown agents.\nUpon completion of the modifications, they stock the rocket, which they name the \"Galileo\", and take off for the Moon, taking approximately three days to arrive. After establishing a semi-permanent structure based on a Quonset hut, they claim the Moon on behalf of the United Nations.\nAs they set up a radio to communicate with the Earth they pick up a local transmission, the sender of which promises to meet them. Instead, their ship is bombed. However, they are able to hole up undetected in their hut and succeed in ambushing the other ship when it lands, capturing the pilot. They discover that there is a Nazi base on the Moon. They bomb it from their captured ship and land. One survivor is found, revived, and questioned.\nThe boys also find evidence of an ancient lunar civilization, and postulate that the craters of the Moon were formed not by impacts from space, but by nuclear bombs that destroyed the alien race.\nWhen the base's Nazi leader shoots the pilot in order to silence him, Cargraves convenes a trial and finds him guilty of murder. Cargraves prepares to execute the prisoner by ejecting him into vacuum, mostly as a bluff for information on how to fly the base's spaceship. The Nazi capitulates in the airlock and teaches them how to fly the ship back to Earth.\nThe boys radio the location of the hidden Nazi base on Earth to the authorities, leading to its destruction; they return as heroes.\nAdaptations.\nThe 1950 movie \"Destination Moon\" was loosely based on \"Rocket Ship\" Galileo, and Heinlein was one of three co-authors of the script. The film's plot also resembles that of \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\", which Heinlein wrote in 1949 but did not publish until 1951.\nCritical reception.\nSurveying Heinlein's juvenile novels, Jack Williamson noted that while \"Rocket Ship\" Galileo remains \"readable, with Heinlein's familiar themes already emerging\", it was a \"sometimes fumbling experiment. ... The plot is often trite, and the characters are generally thin stereotypes.\" Robert Wilfred Franson said that \"Heinlein wants there always to be young people of the right mind and character to seize such opportunities. His novels went a long way toward educating such a class of people, and still are doing so.\" Andrew Baker wrote: \"\"Rocket Ship\" Galileo shares with numerous works composed before the advent of the actual Space Program a gross underestimation of the huge costs and investment of resources needed for any jaunt outside Earth's gravitational field. (...) The idea of private people (boys in this case) being able to just take off to the Moon on their own can ultimately be traced - like so many Science Fiction themes - to the fertile mind of H. G. Wells and to the two English gentlemen quietly taking off to the Moon in \"The First Men in the Moon\". (...) The politics of Galileo are still those of the World War II anti-Nazi Alliance, not of the emerging Cold War. Had it been written a few years later, the villains would have likely been Russian Communists\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45912", "revid": "49214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45912", "title": "Space Cadet", "text": "1948 SF novel by Robert A. Heinlein\nSpace Cadet is a 1948 science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein about Matt Dodson, who joins the Interplanetary Patrol to help preserve peace in the Solar System. The story translates the standard military academy story into outer space: a boy from Iowa goes to officer school, sees action and adventure, shoulders responsibilities far beyond his experience, and becomes a man. It was published as the second of the series of Heinlein juveniles and inspired the media franchise around the character Tom Corbett, including the 1950s television series \"Tom Corbett, Space Cadet\" and radio show which made \"Space Cadet\" a household phrase whose meaning later shifted in popular culture.\nPlot summary.\nIn 2075, teenager Matt Dodson applies to join the prestigious Interplanetary Patrol. After a number of physical, mental, and ethics tests, he is accepted as a cadet. He makes friends with fellow recruits William \"Tex\" Jarman, Venus-born Oscar Jensen, and Pierre Armand from Ganymede. His first roommate is Girard Burke, the arrogant son of a wealthy spaceship builder. They are transported to the orbiting school ship PRS \"James Randolph\" for training. Burke eventually either resigns or is asked to leave, and goes into the merchant service, but the remainder do well enough to be assigned to working Patrol ships.\nDodson, Jarman and Jensen ship out on the \"Aes Triplex\". Their first real mission is to help search for a missing research vessel, the \"Pathfinder\", in the asteroid belt. They find it, but all aboard are dead, the unlucky victims of a fast-moving object that punctured the ship when the armored outer airlock door was open. Before the accident, a researcher on the \"Pathfinder\" had found evidence that the planet which blew up to form the asteroids was inhabited by an intelligent species, and that the explosion had been artificial. The captain of the \"Aes Triplex\" transfers half the crew to the repaired \"Pathfinder\" so that they can take the ship and the news of the startling discovery back to Earth quickly. With the remainder (including all three cadets), he plots a slower, fuel-efficient, elliptical voyage back to Earth.\nThen, he receives an urgent message to investigate an incident on Venus. He sends Lieutenant Thurlow and the cadets to the planet's surface. The lander touches down on a sinkhole, giving the crew barely enough time to get out before it disappears in the mud. With Thurlow comatose, injured when the lander fell over, Jensen assumes command. He contacts the sentient, usually friendly Venerians, but the entire party is taken captive. They soon find out why.\nThese particular natives had never seen human beings before, until old classmate Burke showed up in a prospecting ship. He had taken the matriarch of the local clan hostage when she refused to give him permission to exploit a rich deposit of radioactive ores. The locals promptly attacked the ship and killed his crew; Burke managed to send a message for help before being taken prisoner.\nJensen gains the matriarch's trust and convinces her that, unlike Burke, they are honorable and civilized, and the Patrolmen are released. Unfortunately, neither the lander nor Burke's ship is flightworthy. To their amazement, the matriarch takes the stranded humans to the carefully preserved \"Astarte\", the legendary first ship to set out for Venus over a century before and thought to have been lost en route. According to the log, the crew perished from disease. With the help of the natives, the cadets recommission the ship and fly it back to Venus's South Pole colony. Dodson is initially disappointed when they are not treated as heroes, but then realizes that what they accomplished was simply what was expected of Patrolmen.\nThemes.\nThe Patrol is entrusted by the worldwide Earth government with a monopoly on nuclear weapons, and is expected to maintain a credible threat to drop them on Earth from orbit as a deterrent against breaking the peace. Matt, on a visit home, causes a family argument when his parents refuse to believe that the Patrol\u2014and especially their son\u2014would actually bomb Iowa.\nThe cadets are expected to renounce their loyalty to their respective countries and replace it by a wider allegiance to humanity as a whole and to the sentient species of the Solar System. They are told the stories of four Patrol heroes/martyrs who exemplify this quality. One of them, Rivera, leaves orders to annihilate his hometown if he is held captive there during negotiations. Heinlein later expanded another of these anecdotes into \"The Long Watch\".\nThe young, idealistic Matt feels that he should be able, if the need arose, to emulate Rivera and destroy his own Iowa hometown. His father tells him such a need would never arise, since the Patrol's cosmopolitan allegiance is little more than a sham and in fact it is controlled by the \"North American Federation\" and serves its interests. Later, Matt's mentor in the Patrol makes him understand that if such an unlikely dilemma should arise, his commanding officer would lock him in his room rather than expect him to participate in the attack. The mentor uses this scenario to force Matt to confront the personal and political issues involved in the institutional control of atomic weapons in a more mature way.\nWritten almost a decade before the American Civil Rights Movement, and at a time when non-white characters were almost entirely absent from science fiction, the book also explores the theme of racism, both literally, in discussions about the cosmopolitan racial makeup of the (all-male) Patrol, and metaphorically, in its description of conflict with the Venerians. Venus is described as intensely hot and (incorrectly, as is now known) swampy, but habitable. The Venerians are at first thought to be primitive, but it is later revealed that they have a high level of technological sophistication, though developed along radically different lines than that of humans.\nThere is also a subplot revolving around the issue of what it means to be a good soldier. Discouraged by the intellectual demands of his Patrol training, and attracted to the glamor and esprit de corps of the Marines, Matt requests a transfer, but is dissuaded by his mentor. The mentor, dividing human motivations into three types, explains that the Patrol, which has the responsibility of holding the ultimate weapon and keeping overall peace, is manned by a certain sort of person, the man of ideals (its motto is \"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?).\" In contrast, the Marines, the service branch which deals with ordinary military affairs, are trained to prize unquestioning loyalty and bravery as the highest ideals, and are deliberately recruited from the type of person who seeks glory and excitement. Matt belongs to the former category. The Merchant Service, by implication, is for a third category, those motivated by economic concerns \u2014 which is where Burke fits in.\nThe novel contains an early description of a mobile phone:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Matt dug a candy bar out of his pouch, split it and gave half to Jarman, who accepted it gratefully. \"You're a pal, Matt, I've been living on my own fat ever since breakfast -- and that's risky. Say, your telephone is sounding.\n\"Oh!\" Matt fumbled in his pouch and got out his phone. \"Hello?\"\nThe phone \"was limited by its short range to the neighborhood of an earth-side [i.e. terrestrial] relay office\". A cadet avoids having to talk to his family while traveling by packing his phone in luggage.\nCritical reception.\nSurveying Heinlein's juvenile novels, Jack Williamson characterized \"Space Cadet\" as \"a long step forward. ... The characters are stronger [and] the background is carefully built, original, and convincing, the story suspenseful enough.\" Williamson noted that Heinlein was \"perfecting the \"bildungsroman\" form that shapes the whole series.\"\nP. Schuyler Miller gave the book a favorable review as \"a first-rate historical novel of the near future,\" saying \"So subtly has the scientific detail been interwoven with plot and action that the reader never realizes how painstakingly it has been worked out.\"\n\"Tom Corbett, Space Cadet\".\nThe novel inspired Joseph Greene of Grosset &amp; Dunlap to develop the \"Tom Corbett, Space Cadet\" comic books, television series, radio show, comic strip, and novels that were popular in the early 1950s. Greene had originally submitted a radio script for \"Tom Ranger and the Space Cadets\" on January 16, 1946, but it remained unperformed when Heinlein's novel was published. Heinlein influenced the evolution of \"Tom Ranger\" into \"Tom Corbett\" and launched his student astronaut title's common mention; they share credit for the popularity of both formal and later slang uses of \"space cadet.\"\nIn popular culture.\nThe \"Tom Corbett, Space Cadet\" television series and radio show made \"space cadet\" a household phrase. By 1955, Jackie Gleason spoke the phrase on \"The Honeymooners\" television show in an episode called \"TV or Not to TV,\" original airdate October 1, 1955.\nThe popular meanings of \"space cadet\" later shifted in popular culture away from astronaut-in-training to indicate, by the 1960s, an \"eccentric person disconnected with reality\" (often implying an intimacy with hallucinogenic drugs) although by the 2010s, drug use was rarely implied by this phrase, nor was low intelligence implied; \"space cadet\" was more simply associated with \"spacing out,\" wandering from present concerns, especially of others present, and being a \"space case.\" Both the \"trainee astronaut\" and \"person regarded as being out of touch with reality\" entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", though by 2014 Oxford noted that, in American English, the phrase had also recouped the positive connotations originally meant by Heinlein and Joseph Greene, the \"Tom Corbett, Space Cadet\" writer: \"An enthusiast for space travel, typically a young person.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's \"National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs\". Its origins are obscure, and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings. The rhyme is listed in the Roud Folk Song Index as No. 13026.\nAs a figure in nursery culture, the character appears under a variety of near-rhyming names, such as Lille Trille (Danish), Wirgele-Wargele (German), H\u00fcmpelken-P\u00fcmpelken (German) and Hobberti Bob (Pennsylvania Dutch). As a \ncharacter and literary allusion, Humpty Dumpty was referred to in several works of literature and popular culture in the nineteenth century. Lewis Carroll in particular made him an animated egg in his 1871 book \"Through the Looking-Glass\", while in the United States the character was popularised by George L. Fox as a clown of that name in the Broadway pantomime musical \"Humpty Dumpty\" (1868).\nLyrics and melody.\nThe rhyme is well known in the English language. The common text from 1882 is:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall.\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall.\nAll the king's horses and all the king's men\nCouldn't put Humpty together again.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIt is a single quatrain with external rhymes that follow the pattern of AABB and with a trochaic metre, which is common in nursery rhymes. The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his \"National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs\" (London, 1870), as outlined below:\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\new Staff \u00ab\n\\clef treble \\key bes \\major {\n \\time 6/8 \\partial 2. \n \\relative d' {\n d4 f8 es4 g8 | f8 g a bes4. | d,4 f8 es4 g8 | f8 d bes c4. \\bar\" \\break\n d8 d f es es g | f8 g a bes4. | d8 d bes es es d | c8 bes a bes4. \\bar\" \\break\n%\\new Lyrics \\lyricmode {\n\u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nOrigins.\nThe earliest known version was published in Samuel Arnold's \"Juvenile Amusements\" in 1797 with the lyrics:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall,\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall.\nFour-score Men and Four-score more,\nCould not make Humpty Dumpty where he was before.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA manuscript addition to a copy of \"Mother Goose's Melody\" published in 1803 has the modern version with a different last line: \"Could not set Humpty Dumpty up again\". It was published in 1810 in a version of \"Gammer Gurton's Garland\". (Note: Original spelling variations left intact.)\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHumpty Dumpty sate on a wall,\nHumpti Dumpti had a great fall;\nThreescore men and threescore more,\nCannot place Humpty dumpty as he was before.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn 1841 an anthology of Latin and Greek translations of popular literature was published under the title \"Arudines Cami\" which included a version of the rhyme in Latin translation by Henry Drury. The final two English lines translated in this case now read \nNot all the king's horses, nor all the queen's men,\nCould put Humpty Dumpty on the wall again.\nIn 1842, James Orchard Halliwell published an alternative version in his collection of \"The Nursery Rhymes of England\":\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHumpty Dumpty lay in a beck.\nWith all his sinews around his neck;\nForty Doctors and forty wrights\nCouldn't put Humpty Dumpty to rights!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nEvidence of an alternative American version closer to the modern received rhyme quoted above is given by William Carey Richards in the issue of a children's magazine for 1843, where he comments that he had come across it as a riddle when he was five-years old and that the answer was \"an egg\".\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", in the seventeenth century, the term \"humpty dumpty\" referred to a drink of brandy boiled with ale. The riddle probably exploited, for misdirection, the fact that \"humpty dumpty\" was also eighteenth-century reduplicative slang for a short and clumsy person. The riddle may depend upon the assumption that a clumsy person falling off a wall might not be irreparably damaged, whereas an egg would be. The rhyme is no longer posed as a riddle, since the answer is now so well known. Similar riddles have been recorded by folklorists in other languages, such as \"Boule Boule\" in French, \"Lille Trille\" in Swedish and Norwegian, and \"Runtzelken-Puntzelken\" or \"Humpelken-Pumpelken\" in different parts of Germany\u2014although none is as widely known as Humpty Dumpty is in English.\nMeaning.\nThe rhyme does not explicitly state that the subject is an egg, possibly because it may have been originally posed as a riddle. There are also various theories of an original \"Humpty Dumpty\". One, advanced by Katherine Elwes Thomas in 1930 and adopted by Robert Ripley, posits that Humpty Dumpty is King Richard III of England, depicted as hunchbacked in Tudor histories and particularly in Shakespeare's play, and who was defeated, despite his armies, at Bosworth Field in 1485.\nIn 1785, Francis Grose's \"Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue\" noted that a \"Humpty Dumpty\" was \"a short clumsey [\"sic\"] person of either sex, also ale boiled with brandy\"; no mention was made of the rhyme. The name is also commonly applied to a person in an insecure position, something that would be difficult to reconstruct once broken, or a short and fat person.\nProfessor David Daube suggested in \"The Oxford Magazine\" of 16 February 1956 that Humpty Dumpty was a \"tortoise\" siege engine, an armored frame, used unsuccessfully to approach the walls of the Parliamentary-held city of Gloucester in 1643 during the Siege of Gloucester in the English Civil War. This was on the basis of a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected. The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia, but it was derided by others as \"ingenuity for ingenuity's sake\" and declared to be a spoof. The link was nevertheless popularized by a children's opera \"All the King's Men\" by Richard Rodney Bennett, first performed in 1969.\nFrom 1996, the website of the Colchester tourist board attributed the origin of the rhyme to a cannon recorded as used from the church of St Mary-at-the-Walls by the Royalist defenders in the siege of 1648. In 1648, Colchester was a walled town with a castle and several churches and was protected by the city wall. The story given was that a large cannon, which the website claimed was colloquially called Humpty Dumpty, was strategically placed on the wall. A shot from a Parliamentary cannon succeeded in damaging the wall beneath Humpty Dumpty, which caused the cannon to tumble to the ground. The Royalists (or Cavaliers, \"all the King's men\") attempted to raise Humpty Dumpty on to another part of the wall, but the cannon was so heavy that \"All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again\". Author Albert Jack claimed in his 2008 book \"Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes\" that there were two other verses supporting this claim. Elsewhere, he claimed to have found them in an \"old dusty library, [in] an even older book\", but did not state what the book was or where it was found. It has been pointed out that the two additional verses are not in the style of the seventeenth century or of the existing rhyme, and that they do not fit with the earliest printed versions of the rhyme, which do not mention horses and men.\nAdaptations.\nAmerican actor George L. Fox helped to popularise the nursery rhyme character in a nineteenth-century pantomime on Broadway, where he figures as a clown. During the nineteenth century, too, Humpty Dumpty gave his name to a number of musical items, dependent either on the nursery rhyme or on the pantomime. They include Alfred Caldicott's glee of 1878 and E. P. Sweeting's round of 1893, as well as Walford Davies' 1907 \"Humpty Dumpty\", described as \"a short cantata for children, consisting of a prelude, four short settings of the old nursery rhyme, and part of the scene between Alice and Humpty Dumpty (from \"Alice Through the Looking-Glass\")\". There were also purely musical items in the US, such as the 1875 galop by Harry R. Williams, the 1876 polka by E. Jullian Gray and the 1900 schottische by H. Engelmann.\nLewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking-Glass\".\nHumpty Dumpty makes an appearance in Lewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking-Glass\" (1871). There Alice remarks that Humpty is \"exactly like an egg\", which Humpty finds to be \"very provoking\". Alice clarifies that she said he looks like an egg, not that he is one. They then go on discuss semantics and pragmatics when Humpty Dumpty says, \"my name means the shape I am\".\nA. J. Larner suggested that Carroll's Humpty Dumpty had prosopagnosia on the basis of his description of his finding faces hard to recognise:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The face is what one goes by, generally,\" Alice remarked in a thoughtful tone.\n\"That's just what I complain of,\" said Humpty Dumpty. \"Your face is the same as everybody has\u2014the two eyes,\u2014\" (marking their places in the air with his thumb) \"nose in the middle, mouth under. It's always the same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance\u2014or the mouth at the top\u2014that would be \"some\" help.\"\nJames Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\".\nJames Joyce used the story of Humpty Dumpty as a recurring motif of the Fall of Man in the 1939 novel \"Finnegans Wake\". One of the most easily recognizable references is at the end of the second chapter, in the first verse of the Ballad of Persse O'Reilly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn science.\nHumpty Dumpty has been used to demonstrate the second law of thermodynamics. The law describes a process known as entropy, a measure of the number of specific ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\". The higher the entropy, the higher the disorder. After his fall and subsequent shattering, the inability to put him together again is representative of this principle, as it would be highly unlikely (though not impossible) to return him to his earlier state of lower entropy, as the entropy of an isolated system never decreases.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Heinlein\nBetween Planets is a juvenile science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally serialized in \"Blue Book\" magazine in 1951 as \"Planets in Combat\". It was published in hardcover that year by Scribner's as part of the Heinlein juveniles.\nPlot summary.\nDon Harvey's scientist parents withdraw him from his high school in New Mexico in the middle of the term so that he can join them on Mars. The headmaster suggests that they want him out of a potential war zone, where he might be viewed suspiciously because of doubts about his loyalties. At his parents' behest, he visits an old family friend who asks him to deliver a ring to his father; security forces later arrest both of them. Harvey is released and given his ring back, after it has been examined; he is told that his friend has died of \"heart failure\". Only later does he realize that \"all\" deaths can be described that way.\nHarvey boards a shuttle to a space station orbiting Earth. The station doubles as a transshipment terminus and a military base, armed with missiles to keep restive nations in check. On the trip up, he befriends another passenger, a Venerian \"dragon\" calling himself \"Sir Isaac Newton\". Sir Isaac, a renowned physicist, can vocalize English using a portable device.\nHarvey gets caught up in the Venerian war of independence when colonial forces capture the station in a surprise raid. Most of the other travelers are sent back to Earth, while a few decide to join the rebels. Harvey is in a quandary. The spaceship to Mars has been confiscated, but he remains determined to get there, by way of Venus if necessary. Because he was born in space, with one parent from Venus and the other from Earth, he claims Venerian citizenship; more importantly, Sir Isaac vouches for him. He is allowed to tag along, which turns out to be very fortunate for Harvey. The rebels blow up the station to stir up trouble for the Earth government. When the shuttle returns to Earth with its radios disabled, the military assumes it has been booby-trapped and destroys it, killing all aboard.\nOn his arrival on Venus, Harvey finds that his Earth-backed money is now worthless. A banker lends him money, telling him to pay it forward. He gets a job washing dishes for his keep for Charlie, a Chinese immigrant who runs a small restaurant. He befriends a young woman, Isobel, when he tries to send a message to his parents. However, communication with Mars has been cut due to the hostilities. Harvey settles in to wait out the war, but the war comes to him.\nEarth sends a force to put down the rebellion on Venus. The Venerian ships are destroyed in orbit and the ground forces are routed. Charlie is killed resisting the occupying soldiers. Harvey is rounded up and questioned by a senior security officer, who is very eager to get his hands on Harvey's ring. Luckily, Harvey had given it to Isobel for safekeeping; he does not know where she is or whether she is even alive. Before he can be interrogated with drugs, he escapes and joins the Venerian guerrilla forces.\nHarvey joins the army of the Republic and becomes an effective commando. In time, he is tracked down by the leaders of the resistance, who are also looking for the ring. Isobel and her father (an important member of the rebels) are safe at the very base where Harvey is taken.\nThe seemingly valueless ring turns out to contain the secret of scientific breakthroughs resulting from archaeological studies of an extinct alien civilization on Mars. With Sir Isaac's assistance, the rebels use the information to build an advanced spaceship that is much faster than any other vessel in existence, with revolutionary weapons and defenses also derived from the new technology. As a combat veteran, Harvey is recruited for the maiden voyage of \"Little David\", manning a dead man's switch with strict orders to blow up the ship if it is in danger of capture. \"Little David\" intercepts and defeats a task force of warships on their way to Mars to crush the revolt there.\nAstronomy.\nLike many science fiction works of its period, the novel depicts both Venus and Mars as suitable for human habitation. Since no interplanetary space probes had been launched at the time, neither the extreme pressure and temperature at the surface of Venus, nor the extremely low atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars, were known to science. Even the length of the day on Venus was not yet known.\nReception.\nGroff Conklin reviewed the novel favorably, calling it \"a magnificently real and vivid Picture of the Possible\". Boucher and McComas named it among the best sf novels of 1951, characterizing it as \"more mature than most 'adult' science fiction\". P.\u00a0Schuyler Miller praised the novel as \"very smoothly and logically put together\", although he noted that it lacked the level of \"elaboration of background detail\" that he expected from Heinlein.\nSurveying Heinlein's juvenile novels, Jack Williamson characterized \"Between Planets\" as \"mov[ing] the series still farther from its juvenile origins toward grownup concerns\". Although describing the plot as \"pretty traditional space opera\", he praised the novel for its \"ably drawn\" characters, its \"well-imagined\" background, and its \"story told with zest\". Williamson also noted that Heinlein closed the novel \"with a vigorous statement of his unhappiness with 'the historical imperative' leading to the loss of individual freedom as governmental organizations grew\".\nCartoon.\n\"Between Planets\" was serialized in \"Boys' Life\" magazine in 1978 as a monthly cartoon series. The story took some liberties \u2014 for instance, the \"Dragons\" of Venus were portrayed as humanoids and the planets' names were changed \u2014 but the spirit of the story was relatively faithful.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city's population was 18,899 at the 2020 United States census, making it the 12th-most populous city in Maine, and third-least populous state capital in the United States. Augusta is the seat of and most populous city in Kennebec County.\nEnglish settlers from the Popham Colony at the mouth of the Kennebec River explored the area in 1607. Before European settlement, Algonquian-speaking Indians lived in the area. In 1625, representatives of Plymouth Colony chose the east shore of the Kennebec for a trading post, which was likely built in 1628 and became known as \"Cushnoc\". The Kennebec Proprietors, successors to the Plymouth Company, built Fort Western near the site of the abandoned trading post in 1754 and began settlement efforts. The new village was incorporated as Hallowell in 1771, and the upriver part of town separated in 1797 to form the town of Harrington. On June 9, 1797, Harrington changed its name to Augusta and, in 1827, it was designated capital of Maine.\nAugusta is the easternmost state capital in the United States. Located on the Kennebec River at the head of tide, it is the principal city in the Augusta-Waterville micropolitan statistical area and home to the University of Maine at Augusta. Because of the city's position on the Kennebec, downtown Augusta is vulnerable to floods in spring. The Maine flood of 1987, known as the \"Great Flood\", affected the city. Bond Brook runs from northwest to southeast through the city center, and has been called the \"Home of wild Atlantic Salmon\".\nThe city has five different residential areas, including the \"west side\", a historic neighborhood north of the state capitol complex, and the \"east side\", which is situated on the opposite side of the Kennebec. The city's northwest quadrant includes both a retail center and neighborhoods.\nAugusta State Airport serves the city, offering both commercial service and general aviation. Although the airport is owned by the State of Maine, it is managed and operated by the city. Interstate 95 passes by the western outskirts of Augusta, and both U.S. 202 and U.S. 201 run through the city.\nHistory.\nThe area was first explored by the English of the short-lived Popham Colony in September 1607. Twenty-one years later, English settlers from the Plymouth Colony settled in the area in 1628 as part of a trading post on the Kennebec River. The settlement was known by its Native American name \"Cushnoc\" (or Coussinoc or Koussinoc), meaning \"head of the tide\". Fur trading was at first profitable, but because of Native uprisings and declining revenues, Plymouth Colony sold the Kennebec Patent[\"\"] in 1661. Cushnoc would remain unoccupied for the next 75 years.\nThe area around Cushnoc was inhabited by the Kennebec, a band of the larger Abenaki nation. During the 17th century, they were on friendly terms with the English settlers in the region.\nA hotbed of Abenaki hostility toward British settlements was located further up the Kennebec at Norridgewock. In 1722, the tribe and its allies attacked Fort Richmond (now Richmond) and destroyed Brunswick. In response, English forces sacked Norridgewock in 1724 during Dummer's War, when the English gained tentative control of the Kennebec.\nDuring the height of the French and Indian War, in 1754, the English colonists built a blockhouse named Fort Western at Cushnoc on the eastern bank of the Kennebec River. It was intended as a supply depot for Fort Halifax upriver, as well as a regional defense from French attack. Later, during the American Revolutionary War, Benedict Arnold and his 1,100 troops would use Fort Western as a staging area before continuing their journey up the Kennebec to the Battle of Quebec.\nCushnoc was incorporated as part of Hallowell in 1771. Known as \"the Fort\", it was set off and incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court in February 1797 as Harrington. In August, however, the name was changed to Augusta after Pamela Augusta Dearborn, daughter of Henry Dearborn. In 1799, it was designated as the county seat for the newly created Kennebec County.\nMaine became a state in 1820 as a result of the Missouri Compromise. Augusta was designated as its capital in 1827, over Portland, and rival communities Brunswick and Hallowell. The Maine State Legislature continued meeting in Portland, however, until the completion of the Maine State House in 1832, designed by Charles Bulfinch. Augusta was incorporated as a city in 1849. After being named the state capital and the introduction of new industry, the city flourished. In 1840 and 1850, the city ranked among the 100 largest urban populations in the country. During the next decade, however, the city was quickly bypassed by rapidly growing metropolises in the Midwest.\nExcellent soil provided for agriculture, and water power from streams provided for the industry. In 1837, a dam was built across the Kennebec where the falls drop 15\u00a0 feet at the head of a tide. By 1838, 10 sawmills were contracted. With the arrival of the Kennebec &amp; Portland Railroad in 1851, Augusta became an even more productive mill town. In 1883, the property of A. &amp; W. Sprague Company was purchased by the Edwards Manufacturing Company, which erected extensive brick mills for manufacturing cotton textiles. They imported cotton from the South for processing and export to Europe. In the late 19th century, a paper and pulp plant was constructed.\nOther Augusta firms produced lumber, sash, doors, window shutters, broom handles, stone cutters' tools, shoes, headstones, ice and furniture. The city developed as a publishing and shipping center. Today, government and post-secondary education are important businesses.\nSince the mid-eighteenth century, there has been a military presence in Augusta. Fort Western has not had troops garrisoned there since the 1790s, but in 1828, the U.S. Government built an arsenal to protect their interests from Britain. During the Civil War, Augusta was a rendezvous point for Union soldiers traveling to the front. Many of the soldiers camped on the green in front of the capitol building. In 1862, Camp E.D. Keyes was established in the northwestern portion of the city.\nDuring World War I, Camp Keyes was used as a mobilization and training camp for soldiers. The camp eventually became a headquarters for the Maine National Guard. In 1929, the state legislature approved the placement of the Augusta State Airport next to the camp. As the airport grew, the use of the camp as a training facility was no longer possible. Today, it is still used for administrative and logistical purposes by the National Guard.\nIn the 19th century, Augusta got a regular steamboat service and the railroad. The city installed gas lights in 1859. A telephone service was available in 1880 and a local hospital in 1898. In the early 20th century, Augusta built two movie houses and a film production studio.\nDowntown revitalization.\nFor much of Augusta's history, the central business district was on and near Water Street on the west bank of the Kennebec River. The street, laid out in the late 1700s, was the location of the area's commercial and industrial life. Many fires damaged this concentrated area, including one in 1865 that destroyed nearly 100 buildings. In 1890, the first trolley line began operation down Water Street, connecting Augusta with Gardiner and Hallowell to the south.\nIn 1932, buses replaced the trolley line. With the completion of the Maine Turnpike and Interstate 95 in 1955, local commercial developments began to move away from Water Street and closer to the highway. Among the results was a storefront vacancy rate downtown of about 60 percent.\nSince the late 2000s, there has been a renewed and ongoing focus by city officials, the Augusta Downtown Alliance, and private developers to revitalize the downtown area.\nGeography.\nAugusta is the easternmost state capital in the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Augusta is drained by Bond's Brook, Woromontogus Stream and the Kennebec River.\nRoads.\nThe city is crossed by Interstate 95, U.S. Route 201, State Route 11, U.S. Route 202, State Route 9, State Route 3, State Route 100, State Route 27, State Route 8, State Route 104, and State Route 105.\nBordering.\nAugusta borders the towns of Manchester to its west, Sidney and Vassalboro to its north, Windsor to its east, Chelsea to its south, and the city of Hallowell to its southwest.\nClimate.\nAugusta's climate is classified as a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Dfb\"). Summers are typically warm, rainy, and humid, while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Spring and fall are usually mild, but conditions are widely varied, depending on wind direction and jet stream positioning.\nThe hottest month is July, with an average high temperature of . The coldest month is January, with an average low of . Most snowfall occurs from December through March. There is usually little or no snow in April and November, and snow is rare in May and October.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 19,136 people, 8,802 households, and 4,490 families residing in the city.

Heinlein\nStarman Jones, a 1953 science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein, features a farm boy who wants to go to the stars. Charles Scribner's Sons published the book as part of the Heinlein juveniles series.\nPlot summary.\nMax Jones works the family farm in the Ozark Mountains. With his father dead and his stepmother marrying a man he detests, Max runs away from home, taking his late uncle's astrogation manuals.\nMost occupations are tightly controlled by guilds, with hereditary memberships. Since his uncle had been a member of the Astrogators' Guild and had had no children, Max hopes that before he died, his uncle had named him his heir. He begins hitchhiking towards Earthport to find out. Along the way, he finds a friendly face in hobo Sam Anderson, who later alludes to being a deserter from the Imperial Marines. Sam feeds Max and offers good advice, though he later absconds with Max's valuable manuals.\nAt the guild's headquarters, Max is disappointed to find that he had not been named as an heir, but he receives his uncle's substantial security deposit for his manuals. Max learns that Sam had returned the manuals and tried to claim the deposit for himself.\nBy chance, he runs into an apologetic Sam. With Max's money, Sam is able to finagle them jobs aboard a starship using forged records of service as crewmen aboard other starships. Max signs on as a steward's mate third class, and then he absorbs the contents of the Stewards' Guild manual using his eidetic memory. Among his duties is caring for several animals, including passengers' pets. When Eldreth \"Ellie\" Coburn visits her pet, an alien, semi-intelligent \"spider puppy\" that Max has befriended, she learns that he can play three-dimensional chess, and challenges him to a game. A champion player, she diplomatically lets him win. Meanwhile, Sam rises to the position of master-at-arms.\nWhen, through Ellie's machinations, the ship's officers discover that Max had learned astrogation from his uncle, Max is promoted to the undermanned command deck. Under the tutelage of Chief Astrogator Hendrix and Chief Computerman Kelly, he becomes a probationary apprentice chartsman, then a probationary astrogator. In a meeting with Hendrix, Max reluctantly admits to faking his record to get into space. Hendrix defers the matter until their return to Earth. The \"Asgard\" then departs for Halcyon, a colony planet orbiting Nu Pegasi.\nWhen Hendrix dies, the astrogation department is left dangerously shorthanded. The aging captain tries to take his place, but is not up to the task. When Max detects a critical error in his real-time calculations leading up to a transition (an instantaneous jump to another region of space), neither the captain nor Assistant Astrogator Simes believe him, and the ship becomes lost.\nThey locate a habitable world, which Ellie names Charity, and the passengers become colonists. Meanwhile, the crew continues to try to figure out where they are and whether they can return to Earth. Unfortunately, it turns out the planet is already inhabited by hostile centaur-like sapients. Max and Ellie are captured, but Ellie's pet is able to guide Sam to them. They escape, though Sam is killed covering their retreat. Upon his return, Max is informed that the captain has died. Simes tried to take command illegally and was killed by Sam, leaving Max as the only remaining astrogator. To make matters worse, Simes hid or destroyed the astrogation manuals.\nVastly outnumbered by the natives, the humans are forced to attempt a perilous return to known space by reversing the erroneous transition. Max must pilot the ship; he must also supply the missing astrogation tables from memory. To add to his burdens, the remaining officers inform Max that he must take command, as the captain must be an astrogator. The pressure is immense, but Max succeeds and the ship returns to known space.\nMax pays heavy fines, but is allowed to join the Astrogators' Guild, and is assigned as an assistant astrogator aboard another starship. However, he loses any chance for a romantic relationship with Eldreth; she returns home to marry her boyfriend. Max accepts this with mixed feelings, but looks forward to his new career.\nReception.\nGroff Conklin in 1954 found the novel to be \"a richly textured and thoroughly mature tale\" and the best of the seven Heinlein juveniles available. Anthony Boucher and J.\u00a0Francis McComas praised it for its \"good character-development, rousing adventure-telling, and brilliant creation of several forms of extra-Terrestrial life\". P.\u00a0Schuyler Miller ranked it \"close to the best in mainline science fiction\".\n\"New York Times\" reviewer Villiers Gerson declared \"Starman Jones\" to be \"superior science-fiction. ... carefully plotted, lucidly and beautifully written\".\nSurveying Heinlein's juvenile novels, Jack Williamson described \"Starman Jones\" as \"a classic example of the \"bildungsroman\" pattern\" and noted that \"with its bold symbolism, the book makes a universal appeal\". Despite \"coincidence and occasional melodrama\" in the plotting, Williamson concluded that \"the novel is a fine juvenile [which] reflects hopes and fears we all have known\".\nDamon Knight wrote that in \"Starman Jones\", \"Heinlein is doing something more than just earning a living at the work he does supremely well: he's preparing a whole generation\u00a0\u2013 the generation that will live to see the year 2000\u00a0\u2013 for the Age of Space that's as real to him now as it will be, must be, to them.\"\nAdaptation to other media.\nAlthough Heinlein rarely permitted dramatic adaptations of his work, he authorized Douglas L.\u00a0Lieberman to stage \"Starman Jones\" at the Goodman Children's Theater in Chicago. Written and directed by Lieberman, the two-act play ran for 25 performances in 1972. The title role was played by Charles Fleischer, who later performed the voice of Roger Rabbit in Hollywood. In 1974, Avon Books published the script as part of the anthology \"Contemporary Children's Theater\" edited by Betty Jean Lifton.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Often, the name \"shifted\" geometric distribution is adopted for the former one (distribution of formula_28); however, to avoid ambiguity, it is considered wise to indicate which is intended, by mentioning the support explicitly.\nThe geometric distribution gives the probability that the first occurrence of success requires formula_33 independent trials, each with success probability formula_34. If the probability of success on each trial is formula_34, then the probability that the formula_33-th trial is the first success is\nformula_37\nfor formula_38\nThe above form of the geometric distribution is used for modeling the number of trials up to and including the first success. By contrast, the following form of the geometric distribution is used for modeling the number of failures until the first success:\nformula_39\nfor formula_40\nThe geometric distribution gets its name because its probabilities follow a geometric sequence. It is sometimes called the Furry distribution after Wendell H. Furry.210\nDefinition.\nThe geometric distribution is the discrete probability distribution that describes when the first success in an infinite sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials occurs. Its probability mass function depends on its parameterization and support. When supported on formula_41, the probability mass function is formula_42 where formula_43 is the number of trials and formula_34 is the probability of success in each trial.\nThe support may also be formula_45, defining formula_30. This alters the probability mass function into formula_47 where formula_48 is the number of failures before the first success.66\nAn alternative parameterization of the distribution gives the probability mass function formula_49 where formula_50 and formula_51.\nAn example of a geometric distribution arises from rolling a six-sided die until a \"1\" appears. Each roll is independent with a formula_52 chance of success. The number of rolls needed follows a geometric distribution with formula_53.\nProperties.\nMemorylessness.\nThe geometric distribution is the only memoryless discrete probability distribution. It is the discrete version of the same property found in the exponential distribution.228 The property asserts that the number of previously failed trials does not affect the number of future trials needed for a success. \nBecause there are two definitions of the geometric distribution, there are also two definitions of memorylessness for discrete random variables. Expressed in terms of conditional probability, the two definitions are\nformula_54\nand\nformula_55\nwhere formula_56 and formula_57 are natural numbers, formula_28 is a geometrically distributed random variable defined over formula_41, and formula_60 is a geometrically distributed random variable defined over formula_45. Note that these definitions are not equivalent for discrete random variables; formula_60 does not satisfy the first equation and formula_28 does not satisfy the second. \nMoments and cumulants.\nThe expected value and variance of a geometrically distributed random variable formula_28 defined over formula_41 is261\nformula_66\nWith a geometrically distributed random variable formula_60 defined over formula_45, the expected value changes into\nformula_69\nwhile the variance stays the same.\nFor example, when rolling a six-sided die until landing on a \"1\", the average number of rolls needed is formula_70 and the average number of failures is \nThe moment generating function of the geometric distribution when defined over formula_71 and formula_45 respectively is114\nformula_73\nThe moments for the number of failures before the first success are given by\nformula_74\nwhere formula_75 is the polylogarithm function.\nThe cumulant generating function of the geometric distribution defined over formula_45 is216 formula_77The cumulants formula_78 satisfy the recursionformula_79where formula_80, when defined over formula_45.216\nProof of expected value.\nConsider the expected value formula_82 of \"X\" as above, i.e. the average number of trials until a success. \nThe first trial either succeeds with probability formula_34, or fails with probability formula_84. \nIf it fails, the remaining mean number of trials until a success is identical to the original mean - \nthis follows from the fact that all trials are independent.\nFrom this we get the formula:\nformula_85\nwhich, when solved for formula_86, gives:\nformula_87\nThe expected number of failures formula_60 can be found from the linearity of expectation, formula_89. It can also be shown in the following way:\nformula_90\nThe interchange of summation and differentiation is justified by the fact that convergent power series converge uniformly on compact subsets of the set of points where they converge.\nSummary statistics.\nThe mean of the geometric distribution is its expected value which is, as previously discussed in \u00a7 Moments and cumulants, formula_91 or formula_15 when defined over formula_41 or formula_45 respectively.\nThe median of the geometric distribution is formula_95when defined over formula_41 and formula_97 when defined over formula_45.69\nThe mode of the geometric distribution is the first value in the support set. This is 1 when defined over formula_41 and 0 when defined over formula_45.69\nThe skewness of the geometric distribution is formula_20.115\nThe kurtosis of the geometric distribution is formula_102.115 The excess kurtosis of a distribution is the difference between its kurtosis and the kurtosis of a normal distribution, formula_103.217 Therefore, the excess kurtosis of the geometric distribution is formula_104. Since formula_105, the excess kurtosis is always positive so the distribution is leptokurtic.69 In other words, the tail of a geometric distribution decays faster than a Gaussian.217\nEntropy and Fisher's information.\nEntropy (geometric distribution, failures before success).\nEntropy is a measure of uncertainty in a probability distribution. For the geometric distribution that models the number of failures before the first success, the probability mass function is:\nformula_106\nThe entropy formula_107 for this distribution is defined as:\nformula_108\nThe entropy increases as the probability formula_34 decreases, reflecting greater uncertainty as success becomes rarer.\nFisher's information (geometric distribution, failures before success).\nFisher information measures the amount of information that an observable random variable formula_28 carries about an unknown parameter formula_34. For the geometric distribution (failures before the first success), the Fisher information with respect to formula_34 is given by:\nformula_113\nProof:\nFisher information increases as formula_34 decreases, indicating that rarer successes provide more information about the parameter formula_34.\nEntropy (geometric distribution, trials until success).\nFor the geometric distribution modeling the number of trials until the first success, the probability mass function is:\nformula_123\nThe entropy formula_107 for this distribution is the same as that of version modeling trials until failure, \nformula_125\nFisher's information (geometric distribution, trials until success).\nFisher information for the geometric distribution modeling the number of trials until the first success is given by:\nformula_113\nProof:\n formula_128\n formula_129\n formula_131\n formula_132\nformula_120\nStatistical inference.\nThe true parameter formula_34 of an unknown geometric distribution can be inferred through estimators and conjugate distributions.\nMethod of moments.\nProvided they exist, the first formula_169 moments of a probability distribution can be estimated from a sample formula_170 using the formulaformula_171where formula_172 is the formula_173th sample moment and formula_174. Estimating formula_82 with formula_176 gives the sample mean, denoted formula_177. Substituting this estimate in the formula for the expected value of a geometric distribution and solving for formula_178 gives the estimators formula_179 and formula_180 when supported on formula_41 and formula_45 respectively. These estimators are biased since formula_183 as a result of Jensen's inequality. \nMaximum likelihood estimation.\nThe maximum likelihood estimator of formula_34 is the value that maximizes the likelihood function given a sample.308 By finding the zero of the derivative of the log-likelihood function when the distribution is defined over formula_41, the maximum likelihood estimator can be found to be formula_186, where formula_187 is the sample mean. If the domain is formula_45, then the estimator shifts to formula_189. As previously discussed in \u00a7 Method of moments, these estimators are biased.\nRegardless of the domain, the bias is equal to\nformula_190\nwhich yields the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator,\nformula_191\nBayesian inference.\nIn Bayesian inference, the parameter formula_34 is a random variable from a prior distribution with a posterior distribution calculated using Bayes' theorem after observing samples.167 If a beta distribution is chosen as the prior distribution, then the posterior will also be a beta distribution and it is called the conjugate distribution. In particular, if a formula_193 prior is selected, then the posterior, after observing samples formula_194, isformula_195Alternatively, if the samples are in formula_45, the posterior distribution isformula_197Since the expected value of a formula_193 distribution is formula_199,145 as formula_200 and formula_201 approach zero, the posterior mean approaches its maximum likelihood estimate.\nRandom variate generation.\nThe geometric distribution can be generated experimentally from i.i.d. standard uniform random variables by finding the first such random variable to be less than or equal to formula_34. However, the number of random variables needed is also geometrically distributed and the algorithm slows as formula_34 decreases.498\nRandom generation can be done in constant time by truncating exponential random numbers. An exponential random variable formula_204 can become geometrically distributed with parameter formula_34 through formula_206. In turn, formula_204 can be generated from a standard uniform random variable formula_208 altering the formula into formula_209.\nApplications.\nThe geometric distribution is used in many disciplines. In queueing theory, the M/M/1 queue has a steady state following a geometric distribution. In stochastic processes, the Yule Furry process is geometrically distributed. The distribution also arises when modeling the lifetime of a device in discrete contexts. It has also been used to fit data including modeling patients spreading COVID-19.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45927", "revid": "49276436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45927", "title": "Podkayne of Mars", "text": "1963 SF novel by Robert A. Heinlein\nPodkayne of Mars is a science-fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally serialised in \"Worlds of If\" (November 1962, January, March 1963), and published in hardcover in 1963. The novel features a teenage girl named Podkayne \"Poddy\" Fries and her younger brother, Clark, who leave their home on Mars to take a trip on a spaceliner to visit Earth, accompanied by their great-uncle.\nPlot summary.\nThe book is a first-person narrative consisting of the diary of Podkayne Fries, a 15-year-old (Earth years) girl living on Mars with her parents and 11-year-old brother Clark. Due to the unscheduled \"uncorking\" (birth) of their three test-tube babies, Podkayne's parents cancel a much-anticipated trip to Earth. Disappointed, Podkayne confesses her misery to her uncle, Senator Tom Fries, an elder statesman of the Mars government. Tom arranges for Clark and Podkayne, escorted by himself, to get upgraded passage on a luxury liner to Earth.\nDuring boarding, Clark is asked by a customs official \"Anything to declare?\" and facetiously answers \"Two kilos of happy dust!\" As he anticipated, his seemingly flippant remark gets him taken away and searched. This ploy serves to divert attention away from Podkayne's luggage, where he has hidden a package he was paid to smuggle aboard. Podkayne suspects the reason behind her brother's behavior, but cannot prove it. Clark was told it was a present for the captain, but is far too cynical to be taken in. He later carefully opens the package and finds a nuclear bomb, which he disarms and keeps.\nMuch of the description of the voyage is based on Heinlein's own experiences as a naval officer and world traveler. Clark's ploy is taken from a real-life incident, related in Heinlein's \"Tramp Royale\", in which his wife answers the same question with \"heroin\" substituted for the fictitious, but equally illegal, happy dust.\nOnce aboard, they are befriended by \"Girdie\", an attractive, capable, experienced woman left impoverished by her late husband. Much to Podkayne's surprise, the normally very self-centered Clark contracts a severe case of puppy love.\nPodkayne overhears fellow passengers calling the Frieses \"criminals\" (Mars had been a convict colony) and \"savages\" (the Frieses have M\u0101ori ancestry).\nThe liner makes a stop at Venus, which is depicted as a latter-day Las Vegas gone ultra-capitalistic. The planet is controlled by a single corporation; the dream of most of the frantically enterprising residents is to earn enough to buy a single share in it, which guarantees lifelong financial security. Just about anything goes, as long as one can pay for it. The penalty for murder is a fine paid to the corporation for the victim's estimated value plus his projected future earnings. On a less serious level, Heinlein anticipated, by over forty years, television ads in taxicabs (in the book, holographic), which have since been implemented in taxicabs in major cities worldwide.\nThe Frieses are given VIP treatment by the Venus Corporation and Podkayne is escorted by Dexter Cunha, the Chairman's dashing son. She begins to realize that Tom is much more than just her pinochle-playing uncle. When Clark vanishes and even the corporation is unable to find him, Tom reveals that he is on a secret diplomatic mission, as the accredited representative of the Martian government to a vital conference on Luna (the Moon). The children have been his protective coloration\u2014Tom appearing to be a doddering uncle escorting two young people on a tour of the Solar System. Clark has been kidnapped by members of a political faction opposed to Tom.\nPodkayne makes an ill-judged attempt to rescue Clark by herself and falls into the kidnappers' clutches as well\u2014only to find her uncle caught too. The captors' scheme is to use the children to blackmail the uncle into doing their bidding at the Luna conference. They return Uncle Tom to Venusberg after showing him that they have the children. Clark realizes that once Uncle Tom is released, no matter what happens, their kidnappers will have little reason to keep their prisoners alive. He is prepared, however, and engineers an escape, kills his captors, but forgets to disable the nuclear bomb he had intended to go off only if they failed in their escape.\nTwo versions of the ending.\nIn Heinlein's original ending, Podkayne is killed. This did not please his publisher, who demanded and got a rewrite over the author's bitter objections. In a letter to Lurton Blassingame, his literary agent, Heinlein complained that it would be like \"revising Romeo and Juliet to let the young lovers live happily ever after.\" He also declared that changing the end \"isn't real life, because in real life, not everything ends happily.\"\nIn the original ending, after they escape from the kidnappers to a safe distance, Podkayne remembers that a semi-intelligent Venerian \"fairy\" baby has been left behind, and returns to rescue it. When the bomb that Clark leaves for the kidnappers blows up, Podkayne is killed, shielding the young fairy with her body. Clark takes over the narrative for the last chapter. The story ends with a hint of hope for him, as he admits his responsibility for what happened to Podkayne\u2014that he \"fubbed it, mighty dry\"\u2014then shows some human feeling by regretting his inability to cry and describes his plan to raise the fairy himself.\nIn the revised version, Podkayne is badly injured by the bomb, but not fatally. Uncle Tom, in a phone conversation with Podkayne's father, blames the parents\u2014especially the mother\u2014for neglecting the upbringing of the children. Uncle Tom feels that Clark is dangerous and maladjusted, and attributes this to the mother giving priority to her career. Clark still takes over as the narrator, and, again, regrets that Podkayne was hurt and plans to take care of the fairy, this time because Podkayne will want to see it when she is better. This is the ending that appeared when the book was published in 1963.\nThe 1993 Baen edition included both endings (which differ only on the last page) and featured a \"pick the ending\" contest, in which readers were asked to submit essays on which ending they preferred. The 1995 edition included both endings, Jim Baen's own postlude to the story, and twenty-seven of the essays. The ending in which Podkayne dies was declared the winner. Among the reasons readers favored this ending were that they felt Heinlein should have been free to create his own story, and they believed the changed ending turned a tragedy into a mere adventure, and not a very well constructed one at that. This ending has appeared in all subsequent editions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45929", "revid": "50966387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45929", "title": "Dark Angel (American TV series)", "text": "American science fiction action drama television series\nDark Angel is an American science fiction action drama television series that aired on Fox from October 3, 2000, to May 3, 2002. Created by James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee, it stars Jessica Alba in her breakthrough role. Set in 2019, the series chronicles the life of Max Guevara (Alba), a genetically enhanced runaway supersoldier who escapes from a covert military facility as a child. In a dystopian near-future Seattle, she tries to lead a normal life while eluding capture by government agents and searching for her brothers and sisters scattered in the aftermath of their escape. \"Dark Angel\" was the only show produced by the company Cameron/Eglee Productions, with principal photography in Vancouver, at Lionsgate Studios.\nThe high-budget pilot episode marked Cameron's television debut and was heavily promoted by Fox, reaching 17.4 million viewers. The first season, which was shown on Tuesday nights in the United States, received mainly positive reviews and won several awards, including the People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama, and averaged 10.4 million viewers per episode. Alba's portrayal of Max also received mostly positive reviews and several awards. For the second season, the show was moved to the less desirable air time of Friday night and received some criticism for new plot elements. It suffered from a drop in ratings, averaging 6 million viewers per episode, and was canceled.\nA series of novels continued the storyline, and a video game adaptation was also released. \"Dark Angel\" is considered to have gothic and female empowerment themes; Max followed a long line of strong female characters in Cameron's work, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley. Cameron was also influenced by the manga \"Battle Angel Alita\". \"Dark Angel\" is considered to be part of a wave of shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s that feature strong female characters, alongside \"\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"La Femme Nikita\", and \"Alias\".\nPlot.\nSeason one.\nIn February 2009, a genetically enhanced nine-year-old female supersoldier designated as X5-452 (Geneva Locke) escapes along with eleven others from a secret U.S. government institution code-named Manticore, where they were born, raised, and trained to be soldiers and assassins. On June 1, 2009, months after the twelve X5s' escape, terrorists detonate an electromagnetic pulse weapon in the atmosphere over the U.S., which destroys the vast majority of computer and communication systems, throwing the country into chaos.\nTen years later in 2019, the now 19-year-old X5-452 (Jessica Alba), who calls herself Max Guevara, struggles to search for her Manticore brothers and sisters. In the recovering United States, which is now barely more than a developing country, she tries to live a relatively normal life and evade capture by Manticore, which wishes to recover its lost asset. Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly), an underground cyber-journalist with the alias Eyes Only, attempts to recruit her to help fight corruption in the post-Pulse world. She initially refuses but accepts after Cale is rendered a paraplegic while attempting the assignment for which he was attempting to recruit her. A romantic interest buds between the two. While assisting Cale, Max also makes a living as a bicycle messenger at Jam Pony, a courier company, along with her friends Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller), Herbal Thought (Alimi Ballard), and Sketchy (Richard Gunn). Other X5s are periodically introduced, most significantly the unit leader Zack (William Gregory Lee). The Manticore hunt for the escaped X5s is led by Colonel Donald Lydecker (John Savage). Near the end of the season, Lydecker is betrayed by his superior, the even more ruthless Elizabeth Renfro (Nana Visitor), and he defects from Manticore. He aids Max and Zack in an assault on Manticore headquarters. Max is badly wounded and captured. Zack, who has also been captured, commits suicide to provide Max with his heart, as she needs an X5 heart transplant to survive.\nSeason two.\nCale exposes Manticore to the world. Renfro decides to burn the facility to cover up the evidence and is killed in the process. Aided by Joshua (Kevin Durand), a transgenic with conspicuous canine DNA, Max escapes the facility and frees the other transgenics, including Alec (Jensen Ackles), a fellow X5 and clone of Max's brother Ben (also Jensen Ackles) whom she was forced to kill in the first season, who later joins Jam Pony. When Max is reunited with Cale he immediately becomes ill and almost dies. Max discovers that Manticore has infected her with a virus specifically designed to kill Cale, and the two must avoid all physical contact to keep him alive. Max learns that Joshua was the first transgenic created by Sandeman, Manticore's founder. Over the course of the season, it is revealed that a millennia-old breeding cult has bred their own advanced humans who rival the Manticore-produced transgenics in their abilities. Ames White (Martin Cummins), a government agent tasked with eliminating the freed transgenics, is revealed to be a member of the cult. When a strange message written in Max's genetic code makes an appearance on her skin it is revealed that Sandeman is a renegade from the breeding cult and Ames White is his son. White is still loyal to the cult and hates his father's transgenic creations with a passion. Believing that the special sequences Sandeman buried in Max's DNA are a threat to the breeding cult's plans for the extinction of normal humanity, they attempt to kill her, but she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding. When the police begin to surround Terminal City Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run. The series ends with the military surrounding Terminal City as the residents raise their newly designed flag from one of the buildings, and wait for a possible invasion.\nCast and characters.\nThe first season introduced Jessica Alba as the main character Max Guevara (X5-452), a genetically enhanced transgenic super-soldier who escaped from a government facility named Manticore. She works as a bike messenger for the courier company Jam Pony during the day and as a cat burglar at night. Michael Weatherly played Logan Cale, the show's second most prominent character. Cale is a wealthy cyber-journalist and vigilante who operates under the alias Eyes Only. He recruits Max to assist with his campaign against corruption and crime in return for helping her find information on her fellow Manticore escapees. Main roles were given to several of the couriers at Jam Pony, including Valarie Rae Miller as Cynthia \"Original Cindy\" McEachin, Richard Gunn as Calvin \"Sketchy\" Theodore, and Alimi Ballard as Herbal Thought. J. C. MacKenzie played Reagan \"Normal\" Ronald, the company's boss, and Jennifer Blanc played Kendra Maibaum, Max's first roommate, and John Savage played the main antagonist, Col. Donald Lydecker, who is trying to recapture Max and the other Manticore escapees.\nThe Lydecker character is written out of the series early in the second season, and Herbal Thought and Kendra Maibaum do not appear at all. Season two introduces Kevin Durand as Joshua, an experimental creature from Manticore who has distinct canine facial features. It also brings back Jensen Ackles as Alec McDowell (X5-494), who is an identical twin of Ben (X5-493), one of the original 12 escapees from Manticore, and introduces Ashley Scott as Asha Barlow, a resistance fighter who has a romantic interest in Cale. Martin Cummins portrayed the season's main antagonist Ames White, a National Security Agency agent tasked with destroying the Manticore escapees.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nFollowing his success with the film \"Titanic\", director James Cameron teamed up with Charles H. Eglee with whom he had previously worked on projects including \"\". The two formed a production company, Cameron/Eglee Productions, and began working on ideas for a television series. They considered several options, including a family drama, before deciding on the idea of \"Dark Angel\". Cameron said they began with the idea that Max would be a genetic construct who \"looked normal on the outside but was different on the cellular, genetic level. We explore what that could mean.\" Cameron was influenced by the manga \"Battle Angel Alita\", which he was originally intending to after completing \"Dark Angel\".\n\"Dark Angel\" would be the first and only work by Cameron/Eglee Productions. Max followed a long line of strong female characters in Cameron's work, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley. Cameron said \"it's a win/win situation\" as \"women respond to characters who appear strong and capable\" and young male audiences \"want to see girls kick ass\". Later they decided to set the series in a post-social collapse world, saying that the hysteria surrounding Y2K served as inspiration; in the series, an electromagnetic pulse previously destroyed every computer in the United States. Working titles for the series included \"Experimental Girl\" and \"Maximum Girl\". The project marked Cameron's television debut; he worked mainly as a writer and executive producer for the series.\nCasting and filming.\nMore than a thousand young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying \"she had her head down, she was reading out of the script\u00a0... she didn't present herself all that well. But there was something about the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked.\" Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but kept coming back to Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: \"We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backward, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang.\" To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.\nThe two-hour premiere episode cost up to $10 million to produce, and Cameron reportedly \"brought the pilot in on time and on budget\". Subsequent episodes had a considerably smaller budget. Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere, paying for theatrical trailers, billboards, and guerilla marketing. Cameron took a \"very basic view\" of the show's chance of success, saying: \"If it flies, it flies. If it doesn't, it doesn't\u00a0... If people connect with it, which I hope they will, fine. If we don't find an audience, we deserve to be off the air. It's that simple.\" Eglee admitted the series had been \"routinely over budget\" in the first season, and feared that this would be a factor in whether or not the show was renewed for a second season, though Cameron downplayed these concerns.\nFox \"just barely\" renewed the series for a second season. The budget for episodes in season two was $1.3 million each. After the intended director of the final episode did not work out, Cameron decided to step in and fill the position. He did this partially for the experience but also to show the network the potential for a third season. It was his first experience directing a TV drama.\nThe producers were initially told a third season had been approved, but two days later Fox informed them that the series had been canceled.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They called us on Saturday and told us we were on schedule and we'd been picked up. We got together Saturday night and celebrated. Sunday goes by, and Monday morning we get a call saying, \"No, you're not on the schedule! It's been changed.\" I've never heard of that happening. But then, I'd never been around television.\u00a0... We were supposed to be on a plane on Monday to go to the [network] upfront in New York on Tuesday. They called us that day and told us not to go! I was pissed!\u2014\u200a\n\"Dark Angel\" was set in Seattle, and filmed in Vancouver at Lions Gate Studios. Other filming locations included the Vancouver Art Gallery, as well as Buntzen Lake and Riverview Hospital, also in British Columbia.\nUnproduced season.\nIn the DVD commentary for \"Freak Nation\", the series finale, Charles H. Eglee explained what had been planned for season three. The intention was to bring together the storylines of seasons one (\"Manticore\") and two (\"Breeding Cult\") and reveal the mythology of \"Dark Angel\". The season would reveal that thousands of years ago, Earth passed through a comet's tail which deposited viral material that killed 97% of the human race. The breeding cult preserved the survivors' genetic immunity so that when the comet returned, only members of the cult would survive. Sandeman, a cult member, and Max's creator betrayed the cult and decided to give this genetic immunity to the rest of humanity through Max, who would be the savior of the human race. There were multiple ideas on how to spread Max's immunity, including an air burst that would disperse the antibody through the atmosphere, or attaching the immunity to a common cold virus (Eglee detailed how a scene would show Original Cindy sneezing as part of the beginning of the immunity spread). This storyline is expanded upon in the final \"Dark Angel\" novel \"After the Dark\" though when the comet returns nobody falls ill, and it is believed that the cult simply had a false prediction.\nBroadcast history.\nThe first season premiered in the United States on Tuesday, October 3, 2000, from 9:00 pm until 11:00 pm. Fox had to obtain agreements from its affiliates to broadcast past 10:00 pm, as most of them air local news programs at this time. In subsequent weeks the show aired from 9:00 pm till 10:00 pm Tuesdays. During its first season, the show was preempted on several occasions, including by the 2000 World Series, the Billboard Music Awards and coverage of the presidential election. The frequent preemptions became a running joke on the set. \"Dark Angel's\" scheduled air time put it in direct competition with \"Angel\" on The WB. Critics debated which of the similarly named shows would dominate the time-slot. Jonathon Storm from \"Philadelphia Media Network\" believed that \"Dark Angel\" would prove victorious, while Brad Adgate, a research director at \"Horizon Media\", predicted that \"Dark Angel\" would only initially take the lead in the ratings, as \"Angel's\" strong fanbase would prevail in the long run. Brad Turrell, executive vice-president of Network Communication for the \"WB\" conceded that the heavy promotion for \"Dark Angel\" would give it higher initial ratings at first but believed that as \"Angel\" was a \"better show\" it would not be affected long-term. Concerned that there might be confusion between the two shows, the \"WB\" took out a full page ad in \"TV Guide\", which read \"There is only ONE. David Boreanaz is ANGEL.\" \"Angel\" won the time slot when Fox moved the broadcast time of \"Dark Angel\" to 8:00 pm on Fridays for its second season, where it preceded the new series \"Pasadena\".\nThe final episode of the series aired on May 3, 2002, as a special 90-minute episode. \"Dark Angel\" has been syndicated on Syfy and the El Rey Network in the United States and on E4 and the Horror Channel in the UK.\nMusic.\nThe score for the \"Dark Angel\" pilot was composed and conducted by Joel McNeely. The pilot score track \"Bicycle Ride\" was used in the end credits for the duration of the series. The pilot score was released in full as part of the original publicity press kit, titled \"Dark Angel: Complete Score from the Dark Angel Pilot\". The 37-track CD was for promotional use only and not for resale. McNeely returned to score the entire series, making frequent use of \"grumbling timpani rolls, bass drum beats and shrill brass and violin crescendos that familiarly sketch the action arcs of the narrative.\" Traditional orchestral elements are integrated with innovative electronic sounds and female vocals to create a sense of Max's \"otherworldliness\", \"haunting wind chimes, pseudo-Orientalist refrains and extenuated high-pitched eerie sounds\" evoke Max's super-human abilities, and \"driving hip hop bass beats with heavy percussive effects [and] high-pitched feedback and reverberation\" convey Max's struggles with violence and her memories of Manticore. The theme song for the series was composed by Chuck D and Gary G-Wiz. Both McNeely and G-Wiz cited \"Dark Angel\" as an opportunity to push sonic boundaries; G-Wiz stated that Eglee and music supervisor Randy Gerston kept calling him and telling him to make the theme song \"crazier\". McNeely said scoring the series was \"like the difference between jazz and classical music. I'm a jazz player, so \"Dark Angel\" is as free form and as weird as we want to get.\"\nA soundtrack album consisting of hip hop and R&amp;B songs was released on April 23, 2002, through Artemis Records. Eglee explained that he and Cameron began with the idea that they could do a \"hip hop youth ensemble thing\", noting that \"hip hop had become the dominant influence in the country [and] in the world\" and that they saw an opportunity to give the future of \"Dark Angel\" the soundtrack of contemporary American popular culture. In the soundtrack's liner notes, Eglee writes:Reminiscent of another time and place\u00a0... that part of the Bronx in the late 1970s known as Fort Apache: a place that for white America, defined lack and limitation, violence and hopelessness. What white Americans couldn't see or hear then was the beautiful thing being birthed there, which, years later, would come to be known as Hip Hop.\u00a0... This album remembers the foundations of Hip Hop as it contemplates its future. Randy Gerston said that because of the near future setting of the series, he avoided any major hit songs as these would not sound futuristic. This gave them the opportunity to discover new talent instead. The album features predominately female hip hop and neo soul artists whose lyrics typically \"focus on the expression of female agency and power \u2013 particularly with regard to sexuality.\" It peaked at No. 50 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic gave the soundtrack three out of five stars. He noted the lack of major artists on the album and commented that it \"seems to be a female-orientated soundtrack, perhaps because of the show's female lead character\". Birchmeier said many of the songs were \"quite impressive\" and that it \"exceeds your expectations for a television show soundtrack\".\nThemes.\n\"Dark Angel\" is considered to be in the cyberpunk genre. Writing in \"Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture\", Lorna Jowett considered \"Dark Angel\" to be a \"hybrid of science fiction, Gothic, and action\" which incorporated forms and themes from all three genres. Jowett compared \"Dark Angel\" to the Gothic novel \"Frankenstein\", saying that Max's genetic engineering makes her a \"postmodern Frankenstein's monster, blurring boundaries between human and monster\". Kathleen McConnell in \"Gothic Studies\" also compared Max's unconventional conception to Frankenstein's monster, and cited several other Gothic themes in the series. She states that Max fits the model of a Gothic heroine who \"ostensibly appear[s] to be conforming to their accepted role within the patriarchy but who actually subvert the father's power at every possible occasion.\" In her book \"Post-feminist Impasses in Popular Heroine Television\", Alison Horbury theorizes that \"Dark Angel\", along with the shows \"Alias\", \"La Femme Nikita\", and \"Dollhouse\" have themes of abduction, physical and symbolic rape, motherlessness, and the discovery of a sister.\nSeveral academics have considered \"Dark Angel\" to be part of a wave of shows in the late 90s and early 2000s including \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"\", and \"La Femme Nikita\" that feature strong female characters. Writing in \"Science Fiction Film &amp; Television\", Clarice Butkus noted Max has been considered to be a \"distinctly millennial post-third-wave feminist warrior. She also felt that Max's relationship and dialogue with Original Cindy, an African American lesbian, conveyed female empowerment. For example, Cindy encourages Max not to feel guilt over her sexual behaviour and instead to embrace a traditionally masculine approach to sex. McConnell and Jowett also cited Max as an example of female empowerment; Jowett considered Max to be the \"usual postmodern, postfeminist representation of the female action hero with [at least] a reversal or [at most] a mixture of traditional gender traits.\"\nButkus stated that \"Dark Angel\" repeatedly paid homage to the film \"Blade Runner\". Lydecker, the \"flawed antagonist\" of \"Dark Angel\" is said to be a transposition of Deckard, the \"flawed hero\" of \"Blade Runner\". Alec McDowell/X5-494's love interest is named Rachel, believed to be a reference to the replicant Rachael, though in \"Dark Angel\" it is McDowell and not Rachel who is bio-engineered. His flashbacks of this traumatic relationship use piano music similar to that used in \"Blade Runner\" to denote memories and a desire for former times. Alec's genetic memory enhancements enable him, with only a few hours practice, to play a detailed piano piece by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, the composer originally scripted for the scene in \"Blade Runner\" where Rachael inexplicably finds herself able to play the piano; both characters are considered to be pre-programmed by state forces to master superhuman skills.\nReception and legacy.\nInitial reaction to the series and Max's character was mostly positive, with favorable reviews in \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Time\". Hal Boedeker of the \"Orlando Sentinel\" said: \"Television's newest warrior woman possesses skills worthy of Catwoman, Xena, Emma Peel, and Wonder Woman.\" Howard Rosenberg said: \"If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping out the entire planet.\" However Joyce Millman said Max was \"little more than lips and ass\" and considered the series to be an expensive Britney Spears music video. \"People\" ran a negative review of the Pilot episode in October 2000, though in December they listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the \"breakthrough\" performances of 2000.\nThe first episode was behind only \"\" as the most watched new show of the week, albeit in a week with fewer new shows because of the presidential debate coverage. Fox chose to debut \"Dark Angel\" instead of airing the first presidential debate, a move which TV analyst Marc Berman praised, saying: \"The people who watch the debates aren't the people who'll tune into \"Dark Angel\" anyway\", though he predicted that the premiere's high ratings would not hold up as the show competed against more varied competition in subsequent weeks. It was the tenth most popular show overall that week, attracting 17.4 million viewers. The first season averaged 10.4 million viewers per episode, ranking number 59 for the 2000\u201301 season. Cameron said he did not know if the broadcast time change for the second season would have a positive or negative effect on the show's ratings, though R. D. Heldenfels of the \"Sun Journal\" noted the poor ratings of Friday night television, especially the low viewing rates among 18 to 24-year-olds, the age-group that \"Dark Angel\" was most popular with. The new time slot saw a ratings drop; for the second season \"Dark Angel\" averaged 6 million viewers, ranking number 114 for the 2001\u201302 season in the Nielsen ratings. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the first seasons holds a score of 65% based on 23 reviews, with a critics consensus stating: \"Jessica Alba does a solid job as a post-apocalyptic heroine in \"Dark Angel\", a sleek \u2013 if somewhat predictable \u2013 cyberpunk show.\nCommenting on the release of the second season, Cynthia Fuchs of \"PopMatters\" said the first season of \"Dark Angel\" was one of the \"few straight-up successes, a ratings hit among the coveted 'youth' demographic.\" She praised the series but clarified: \"I'm not getting carried away: Jim Cameron is not going to be making revolutionary art anytime soon.\" Michael Sauter of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the first season a B+ and spoke highly of Alba, saying that \"for a while [she was] TV's hottest kick-butt heroine\". Elka Karl of Common Sense Media gave the entire series 3 out of 5 stars, saying: \"While the dialogue sometimes falls flat, overall the show is well-scripted and well acted, and Alba does an excellent job of carrying the series. Dark Angel isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is compelling television that teen sci-fi fans will enjoy.\" While praising the first season, Randy Dankievitch of \"TVOvermind\" labelled the second season \"silly\", criticizing \"dumb stories\" like Max's dream episode \"Boo\", the virus that prevents Logan and Max having physical contact, and the various half-animal Manticore experiments that are revealed.\nWriting in his book \"The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television\", John Kenneth Muir said it was necessary for Cameron to set \"Dark Angel\" in the future because the prosperity of the U.S. in 2000 \"offered little possibility for crime, squalor and other societal problems\". While criticizing certain plot elements in the second season as contributing to the show's downfall, Muir said that larger factors in ratings dropping were the September 11 attacks, the Enron scandal, and the depletion of the U.S. government's surplus, which changed \"Dark Angel's\" \"futuristic vision of recession in a Third-World America\" from an interesting, far-fetched premise to a \"depressing reminder that things could still get worse\".\nIn 2004, Max was ranked number 17 on \"TV Guide\"'s list of the 25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends, and in 2012, Dave Golder of GamesRadar ranked her number 49 on his list of the 100 sexiest women in sci-fi. In 2009, AfterEllen ranked Original Cindy number 6 on their list of the Top 11 Lesbian/Bi Sidekicks. In 2015, Kayti Burt of \"Den of Geek\" included \"Dark Angel\" at the top of her list of \"10 Sci-Fi Shows That Don't Get Enough Love\". In 2016, it was recognized that \"Dark Angel\" was the first American television series to feature an openly transgender actress playing a transgender character. In the season one episode \"Out\", transgender actress Jessica Crockett portrayed \"Louise\", a young woman on a date with Normal.\nThe 2007 film \"Hitman\" re-used footage of Max and other Manticore children in training from \"Dark Angel\". It was used to portray the Hitman protagonist Agent 47, a cloned assassin who, like the Manticore children, has a barcode on the back of his head.\nAccolades.\nIn its first season \"Dark Angel\" won the Favorite Television New Dramatic Series award at the 27th People's Choice Awards, and was nominated for Best Television by the International Horror Guild Awards. The production team was nominated for the Excellence in Production Design Award by the Art Directors Guild. Editor Stephen Mark won Best Edited Motion Picture for Commercial Television at the Eddie Awards for the pilot episode, and the pilot was also nominated for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for the 53rd Primetime Emmy Awards and \"Best Visual Effects: Dramatic Series\" by the Leo Awards. \"Dark Angel\" was nominated for the 2001 Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing \u2013 Television Movies and Specials \u2013 Dialogue &amp; ADR, and for Choice Drama at the 2001 Teen Choice Awards.\nJessica Alba won Best Actress on Television at the 27th Saturn Awards, Breakout Star of the Year at the TV Guide Awards, Outstanding Actress in a New Television Series at the ALMA Awards, and Choice Actress at the 2001 Teen Choice Awards. She also received nominations for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama for the 58th Golden Globe Awards and Best Performance in a TV Drama Series \u2013 Leading Young Actress for the 22nd Young Artist Awards.\n\"Dark Angel\" was nominated for fewer awards in its second season. It was nominated for Choice Drama/Action Adventure for the 2002 Teen Choice Awards, where Alba was also nominated for Choice Actress, Drama. Alba was also nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Television Series for the ALMA Awards. At the Leo Awards the episode \"Boo\" received a nomination for Best Visual Effects: Dramatic Series, and David Geddes won Best Cinematography: Dramatic Series for the episode \"Two\".\nHome media.\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released seasons 1 and 2 of \"Dark Angel\" on DVD in region 1 (R1), as well as a dual-coded region 2 and 4 (R2/4) set in 2003, as six-disc sets packaged in cardboard sleeves containing three DVD cases each of two discs. Season 1 was released in R2/4 in February and R1 in May, and season 2 was released in R2/4 in June and R1 in October.\nThe R1 releases contain several special features, including four episodes with optional commentary in each season, bloopers, deleted scenes, and featurettes. The R2/4 releases contain no commentaries and fewer other special features, but the episodes are presented in anamorphic widescreen, while R1 releases are fullscreen. Adam Tyner of \"DVD Talk\" gave the R1 first season three out of five stars for audio and video, and three and a half stars for special features. Shannon Nutt of \"DVD Talk\" gave the R1 second season three stars out of five for audio and video, and two and a half stars for extras, stating: \"it appears [to have] a decent number of features, but then you discover the length of each one and really feel short-changed by Fox\". She also noted the episode's commentary was mainly by writers and producers, and did not feature James Cameron or any of the actors.\nBoth seasons were re-released in R1 on June 5, 2007, with slim packaging consisting of one plastic case containing all six discs (which were unchanged in content and cosmetics).\nRelated media.\nA video game of the same name based on the series was developed by Radical Entertainment, published by Sierra Entertainment and released for PlayStation 2 on November 18, 2002, and later on Xbox. Alba and Weatherly voiced their respective characters in the game. Development of the game started before the series was cancelled, and the game was met with mixed to negative reception upon release. Brett Todd of GameSpot gave the game 3.8 out of 10, saying: \"Although it's impossible to say whether or not the developers' morale was affected by the cancellation of the series, this third-person action adventure plays like it was cranked out to fulfill a contract\" and concluded \"the development of this game probably should have been cancelled at the same time as the television series\". Duke Ferris from Game Revolution gave the game a 'D+', saying that while fans of \"Dark Angel\" would enjoy it as it \"mirrors an episode of the show almost exactly\", anybody else was likely to find it boring.\nThree original novels written by Max Allan Collins expand upon the \"Dark Angel\" television series, with two picking up directly where the series ended, and another serving as a prequel. A companion book, \"Dark Angel: The Eyes Only Dossier\", was written by D.A. Stern.\nThe companion book, \"Dark Angel: The Eyes Only Dossier\", begins with a letter written by Logan Cale during the stand-off at Terminal City. It is addressed to Detective Matt Sung, a recurring character from the series who aides Logan, instructing him that the package he is sending him contains documents pertaining to the four most critical Eyes Only investigations. If he is killed by the potential invasion of Terminal City, Logan wants Sung to carry on the investigations. The rest of the book contains the documents relating to the four investigations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Quotations related to at Wikiquote"}
{"id": "45936", "revid": "50984918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45936", "title": "Spirit possession", "text": "Purported control of a human body by spirits, ghosts, demons, or gods\nSpirit possession is an altered state of consciousness and associated behaviors purportedly caused by the control of a human body and its functions by spirits, ghosts, demons, angels, or gods. The concept of spirit possession exists in many cultures and religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Dominican Vud\u00fa, Haitian Vodou, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Wicca, and Southeast Asian, African, and Native American traditions. Depending on the cultural context in which it is found, possession may be thought of as voluntary or involuntary and may be considered to have beneficial or detrimental effects on the host. The experience of spirit possession sometimes serves as evidence in support of belief in the existence of spirits, deities or demons. In a 1969 study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, spirit-possession beliefs were found to exist in 74% of a sample of 488 societies in all parts of the world, with the highest numbers of believing societies in Pacific cultures and the lowest incidence among Native Americans of both North and South America. As Pentecostal and Charismatic Christian churches move into both African and Oceanic areas, a merger of belief can take place, with demons becoming representative of the \"old\" indigenous religions, which Christian ministers attempt to exorcise.\nOrganized religions.\nChristianity.\nFrom the beginning of Christianity, adherents have held that possession derives from the Devil (i.e. Satan) and demons. In the battle between Satan and Heaven, Satan is believed to engage in \"spiritual attacks\", including demonic possession, against human beings by the use of supernatural powers to harm them physically or psychologically. Prayer for deliverance, blessings upon the person's house or body, sacraments, and exorcisms are generally used to drive the demon out.\nSome theologians, such as \u00c1ngel Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, say that mediums, like the ones mentioned in Leviticus 20:27, were possessed by demons. Another possible case of demonic possession in the Old Testament includes the false prophets that King Ahab relied upon before re-capturing Ramoth-Gilead in 1 Kings 22. They were described as being empowered by a deceiving spirit.\nThe New Testament mentions several episodes in which Jesus drove out demons from persons. Whilst most Christians believe that demonic possession is an involuntary affliction, some biblical verses have been interpreted as indicating that possession can be voluntary. For example, Alfred Plummer writes that when Satan entered into Judas Iscariot in John 13:27, this was because Judas had continually agreed to Satan's suggestions to betray Jesus and had wholly submitted to him.\nThe New Testament indicates that people can be possessed by demons, but that the demons respond and submit to Jesus Christ's authority:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the synagogue, there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, \"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are\u2014the Holy One of God!\" \"Be quiet!\" Jesus said sternly. \"Come out of him!\" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. All the people were amazed and said to each other, \"What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!\" And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area\u2014\u200a and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And when He came to the other side into the country of the [Gadarenes](Gergesa), two demon-possessed men confronted Him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way. 29 And they cried out, saying, \"What business do You have with us, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?\" 30 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding at a distance from them. 31 And the demons begged Him, saying, \"If You are going to cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs.\" 32 And He said to them, \"Go!\" And they came out and went into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and [c]drowned in the waters. 33 And the herdsmen ran away, and went to the city and reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 34 And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they pleaded with Him to leave their region.\u2014\u200a\nIt also indicates that demons can possess animals as in the exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac.\nThis is dramatic in European literature and for adherents to Christianity.\nSee also Luke 8:26-37.\nThe Gospel writings state that Mary Magdelene had demons cast out as well.\nCatholicism.\nRoman Catholic doctrine states that angels are non-corporeal, spiritual beings with intelligence and will. Fallen angels, or demons, are able to \"demonically possess\" individuals without the victim's knowledge or consent, leaving them morally blameless.\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" says that there is only one apparent case of demonic possession in the Old Testament, of King Saul being tormented by an \"evil spirit\" (1 Samuel 16:14), but this depends on interpreting the Hebrew word \"r\u00fbah\" as implying a personal influence which it may not; as a result, even this example is described as \"not very certain\". In addition, Saul was only described to be tormented, rather than possessed, and he was relieved from these torments by having David play the lyre to him.\nCatholic exorcists differentiate between \"ordinary\" Satanic/demonic activity or influence (mundane everyday \"temptations\") and \"extraordinary\" Satanic/demonic activity, which can take six different forms, ranging from complete control by Satan or demons to voluntary submission:\nIn the Roman Ritual, true demonic or Satanic possession has been characterized since the Middle Ages, by the following four typical characteristics:\nThe \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\" states, \"Ecclesiastical authorities are reluctant to admit diabolical possession in most cases, because many can be explained by physical or mental illness alone. Therefore, medical and psychological examinations are necessary before the performance of major exorcism. The standard that must be met is that of moral certitude (\"De exorcismis\", 16). For an exorcist to be morally certain, or beyond reasonable doubt, that he is dealing with a genuine case of demonic possession, there must be no other reasonable explanation for the phenomena in question\".\nOfficial Catholic doctrine affirms that demonic possession can occur as distinguished from mental illness, but stresses that cases of mental illness should not be misdiagnosed as demonic influence. Catholic exorcisms can occur only under the authority of a bishop and in accordance with strict rules; a simple exorcism also occurs during baptism.\nAnglican.\nThe infliction of demonic torment upon an individual has been chronicled in premodern Protestant literature. In 1597, King James discussed four methods of daemonic influence upon an individual in his book Daemonologie:\nKing James attested that the symptoms derived from demonic possession could be discernible from natural diseases. He rejected the symptoms and signs prescribed by the Catholic church as vain (e.g. rage begotten from Holy Water, fear of the Cross, etc.) and found the exorcism rites to be troublesome and ineffective to recite. The Rites of the Catholic Church to remedy the torment of demonic spirits were rejected as counterfeit since few possessed could be cured by them. In James' view: \"It is easy then to understand that the casting out of Devils, is by virtue of fasting and prayer, and in-calling of the name of God, suppose many imperfections be in the person that is the instrument, as CHRIST himself teaches us (Mat. 7) of the power that false Prophets all have cast out devils\".\nIn medieval Great Britain, the Christian church had offered suggestions on safeguarding one's home. Suggestions ranged from dousing a household with holy water, placing wax and herbs on thresholds to \"ward off witches occult\", and avoiding certain areas of townships known to be frequented by witches and Devil worshippers after dark. Afflicted persons were restricted from entering the church, but might share the shelter of the porch with lepers and persons of offensive life. After the prayers, if quiet, they might come in to receive the bishop's blessing and listen to the sermon. They were fed daily and prayed over by the exorcists and, in case of recovery, after a fast of from 20 to 40 days, were admitted to the Eucharist, and their names and cures entered in the church records. In 1603, the Church of England forbade its clergy from performing exorcisms because of numerous fraudulent cases of demonic possession.\nBaptist.\nIn May 2021, the Baptist Deliverance Study Group of the Baptist Union of Great Britain, a Christian denomination, issued a \"warning against occult spirituality following the rise in people trying to communicate with the dead\". The commission reported that \"becoming involved in activities such as Spiritualism can open up a doorway to great spiritual oppression which requires a Christian rite to set that person free\".\nIn September 2023, Pastor Rick Morrow of Beulah Church in Richland, Missouri gave a sermon in which he presented the cause of autism in the following way: \"the devil's attacked them, he's brought this infirmity upon them, he's got them where he wants them\". He asserted that the cure for the neurodevelopmental disorder was prayer by claiming to \"know a minister who has seen lots of kids that are autistic, that he cast that demon out, and they were healed, and then he had to pray and their brain was rewired and they were fixed.\"\nMembers of the pastor's community found his comment to be \"derogatory toward individuals with certain disabilities.\" Their public outcry led to Morrow's resignation from the school board on which he was a member.\nEvangelical.\nIn both charismatic and evangelical Christianity, exorcisms of demons are often carried out by individuals or groups belong to the deliverance ministries movement. According to these groups, symptoms of such possessions can include chronic fatigue syndrome, homosexuality, addiction to pornography, and alcoholism. The New Testament's description of people who had evil spirits includes a knowledge of future events (Acts 16:16) and great strength (Act 19:13\u201316), among others, and shows that those with evil spirits can speak of Christ (Mark 3:7\u201311). Some Evangelical denominations believe that demonic possession is not possible if one has already professed their faith in Christ, because the Holy Spirit already occupies the body and a demon cannot enter.\nIslam.\nVarious types of creatures, such as \"jinn\", \"shayatin\", \"\u02bbafarit\", found within Islamic culture, are often held to be responsible for spirit possession. Spirit possession appears in both Islamic theology and wider cultural tradition.\nAlthough opposed by some Muslim scholars, sleeping near a graveyard or a tomb is believed to enable contact with the ghosts of the dead, who visit the sleeper in dreams and provide hidden knowledge. Possession by \"\u02bbafarit\" (a vengeful ghost) are said to grant the possessed some supernatural powers, but it drives them insane as well.\n\"Jinn\" (singular \"jinni\") are much more physical than spirits. Due to their subtle bodies, which are composed of fire and air (\"marijin min nar\"), they are purported to be able to possess the bodies of humans. Such physical intrusion of the jinn is conceptually different from the whisperings of the devils. Since \"jinn\" are not necessarily evil, they are distinguished from cultural concepts of possession by devils/demons.\nSince such \"jinn\" are said to have free will, they can have their own reasons to possess humans and are not necessarily harmful. There are various reasons given as to why a \"jinni\" might seek to possess an individual, such as falling in love with them, taking revenge for hurting them or their relatives, or other undefined reasons. At an intended possession, the covenant with the \"jinni\" must be renewed. Soothsayers (\"k\u0101hin\" pl. \"kuhh\u0101n\"), would use such possession to gain hidden knowledge. Inspirations from jinn by poets requires neither possession nor obedience to the jinn. Their relationship is rather described as mutual.\nThe concept of jinn-possession is alien to the Quran and derives from pagan notions. It is widespread among Muslims and also accepted by most Islamic scholars. It is part of the \"aqida\" (theological doctrines) in the tradition of Ashari, and the Atharis, such as ibn Taimiyya and ibn Qayyim. Among Maturidites it is debated, as some accept it, but it has been challenged since the early years by Maturidite scholars such as al-Rustughfan\u012b. The Mu'tazila are associated with substituting jinn-possession by devilish-whisperings, denying bodily possession altogether.\nIn contrast to \"jinn\", the devils (\"shayatin\") are inherently evil. Iblis, the father of the devils, dwells in the fires of hell, although not suffering wherein, he and his children try to draw people into damnation of hell. Devils don't physically possess people, they only tempt humans into sin by following their lower \"nafs\". Hadiths suggest that the devils whisper from within the human body, within or next to the heart, and so \"devilish whisperings\" ( \u0648\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0633) are sometimes thought of as a kind of possession. Unlike possession by \"jinn\", the whispering of devils affects the soul instead of the body. Inspiration by angels, on the other hand, is called .\nDemons (also known as \"div\"), though part of the human conception, get stronger through acts of sin. By acts of obedience (to God), they get weaker. Although a human might find pleasure in obeying the demons first, according to Islamic thought, the human soul can only be free if the demons are bound by the spirit (ruh). Sufi literature, as in the writings of Rumi and Attar of Nishapur, pay a lot of attention to how to bind the inner demons. Attar of Nishapur writes: \"If you bind the \"div\", you will set out for the royal pavilion with Solomon\" and \"You have no command over your self's kingdom [body and mind], for in your case the \"div\" is in the place of Solomon\". He further links the demons to the story alluded in the Quran (38:34) that a demon replaced the prophet Solomon: one must behave like a triumphant 'Solomon' and chain the demons of the \"nafs\" or lower self, locking the demon-prince into a 'rock', before the \"r\u016b\u1e25\" (soul) can make the first steps to the Divine.\nJudaism.\nAlthough forbidden in the Hebrew Bible, magic was widely practiced in the late Second Temple Period and well documented in the period following the destruction of the Temple into the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries C.E. Jewish magical papyri were inscriptions on amulets, ostraca and incantation bowls used in Jewish magical practices against \"shedim\" and other unclean spirits. According to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", Jewish methods of exorcism were described in the Book of Tobias.\nIn the 16th century, Isaac Luria, a Jewish mystic, wrote about the transmigration of souls seeking perfection. His disciples took his idea a step further, creating the idea of a \"dybbuk\", a soul inhabiting a victim until it had accomplished its task or atoned for its sin. The \"dybbuk\" appears in Jewish folklore and literature, as well as in chronicles of Jewish life. In Jewish folklore, a \"dybbuk\" is a disembodied spirit that wanders restlessly until it inhabits the body of a living person. The Baal Shem could expel a harmful \"dybbuk\" through exorcism.\nPossession-trance and adorcism are also engaged with by some Jews. Notably, Ethiopian Jewish women may participate in z\u0101r, and Tuisinian Jewish women have a practice called Stambali.\nStambali uses incense, music (traditionally performed by Black musicians from fraternal orders), dance, animal sacrifice, and large spreads of food to induce trance and to appease jinn which may be afflicting someone, and ceremonies may be regularly repeated by that person. Stambali is also sometimes done preventatively as part of wedding, bnei mitzvah, and housewarming festivities to ward away the evil eye. The afflictions of jinn may simply be buildups of emotional stress or more serious illness. During trance, the jinn enter the body, and the participants do not remember what occurred during trance afterwards. If a particular person has needed a Stambali ceremony organized, the jinn afflicting them will be asked what it wants as it possesses them. Usually requests involve clothes and an animal for sacrifice. The atmosphere is festive, and participants wear bright clothes and henna. Aside from musicians, the participants are all women. The dances and lyrics are improvised. Those seen as particularly susceptible to jinn affliction are the victims and perpetrators of aggression, those who are frightened, and those who may have the evil eye directed at them. Showers are also seen as particularly vulnerable places where a jinn may attach themselves to a person.\nAfrican traditions.\nCentral Africa.\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nZebola is a women's spirit possession dance ritual practised by certain ethnic groups of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is believed to have therapeutic qualities and has been noted in the West as a traditional form of psychotherapy.\nIt originated among the Mongo people but is also practised among various ethnic groups in Kinshasa.\nHorn of Africa.\nEthiopia.\nAmong the Gurage people of Ethiopia, spirit possession is a common belief. William A. Shack postulated that it is caused by Gurage cultural attitudes about food and hunger, while they have a plentiful food supply, cultural pressures that force the Gurage to either share it to meet social obligations, or hoard it and eat it secretly cause feelings of anxiety. Distinctions are drawn between spirits that strictly possess men, spirits that possess women, and spirits that possess victims of either sex. A ritual illness that only affects men is believed to be caused by a spirit called \"awre\". This affliction presents itself by loss of appetite, nausea, and attacks from severe stomach pains. If it persists, the victim may enter a trance-like stupor, in which he sometimes regains consciousness long enough to take food and water. Breathing is often labored. Seizures and trembling overcome the patient, and in extreme cases, partial paralysis of the extremities.\nIf the victim does not recover naturally, a traditional healer, or \"sagwara\", is summoned. Once the \"sagwara\" has determined the spirit's name through the use of divination, he prescribes a routine formula to exorcise the spirit. This is not a permanent cure, it merely allows the victim to form a relationship with the spirit while subject to chronic repossession, which is treated by repeating the formula. This formula involves the preparation and consumption of a dish of \"ensete\", butter, and red pepper. During this ritual, the victim's head is covered with a drape, and he eats the \"ensete\" ravenously while other ritual participants participate by chanting. The ritual ends when the possessing spirit announces that it is satisfied. Shack notes that the victims are overwhelmingly poor men, and that women are not as food-deprived as men, due to ritual activities that involve food redistribution and consumption. Shack postulates that the \"awre\" serves to bring the possessed man to the center of social attention, and to relieve his anxieties over his inability to gain prestige from redistributing food, which is the primary way in which Gurage men gain status in their society.\nThe belief in spirit possession is part of the native culture of the Sidama people of southwest Ethiopia. Anthropologists Irene and John Hamer postulated that it is a form of compensation for being deprived within Sidama society, although they do not draw from I.M. Lewis (see Cultural anthropology section under Scientific views). The majority of the possessed are women whose spirits demand luxury goods to alleviate their condition, but men can be possessed as well. Possessed individuals of both sexes can become healers due to their condition. Hamer and Hamer suggest that this is a form of compensation among deprived men in the deeply competitive society of the Sidama, for if a man cannot gain prestige as an orator, warrior, or farmer, he may still gain prestige as a spirit healer. Women are sometimes accused of faking possession, but men never are.\nEast Africa.\nKenya\nMayote\nMozambique\nUganda\nTanzania\nAfrican diasporic traditions.\nMost, if not all, Afro-diasporic traditions actively practice spirit possession. In many of the African diaspora religions possessing spirits are not necessarily harmful or evil, but are rather seeking to rebuke misconduct in the living. Possession by a spirit in the African diaspora and traditional African religions can result in healing for the person possessed and information gained from possession as the spirit provides knowledge to the one they possessed.\nHaitian Vodou.\nIn Haitian Vodou and related African diaspora religions, one way that those who participate or practice can have a spiritual experience is by being possessed by the \"Loa\" (or \"lwa\"). When the \"Loa\" descends upon a practitioner, the practitioner's body is being used by the spirit, according to the tradition. Some spirits are believed to be able to give prophecies of upcoming events or situations pertaining to the possessed one, also called a \"Chwal\" or the \"Horse of the Spirit\". Practitioners describe this as a beautiful but very tiring experience. Most people who are possessed by the spirit describe the onset as a feeling of blackness or energy flowing through their body.\nUmbanda.\nThe concept of spirit possession is also found in Umbanda, an Afro-Brazilian folk religion that has origins in Yoruba people. According to tradition, there are some guiding spirits that possess a voluntary person, which is normally done when there is a person that wants to ask for some guidance. When the person is possessed by a guiding spirit, the possessed person gives guidance to people that ask for consultation, by answering questions and sometimes explaining rituals to help the consulting person to achieve their goals or solve problems in their life. Examples of such spirits are Pomba Gira (female guardian spirit) or Exu (male guardian spirit), who possesses both women and men. According to the tradition everyone has a Pomba Gira and a Exu who they can call for help and protection, even if they don't possess the person asking for help, and they can always be called when the person feels it to be necessary.\nHoodoo.\nThe culture of Hoodoo was created by African-Americans. There are regional styles to this tradition, and as African-Americans traveled, the tradition of Hoodoo changed according to African-Americans' environment. Hoodoo includes reverence to ancestral spirits, African-American quilt making, herbal healing, Bakongo and Igbo burial practices, Holy Ghost shouting, praise houses, snake reverence, African-American churches, spirit possession, some Nkisi practices, Black Spiritual churches, Black theology, the ring shout, the Kongo cosmogram, Simbi water spirits, graveyard conjuring, the crossroads spirit, making conjure canes, incorporating animal parts, pouring of libations, Bible conjuring, and conjuring in the African-American tradition. In Hoodoo, people become possessed by the Holy Ghost. Spirit possession in Hoodoo was influenced by West African Vodun spirit possession. As Africans were enslaved in the United States, the Holy Spirit (Holy Ghost) replaced the African gods during possession. \"Spirit possession was reinterpreted in Christian terms.\" In African-American churches this is called being filled with the Holy Ghost. \"Walter Pitts (1993) has demonstrated the modern importance of 'possession' within African- American Baptist ritual, tracing the origins of the ecstatic state (often referred to as 'getting the spirit') to African possessions.\" Church members in Black Spiritual churches become possessed by spirits of deceased family members, the Holy Spirit, Christian saints, and other biblical figures from the Old and New Testament of the Bible. It is believed when people become possessed by these spirits they gain knowledge and wisdom and act as intercessors between people and God. William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (W. E. B. Du Bois) studied African-American churches in the early twentieth century. Du Bois asserts that the early years of the Black church during slavery on plantations was influenced by Voodooism.\nThrough counterclockwise circle dancing, ring shouters built up spiritual energy that resulted in the communication with ancestral spirits, and led to spirit possession. Enslaved African Americans performed the counterclockwise circle dance until someone was pulled into the center of the ring by the spiritual vortex at the center. The spiritual vortex at the center of the ring shout was a sacred spiritual realm. The center of the ring shout is where the ancestors and the Holy Spirit reside at the center. The Ring Shout (a sacred dance in Hoodoo) in Black churches results in spirit possession. The Ring Shout is a counterclockwise circle dance with singing and clapping that results in possession by the Holy Spirit. It is believed when people become possessed by the Holy Spirit their hearts become filled with the Holy Ghost which purifies their heart and soul from evil and replace it with joy. The Ring Shout in Hoodoo was influenced by the Kongo cosmogram a sacred symbol of the Bantu-Kongo people in Central Africa. It symbolizes the cyclical nature of life of birth, life, death, and rebirth (reincarnation of the soul). The Kongo cosmogram also symbolizes the rising and setting of the sun, the sun rising in the east and setting in the west that is counterclockwise, which is why ring shouters dance in a circle counterclockwise to invoke the spirit.\nMardi Gras Indians.\nIn New Orleans, Louisiana the practice of spirit possession continues in the cultural traditions of Mardi Gras Indians. Mardi Gras Indians are African Americans that practice a masking creole tradition that combines Native American traditions from Louisiana, West African masking traditions, and Afro-Caribbean carnival practices. During Mardi Gras, some Black maskers wear masks and suits (regalia) to invite the spirits and gods to possess them. This is a continued African tradition of spirit communication and possession. Masking Indian \"Big Chief\" Allison Montana said: \"...You're dancing with a spirit, with a feeling. If there are five or six chiefs in my practice, I'll out dance all of them until they short-winded and they have to run outside looking for air. I'll still be on the dance floor soaking wet. Look like I can't stop. My duty was to out dance every one of them. I'm just dancing with a spirit. I'm not just dancing to be dancing.\"\nAsian traditions.\nYahwism.\nThere are indications that trance-related practices might have played a role in the prophetic experiences of adherents of Yahwism. According to Martti Nissinen, Yahwist prophets may have received messages from the different gods and goddesses in the Yahwist Pantheon through a state of trance possession. This theory can be reconstructed from Sumerian Mythology, a similar theology to that of Yahwism, where the standard prophetic designations in the Akkadian language, mu\u1e2b\u1e2b\u00fbm/mu\u1e2b\u1e2b\u016btum (masc./fem., Old Babylonian) and ma\u1e2b\u1e2b\u00fb/ma\u1e2b\u1e2b\u016btu (masc./fem., Neo-Assyrian), are derived from the Akkadian verb ma\u1e2b\u00fb \"to become crazy, to go into a frenzy.\" According to bible scholar Simon B. Parker, trance rituals may have occurred such as nudity or a less extreme alternative, a trance where the person to enter trance receives the god or spirit into their body.\nFurther according to Nissinen, the Hebrew Bible, may contain evidence that trance-related practices may have been the origins of the Jewish traditions of prophetic messages. However, these instances may have been limited, with trance instead being a way of confirming divine appointment to a leadership position.\nNissinen also recorded that music was an essential part to these trance-ceremonies in the Ancient Near-East and so it can be reconstructed it could have been found in Yahwism. Instruments such as the tambourine, harps, lyres, and flutes may have been utilized, as those were common instruments in Ancient Israel. Along with music, incense may have also been used, either as an offering, or to be used as an entheogen, or possibly as both.\nExorcisms were also common. They can be reconstructed from both Medieval Jewish texts and texts from neighboring ancient cultures that practiced exorcisms. Exorcists acting almost like shamans would do rituals to exorcise one of a \"demon\" or evil spirit. According to Gina Konstantopoulos, a figure named an \"\u0100shipu\" acted as an exorcist in Mesopotamia and were trained in many fields of occultism, priesthood and herbalism. As amulets (called teraphim) were also used in Yahwism to ward off evil spirits, it may also be reconstructed that there were people in Ancient Israel who acted as exorcists or shamans who would do specific rituals to ward off evil spirits. As mentioned previously, these may have included music, incense, prayers, and trance-rituals. According to Reimund Leicht, formulae was used ward off the evil, along with ritualistic sacrifices.\nBuddhism.\nAccording to the Indian medical literature and Tantric Buddhist scriptures, most of the \"seizers\", or those that threaten the lives of young children, appear in animal form: cow, lion, fox, monkey, horse, dog, pig, cat, crow, pheasant, owl, and snake. Apart from these \"nightmare shapes\", the impersonation or incarnation of animals can in some circumstances also be highly beneficial, according to Michel Strickmann.\nCh'i Chung-fu, a Chinese gynecologist writing early in the 13th century, wrote that in addition to five sorts of falling frenzy classified according to their causative factors, there were also four types of other frenzies distinguished by the sounds and movements given off by the victim during his seizure: cow, horse, pig, and dog frenzies.\nIn Buddhism, a \"m\u0101ra\", sometimes translated as \"demon\", can either be a being suffering in the hell realm or a delusion. Before Siddhartha became Gautama Buddha, He was challenged by Mara, the embodiment of temptation, and overcame it. In traditional Buddhism, four forms of \"m\u0101ra\" are enumerated:\nIt is believed that a \"m\u0101ra\" will depart to a different realm once it is appeased.\nEast Asia.\nCertain sects of Taoism, Korean shamanism, Shinto, some Japanese new religious movements, and other East Asian religions feature the idea of spirit possession. Some sects feature shamans who supposedly become possessed; mediums who allegedly channel beings' supernatural power; or enchanters are said to imbue or foster spirits within objects, like samurai swords. The Hong Kong film \"Super Normal II\" (\"\u5927\u8ff7\u4fe1\", 1993) shows the famous true story of a young lady in Taiwan who possesses the dead body of a married woman to live her pre-determined remaining life. She is still serving in the Zhen Tian Temple in Yunlin County.\nChina.\nBackground.\nChina is a country where 73.56% of the population is defined as Chinese folk religion/unaffiliated (nonreligion). Therefore, the Chinese population's knowledge of spirit possession is not majorly obtained from religion. Instead, the concept is spread through fairy tales/folk tales and literary works of its traditional culture. In essence, the concept of soul possession has penetrated into all aspects of Chinese life, from people's superstitions, folk taboos, and funeral rituals, to various ghost-themed literary works, and has continued to spread to people's lives today.\nDevelopment.\nSpirit possession in China was prominent until the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war and most of the data gathered on this topic will be from the late 18th century. Some Chinese believe that illnesses to man is due to the possession of an evil yin spirit (kuei). These evil spirits become such when the deceased are not worshiped by the family, they have died unexpectedly, or did not follow Confucius's ideals of filial piety and ancestral reverence accordingly. These evil spirits cause unexplainable disasters, agricultural shocks and possessions. Disease is the cause of the supernatural where they do not have control over. Usually in the writings about this, the healers are the ones being described with detail, not so much the patient. Magical practices are sometimes what spirit possession is referred to as. It is very hard to distinguish between the religion, magic and local traditions. This is because many times, all three are fused together, so sometimes trying to distinguish between them is hard.\nShaman.\nAnother type of spirit possession works through a shaman, a prophet, healer and religious figure with the power to partially control spirits and communicate for them. Messages, remedies and even oracles are delivered through the shaman. This is sometimes used by people who would like to become important figures. Usually, shamans give guidance that reflects the customer's existing values.\nYin-yang theory.\nThe yin-yang theory is one of the most important bases and components of Chinese traditional culture. The yin-yang theory has penetrated into various traditional Chinese cultural things including calendar, astronomy, meteorology, Chinese medicine, martial arts, calligraphy, architecture, religion, feng shui, divination, etc. The yin-yang theory also applies to spirit possession. In general, one is considered to be \"weak\", when the yin and yang in the body are imbalanced, especially when the yin is on the dominant side. The spirits, which are categorized as the yin side, will then take control of these individuals with the imbalanced and yin-dominant situation more easily.\nIndia.\nAyurveda.\n\"Bh\u016btavidy\u0101\", the exorcism of possessing spirits, is traditionally one of the eight limbs of Ayurveda.\nRajasthan.\nThe concept of spirit possession exists in the culture of modern Rajasthan. Some of the spirits allegedly possessing Rajasthanis are seen as good and beneficial, while others are seen as malevolent. The good spirits are said to include murdered royalty, the underworld god Bhaironji, and Muslim saints and fakirs. Bad spirits are believed to include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists. The supposedly possessed individual is referred to as a \"ghorala\", or \"mount\". Possession, even if by a benign spirit, is regarded as undesirable, as it is seen to entail loss of self-control, and violent emotional outbursts.\nTamil Nadu.\nTamil women in India are said to experience possession by \"peye\" spirits. According to tradition, these spirits overwhelmingly possess new brides, are usually identified as the ghosts of young men who died while romantically or sexually frustrated, and are ritually exorcised. \nSri Lanka.\nThe Coast Veddas, a social group within the minority group of Sri Lankan Tamil people in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka, enter trances during religious festivals in which they are regarded as being possessed by a spirit. Although they speak a dialect of Tamil, during trances they will sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the Vedda language.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIndonesia.\nIn Bali, the animist traditions of the island include a practice called \"sanghyang\", induction of voluntary possession trance states for specific purposes. Roughly similar to voluntary possession in Vaudon (Voodoo), \"sanghyang\" is considered a sacred state in which hyangs (deities) or helpful spirits temporarily inhabit the bodies of participants. The purpose of sanghyang is believed to be to cleanse people and places of evil influences and restore spiritual balance. Thus, it is often referred to as an exorcism ceremony. In Sulawesi, the women of the Bonerate people of Sulawesi practice a possession-trance ritual in which they smother glowing embers with their bare feet at the climax. The fact that they are not burned in the process is considered proof of the authenticity of the possession.\nInfluenced by the religion of Islam, among the several spirits in Indonesian belief are demons (\"setan\"), composed of fire, prone to anger and passion. They envy humans for their physical body, and try to gain control of it. When they assault a human, they would intrude their mind, trying to displace the human spirit. The human's mind would adapt to the passions of anger, violence, irrationality and greed, the intruding demon is composed of. The demon is believed to alter the person, giving him supernatural attributes, like strength of many men, ability to appear in more than one place, or assume the form of an animal, such as a tiger or a pig, or to kill without touching. Others become lunatics, resembling epilepsy. In extreme cases, the presence of the demon may alter the condition of the body, matching its own spiritual qualities, turning into a \"raksasha\".\nMalaysia.\nFemale workers in Malaysian factories have allegedly become possessed by spirits, and factory owners generally regard it as mass hysteria and an intrusion of irrational and archaic beliefs into a modern setting.\nAnthropologist Aihwa Ong noted that spirit possession beliefs in Malaysia were typically held by older, married women, whereas the female factory workers are typically young and unmarried. She connects this to the rapid industrialization and modernization of Malaysia. Ong argued that spirit possession is a traditional way of rebelling against authority without punishment, and suggests that it is a means of protesting the untenable working conditions and sexual harassment that the women were compelled to endure.\nThailand.\nThe roles and cultures of each region have different reputations, for example the northern region is called fon phi (\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e35) or the southern region is divided into two groups are thai folk religion and chinese folk religion. \nMyanmanr.\nSee more : Nat-kadaw and nat-pwe\nThe Americas and Caribbean.\nIndo-Caribbean Shaktism.\nIn Indo-Caribbean Madrasi Religion, a state of trance-possession known as \"Sami Aduthal\" in Tamil and as a \"manifestation\" in English occurs whence a devotee enters a trance state after praying. It is an essential part to Indo-Caribbean Shakti ceremonies, being accompanied by Tappu drumming, the singing of devotional songs, and the drumming of Udukai drums.\nCeremonies called Pujas often include the drumming of three to five tappu to invoke the deity to the space. Then, the head pujari receives the God or Goddess into their body, acting as a medium. A mixture of water, turmeric powder, and neem leaves are poured onto the medium, as it is believed that the God's energy heats up the body while the water and turmeric with the neem leaves cools it down again. Puja services are often held once a week.\nOceanic traditions.\nMelanesia.\nThe Urapmin people of the New Guinea Highlands practice a form of group possession known as the \"spirit disco\" (). Men and women gather in church buildings, dancing in circles and jumping up and down while women sing Christian songs; this is called \"pulling the [Holy] spirit\" (, Urap: ). The songs' melodies are borrowed from traditional women's songs sung at drum dances (Urap: ), and the lyrics are typically in Telefol or other Mountain Ok languages. If successful, some dancers will \"get the spirit\" (), flailing wildly and careening about the dance floor. After an hour or more, those possessed will collapse, the singing will end, and the spirit disco will end with a prayer and, if there is time, a Bible reading and sermon. The body is believed to normally be \"heavy\" () with sin, and possession is the process of the Holy Spirit throwing the sins from one's body, making the person \"light\" () again. This is a completely new ritual for the Urapmin, who have no indigenous tradition of spirit-possession.\nMicronesia.\nThe concept of spirit possession appears in Chuuk State, one of the four states of Federated States of Micronesia. Although Chuuk is an overwhelmingly Christian society, traditional beliefs in spirit possession by the dead still exist, usually held by women, and \"events\" are usually brought on by family conflicts. The supposed spirits, speaking through the women, typically admonish family members to treat each other better.\nEuropean traditions.\nItalian folk magic.\nIn traditional Italian folk magic spirit possessions are not uncommon. It is known in this culture that a person may be possessed by multiple entities at once. The way to be rid of the spirit(s) would be to call for a \"curatore, guaritore\" or \"pratico\" which all translate to healer or knowledgeable one from Italian. These healers would perform sacred rituals to be rid of the spirits; the rituals are passed down through generations and vary based on the region in Italy. It is said that for many Italian rituals specifically those to be rid of negative spirits, that the information may only be shared on Christmas Eve (specifically for \"il malocchio\"). If the family is religious they may even call in a priest to perform a traditional catholic exorcism on the spirit(s).\nShamanic traditions.\nShamanism is a religious practice that involves a practitioner who is believed to interact with a spirit world through altered states of consciousness, such as trance. The goal of this is usually to direct these spirits or spiritual energies into the physical world, for healing or another purpose.\nNew religious movements.\nWicca.\nWiccans believe in voluntary possession by the Goddess, connected with the sacred ceremony of Drawing Down the Moon. The high priestess solicits the Goddess to possess her and speak through her.\nScientific views.\nCultural anthropology.\nThe works of Jean Rouch, Germaine Dieterlen, and Marcel Griaule have been extensively cited in research studies on possession in Western Africa that extended to Brazil and North America due to the slave trade.\nThe anthropologist I.M. Lewis noted that women are more likely to be involved in spirit possession cults than men are, and postulated that such cults act as a means of compensation for their exclusion from other spheres within their respective cultures.\nPhysical anthropology.\nAnthropologists Alice B. Kehoe and Dody H. Giletti argued that women are more commonly seen in Afro-Eurasian spirit possession cults because of deficiencies in thiamine, tryptophan-niacin, calcium, and vitamin D. They argued that a combination of poverty and diet causes this problem, and that it is exacerbated by the strains of pregnancy and lactation. They postulated that the involuntary symptoms of these deficiencies affecting their nervous systems have been institutionalized as spirit possession.\nMedicine and psychology.\nSpirit possession of any kind, including demonic, is just one psychiatric or medical diagnosis recognized by the DSM-5 or the ICD-10: \"F44.3 Trance and possession disorders\". In clinical psychiatry, trance and possession disorders are defined as \"states involving a temporary loss of the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surroundings\" and generally classed as a type of dissociative disorder.\nPeople alleged to be possessed by spirits sometimes exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with mental illnesses such as derealization, hallucinogen abuse, psychosis, catatonia, mania, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, schizophrenia, or dissociative identity disorder, including involuntary, uncensored behavior, and an extra-human, extra-social aspect to the individual's actions. It is not uncommon to ascribe the experience of sleep paralysis to demonic possession, although it's not a physical or mental illness. Studies have found that alleged demonic possessions can be related to trauma.\nIn entry article on dissociative identity disorder, the DSM-5 states, \"possession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest as behaviors that appear as if a 'spirit,' supernatural being, or outside person has taken control such that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner\". The symptoms vary across cultures. The DSM-5 indicates that personality states of dissociative identity disorder may be interpreted as possession in some cultures, and instances of spirit possession are often related to traumatic experiences\u2014suggesting that possession experiences may be caused by mental distress. In cases of dissociative identity disorder in which the alter personality is questioned as to its identity, 29 percent are reported to identify themselves as demons. A 19th century term for a mental disorder in which the patient believes that they are possessed by demons or evil spirits is demonomania or cacodemonomanis.\nSome have expressed concern that belief in demonic possession can limit access to health care for the mentally ill.\nNotable examples.\nPurported demonic possessions.\nIn chronological order:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Legion (1st century)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45938", "revid": "49001800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45938", "title": "General equilibrium theory", "text": "Theory of equilibrium between supply and demand\nIn economics, general equilibrium theory attempts to explain the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that the interaction of demand and supply will result in an overall general equilibrium. General equilibrium theory contrasts with the theory of \"partial\" equilibrium, which analyzes a specific part of an economy while its other factors are held constant.\nGeneral equilibrium theory both studies economies using the model of equilibrium pricing and seeks to determine in which circumstances the assumptions of general equilibrium will hold. The theory dates to the 1870s, particularly the work of French economist L\u00e9on Walras in his pioneering 1874 work \"Elements of Pure Economics\". The theory reached its modern form with the work of Lionel W. McKenzie (Walrasian theory), Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu (Hicksian theory) in the 1950s.\nOverview.\nBroadly speaking, general equilibrium tries to give an understanding of the whole economy using a \"bottom-up\" approach, starting with individual markets and agents. Therefore, general equilibrium theory has traditionally been classified as part of microeconomics. The difference is not as clear as it used to be, since much of modern macroeconomics has emphasized microeconomic foundations, and has constructed general equilibrium models of macroeconomic fluctuations. General equilibrium macroeconomic models usually have a simplified structure that only incorporates a few markets, like a \"goods market\" and a \"financial market\". In contrast, general equilibrium models in the microeconomic tradition typically involve a multitude of different goods markets. They are usually complex and require computers to calculate numerical solutions.\nIn a market system the prices and production of all goods, including the price of money and interest, are interrelated: a change in the price of one good may affect the price of another good. Calculating the equilibrium price of just one good, in theory, requires an analysis that accounts for all of the millions of different goods that are available. It is often assumed that agents are price takers, and under that assumption two common notions of equilibrium exist: Walrasian, or competitive equilibrium, and its generalization: a price equilibrium with transfers.\nFriedrich Hayek's influential essay \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945) articulated what scholars have since identified as a fundamental challenge to the informational assumptions underlying general equilibrium theory. Hayek argued that economic knowledge is inherently dispersed across countless individuals and often exists in tacit, context-specific forms that cannot be aggregated or centralized. This posed a problem for some models, whether Walrasian equilibrium theory or centralized economic planning, that presumes complete information or the possibility of gathering all relevant data in one place.\nHayek proposed that market prices serve as decentralized information signals, distilling complex local knowledge about preferences, resources, and opportunities into summary statistics that coordinate economic decisions across society without requiring centralized knowledge or direction. While predating the full Arrow-Debreu formalization (1954), Hayek's essay has been interpreted by subsequent economists both as a critique of the informational feasibility of perfect-information equilibrium models and as an explanation of how real-world market processes achieve coordination through price mechanisms despite pervasive ignorance and uncertainty. This perspective emphasizes economic processes and discovery over static equilibrium states.\nWalrasian equilibrium.\nThe first attempt in neoclassical economics to model prices for a whole economy was made by L\u00e9on Walras. Walras' \"Elements of Pure Economics\" provides a succession of models, each taking into account more aspects of a real economy (two commodities, many commodities, production, growth, money). Some think Walras was unsuccessful and that the later models in this series are inconsistent.\nIn particular, Walras's model was a long-run model in which prices of capital goods are the same whether they appear as inputs or outputs and in which the same rate of profits is earned in all lines of industry. This is inconsistent with the quantities of capital goods being taken as data. But when Walras introduced capital goods in his later models, he took their quantities as given, in arbitrary ratios. (In contrast, Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu continued to take the initial quantities of capital goods as given, but adopted a short run model in which the prices of capital goods vary with time and the own rate of interest varies across capital goods.)\nWalras was the first to lay down a research program widely followed by 20th-century economists. In particular, the Walrasian agenda included the investigation of when equilibria are unique and stable\u2014 Walras' Lesson 7 shows neither uniqueness, nor stability, nor even existence of an equilibrium is guaranteed. Walras also proposed a dynamic process by which general equilibrium might be reached, that of the t\u00e2tonnement or groping process.\nThe t\u00e2tonnement process is a model for investigating stability of equilibria. Prices are announced (perhaps by an \"auctioneer\"), and agents state how much of each good they would like to offer (supply) or purchase (demand). No transactions and no production take place at disequilibrium prices. Instead, prices are lowered for goods with positive prices and excess supply. Prices are raised for goods with excess demand. The question for the mathematician is under what conditions such a process will terminate in equilibrium where demand equates to supply for goods with positive prices and demand does not exceed supply for goods with a price of zero. Walras was not able to provide a definitive answer to this question (see Unresolved Problems in General Equilibrium below).\nMarshall and Sraffa.\nIn partial equilibrium analysis, the determination of the price of a good is simplified by just looking at the price of one good, and assuming that the prices of all other goods remain constant. The Marshallian theory of supply and demand is an example of partial equilibrium analysis. Partial equilibrium analysis is adequate when the first-order effects of a shift in the demand curve do not shift the supply curve. Anglo-American economists became more interested in general equilibrium in the late 1920s and 1930s after Piero Sraffa's demonstration that Marshallian economists cannot account for the forces thought to account for the upward-slope of the supply curve for a consumer good.\nIf an industry uses little of a factor of production, a small increase in the output of that industry will not bid the price of that factor up. To a first-order approximation, firms in the industry will experience constant costs, and the industry supply curves will not slope up. If an industry uses an appreciable amount of that factor of production, an increase in the output of that industry will exhibit increasing costs. But such a factor is likely to be used in substitutes for the industry's product, and an increased price of that factor will have effects on the supply of those substitutes. Consequently, Sraffa argued, the first-order effects of a shift in the demand curve of the original industry under these assumptions includes a shift in the supply curve of substitutes for that industry's product, and consequent shifts in the original industry's supply curve. General equilibrium is designed to investigate such interactions between markets.\nContinental European economists made important advances in the 1930s. Walras' arguments for the existence of general equilibrium often were based on the counting of equations and variables. Such arguments are inadequate for non-linear systems of equations and do not imply that equilibrium prices and quantities cannot be negative, a meaningless solution for his models. The replacement of certain equations by inequalities and the use of more rigorous mathematics improved general equilibrium modeling.\nModern concept of general equilibrium in economics.\nThe modern conception of general equilibrium is provided by the Arrow\u2013Debreu\u2013McKenzie model, developed jointly by Kenneth Arrow, G\u00e9rard Debreu, and Lionel W. McKenzie in the 1950s. Debreu presents this model in \"Theory of Value\" (1959) as an axiomatic model, following the style of mathematics promoted by Nicolas Bourbaki. In such an approach, the interpretation of the terms in the theory (e.g., goods, prices) are not fixed by the axioms.\nThree important interpretations of the terms of the theory have been often cited. First, suppose commodities are distinguished by the location where they are delivered. Then the Arrow-Debreu model is a spatial model of, for example, international trade.\nSecond, suppose commodities are distinguished by when they are delivered. That is, suppose all markets equilibrate at some initial instant of time. Agents in the model purchase and sell contracts, where a contract specifies, for example, a good to be delivered and the date at which it is to be delivered. The Arrow\u2013Debreu model of intertemporal equilibrium contains forward markets for all goods at all dates. No markets exist at any future dates.\nThird, suppose contracts specify states of nature which affect whether a commodity is to be delivered: \"A contract for the transfer of a commodity now specifies, in addition to its physical properties, its location and its date, an event on the occurrence of which the transfer is conditional. This new definition of a commodity allows one to obtain a theory of [risk] free from any probability concept...\"\nThese interpretations can be combined. So the complete Arrow\u2013Debreu model can be said to apply when goods are identified by when they are to be delivered, where they are to be delivered and under what circumstances they are to be delivered, as well as their intrinsic nature. So there would be a complete set of prices for contracts such as \"1 ton of Winter red wheat, delivered on 3rd of January in Minneapolis, if there is a hurricane in Florida during December\". A general equilibrium model with complete markets of this sort seems to be a long way from describing the workings of real economies, however, its proponents argue that it is still useful as a simplified guide as to how real economies function.\nSome of the recent work in general equilibrium has in fact explored the implications of incomplete markets, which is to say an intertemporal economy with uncertainty, where there do not exist sufficiently detailed contracts that would allow agents to fully allocate their consumption and resources through time. While it has been shown that such economies will generally still have an equilibrium, the outcome may no longer be Pareto optimal. The basic intuition for this result is that if consumers lack adequate means to transfer their wealth from one time period to another and the future is risky, there is nothing to necessarily tie any price ratio down to the relevant marginal rate of substitution, which is the standard requirement for Pareto optimality. Under some conditions the economy may still be constrained Pareto optimal, meaning that a central authority limited to the same type and number of contracts as the individual agents may not be able to improve upon the outcome, what is needed is the introduction of a full set of possible contracts. Hence, one implication of the theory of incomplete markets is that inefficiency may be a result of underdeveloped financial institutions or credit constraints faced by some members of the public. Research still continues in this area.\nProperties and characterization of general equilibrium.\nBasic questions in general equilibrium analysis are concerned with the conditions under which an equilibrium will be efficient, which efficient equilibria can be achieved, when an equilibrium is guaranteed to exist and when the equilibrium will be unique and stable.\nFirst Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics.\nThe First Fundamental Welfare Theorem asserts that market equilibria are Pareto efficient. In other words, the allocation of goods in the equilibria is such that there is no reallocation which would leave a consumer better off without leaving another consumer worse off. In a pure exchange economy, a sufficient condition for the first welfare theorem to hold is that preferences be locally nonsatiated. The first welfare theorem also holds for economies with production regardless of the properties of the production function. Implicitly, the theorem assumes complete markets and perfect information. In an economy with externalities, for example, it is possible for equilibria to arise that are not efficient.\nThe first welfare theorem is informative in the sense that it points to the sources of inefficiency in markets. Under the assumptions above, any market equilibrium is tautologically efficient. Therefore, when equilibria arise that are not efficient, the market system itself is not to blame, but rather some sort of market failure.\nSecond Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics.\nEven if every equilibrium is efficient, it may not be that every efficient allocation of resources can be part of an equilibrium. However, the second theorem states that every Pareto efficient allocation can be supported as an equilibrium by some set of prices. In other words, all that is required to reach a particular Pareto efficient outcome is a redistribution of initial endowments of the agents after which the market can be left alone to do its work. This suggests that the issues of efficiency and equity can be separated and need not involve a trade-off. The conditions for the second theorem are stronger than those for the first, as consumers' preferences and production sets now need to be convex (convexity roughly corresponds to the idea of diminishing marginal rates of substitution i.e. \"the average of two equally good bundles is better than either of the two bundles\").\nExistence.\nEven though every equilibrium is efficient, neither of the above two theorems say anything about the equilibrium existing in the first place. To guarantee that an equilibrium exists, it suffices that consumer preferences be strictly convex. With enough consumers, the convexity assumption can be relaxed both for existence and the second welfare theorem. Similarly, but less plausibly, convex feasible production sets suffice for existence; convexity excludes economies of scale.\nProofs of the existence of equilibrium traditionally rely on fixed-point theorems such as Brouwer fixed-point theorem for functions (or, more generally, the Kakutani fixed-point theorem for set-valued functions). See Competitive equilibrium#Existence of a competitive equilibrium. The proof was first due to Lionel McKenzie, and Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu. In fact, the converse also holds, according to Uzawa's derivation of Brouwer's fixed point theorem from Walras's law. Following Uzawa's theorem, many mathematical economists consider proving existence a deeper result than proving the two Fundamental Theorems.\nAnother method of proof of existence, global analysis, uses Sard's lemma and the Baire category theorem; this method was pioneered by G\u00e9rard Debreu and Stephen Smale.\nNonconvexities in large economies.\nStarr (1969) applied the Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr theorem to prove that even without convex preferences there exists an approximate equilibrium. The Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr results bound the distance from an \"approximate\" economic equilibrium to an equilibrium of a \"convexified\" economy, when the number of agents exceeds the dimension of the goods. Following Starr's paper, the Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr results were \"much exploited in the theoretical literature\", according to Guesnerie, who wrote the following:\nsome key results obtained under the convexity assumption remain (approximately) relevant in circumstances where convexity fails. For example, in economies with a large consumption side, nonconvexities in preferences do not destroy the standard results of, say Debreu's theory of value. In the same way, if indivisibilities in the production sector are small with respect to the size of the economy, [ . . . ] then standard results are affected in only a minor way.\nTo this text, Guesnerie appended the following footnote:\nThe derivation of these results in general form has been one of the major achievements of postwar economic theory.\nIn particular, the Shapley-Folkman-Starr results were incorporated in the theory of general economic equilibria and in the theory of market failures and of public economics.\nUniqueness.\nAlthough generally (assuming convexity) an equilibrium will exist and will be efficient, the conditions under which it will be unique are much stronger. The Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu theorem, proven in the 1970s, states that the aggregate excess demand function inherits only certain properties of individual's demand functions, and that these (continuity, homogeneity of degree zero, Walras' law and boundary behavior when prices are near zero) are the only real restriction one can expect from an aggregate excess demand function. Any such function can represent the excess demand of an economy populated with rational utility-maximizing individuals.\nThere has been much research on conditions when the equilibrium will be unique, or which at least will limit the number of equilibria. One result states that under mild assumptions the number of equilibria will be finite (see regular economy) and odd (see index theorem). Furthermore, if an economy as a whole, as characterized by an aggregate excess demand function, has the revealed preference property (which is a much stronger condition than revealed preferences for a single individual) or the gross substitute property then likewise the equilibrium will be unique. All methods of establishing uniqueness can be thought of as establishing that each equilibrium has the same positive local index, in which case by the index theorem there can be but one such equilibrium.\nDeterminacy.\nGiven that equilibria may not be unique, it is of some interest to ask whether any particular equilibrium is at least locally unique. If so, then comparative statics can be applied as long as the shocks to the system are not too large. As stated above, in a regular economy equilibria will be finite, hence locally unique. One reassuring result, due to Debreu, is that \"most\" economies are regular.\nWork by Michael Mandler (1999) has challenged this claim. The Arrow\u2013Debreu\u2013McKenzie model is neutral between models of production functions as continuously differentiable and as formed from (linear combinations of) fixed coefficient processes. Mandler accepts that, under either model of production, the initial endowments will not be consistent with a continuum of equilibria, except for a set of Lebesgue measure zero. However, endowments change with time in the model and this evolution of endowments is determined by the decisions of agents (e.g., firms) in the model. Agents in the model have an interest in equilibria being indeterminate:\nIndeterminacy, moreover, is not just a technical nuisance; it undermines the price-taking assumption of competitive models. Since arbitrary small manipulations of factor supplies can dramatically increase a factor's price, factor owners will not take prices to be parametric.\nWhen technology is modeled by (linear combinations) of fixed coefficient processes, optimizing agents will drive endowments to be such that a continuum of equilibria exist:\nThe endowments where indeterminacy occurs systematically arise through time and therefore cannot be dismissed; the Arrow-Debreu-McKenzie model is thus fully subject to the dilemmas of factor price theory.\nSome have questioned the practical applicability of the general equilibrium approach based on the possibility of non-uniqueness of equilibria.\nStability.\nIn a typical general equilibrium model the prices that prevail \"when the dust settles\" are simply those that coordinate the demands of various consumers for various goods. But this raises the question of how these prices and allocations have been arrived at, and whether any (temporary) shock to the economy will cause it to converge back to the same outcome that prevailed before the shock. This is the question of stability of the equilibrium, and it can be readily seen that it is related to the question of uniqueness. If there are multiple equilibria, then some of them will be unstable. Then, if an equilibrium is unstable and there is a shock, the economy will wind up at a different set of allocations and prices once the convergence process terminates. However, stability depends not only on the number of equilibria but also on the type of the process that guides price changes (for a specific type of price adjustment process see Walrasian auction). Consequently, some researchers have focused on plausible adjustment processes that guarantee system stability, i.e., that guarantee convergence of prices and allocations to some equilibrium. When more than one stable equilibrium exists, where one ends up will depend on where one begins. The theorems that have been mostly conclusive when related to the stability of a typical general equilibrium model are closed related to that of the most local stability.\nUnresolved problems in general equilibrium.\nResearch building on the Arrow\u2013Debreu\u2013McKenzie model has revealed some problems with the model. The Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu results show that, essentially, any restrictions on the shape of excess demand functions are stringent. Some think this implies that the Arrow\u2013Debreu model lacks empirical content. Therefore, an unsolved problem is\nA model organized around the t\u00e2tonnement process has been said to be a model of a centrally planned economy, not a decentralized market economy. Some research has tried to develop general equilibrium models with other processes. In particular, some economists have developed models in which agents can trade at out-of-equilibrium prices and such trades can affect the equilibria to which the economy tends. Particularly noteworthy are the Hahn process, the Edgeworth process and the Fisher process.\nThe data determining Arrow-Debreu equilibria include initial endowments of capital goods. If production and trade occur out of equilibrium, these endowments will be changed further complicating the picture.\nIn a real economy, however, trading, as well as production and consumption, goes on out of equilibrium. It follows that, in the course of convergence to equilibrium (assuming that occurs), endowments change. In turn this changes the set of equilibria. Put more succinctly, the set of equilibria is path dependent... [This path dependence] makes the calculation of equilibria corresponding to the initial state of the system essentially irrelevant. What matters is the equilibrium that the economy will reach from given initial endowments, not the equilibrium that it would have been in, given initial endowments, had prices happened to be just right. \u2013 (Franklin Fisher).\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model in which all trade occurs in futures contracts at time zero requires a very large number of markets to exist. It is equivalent under complete markets to a sequential equilibrium concept in which spot markets for goods and assets open at each date-state event (they are not equivalent under incomplete markets); market clearing then requires that the entire sequence of prices clears all markets at all times. A generalization of the sequential market arrangement is the temporary equilibrium structure, where market clearing at a point in time is conditional on expectations of future prices which need not be market clearing ones.\nAlthough the Arrow\u2013Debreu\u2013McKenzie model is set out in terms of some arbitrary num\u00e9raire, the model does not encompass money. Frank Hahn, for example, has investigated whether general equilibrium models can be developed in which money enters in some essential way. One of the essential questions he introduces, often referred to as the Hahn's problem is: \"Can one construct an equilibrium where money has value?\" The goal is to find models in which existence of money can alter the equilibrium solutions, perhaps because the initial position of agents depends on monetary prices.\nSome critics of general equilibrium modeling contend that much research in these models constitutes exercises in pure mathematics with no connection to actual economies. In a 1979 article, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen complains: \"There are endeavors that now pass for the most desirable kind of economic contributions although they are just plain mathematical exercises, not only without any economic substance but also without any mathematical value.\" He cites as an example a paper that assumes more traders in existence than there are points in the set of real numbers.\nAlthough modern models in general equilibrium theory demonstrate that under certain circumstances prices will indeed converge to equilibria, critics hold that the assumptions necessary for these results are extremely strong. As well as stringent restrictions on excess demand functions, the necessary assumptions include perfect rationality of individuals; complete information about all prices both now and in the future; and the conditions necessary for perfect competition. However, some results from experimental economics suggest that even in circumstances where there are few, imperfectly informed agents, the resulting prices and allocations may wind up resembling those of a perfectly competitive market (although certainly not a stable general equilibrium in all markets).\nFrank Hahn defends general equilibrium modeling on the grounds that it provides a negative function. General equilibrium models show what the economy would have to be like for an unregulated economy to be Pareto efficient.\nComputing general equilibrium.\nUntil the 1970s general equilibrium analysis remained theoretical. With advances in computing power and the development of input\u2013output tables, it became possible to model national economies, or even the world economy, and attempts were made to solve for general equilibrium prices and quantities empirically.\nApplied general equilibrium (AGE) models were pioneered by Herbert Scarf in 1967, and offered a method for solving the Arrow\u2013Debreu General Equilibrium system in a numerical fashion. This was first implemented by John Shoven and John Whalley (students of Scarf at Yale) in 1972 and 1973, and were a popular method up through the 1970s. In the 1980s however, AGE models faded from popularity due to their inability to provide a precise solution and its high cost of computation.\nComputable general equilibrium (CGE) models surpassed and replaced AGE models in the mid-1980s, as the CGE model was able to provide relatively quick and large computable models for a whole economy, and was the preferred method of governments and the World Bank. CGE models are heavily used today, and while 'AGE' and 'CGE' is used inter-changeably in the literature, Scarf-type AGE models have not been constructed since the mid-1980s, and the CGE literature at current is \"not\" based on Arrow-Debreu and General Equilibrium Theory as discussed in this article. CGE models, and what is today referred to as AGE models, are based on static, simultaneously solved, macro balancing equations (from the standard Keynesian macro model), giving a precise and explicitly computable result.\nOther schools.\nGeneral equilibrium theory is a central point of contention and influence between the neoclassical school and other schools of economic thought, and different schools have varied views on general equilibrium theory. Some, such as the Keynesian and Post-Keynesian schools, strongly reject general equilibrium theory as \"misleading\" and \"useless\". Disequilibrium macroeconomics and different non-equilibrium approaches were developed as alternatives. Other schools, such as new classical macroeconomics, developed from general equilibrium theory.\nKeynesian and Post-Keynesian.\nKeynesian and Post-Keynesian economists, and their underconsumptionist predecessors criticize general equilibrium theory specifically, and as part of criticisms of neoclassical economics generally. Specifically, they argue that general equilibrium theory is neither accurate nor useful, that economies are not in equilibrium, that equilibrium may be slow and painful to achieve, and that modeling by equilibrium is \"misleading\", and that the resulting theory is not a useful guide, particularly for understanding of economic crises.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let us beware of this dangerous theory of equilibrium which is supposed to be automatically established. A certain kind of equilibrium, it is true, is reestablished in the long run, but it is after a frightful amount of suffering.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is as absurd to assume that, for any long period of time, the variables in the economic organization, or any part of them, will \"stay put,\" in perfect equilibrium, as to assume that the Atlantic Ocean can ever be without a wave.\u2014\u200a\nRobert Clower and others have argued for a reformulation of theory toward disequilibrium analysis to incorporate how monetary exchange fundamentally alters the representation of an economy as though a barter system.\nNew classical macroeconomics.\nWhile general equilibrium theory and neoclassical economics generally were originally microeconomic theories, new classical macroeconomics builds a macroeconomic theory on these bases. In new classical models, the macroeconomy is assumed to be at its unique equilibrium, with full employment and potential output, and that this equilibrium is assumed to always have been achieved via price and wage adjustment (market clearing). The best-known such model is real business-cycle theory, in which business cycles are considered to be largely due to changes in the real economy, unemployment is not due to the failure of the market to achieve potential output, but due to equilibrium potential output having fallen and equilibrium unemployment having risen.\nSocialist economics.\nWithin socialist economics, a sustained critique of general equilibrium theory (and neoclassical economics generally) is given in \"Anti-Equilibrium\", based on the experiences of J\u00e1nos Kornai with the failures of Communist central planning, although Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel later based their Parecon model on the same theory.\nNew structural economics.\nThe structural equilibrium model is a matrix-form computable general equilibrium model in new structural economics.\nThis model is an extension of the John von Neumann's general equilibrium model (see Computable general equilibrium for details). Its computation can be performed using the R package GE.\nThe structural equilibrium model can be used for intertemporal equilibrium analysis, where time is treated as a label that differentiates between types of commodities and firms, meaning commodities are distinguished by when they are delivered and firms are distinguished by when they produce. The model can include factors such as taxes, money, endogenous production functions, and endogenous institutions, etc. The structural equilibrium model can include excess tax burdens, meaning that the equilibrium in the model may not be Pareto optimal. When production functions and/or economic institutions are treated as endogenous variables, the general equilibrium is referred to as structural equilibrium.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is the essential method used to create the perception of a broad range of colors in, e.g., electronic displays, color printing, and paintings. Perceptions associated with a given combination of primary colors can be predicted by an appropriate mixing model (e.g., additive, subtractive) that uses the physics of how light interacts with physical media, and ultimately the retina to be able to accurately display the intended colors. \nThe most common colour mixing models are the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) and the subtractive primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow). Red, yellow, and blue are also commonly taught as primary colors (usually in the context of subtractive color mixing as opposed to additive color mixing), despite some criticism due to its lack of scientific basis.\nPrimary colours can also be conceptual (not necessarily real), either as additive mathematical elements of a color space or as irreducible phenomenological categories in domains such as psychology and philosophy. Color space primaries are precisely defined and empirically rooted in psychophysical colorimetry experiments which are foundational for understanding color vision. Primaries of some color spaces are \"complete\" (that is, all visible colors are described in terms of their primaries weighted by nonnegative primary intensity coefficients) but necessarily \"imaginary\" (that is, there is no plausible way that those primary colors could be represented physically, or perceived). Phenomenological accounts of primary colors, such as the psychological primaries, have been used as the conceptual basis for practical color applications even though they are not a quantitative description in and of themselves.\nSets of color space primaries are generally \"arbitrary\", in the sense that there is no one set of primaries that can be considered the canonical set. Primary pigments or light sources are selected for a given application on the basis of subjective preferences as well as practical factors such as cost, stability, availability etc.\nThe concept of primary colors has a long, complex history. The choice of primary colors has changed over time in different domains that study color. Descriptions of primary colors come from areas including philosophy, art history, color order systems, and scientific work involving the physics of light and perception of color.\nArt education materials commonly use red, yellow, and blue as primary colors, sometimes suggesting that they can mix all colors. No set of real colorants or lights can mix all possible colors, however. In other domains, the three primary colors are typically red, green and blue, which are more closely aligned to the sensitivities of the photoreceptor pigments in the cone cells.\nColor model primaries.\nA color model is an abstract model intended to describe the ways that colors behave, especially in color mixing. Most color models are defined by the interaction of multiple primary colors. Since most humans are trichromatic, color models that want to reproduce a meaningful portion of a human's perceptual gamut must use at least \"three\" primaries. More than three primaries are allowed, for example, to increase the size of the gamut of the color space, but the entire human perceptual gamut can be reproduced with just three primaries (albeit imaginary ones as in the CIE XYZ color space).\nSome humans (and most mammals) are dichromats, corresponding to specific forms of color blindness in which color vision is mediated by only two of the types of color receptors. Dichromats require only two primaries to reproduce their entire gamut and their participation in color matching experiments was essential in the determination of cone fundamentals leading to all modern color spaces. Despite most vertebrates being tetrachromatic, and therefore requiring four primaries to reproduce their entire gamut, there is only one scholarly report of a functional human tetrachromat, for which trichromatic color models are insufficient.\nAdditive models.\nThe perception elicited by multiple light sources co-stimulating the same area of the retina is additive, i.e., predicted via summing the spectral power distributions (the intensity of each wavelength) of the individual light sources assuming a color matching context. For example, a purple spotlight on a dark background could be matched with coincident blue and red spotlights that are both dimmer than the purple spotlight. If the intensity of the purple spotlight was doubled it could be matched by doubling the intensities of both the red and blue spotlights that matched the original purple. The principles of additive color mixing are embodied in Grassmann's laws. Additive mixing is sometimes described as \"additive color matching\" to emphasize the fact the predictions based on additivity only apply assuming the color matching context. Additivity relies on assumptions of the color matching context such as the match being in the foveal field of view, under appropriate luminance, etc.\nAdditive mixing of coincident spot lights was applied in the experiments used to derive the CIE 1931 colorspace (see color space primaries section). The original \"monochromatic\" primaries of the wavelengths of 435.8\u00a0nm (violet), 546.1\u00a0nm (green), and 700\u00a0nm (red) were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work.\nSmall red, green, and blue elements (with controllable brightness) in electronic displays mix additively from an appropriate viewing distance to synthesize compelling colored images. This specific type of additive mixing is described as \"partitive mixing\". Red, green, and blue light are popular primaries for partitive mixing since primary lights with those hues provide a large color triangle (gamut).\nThe exact colors chosen for additive primaries are a compromise between the available technology (including considerations such as cost and power usage) and the need for large chromaticity gamut. For example, in 1953 the NTSC specified primaries that were representative of the phosphors available in that era for color CRTs. Over decades, market pressures for brighter colors resulted in CRTs using primaries that deviated significantly from the original standard. Currently, ITU-R BT.709-5 primaries are typical for high-definition television.\nSubtractive models.\nThe subtractive color mixing model predicts the resultant spectral power distribution of light filtered through overlaid partially absorbing materials, usually in the context of an underlying reflective surface such as white paper. Each layer partially absorbs some wavelengths of light from the illumination while letting others pass through, resulting in a colored appearance. The resultant spectral power distribution is predicted by the wavelength-by-wavelength product of the spectral reflectance of the illumination and the product of the spectral reflectances of all of the layers. Overlapping layers of ink in printing mix subtractively over reflecting white paper, while the reflected light mixes in a partitive way to generate color images. Importantly, unlike additive mixture, the color of the mixture is not well predicted by the colors of the individual dyes or inks. The typical number of inks in such a printing process is 3 (CMY) or 4 (CMYK), but can commonly range to 6 (e.g., Pantone hexachrome). In general, using fewer inks as primaries results in more economical printing but using more may result in better color reproduction.\nCyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) are good chromatic subtractive primaries in that filters with those colors can be overlaid to yield a surprisingly large chromaticity gamut. A black (K) ink (from the older \"key plate\") is also used in CMYK systems to augment C, M and Y inks or dyes: this is more efficient in terms of time and expense and less likely to introduce visible defects. Before the color names \"cyan\" and \"magenta\" were in common use, these primaries were often known as blue and red, respectively, and their exact color has changed over time with access to new pigments and technologies. Organizations such as Fogra, European Color Initiative and SWOP publish colorimetric CMYK standards for the printing industry.\nTraditional red, yellow, and blue primary colors as a subtractive system.\nColor theorists since the seventeenth century, and many artists and designers since that time, have taken red, yellow, and blue to be the primary colors (see history below). This RYB system, in \"traditional color theory\", is often used to order and compare colors, and sometimes proposed as a system of mixing pigments to get a wide range of, or \"all\", colors.\nO'Connor describes the role of RYB primaries in traditional color theory:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A cornerstone component of traditional color theory, the RYB conceptual color model underpins the notion that the creation of an exhaustive gamut of color nuances occurs via intermixture of red, yellow, and blue pigments, especially when applied in conjunction with white and black pigment color. In the literature relating to traditional color theory and RYB color, red, yellow, and blue are often referred to as primary colors and represent exemplar hues rather than specific hues that are more pure, unique, or proprietary variants of these hues.\nTraditional color theory is based on experience with pigments, more than on the science of light. In 1920, Snow and Froehlich explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It does not matter to the makers of dyes if, as the physicist says, red light and green light in mixture make yellow light, when they find by experiment that red pigment and green pigment in mixture produce gray. No matter what the spectroscope may demonstrate regarding the combination of yellow rays of light and blue rays of light, the fact remains that yellow pigment mixed with the blue pigment produces green pigment.\nThe widespread adoption of teaching of RYB as primary colors in post-secondary art schools in the twentieth century has been attributed to the influence of the Bauhaus, where Johannes Itten developed his ideas on color during his time there in the 1920s, and of his book on color published in 1961.\nIn discussing color design for the web, Jason Beaird writes: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The reason many digital artists still keep a red, yellow, and blue color wheel handy is because the color schemes and concepts of traditional color theory are based on that model.\u00a0... Even though I design mostly for the Web\u2014a medium that's displayed in RGB\u2014I still use red, yellow, and blue as the basis for my color selection. I believe that color combinations created using the red, yellow, and blue color wheel are more aesthetically pleasing, and that good design is about aesthetics.\nAs with any system of real primaries, not all colors can be mixed from RYB primaries. \nFor example, if the blue pigment is a deep Prussian blue, then a muddy desaturated green may be the best that can be had by mixing with yellow. To achieve a larger gamut of colors via mixing, the blue and red pigments used in illustrative materials such as the \"Color Mixing Guide\" in the image are often closer to peacock blue (a blue-green or cyan) and carmine (or crimson or magenta) respectively. \nPrinters traditionally used inks of such colors, known as \"process blue\" and \"process red\", before modern color science and the printing industry converged on the process colors (and names) cyan and magenta RYB is not the same as CMY, nor exactly subtractive, but that there is a range of ways to conceptualize traditional RYB as a subtractive system in the framework of modern color science.\nFaber-Castell identifies the following three colors: \"Cadmium yellow\" (number 107) for yellow, \"Phthalo blue\" (number 110) for blue and \"Deep scarlet red\" (number 219) for red, as the closest to primary colors for its Art &amp; Graphic color pencils range. \"Cadmium yellow\" (number 107) for yellow, \"Phthalo blue\" (number 110) for blue and \"Pale geranium lake\" (number 121) for red, are provided as primary colors in its basic 5 color \"Albrecht D\u00fcrer\" watercolor marker set.\nMixing pigments in limited palettes.\nThe first known use of red, yellow, and blue as \"simple\" or \"primary\" colors, by Chalcidius, ca. AD 300, was possibly based on the art of paint mixing.\nMixing pigments for the purpose of creating realistic paintings with diverse color gamuts is known to have been practiced at least since Ancient Greece (see history section). The identity of a set of minimal pigments to mix diverse gamuts has long been the subject of speculation by theorists whose claims have changed over time, for example, Pliny's white, black, one or another red, and \"sil\", which might have been yellow or blue; Robert Boyle's white, black, red, yellow, and blue; and variations with more or fewer \"primary\" color or pigments. Some writers and artists have found these schemes difficult to reconcile with the actual practice of painting. Nonetheless, it has long been known that limited palettes consisting of a small set of pigments are sufficient to mix a diverse gamut of colors.\nThe set of pigments available to mix diverse gamuts of color (in various media such as oil, watercolor, acrylic, gouache, and pastel) is large and has changed throughout history. There is no consensus on a specific set of pigments that are considered primary colors\u00a0\u2013 the choice of pigments depends entirely on the artist's subjective preference of subject and style of art, as well as material considerations like lightfastness and mixing behavior. A variety of limited palettes have been employed by artists for their work.\nThe color of light (i.e., the spectral power distribution) reflected from illuminated surfaces coated in paint mixes is not well approximated by a subtractive or additive mixing model. Color predictions that incorporate light scattering effects of pigment particles and paint layer thickness require approaches based on the Kubelka\u2013Munk equations, but even such approaches are not expected to predict the color of paint mixtures precisely due to inherent limitations. Artists typically rely on mixing experience and \"recipes\" to mix desired colors from a small initial set of primaries and do not use mathematical modeling.\nMacEvoy explains why artists often chose a palette closer to RYB than to CMY: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Because the 'optimal' pigments in practice produce unsatisfactory mixtures; because the alternative selections are less granulating, more transparent, and mix darker values; and because visual preferences have demanded relatively saturated yellow to red mixtures, obtained at the expense of relatively dull green and purple mixtures. Artists jettisoned 'theory' to obtain the best color mixtures in practice.\nColor space primaries.\nA color space is a subset of a color model, where the primaries have been defined, either directly as photometric spectra, or indirectly as a function of other color spaces. For example, sRGB and Adobe RGB are both color spaces based on the RGB color model. However, the green primary of Adobe RGB is more saturated than the equivalent in sRGB, and therefore yields a larger gamut. Otherwise, choice of color space is largely arbitrary and depends on the utility to a specific application.\nImaginary primaries.\nColor space primaries are derived from canonical colorimetric experiments that represent a standardized model of an observer (i.e., a set of \"color matching functions\") adopted by Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) standards. The abbreviated account of color space primaries in this section is based on descriptions in \"Colorimetry - Understanding The CIE System\".\nThe CIE 1931 standard observer is derived from experiments in which participants observe a foveal secondary bipartite field with a dark surround. Half of the field is illuminated with a monochromatic \"test stimulus\" (ranging from 380\u00a0nm to 780\u00a0nm) and the other half is the \"matching stimulus\" illuminated with three coincident monochromatic primary lights: 700\u00a0nm for red (R), 546.1\u00a0nm for green (G), and 435.8\u00a0nm for blue (B). These primaries correspond to CIE RGB color space. The intensities of the primary lights could be adjusted by the participant observer until the matching stimulus matched the test stimulus, as predicted by Grassman's laws of additive mixing. Different standard observers from other color matching experiments have been derived since 1931. The variations in experiments include choices of primary lights, field of view, number of participants etc. but the presentation below is representative of those results.\nMatching was performed across many participants in incremental steps along the range of test stimulus wavelengths (380\u00a0nm to 780\u00a0nm) to ultimately yield the color matching functions: formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3 that represent the relative intensities of red, green, and blue light to match each wavelength (formula_4). These functions imply that formula_5 units of the test stimulus with \"any\" spectral power distribution, formula_6, can be matched by [R], [G], and [B] units of each primary where:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;^{780\\text{ nm}} \\overline{r}(\\lambda) P(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda \\cdot [R] +\n\\int_{380\\text{ nm}}^{780\\text{ nm}} \\overline{g}(\\lambda) P(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda \\cdot [G] +\n\\int_{380\\text{ nm}}^{780\\text{ nm}} \\overline{b}(\\lambda) P(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda \\cdot [B].\nEach integral term in the above equation is known as a \"tristimulus value\" and measures amounts in the adopted units. No set of real primary lights can match another monochromatic light under additive mixing so at least one of the color matching functions is negative for each wavelength. A negative tristimulus value corresponds to that primary being added to the test stimulus instead of the matching stimulus to achieve a match.\nThe negative tristimulus values made certain types of calculations difficult, so the CIE put forth new color matching functions formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9 defined by the following linear transformation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese new color matching functions correspond to \"imaginary\" primary lights X, Y, and Z (CIE XYZ color space). All colors can be matched by finding the amounts [X], [Y], and [Z] analogously to [R], [G], and [B] as defined in Eq. 1. The functions formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9 based on the specifications that they should be nonnegative for all wavelengths, formula_8 be equal to photometric luminance, and that formula_14 for an equienergy (i.e., a uniform spectral power distribution) test stimulus.\nDerivations use the color matching functions, along with data from other experiments, to ultimately yield the \"cone fundamentals\": formula_15, formula_16 and formula_17. These functions correspond to the response curves for the three types of color photoreceptors found in the human retina: long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S) cones. The three cone fundamentals are related to the original color matching functions by the following linear transformation (specific to a 10\u00b0 field):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLMS color space comprises three primary lights (L, M, and S) that stimulate only the L-, M-, and S-cones respectively. A real primary that stimulates only the M-cone is impossible, and therefore these primaries are imaginary. The LMS color space has significant physiological relevance as these three photoreceptors mediate trichromatic color vision in humans.\nBoth XYZ and LMS color spaces are \"complete\" since all colors in the gamut of the standard observer are contained within their color spaces. Complete color spaces must have imaginary primaries, but color spaces with imaginary primaries are not necessarily complete (e.g. ProPhoto RGB color space).\nReal primaries.\nColor spaces used in color reproduction must use real primaries that can be reproduced by practical sources, either lights in additive models, or pigments in subtractive models. Most RGB color spaces have real primaries, though some maintain imaginary primaries. For example, all the sRGB primaries fall within the gamut of human perception, and so can be easily represented by practical light sources, including CRT and LED displays, hence why sRGB is still the color space of choice for digital displays.\nA color in a color space is defined as a combination of its primaries, where each primary must give a non-negative contribution. Any color space based on a finite number of real primaries is \"incomplete\" in that it cannot reproduce every color within the gamut of the standard observer.\nPractical color spaces such as sRGB and scRGB are typically (at least partially) defined in terms of linear transformations from CIE XYZ, and color management often uses CIE XYZ as a middle point for transformations between two other color spaces.\nMost color spaces in the color-matching context (those defined by their relationship to CIE XYZ) inherit its three-dimensionality. However, more complex color appearance models like CIECAM02 require extra dimensions to describe colors appear under different viewing conditions.\nPsychological primaries.\nThe opponent process was proposed by Ewald Hering in which he described the four unique hues (later called psychological primaries in some contexts): red, green, yellow and blue. To Hering, the unique hues appeared as pure colors, while all others were \"psychological mixes\" of two of them. Furthermore, these colors were organized in \"opponent\" pairs, red vs. green and yellow vs. blue so that mixing could occur across pairs (e.g., a yellowish green or a yellowish red) but not within a pair (i.e., reddish green cannot be imagined). An achromatic opponent process along black and white is also part of Hering's explanation of color perception. Hering asserted that we did not know why these color relationships were true but knew that they were. Although there is a great deal of evidence for the opponent process in the form of neural mechanisms, there is currently no clear mapping of the psychological primaries to neural correlates.\nThe psychological primaries were applied by Richard S. Hunter as the primaries for Hunter L,a,b colorspace that led to the creation of CIELAB. The Natural Color System is also directly inspired by the psychological primaries.\nHistory.\nPhilosophy.\nPhilosophical writing from ancient Greece has described notions of primary colors, but they can be difficult to interpret in terms of modern color science. Theophrastus (c. 371\u2013287 BCE) described Democritus' position that the primary colors were white, black, red, and green. In Classical Greece, Empedocles identified white, black, red, and, (depending on the interpretation) either yellow or green as primary colors. Aristotle described a notion in which white and black could be mixed in different ratios to yield chromatic colors; this idea had considerable influence in Western thinking about color. Fran\u00e7ois d'Aguilon's 16th century notion of the five primary colors (white, yellow, red, blue, black) was influenced by Aristotle's idea of the chromatic colors being made of black and white.The 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein explored color-related ideas using red, green, blue, and yellow as primary colors.\nLight and color vision.\nIsaac Newton used the term \"primary color\" to describe the colored spectral components of sunlight. A number of color theorists did not agree with Newton's work. David Brewster advocated that red, yellow, and blue light could be combined into any spectral hue late into the 1840s. Thomas Young proposed red, green, and violet as the three primary colors, while James Clerk Maxwell favored changing violet to blue. Hermann von Helmholtz proposed \"a slightly purplish red, a vegetation-green, slightly yellowish, and an ultramarine-blue\" as a trio. Newton, Young, Maxwell, and Helmholtz were all prominent contributors to \"modern color science\" that ultimately described the perception of color in terms of the three types of retinal photoreceptors.\nColorants.\nTwentieth century art historian\nJohn Gage's \"The Fortunes Of Apelles\" provides a summary of the history of primary colors as pigments in painting and describes the evolution of the idea as complex. Gage begins by describing Pliny the Elder's account of notable Greek painters who used four primaries. Pliny distinguished the pigments (i.e., substances) from their apparent colors: white from Milos (\"ex albis\"), red from Sinope (\"ex rubris\"), Attic yellow (\"sil\") and atramentum (\"ex nigris\"). Sil was historically confused as a blue pigment between the 16th and 17th centuries, leading to claims about white, black, red, and blue being the fewest colors required for painting. Thomas Bardwell, an 18th century Norwich portrait painter, was skeptical of the practical relevance of Pliny's account.\nRobert Boyle, the Irish chemist, introduced the term \"primary color\" in English in 1664 and claimed that there were five primary colors (white, black, red, yellow, and blue). The German painter Joachim von Sandrart eventually proposed removing white and black from the primaries and that one only needed red, yellow, blue, and green to paint \"the whole creation\".\nRed, yellow, and blue as primaries became a popular notion in the 18th and 19th centuries. Jacob Christoph Le Blon, an engraver, was the first to use separate plates for each color in mezzotint printmaking: yellow, red, and blue, plus black to add shades and contrast. Le Blon used \"primitive\" in 1725 to describe red, yellow, and blue in a very similar sense as Boyle used \"primary\". Moses Harris, an entomologist and engraver, also describes red, yellow, and blue as \"primitive\" colors in 1766. L\u00e9onor M\u00e9rim\u00e9e described red, yellow, and blue in his book on painting (originally published in French in 1830) as the three simple/primitive colors that can make a \"great variety\" of tones and colors found in nature. George Field, a chemist, used the word \"primary\" to describe red, yellow, and blue in 1835. Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, also a chemist, discussed red, yellow, and blue as \"primary\" colors in 1839.\nColor order systems.\nHistorical perspectives on color order systems (\"catalogs\" of color) that were proposed in the 18th and 19th centuries describe them as using red, yellow, and blue pigments as chromatic primaries. Tobias Mayer (a German mathematician, physicist, and astronomer) described a triangular bipyramid with red, yellow and blue at the 3 vertices in the same plane, white at the top vertex, and black and the bottom vertex in a public lecture in 1758. There are 11 planes of colors between the white and black vertices inside the triangular bipyramid. Mayer did not seem to distinguish between colored light and colorant though he used vermilion, orpiment (King's yellow), and Bergblau (azurite) in partially complete colorings of planes in his solid. Johann Heinrich Lambert (a Swiss mathematician, physicist, and astronomer) proposed a triangular pyramid with gamboge, carmine, and Prussian blue as primaries and only white at the top vertex (since Lambert could produce a mixture that was sufficiently black with those pigments). Lambert's work on this system was published in 1772. Philipp Otto Runge (the Romantic German painter) firmly believed in the theory of red, yellow and blue as the primary colors (again without distinguishing light color and colorant). His color sphere was ultimately described in an essay titled \"Farben-Kugel\" (color ball) published by Goethe in 1810. His spherical model of colors equally spaced red, yellow, and blue longitudinally with orange, green, and violet between them, and white and black at opposite poles.\nRed, yellow, and blue as primary colors.\nNumerous authors have taught that red, yellow, and blue (RYB) are the primary colors in art education materials since at least the 19th century, following the ideas introduced above from earlier centuries.\nA wide variety of contemporary educational sources also describe the RYB primaries. These sources range from children's books and art material manufacturers to painting and color guides. Art education materials often suggest that RYB primaries can be mixed to create \"all\" other colors.\nCriticism.\nAlbert Munsell, an American painter (and creator of the early 20th century Munsell color system), referred to the notion of RYB primaries as \"mischief\", \"a widely accepted error\", and underspecified in his book \"A Color Notation\", first published in 1905.\nItten's ideas about RYB primaries have been criticized as ignoring modern color science with demonstrations that some of Itten's claims about mixing RYB primaries are impossible.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the Western world, it is widely recognized as a symbol of the German Nazi Party, which appropriated it for its party insignia starting in the early 20th century. The appropriation continues with its use by neo-Nazis around the world. The swastika was and continues to be used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in Indian religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It generally takes the form of a cross, the arms of which are of equal length and perpendicular to the adjacent arms, each bent midway at a right angle.\nThe word \"swastika\" comes from , meaning 'conducive to well-being'. In Hinduism, the right-facing symbol (clockwise)\u00a0(\u5350) is called , symbolizing ('sun'), prosperity and good luck, while the left-facing symbol (counter-clockwise)\u00a0(\u534d) is called , symbolising night or tantric aspects of Kali. In Jain symbolism, it is the part of the Jain flag. It represents Suparshvanatha\u00a0\u2013 the seventh of 24 Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers and saviours), while in Buddhist symbolism it represents the auspicious footprints of the Buddha. In the different Indo-European traditions, the swastika symbolises fire, lightning bolts, and the sun. The symbol is found in the archaeological remains of the Indus Valley civilisation and Samarra, as well as in early Byzantine and Christian artwork.\nAlthough used for the first time as a symbol of international antisemitism by far-right Romanian politician A. C. Cuza prior to World War I, it was a symbol of auspiciousness and good luck for most of the Western world until the 1930s, when the German Nazi Party adopted the swastika as an emblem of the Aryan race. As a result of World War II and the Holocaust, in the West it continues to be strongly associated with Nazism, antisemitism, white supremacism, or simply evil. As a consequence, its use in some countries, including Germany, is prohibited by law. However, the swastika remains a symbol of good luck and prosperity in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain countries such as Nepal, India, Thailand, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, China and Japan, and carries various other meanings for peoples around the world, such as the Akan, Hopi, Navajo, and Tlingit peoples. It is also commonly used in Hindu marriage ceremonies and Dipavali celebrations.\nEtymology and nomenclature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWith well-being (swasti) we would follow along our path, like the Sun and the Moon. May we meet up with one who gives in return, who does not smite (harm), with one who knows.\n \u2014 The Rigveda V.51.15\nThe word \"swastika\" is derived from the Sanskrit root , which is composed of 'good, well' and 'is; it is; there is'. The word occurs frequently in the Vedas as well as in classical literature, meaning 'health, luck, success, prosperity', and it was commonly used as a greeting. The final is a common suffix that could have multiple meanings.\nAccording to 19th century Sanskrit scholar Monier Monier-Williams, a majority of scholars consider the swastika to originally be a solar symbol. The sign implies well-being, something fortunate, lucky, or auspicious. It is alternatively spelled in contemporary texts as \"svastika\", and other spellings were occasionally used in the 19th and early 20th century, such as \"suastika\". It was derived from the Sanskrit term (Devanagari ), which transliterates to \"\" under the commonly used IAST transliteration system, but is pronounced closer to \"swastika\".\nThe earliest known use of the word swastika is in P\u0101\u1e47ini's A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, which uses it to explain a Sanskrit grammar rule, in the context of a type of identifying mark on a cow's ear. P\u0101\u1e47ini lived in or before the 4th century BCE, possibly in 6th or 5th century BCE.\nAn early use of \"swastika\" in a European text was in 1871 with the publications of Heinrich Schliemann, who discovered more than 1,800 ancient instances of swastikas and variants while digging the Hisarlik mound near the Aegean Sea coast for the history of Troy. Schliemann linked his findings to the Sanskrit .\nBy the 19th century, the term \"swastika\" was adopted into English, replacing the previous \"gammadion\" from Greek . In 1878, the Irish scholar Charles Graves used \"swastika\" as the common English name for the symbol, after defining it as equivalent to the French term \u00a0\u2013 a cross with arms shaped like the Greek letter gamma (\u0393). Shortly thereafter, the British antiquarians Edward Thomas and Robert Sewell separately published their studies about the symbol, using \"swastika\" as the common English term.\nThe \"reversed\" swastika was probably first conceived among European scholars by Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf in 1852 and taken up by Schliemann in \"Ilios\" (1880), based on a letter from Max M\u00fcller that quotes Burnouf. The term is used in the sense of 'backward swastika' by Eug\u00e8ne Goblet d'Alviella (1894): \"In India it [the \"gammadion\"] bears the name of , when its arms are bent towards the right, and when they are turned in the other direction.\"\nOther names for the symbol include:\nIn various European languages, it is known as the \"fylfot\", , , or (a term in Anglo-Norman heraldry); German: ; French: ; Italian: ; Latvian: . In Mongolian it is called () and mainly used in seals. In Chinese it is called \u534d\u5b57, pronounced in Mandarin, \"manji\" in Cantonese, in Japanese, (\ub9cc\uc790) in Korean and or in Vietnamese. In Balti/Tibetan language it is called .\nAppearance.\nAll swastikas are bent crosses based on a chiral symmetry, but they appear with different geometric details: as compact crosses with short legs, as crosses with large arms and as motifs in a pattern of unbroken lines. Chirality describes an absence of reflective symmetry, with the existence of two versions that are mirror images of each other. The mirror-image forms are typically described as left-facing or left-hand (\u534d) and right-facing or right-hand (\u5350).\nThe compact swastika can be seen as a chiral irregular icosagon (20-sided polygon) with fourfold (90\u00b0) rotational symmetry. Such a swastika proportioned on a 5\u00d75 square grid and with the broken portions of its legs shortened by one unit can tile the plane by translation alone. The main Nazi flag swastika used a 5\u00d75 diagonal grid, but with the legs unshortened.\nWritten characters.\nThe swastika was adopted as a standard character in Chinese, \"\u534d\" () and as such entered various other East Asian languages, including Chinese script. In Japanese, the symbol is called or .\nThe swastika is included in the Unicode character sets of two languages. In the Chinese block, it is U+534D \u534d (left-facing) and U+5350 for the swastika \u5350 (right-facing); The latter has a mapping in the original Big5 character set, but the former does not (although it is in Big5+). In Unicode 5.2, two swastika symbols and two swastikas were added to the Tibetan block: swastika , , and swastikas , .\nOrigin.\nEuropean uses of swastikas are often treated in conjunction with cross symbols in general, such as the sun cross of Bronze Age religion. Beyond its certain presence in the \"proto-writing\" symbol systems, such as the Vin\u010da script, which appeared during the Neolithic.\nNorth Pole.\nAccording to Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, the swastika represents the North Pole, and the rotational movement around a centre or immutable axis (), and only secondly it represents the Sun as a reflected function of the North Pole. As such it is a symbol of life, of the vivifying role of the supreme principle of the universe, the absolute God, in relation to the cosmic order. It represents the activity (the Hellenic , the Hindu , the Chinese , 'Great One') of the principle of the universe in the formation of the world. According to Gu\u00e9non, the swastika in its polar value has the same meaning of the yin and yang symbol of the Chinese tradition, and of other traditional symbols of the working of the universe, including the letters \u0393 (gamma) and G, symbolising the Great Architect of the Universe of Masonic thought.\nAccording to the scholar Reza Assasi, the swastika represents the north ecliptic North Pole centred in \u03b6 Draconis, with the constellation Draco as one of its beams. He argues that this symbol was later attested as the four-horse chariot of Mithra in ancient Iranian culture. They believed the cosmos was pulled by four heavenly horses who revolved around a fixed centre in a clockwise direction. He suggests that this notion later flourished in Roman Mithraism, as the symbol appears in Mithraic iconography and astronomical representations.\nAccording to the Russian archaeologist Gennady Zdanovich, who studied some of the oldest examples of the symbol in Sintashta culture, the swastika symbolises the universe, representing the spinning constellations of the celestial north pole centred in \u03b1 Ursae Minoris, specifically the Little and Big Dipper (or Chariots), or Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. Likewise, according to Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non-the swastika is drawn by visualising the Big Dipper/Great Bear in the four phases of revolution around the pole star.\nComet.\nIn their 1985 book \"Comet\", Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan argue that the appearance of a rotating comet with a four-pronged tail as early as 2,000 years BCE could explain why the swastika is found in the cultures of both the Old World and the pre-Columbian Americas. The Han dynasty \"Book of Silk\" (2nd century BCE) depicts such a comet with a swastika-like symbol.\nBob Kobres, in a 1992 paper, contends that the swastika-like comet on the Han-dynasty manuscript was labelled a \"long tailed pheasant star\" (\"dixing\") because of its resemblance to a bird's foot or footprint. Similar comparisons had been made by J.F. Hewitt in 1907, as well as a 1908 article in \"Good Housekeeping\". Kobres goes on to suggest an association of mythological birds and comets also outside of China.\nFour winds.\nIn Native American culture, particularly among the Pima people of Arizona, the swastika is a symbol of the four winds. Anthropologist Frank Hamilton Cushing noted that among the Pima the symbol of the four winds is made from a cross with the four curved arms (similar to a broken sun cross) and concludes \"the right-angle swastika is primarily a representation of the circle of the four wind gods standing at the head of their trails, or directions.\"\nHistorical uses.\nPrehistory.\nThe earliest known swastikas are from 10,000 to 17,000 BCE\u00a0\u2013 part of \"an intricate meander pattern of joined-up swastikas\" found on a late Paleolithic figurine of a bird, carved from mammoth ivory, found in Mezine, Ukraine. It has been suggested that this swastika may be a stylised picture of a stork in flight. As the carving was found near phallic objects, this may also support the idea that the pattern was a fertility symbol.\nIn the mountains of Iran, there are swastikas or spinning wheels inscribed on stone walls, which are estimated to be more than 7,000 years old. One instance is in Khorashad, Birjand, on the holy wall Lakh Mazar.\nMirror-image swastikas (clockwise and counter-clockwise) have been found on ceramic pottery in the Devetashka cave, Bulgaria, dated to 6,000 BCE.\nIn South Asia, swastika symbols first appear in the archaeological record around 3000 BCE in the Indus Valley Civilisation. It also appears in the Bronze and Iron Age cultures around the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. In all these cultures, swastika symbols do not appear to occupy any marked position or significance, appearing as just one form of a series of similar symbols of varying complexity. In the Zoroastrian religion of Persia, the swastika was a symbol of the revolving sun, infinity, or continuing creation. It is one of the most common symbols on Mesopotamian coins. In England, neolithic or Bronze Age stone carvings of the symbol have been found on Ilkley Moor, such as the Swastika Stone.\nSwastikas have also been found on pottery in archaeological digs in Africa, in the area of Kush and on pottery at the Jebel Barkal temples, in Iron Age designs of the northern Caucasus (Koban culture), and in Neolithic China in the Majiayao culture.\nSwastikas are also seen in Egypt during the Coptic period. Textile number T.231-1923 held at the V&amp;A Museum in London includes small swastikas in its design. This piece was found at Qau-el-Kebir, near Asyut, and is dated between 300 and 600 CE.\nThe \"Tierwirbel\" (the German for \"animal whorl\" or \"whirl of animals\") is a characteristic motif in Bronze Age Central Asia, the Eurasian Steppe, and later also in Iron Age Scythian and European (Baltic and Germanic) culture, showing rotational symmetric arrangement of an animal motif, often four birds' heads. Even wider diffusion of this \"Asiatic\" theme has been proposed to the Pacific and even North America (especially Moundville).\nCaucasus.\nIn Armenia the swastika is called the \"arevakhach\" and \"kerkhach\" () and is the ancient symbol of eternity and eternal light (i.e. God). Swastikas in Armenia were found on petroglyphs from the copper age, predating the Bronze Age. During the Bronze Age it was depicted on cauldrons, belts, medallions and other items.\nSwastikas can also be seen on early Medieval churches and fortresses, including the principal tower in Armenia's historical capital city of Ani. The same symbol can be found on Armenian carpets, cross-stones (\"khachkar\") and in medieval manuscripts, as well as on modern monuments as a symbol of eternity.\nOld petroglyphs of four-beam and other swastikas were recorded in Dagestan, in particular, among the Avars. According to Vakhushti of Kartli, the tribal banner of the Avar khans depicted a wolf with a standard with a double-spiral swastika.\nPetroglyphs with swastikas were depicted on medieval Vainakh tower architecture (see sketches by scholar Bruno Plaetschke from the 1920s). Thus, a rectangular swastika was made in engraved form on the entrance of a residential tower in the settlement Khimoy, Chechnya.\nEurope.\nIron Age attestations of swastikas can be associated with Indo-European cultures such as the Illyrians, Indo-Iranians, Celts, Greeks, Italics, Germanic peoples and Slavs. In Sintashta culture's \"Country of Towns\", ancient Indo-European settlements in southern Russia, it has been found a great concentration of some of the oldest swastika patterns.\nSwastika shapes have been found on numerous artefacts from Iron Age Europe.\nThe swastika shape appears on various Germanic Migration Period and Viking Age artifacts, such as the 3rd-century V\u00e6rl\u00f8se Fibula from Zealand, Denmark, the Gothic spearhead from Brest-Litovsk, today in Belarus, the 9th-century Snoldelev Stone from Rams\u00f8, Denmark, and numerous Migration Period bracteates drawn left-facing or right-facing.\nThe pagan Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo, England, contained numerous items bearing swastikas, now housed in the collection of the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. A swastika is clearly marked on a hilt and sword belt found at Bifrons in Kent, in a grave of about the 6th century.\nHilda Ellis Davidson hypothesised that the swastika symbol was associated with Thor, possibly representing his Mjolnir\u00a0\u2013 symbolic of thunder\u00a0\u2013 and possibly being connected to the Bronze Age sun cross. Davidson cites \"many examples\" of swastika symbols from Anglo-Saxon graves of the pagan period, with particular prominence on cremation urns from the cemeteries of East Anglia. Some of the swastikas on the items, on display at the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, are depicted with such care and art that, according to Davidson, it must have possessed special significance as a funerary symbol. The runic inscription on the 8th-century S\u00e6b\u00f8 sword has been taken as evidence of the swastika as a symbol of Thor in Norse paganism.\nThe bronze frontispiece of a ritual pre-Christian (c.\u2009350\u201350 BCE) shield found in the River Thames near Battersea Bridge (hence \"Battersea Shield\") is embossed with 27 swastikas in bronze and red enamel. An Ogham stone found in Aglish, County Kerry, Ireland (CIIC 141) was modified into an early Christian gravestone, and was decorated with a cross patt\u00e9e and two swastikas. The Book of Kells (c.\u2009800 CE) contains swastika-shaped ornamentation. A number of swastikas have been found embossed in Galician metal pieces and carved in stones, mostly from the Castro culture period, although there also are contemporary examples (imitating old patterns for decorative purposes).\nThe ancient Baltic thunder cross symbol (\"p\u0113rkona krusts\" or \"perk\u016bno kry\u017eius\" (cross of Perk\u016bnas); also fire cross, \"ugunskrusts\") is a swastika symbol used to decorate objects, traditional clothing and in archaeological excavations.\nIn Lithuania since ancient times the swastika\u2014found on objects crafted from antler, wood, metal, and clay\u2014served as a significant cultural and religious emblem deeply rooted in Baltic tradition for the Lithuanians. The researchers of Klaip\u0117da University discovered that there was no standardized or canonical form of the symbol: on single-sided artifacts, the swastika\u2019s arms could rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise, whereas two-sided items might display both orientations simultaneously, suggesting an inclusive or multifaceted symbolic intention. Importantly, the contexts in which the swastika appears often linked the symbol to two deities in Lithuanian mythology: Perk\u016bnas, the god of thunder, and Kalvelis, the blacksmith. This association reinforces the concept of the swastika as a manifestation of the \u201cfire cross\u201d\u2014an equilateral cross symbolizing fire or thunder\u2014an enduring motif within Baltic and ancient Lithuanian religious iconography.\nAccording to painter Stanis\u0142aw Jakubowski, the \"little sun\" (Polish: \"s\u0142oneczko\") is an Early Slavic pagan symbol of the Sun; he claimed it was engraved on wooden monuments built near the final resting places of fallen Slavs to represent eternal life. The symbol was first seen in his collection of Early Slavic symbols and architectural features, which he named \"Pras\u0142owia\u0144skie motywy architektoniczne\" (Polish: \"Early Slavic Architectural Motifs\"). His work was published in 1923.\nThe Boreyko coat of arms with a red swastika was used by several noble families in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nAccording to Boris Kuftin, the Russians often used swastikas as a decorative element and as the basis of the ornament on traditional weaving products. Many can be seen on a women's folk costume from the Meshchera Lowlands.\nAccording to some authors, Russian names popularly associated with the swastika include \"veterok\" (\"breeze\"), \"ognevtsi\" (\"little flames\"), \"geese\", \"hares\" (a towel with a swastika was called a towel with \"hares\"), or \"little horses\". The similar word \"koleso\" (\"wheel\") was used for rosette-shaped amulets, such as a hexafoil-thunder wheel ) in folklore, particularly in the Russian North.\nAn object very much like a hammer or a double axe is depicted among the magical symbols on the drums of Sami \"noaidi\", used in their religious ceremonies before Christianity was established. The name of the Sami thunder god was Horagalles, thought to derive from \"Old Man Thor\" (\"\u00de\u00f3rr karl\"). Sometimes on the drums, a male figure with a hammer-like object in either hand is shown, and sometimes it is more like a cross with crooked ends, or a swastika.\nSouthern and eastern Asia.\nThe icon has been of spiritual significance to Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The swastika is a sacred symbol in the B\u00f6n religion, native to Tibet.\nHinduism.\nThe swastika is an important Hindu symbol. The swastika symbol is commonly used before entrances or on doorways of homes or temples, to mark the starting page of financial statements, and mandalas constructed for rituals such as weddings or welcoming a newborn.\nThe swastika has a particular association with Diwali, being drawn in \"rangoli\" (coloured sand) or formed with deepak lights on the floor outside Hindu houses and on wall hangings and other decorations.\nIn the diverse traditions within Hinduism, both the clockwise and counter-clockwise swastika are found, with different meanings. The clockwise or right hand icon is called \"swastika\", while the counter-clockwise or left hand icon is called \"sauwastika\" or \"sauvastika\". The clockwise swastika is a solar symbol (Surya), suggesting the motion of the Sun in India (the northern hemisphere), where it appears to enter from the east, then ascend to the south at midday, exiting to the west. The counter-clockwise \"sauwastika\" is less used; it connotes the night, and in tantric traditions it is an icon for the goddess Kali, the terrifying form of Devi Durga. The symbol also represents activity, karma, motion, wheel, and in some contexts the lotus. According to Norman McClelland its symbolism for motion and the Sun may be from shared prehistoric cultural roots.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhism, the swastika is considered to symbolise the auspicious footprints of the Buddha. The left-facing sauwastika is often imprinted on the chest, feet or palms of Buddha images. It is an aniconic symbol for the Buddha in many parts of Asia and homologous with the \"dharma wheel\". The shape symbolises eternal cycling, a theme found in the \"samsara\" doctrine of Buddhism.\nThe swastika symbol is common in esoteric tantric traditions of Buddhism, along with Hinduism, where it is found with chakra theories and other meditative aids. The clockwise symbol is more common, and contrasts with the counter-clockwise version common in the Tibetan Bon tradition and locally called \"yungdrung\".\nIn East Asia, the swastika is prevalent in Buddhist monasteries and communities. It is commonly found in Buddhist temples, religious artifacts, texts related to Buddhism and schools founded by Buddhist religious groups. It also appears as a design or motif (singularly or woven into a pattern) on textiles, architecture and various decorative objects as a symbol of luck and good fortune. The icon is also found as a sacred symbol in the Bon tradition, but in the left-facing orientation.\nJainism.\nIn Jainism, it is a symbol of the seventh \"t\u012brtha\u1e45kara\", Supar\u015bvan\u0101tha. In the \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara tradition, it is also one of the \"a\u1e63\u1e6dama\u1e45gala\" or eight auspicious symbols. All Jain temples and holy books must contain the swastika and ceremonies typically begin and end with creating a swastika mark several times with rice around the altar. Jains use rice to make a swastika in front of statues and then put an offering on it, usually a ripe or dried fruit, a sweet ( ), or a coin or currency note. The four arms of the swastika symbolise the four places where a soul could be reborn in \"samsara\", the cycle of birth and death\u00a0\u2013 \"svarga\" \"heaven\", \"naraka\" \"hell\", \"manushya\" \"humanity\" or \"tiryancha\" \"as flora or fauna\"\u00a0\u2013 before the soul attains \"moksha\" \"salvation\" as a \"siddha\", having ended the cycle of birth and death and become omniscient.\nPrevalence in southern Asia.\nIn Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the swastika is common. Temples, businesses and other organisations, such as the Buddhist libraries, Ahmedabad Stock Exchange and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce, use the swastika in reliefs or logos. Swastikas are ubiquitous in Indian and Nepalese communities, located on shops, buildings, transport vehicles, and clothing. The swastika remains prominent in Hindu ceremonies such as weddings. The left facing \"sauwastika\" symbol is found in tantric rituals.\nMusaeus College in Colombo, Sri Lanka, a Buddhist girls' school, has a left facing swastika in their school logo.\nIn India, \"Swastik\" and \"Swastika\", with their spelling variants, are first names for males and females respectively, for instance with Swastika Mukherjee. The Emblem of Bihar contains two swastikas.\nIn Bhutan, swastika motifs are found in architecture, fabrics and religious ceremonies.\nAmong the predominantly Hindu population of Bali, in Indonesia, swastikas are common in temples, homes and public spaces. Similarly, the swastika is a common icon associated with Buddha's footprints in Theravada Buddhist communities of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.\nThe Tantra-based new religious movement Ananda Marga (Devanagari: \u0906\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917, meaning 'Path of Bliss') uses a motif similar to the Ra\u00eblians, but in their case the apparent star of David is defined as intersecting triangles with no specific reference to Jewish culture.\nSpread to eastern Asia.\nThe swastika is an auspicious symbol in China where it was introduced from India with Buddhism. In 693, during the Tang dynasty, it was declared as \"the source of all good fortune\" and was called by Wu Zetian becoming a Chinese word. The Chinese character for () is similar to a swastika in shape and has two different variations:\u300a\u5350\u300band \u300a\u534d\u300b. As the Chinese character ( or ) is homonym for the Chinese word of \"ten thousand\" () and \"infinity\", as such the Chinese character is itself a symbol of immortality and infinity.175 It was also a representation of longevity.175\nThe Chinese character could be used as a stand-alone\u300a\u300bor\u300a\u300bor as be used as pairs\u300a \u300bin Chinese visual arts, decorative arts, and clothing due to its auspicious connotation.175\nAdding the character ( or ) to other auspicious Chinese symbols or patterns can multiply that wish by 10,000 times.175 It can be combined with other Chinese characters, such as the Chinese character \u300a\u58fd\u300bfor longevity where it is sometimes even integrated into the Chinese character to augment the meaning of longevity.175\nThe paired swastika symbols ( and ) are included, at least since the Liao Dynasty (907\u20131125 CE), as part of the Chinese writing system and are variant characters for \u300a\u842c\u300b or \u300a\u4e07\u300b (\"w\u00e0n\" in Mandarin, \u300a\ub9cc\u300b(\"man\") in Korean, Cantonese, and Japanese, \"v\u1ea1n\" in Vietnamese) meaning \"myriad\".\nThe character can also be stylized in the form of the , Chinese auspicious clouds.\nWhen the Chinese writing system was introduced to Japan in the 8th century, the swastika was adopted into the Japanese language and culture. It is commonly referred as the \"manji\" (lit.\u2009'10,000-character'). Since the Middle Ages, it has been used as a \"mon\" by various Japanese families such as Tsugaru clan, Hachisuka clan or around 60 clans that belong to Tokugawa clan.\nThe city of Hirosaki in Aomori Prefecture designates this symbol as its official flag, which stemmed from its use in the emblem of the Tsugaru clan, the lords of Hirosaki Domain during the Edo period.\nIn Japan, the swastika is also used as a map symbol and is designated by the Survey Act and related Japanese governmental rules to denote a Buddhist temple. Japan has considered changing this due to occasional controversy and misunderstanding by foreigners. The symbol is sometimes censored in international versions of Japanese works, such as anime. Censorship of this symbol in Japan and in Japanese media abroad has been subject to occasional controversy related to freedom of speech, with critics of the censorship arguing it does not respect history nor freedom of speech.\nIn Chinese and Japanese art, swastikas are often found as part of a repeating pattern. One common pattern, called \"sayagata\" in Japanese, comprises left- and right-facing swastikas joined by lines. As the negative space between the lines has a distinctive shape, the sayagata pattern is sometimes called the \"key fret\" motif in English.\nMany Chinese religions make use of swastika symbols, including Guiyidao and Shanrendao. The Red Swastika Society, formed in China in 1922 as the philanthropic branch of Guiyidao, became the largest supplier of emergency relief in China during World War II, in the same manner as the Red Cross in the rest of the world. The Red Swastika Society abandoned mainland China in 1954, settling first in Hong Kong then in Taiwan. They continue to use the red swastika as their symbol.\nThe Falun Gong qigong movement, founded in China in the early 1990s, uses a symbol that features a large swastika surrounded by four smaller (and rounded) ones, interspersed with yin-and-yang symbols.\nClassical Europe.\nAncient Greek architectural, clothing and coin designs are replete with single or interlinking swastika motifs. There are also gold plate fibulae from the 8th century BCE decorated with an engraved swastika. Related symbols in classical Western architecture include the cross, the three-legged triskele or triskelion and the rounded lauburu. The swastika symbol is also known in these contexts by a number of names, especially \"gammadion\", or rather the tetra-gammadion. The name \"gammadion\" comes from its being seen as being made up of four Greek gamma (\u0393) letters. Ancient Greek architectural designs are replete with the interlinking symbol.\nIn Greco-Roman art and architecture, and in Romanesque and Gothic art in the West, isolated swastikas are relatively rare, and the swastika is more commonly found as a repeated element in a border or tessellation. Swastikas often represented perpetual motion, reflecting the design of a rotating windmill or watermill. A meander of connected swastikas makes up the large band that surrounds the Augustan Ara Pacis.\nA design of interlocking swastikas is one of several tessellations on the floor of the cathedral of Amiens, France. A border of linked swastikas was a common Roman architectural motif, and can be seen in more recent buildings as a neoclassical element. A swastika border is one form of meander, and the individual swastikas in such a border are sometimes called \"Greek keys\". There have also been swastikas found on the floors of Pompeii.\nSwastikas were widespread among the Illyrians, symbolising the Sun and the fire. The Sun cult was the main Illyrian cult; a swastika in clockwise motion is interpreted in particular as a representation of the movement of the Sun.\nThe swastika has been preserved by the Albanians since Illyrian times as a pagan symbol commonly found in a variety of contexts of Albanian folk art, including traditional tattooing, grave art, jewellery, clothes, and house carvings. The swastika ( or , \"hooked cross\") and other crosses in Albanian tradition represent the Sun (Dielli) and the fire (zjarri, evidently called with the theonym Enji). In Albanian paganism fire is regarded as the offspring of the Sun and fire calendar rituals are practiced in order to give strength to the Sun and to ward off evil.\nMedieval and early modern Europe.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn Christianity, the swastika is used as a hooked version of the Christian Cross, the symbol of Christ's victory over death. Some Christian churches built in the Romanesque and Gothic eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a mosaic in the Saint Sophia Cathedral, Kyiv, dating from the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on the so-called Sarcophagus of Stilicho in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan.\nA ceiling painted in 1910 in the Grenoble Archaeological Museum (the former church of St Laurent) has many swastikas. A proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the Amiens Cathedral, which was built on top of a pagan site at Amiens, France in the 13th century, is considered unlikely. The stole worn by a priest in the 1445 painting of the Seven Sacraments by Rogier van der Weyden presents the swastika form simply as one way of depicting the cross.\nSwastikas also appear in art and architecture during the Renaissance and Baroque era. The fresco \"The School of Athens\" shows an ornament made out of swastikas, and the symbol can also be found on the facade of the \"Santa Maria della Salute\", a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of Venice.\nIn the Polish First Republic swastika symbols were also popular with the nobility. Several noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia, also had swastikas as their coat of arms. The family reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and its crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.\nThe swastika was also a heraldic symbol, for example on the Boreyko coat of arms, used by noblemen in Poland and Ukraine. In the 19th century a swastika was one of the Russian Empire's symbols and was used on coinage as a backdrop to the .\nRediscovery by Heinrich Schliemann.\nAt Troy near the Dardanelles, Heinrich Schliemann's 1871\u20131875 archaeological excavations discovered objects decorated with swastikas.3131 Hearing of this, the director of the French School at Athens, \u00c9mile-Louis Burnouf, wrote to Schliemann in 1872, stating \"the Swastika should be regarded as a sign of the Aryan race\". Burnouf told Schliemann that \"It should also be noted that the Jews have completely rejected it\".89 Accordingly, Schliemann believed the Trojans to have been Aryans: \"The primitive Trojans, therefore, belonged to the Aryan race, which is further sufficiently proved by the symbols on the round terra-cottas\".15790 Schliemann accepted Burnouf's interpretation.89\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This winter, I have read in Athens many excellent works of celebrated scholars on Indian antiquities, especially Adalbert Kuhn, ; Max M\u00fcller's \"Essays\"; \u00c9mile Burnouf, and ; as well as several works by Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf; and I now perceive that these crosses upon the Trojan terra-cottas are of the highest importance to arch\u00e6ology.\u2014\u200a\nSchliemann believed that use of swastikas spread widely across Eurasia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... I am now able to prove that ... the \u534d, which I find in \u00c9mile Burnouf's Sanscrit lexicon, under the name of \"\"suastika\",\" and with the meaning , or as the sign of good wishes, were already regarded, thousands of years before Christ, as religious symbols of the very greatest importance among the early progenitors of the Aryan races in Bactria and in the villages of the Oxus, at a time when Germans, Indians, Pelasgians, Celts, Persians, Slavonians and Iranians still formed one nation and spoke one language.\u2014\u200a\nSchliemann established a link between the swastika and Germany. He connected objects he excavated at Troy to objects bearing swastikas found in Germany near K\u00f6nigswalde on the Oder.313190\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For I recognise at the first glance the \"suastika\" upon one of those three pot bottoms, which were discovered on Bishop's Island near K\u00f6nigswalde on the right bank of the Oder, and have given rise to very many learned discussions, while no one recognised the mark as that exceedingly significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors.\u2014\u200a\nSarah Boxer, in an article in 2000 in \"The New York Times\", described this as a \"fateful link\". According to Steven Heller, \"Schliemann presumed that the swastika was a religious symbol of his German ancestors which linked ancient Teutons, Homeric Greeks and Vedic India\".31 According to Bernard Mees, \"Of all of the pre-runic symbols, the swastika has always been the most popular among scholars\" and \"The origin of swastika studies must be traced to the excitement generated by the archaeological finds of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy\".\nAfter his excavations at Troy, Schliemann began digging at Mycenae. According to Cathy Gere, \"Having burdened the swastika symbol with such cultural, religious and racial significance in \"Troy and Its Remains\", it was incumbent on Schliemann to find the symbol repeated at Mycenae, but its occurrence turned out to be disappointingly infrequent\".91 Gere writes that \"He did his best with what he had\":91\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The cross with the marks of four nails may often be seen; as well as the \u534d, which is usually also represented with four points indicating the four nails, thus \u0fd8. These signs cannot but represent the \"suastika\", formed by two pieces of wood, which were laid across and fixed with four nails, and in the joint of which the holy fire was produced by friction by a third piece of wood. But both the cross and the \u534d occur for the most part only on the vases with geometrical patterns.\u2014\u200a\nGere points out that although Schliemann wrote that the motif \"may often be seen\", his 1878 book \"Mycen\u00e6\" did not have illustrations of any examples.91 Schliemann described \"a small and thick terra-cotta disk\" on which \"are engraved a number of \u534d's, the sign which occurs so frequently in the ruins of Troy\", but as Gere notes, he did not publish an illustration.7791\nAmong the gold grave goods at Grave Circles A and B was a \"repouss\u00e9\" roundel in grave III of Grave Circle A, the ornamentation of which Schliemann thought was \"derived\" from the swastika:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The curious ornamentation in the centre, which so often recurs here, seems to me to be derived from the \u0fd8, the more so as the points which are thought to be the marks of the nails, are seldom missing; the artist has only added two more arms and curved all of them.\u2014\u200a\nAccording to Gere, this motif is \"completely dissimilar\" to the swastika, and that Schliemann was \"straining desperately after the same connection\".91 Nevertheless, the Mycenaean Greeks and the Trojan people both came to be identified as representatives of the Aryan race: \"Despite the difficulties with linking the symbolism of Troy and Mycenae, the common Aryan roots of the two peoples became something of a truism\".91\nThe house Schliemann had had built in Panepistimiou Street in Athens by 1880, Iliou Melathron, is decorated with swastika symbols and motifs in numerous places, including the ironwork railing and gates, the window bars, the ceiling fresco of the entrance hall, and the entire floor of one room.\nFollowing Schliemann, academic studies on the swastika were published by Ludvig M\u00fcller, Micha\u0142 \u017bmigrodzki, Eug\u00e8ne Goblet d'Alviella, Thomas Wilson, Oscar Montelius and Joseph D\u00e9chelette.\nGerman occultism and pan-German nationalism.\nOn 24 June 1875, Guido von List commemorated the 1500th anniversary of the German victory over the Roman Empire at the Battle of Carnuntum by burying a swastika of eight wine bottles beneath the (lit.\u2009'Heathens' Gate') in the ruins of Carnuntum.35 In 1891, List began to claim that heraldry's division of the field was derived from the shapes of runes.71 He claimed that the medieval German was a survival of the pre-Christian Armanist priest-kings and that the cryptic letters \"SSGG\" inscribed on vehmic knives represented a double sig rune followed by two swastikas.76\nIn 1897, Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth published and , which according to Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke in \"The Occult Roots of Nazism\", \"described the sexual-religion of the Aryans, a sacred practice of eugenics designed to maintain the purity of the race\".51 Both works were \"illustrated with the magical curved-armed armed swastika\".51 Influenced by Sebaldt, List published in \"Der Scherer \u2013 erstes illustriertes Tiroler Witzblatt\" an article (\"\") which claimed the swastika was a sacred symbol of the Aryans representing the \"fire-whisk\" () with which the creator deity had begun the world.52 In September 1903, List published an article discussing the creation of the universe, the \"old-Aryan sexual religion\", reincarnation, karma, \"Wotanism\", and \"Armanism\" from his theosophical viewpoint, which was illustrated by triskelions and various swastikas in the Viennese occult journal . According to Goodrick-Clarke, \"This article marked the first stage in List's articulation of a Germanic occult religion, the principal concern of which was racial purity\".52\nBetween 1905 and 1907, List published articles in the arguing that the swastika, the triskelion, and the sun-wheel were all \"Armanist\" occult symbols (Armanen runes) concealed in German heraldry, and in 1908 his (lit.\u2009'\"The Secret of the Runes\"') argued that the swastika or Armanen rune \"Gibor\" was represented in blazons including different heraldic crosses and kinked versions of the ordinaries pale, bend, and fess.72 List argued that the swastika, triskelion, and other Armanen runes had been concealed in 15th-century rose windows and curvilinear tracery in late Gothic architecture.74\nList's 1908 book (lit.\u2009'\"The Rite of the Ario-Germans\"') had chapter headings with triskelions, swastikas, and other symbols attached. The work laid out his belief in an ancient priestly of Wotanist initiates and identified the \"Ario-Germans\" as a \"race\" identical with Helena Blavatsky's theosophical fifth \"root race\". List's 1910 (lit.\u2009'\"The Religion of the Ario-Germans\"') discussed Yuga cycles and the Kali Yuga, proposing a mathematical relationship with the of the .53 His (lit.\u2009'\"The Picture-Writing of the Ario-Germans\"') of the same year connected Blavatsky's Hindu-inspired cosmic cycles (kalpas) with the realms of Muspelheim (), Asgard, Vanaheimr (), and Midgard, each with a corresponding symbol. Blavatsky's first Astral and second Hyperborean races List connected with the descendants of Ymir and Orgelmir, her third Lemurian race was his race of Thrudgelmir, her fourth Atlantean race his descendants of Bergelmir, and Blavatsky's fifth root race List identified as the \"Ario-Germans\". According to Goodrick-Clarke, List again argued that the clockwise swastika was a holy symbol of the \"Ario-Germans\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A series of anti-clockwise triskelions and swastikas and inverted triangles symbolized stages of cosmic evolution in the downsweep of the cycle (i.e. the evolution from unity to multiplicity), while their clockwise and upright counterparts connoted the return path to the godhead. The skewed super-imposition of these 'falling' and 'rising' sigils created complex sigils like the hexagram and the Maltese Cross. List asserted that these latter symbols were utterly sacred, because they embraced the two antithetical forces of all creation: as the representative symbols of the zenith of multiplicity at the outermost limit of the cycle, they denoted the Ario-German god-man, the highest form of life ever to evolve in the universe.54\nList's 1914 (lit.\u2009'\"The Proto-Language of the Ario-Germans\"') adopted the geological ideas of theosophist William Scott-Elliot and claimed that fragments of Atlantis remained part of Europe, pointing to rocking stones in Lower Austria and European megaliths as evidence. From J\u00f6rg Lanz von Liebenfels, List took on occult ideas about the Aryan homeland Arktog\u00e4a (a lost polar continent), and struggle the Ario-German master races and the non-Aryan slave races, and the Knights Templar. List believed that the Templars had been adepts of \"Armanism\" during the Middle Ages' Christian ascendancy, and that they had been suppressed for worshipping the Maltese cross that List believed to be derived from a superimposed clockwise and counter-clockwise swastika and which he identified with Baphomet. Members of the inner circle of the Guido von List Society, the (HAO), expressed their membership of the occult priesthood with swastikas. Heinrich Winter, Friedrich Oskar Wannieck, and Georg Hauerstein senior's first wife all had their graves decorated with swastikas.65Lanz, a former Cistercian, established the Order of the New Templars or ONT ( lit.\u2009'Order of the New Temple') in imitation of the Knights Templar whose monastic rule had been written by the Cistercian Bernard of Clairvaux and whom Lanz believed had aimed to establish \"a Greater Germanic order-state, which would encompass the entire Mediterranean area and extend its sphere of influence deep into the Middle East\" whose eventual suppression had been a triumph of racial inferiority over the \"Ario-Christian\" eugenics practised by the Templars.108 As the headquarters of his revived Templar Order and as a museum of Aryan anthropology, Lanz bought Burg Werfenstein on the Danube, where on Christmas Day 1907, he hoisted his heraldic banner (\"gules\", an eagle's wing \"argent\") and the flag of the ONT: a swastika \"gules\" surrounded by four fleurs-de-lis \"azure\" on a field \"or\".\nPost-Schliemann popularity.\nThe swastika symbol became a popular symbol in the Western world in the early 20th century, and was often used for ornamentation. It symbolised many things to the Europeans, with the most common symbolism being of good luck and auspiciousness.\nThe Benedictine choir school at Lambach Abbey, Upper Austria, which Hitler attended for several months as a boy, had a swastika chiselled into the monastery portal and also the wall above the spring grotto in the courtyard by 1868. Their origin was the personal coat of arms of Theoderich Hagn, abbot of the monastery in Lambach, which bore a golden swastika with slanted points on a blue field.\nThe British author and poet Rudyard Kipling used the symbol on the cover art of a number of his works, including \"The Five Nations\", 1903, which has it twinned with an elephant. Once Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power, Kipling ordered that swastikas should no longer adorn his books. In 1927, a red swastika defaced by a Union Jack was proposed as a flag for the Union of South Africa.\nThe logo of H/f. Eimskipafjelag \u00cdslands was a swastika, called \"Thor's hammer\", from its founding in 1914 until the Second World War when it was discontinued and changed to read only the letters Eimskip.\nThe swastika was also used by the women's paramilitary organisation Lotta Sv\u00e4rd, which was banned in 1944 in accordance with the Moscow Armistice between Finland and the allied Soviet Union and Britain.\nAlso, the insignias of the Cross of Liberty, designed by Gallen-Kallela in 1918, have swastikas. The 3rd class Cross of Liberty is depicted in the upper left corner of the standard of the President of Finland, who is the grand master of the order, too.\nLatvia adopted the swastika, for its Air Force in 1918/1919 and continued its use until the Soviet occupation in 1940. The cross itself was maroon on a white background, mirroring the colours of the Latvian flag. Earlier versions pointed counter-clockwise, while later versions pointed clock-wise and eliminated the white background. Various other Latvian Army units and the Latvian War College (the predecessor of the National Defence Academy) also had adopted the symbol in their battle flags and insignia during the Latvian War of Independence. A stylised fire cross is the base of the Order of L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis, the highest military decoration of Latvia for participants of the War of Independence. The P\u0113rkonkrusts, an ultra-nationalist political organisation active in the 1930s, also used the fire cross as one of its symbols.\nThe swastika symbol (Lithuanian: \"s\u016bkur\u0117lis\") is a traditional Baltic ornament, found on relics dating from at least the 13th century. The \"s\u016bkur\u0117lis\" for Lithuanians represents the history and memory of their Lithuanian ancestors as well as the Baltic people at large. There are monuments in Lithuania such as the Freedom Monument in Roki\u0161kis where swastikas can be found. In Lithuania, the swastika was first used on a flag in 1924 by the Lithuanian Nationalist Union.\nStarting in 1917, Mikal Sylten's staunchly antisemitic periodical, \"Nationalt Tidsskrift\" took up the swastika as a symbol, three years before Adolf Hitler chose to do so.\nThe left-handed swastika was a favourite sign of the last Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. She wore a talisman in the form of a swastika, put it everywhere for happiness, including on her suicide letters from Tobolsk, later drew with a pencil on the wall and in the window opening of the room in the Ipatiev House, which served as the place of the last imprisonment of the royal family and on the wallpaper above the bed.\nThe Russian Provisional Government of 1917 printed a number of new bank notes with right-facing, diagonally rotated swastikas in their centres. The banknote design was initially intended for the Mongolian national bank but was re-purposed for Russian rubles after the February revolution. Swastikas were depicted and on some Soviet credit cards (sovznaks) printed with clich\u00e9s that were in circulation in 1918\u20131922.\nDuring the Russian Civil War, swastikas were present in the symbolism of the uniform of some units of the White Army Asiatic Cavalry Division of Baron Ungern in Siberia and Bogd Khanate of Mongolia, which is explained by the significant number of Buddhists within it. The Red Army's ethnic Kalmyk units wore distinct armbands featuring a swastika with \"\u0420\u0421\u0424\u0421\u0420\" (Roman: \"RSFSR\") inscriptions on them.\nNew religious movements.\nBesides its use as a religious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, which can be traced back to pre-modern traditions, the swastika was also incorporated into a large number of new religious movements which were established in the West in the modern period.\nIn the 1880s, the U.S.-origined Theosophical Society adopted a swastika as part of its seal, along with an Om, a hexagram or star of David, an Ankh, and an Ouroboros. Unlike the much more recent Ra\u00eblian movement, the Theosophical Society symbol has been free from controversy, and the seal is still used. The current seal also includes the text \"There is no religion higher than truth.\"\nThe Ra\u00eblian Movement, whose adherents believe extraterrestrials created all life on earth, use a symbol that is often the source of considerable controversy: an interlaced star of David and a swastika. The Ra\u00eblians say the Star of David represents infinity in space whereas the swastika represents infinity in time\u00a0\u2013 no beginning and no end in time, and everything being cyclic. In 1991, the symbol was changed to remove the swastika, out of respect to the victims of the Holocaust, but as of 2007 it has been restored to its original form.\nThe swastika is a holy symbol in neopagan Germanic Heathenry, along with the hammer of Thor and runes. This tradition\u00a0\u2013 which is found in Scandinavia, Germany, and elsewhere\u00a0\u2013 considers the swastika to be derived from a Norse symbol for the sun. Their use of the symbol has led people to accuse them of being a neo-Nazi group.\nNazism.\nBefore the Nazis, the swastika was already in use as a symbol of German nationalist movements ().\nIn post-World War I Germany, the newly established Nazi Party formally adopted the swastika in 1920. The Nazi Party emblem was a black swastika rotated 45 degrees on a white circle on a red background. This insignia was used on the party's flag, badge, and armband. Adolf Hitler also designed his personal standard using a black swastika sitting flat on one arm, not rotated.\nIn his 1925 work , Hitler writes: \"I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black hooked cross in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the hooked cross.\"\nWhen Hitler created a flag for the Nazi Party, he sought to incorporate both the swastika and \"those revered colours expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honour to the German nation\". (Red, white, and black were the colours of the flag of the old German Empire.) He also stated: \"As National Socialists, we see our program in our flag. In red, we see the social idea of the movement; in white, the nationalistic idea; in the hooked cross, the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work.\"\nThe swastika was also understood as \"the symbol of the creating, effecting life\" () and as \"race emblem of Germanism\" ().\nThe concepts of racial hygiene and scientific racism were central to Nazism. High-ranking Nazi theorist Alfred Rosenberg noted that the Indo-Aryan peoples were both a model to be imitated and a warning of the dangers of the spiritual and racial \"confusion\" that, he believed, arose from the proximity of races. The Nazis co-opted the swastika as a symbol of the Aryan master race.\nOn 14 March 1933, shortly after Hitler's appointment as Chancellor of Germany, the NSDAP flag was hoisted alongside Germany's national colours. As part of the Nuremberg Laws, the NSDAP flag\u00a0\u2013 with the swastika slightly offset from centre\u00a0\u2013 was adopted as the sole national flag of Germany on 15 September 1935.\nAmericas.\nThe swastika has been used in the art and iconography of multiple indigenous peoples of North America, including the Hopi, Navajo, and Tlingit. Swastikas were founds on pottery from the Mississippi valley and on copper objects in the Hopewell Mounds in Ross County, Ohio, and on objects associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (S.E.C.C.). To the Hopi it represents the wandering Hopi clan. The Navajo symbol, called \"tsin n\u00e1\u00e1lwo\u0142\u00ed\" (\"whirling log\"), represents humanity and life, and is used in healing rituals.\nA brightly coloured First Nations saddle featuring swastika designs is on display at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Canada.\nBefore the 1930s, the symbol for the 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army was a red diamond with a yellow swastika, a tribute to the large Native American population in the southwestern United States. It was later replaced with a thunderbird symbol.\nIn the 20th century, traders encouraged Native American artists to use the symbol in their crafts, and it was used by the US Army 45th Infantry Division, an all-Native American division. The symbol lost popularity in the 1930s due to its associations with Nazi Germany. In 1940, partially due to government encouragement, community leaders from several different Native American tribes made a statement promising to no longer use the symbol. However, the symbol has continued to be used by Native American groups, both in reference to the original symbol and as a memorial to the 45th Division, despite external objections to its use. The symbol was used on state road signs in Arizona from the 1920s until the 1940s.\nThe town of Swastika, Ontario, and the hamlet of Swastika, New York were named after the symbol.\nFrom 1909 to 1916, the K-R-I-T automobile, manufactured in Detroit, Michigan, used a right-facing swastika as their trademark.\nThe flag of the Guna people (also \"Kuna Yala\" or \"Guna Yala\") of Panama. This flag, adopted in 1925, has a swastika symbol that they call \"Naa Ukuryaa\". According to one explanation, this ancestral symbol symbolises the octopus that created the world, its tentacles pointing to the four cardinal points.\nIn 1942, a ring was added to the centre of the flag to differentiate it from the symbol of the Nazi Party (this version subsequently fell into disuse).\nAfrica.\nSwastikas can be seen in various African cultures. In Ethiopia a swastika is carved in the window of the famous 12th-century Biete Maryam, one of the Rock-Hewn Churches, Lalibela. In Ghana, the adinkra symbol \"nkontim\", used by the Akan people to represent loyalty, takes the form of a swastika. \"Nkontim\" symbols could be found on Ashanti gold weights and clothing.\nModern adoptions.\nA \"ugunskrusts\" ('fire cross') is used by the Baltic neopagan religions Dievtur\u012bba in Latvia and Romuva in Lithuania. \nIn the early 1990s, the former dissident and one of the founders of Russian neo-paganism Alexey Dobrovolsky first gave the name \"kolovrat\" (, literally 'spinning wheel') to a four-beam swastika, identical to the Nazi symbol, and later transferred this name to an eight-beam rectangular swastika. The eight-beam swastika dates back all the way to Ancient Greece with some ceramics containing the eight-beamed symbol. A necklace found in Ukraine via metal detection is estimated to date back to the 11th century and also contained the kolovrat symbol, providing some solid evidence of its presence among the Slavic people at the time. A six-beamed variant is located in the tower of the Vang Church in Karpacz, Poland. According to the historian and religious scholar Roman Shizhensky, Dobrovolsky took the idea of the swastika from the work \"The Chronicle of Oera Linda\" by the Nazi ideologist Herman Wirth, the first head of the Ahnenerbe.\nDobrovolsky introduced the eight-beam \"kolovrat\" as a symbol of \"resurgent paganism.\" He considered this version of the Kolovrat a pagan sign of the sun and, in 1996, declared it a symbol of the uncompromising \"national liberation struggle\" against the \"Zhyd yoke\". According to Dobrovolsky, the meaning of the \"kolovrat\" completely coincides with the meaning of the Nazi swastika.\nThe \"kolovrat\" is the most commonly used religious symbol within neopagan Slavic Native Faith (a.k.a. Rodnovery).\nIn 2005, authorities in Tajikistan called for the widespread adoption of the swastika as a national symbol. President Emomali Rahmonov declared the swastika an Aryan symbol, and 2006 \"the year of Aryan culture\", which would be a time to \"study and popularise Aryan contributions to the history of the world civilisation, raise a new generation (of Tajiks) with the spirit of national self-determination, and develop deeper ties with other ethnicities and cultures\".\nModern controversy.\nBecause of its use by Nazi Germany, the swastika since the 1930s has been largely associated with Nazism. In the aftermath of World War II, it has been considered a symbol of hate in the West, and of white supremacy in many Western countries.\nAs a result, all use of it, or its use as a Nazi or hate symbol, is prohibited in some countries, including Germany. In some countries, such as the United States (in the 2003 case \"Virginia v. Black\"), the highest courts have ruled that the local governments can prohibit the use of swastika along with other symbols such as cross burning, if the intent of the use is to intimidate others.\nGermany.\nThe German and Austrian post-war criminal code makes the public showing of the swastika, the sig rune, the Celtic cross (specifically the variations used by white power activists), the , the Odal SS-rune and the skull illegal, except for certain enumerated exemptions. It is also censored from the reprints of 1930s railway timetables published by the . The swastikas on Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples are exempt, as religious symbols cannot be banned in Germany.\nA controversy was stirred by the decision of several police departments to begin inquiries against anti-fascists. In late 2005 police raided the offices of the punk rock label and mail order store \"Nix Gut Records\" and confiscated merchandise depicting crossed-out swastikas and fists smashing swastikas. In 2006 the Stade police department started an inquiry against anti-fascist youths using a placard depicting a person dumping a swastika into a trashcan. The placard was displayed in opposition to the campaign of right-wing nationalist parties for local elections.\nOn Friday, 17 March 2006, a member of the , Claudia Roth reported herself to the German police for displaying a crossed-out swastika in multiple demonstrations against neo-Nazis, and subsequently got the Bundestag to suspend her immunity from prosecution. She intended to show the absurdity of charging anti-fascists with using fascist symbols: \"We don't need prosecution of non-violent young people engaging against right-wing extremism.\" On 15 March 2007, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany () held that the crossed-out symbols were \"clearly directed against a revival of national-socialist endeavours\", thereby settling the dispute for the future.\nOn 9 August 2018, Germany lifted the ban on the usage of swastikas and other Nazi symbols in video games. \"Through the change in the interpretation of the law, games that critically look at current affairs can for the first time be given a USK age rating,\" USK managing director Elisabeth Secker told CTV. \"This has long been the case for films and with regards to the freedom of the arts, this is now rightly also the case with computer and videogames.\"\nLegislation in other European countries.\nThe European Union's Executive Commission proposed a European Union-wide anti-racism law in 2001, but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. An attempt to ban the swastika across the EU in early 2005 failed after objections from the British Government and others. In early 2007, while Germany held the European Union presidency, Berlin proposed that the European Union should follow German Criminal Law and criminalise the denial of the Holocaust and the display of Nazi symbols including the swastika, which is based on the Ban on the Symbols of Unconstitutional Organisations Act. This led to an opposition campaign by Hindu groups across Europe against a ban on the swastika. They pointed out that the swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace. The proposal to ban the swastika was dropped by Berlin from the proposed European Union wide anti-racism laws on 29 January 2007.\nOutside Europe.\nThe manufacture, distribution or broadcasting of a swastika, with the intent to propagate Nazism, is a crime in Brazil as dictated by article 20, paragraph 1, of federal statute 7.716, passed in 1989. The penalty is a two to five years prison term and a fine.\nThe public display of Nazi-era German flags (or any other flags) is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech. The Nazi \"Reichskriegsflagge\" has also been seen on display at white supremacist events within United States borders, side by side with the Confederate battle flag.\nIn 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) downgraded the swastika from its status as a Jewish hate symbol, saying \"We know that the swastika has, for some, lost its meaning as the primary symbol of Nazism and instead become a more generalised symbol of hate.\" The ADL notes on their website that the symbol is often used as \"shock graffiti\" by juveniles, rather than by individuals who hold white supremacist beliefs, but it is still a predominant symbol among American white supremacists (particularly as a tattoo design) and used with antisemitic intention.\nIn 2022, Victoria was the first Australian state to ban the display of the Nazi's swastika. People who intentionally break this law will face a one-year jail sentence, a fine of 120 penalty units ($23,077.20 AUD as of 2023, equivalent to \u00a312,076.66 or US$15,385.57), or both.\nMedia.\nIn 2010, Microsoft officially spoke out against use of the swastika by players of the first-person shooter \"\". In \"Black Ops\", players are allowed to customise their name tags to represent whatever they want. The swastika can be created and used, but Stephen Toulouse, director of Xbox Live policy and enforcement, said players with the symbol on their name tag will be banned (if someone reports it as inappropriate) from Xbox Live.\nIn the \"Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular\" at Disney Hollywood Studios in Florida, the swastikas on German trucks, aircraft and actor uniforms in the re-enactment of a scene from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" were removed in 2004.\nUse by neo-Nazis.\nAs with many neo-Nazi groups across the world, the American Nazi Party used the swastika as part of its flag before its first dissolution in 1967. The symbol was chosen by the organisation's founder, George Lincoln Rockwell. It was \"re-used\" by successor organisations in 1983, without the publicity Rockwell's organisation enjoyed.\nThe swastika, in various iconographic forms, is one of the hate symbols identified in use as graffiti in US schools, and is described as such in a 1999 US Department of Education document, \"Responding to Hate at School: A Guide for Teachers, Counsellors and Administrators\", edited by Jim Carnes, which provides advice to educators on how to support students targeted by such hate symbols and address hate graffiti. Examples given show that it is often used alongside other white supremacist symbols, such as those of the Ku Klux Klan, and note a \"three-bladed\" variation used by skinheads, white supremacists, and \"some South African extremist groups\".\nThe neo-Nazi Russian National Unity group's branch in Estonia is officially registered under the name \"Kolovrat\" and published an extremist newspaper in 2001 under the same name. A criminal investigation found the paper included an array of racial epithets. One Narva resident was sentenced to one year in jail for distribution of \"Kolovrat\". The Kolovrat has since been used by the Rusich Battalion, a Russian militant group known for its operation during the war in Donbas. In 2014 and 2015, members of the Ukrainian Azov Regiment were seen with swastika tattoos.\nWestern misinterpretation of Asian use.\nSince the end of the 20th century, and through the early 21st century, confusion and controversy has occurred when personal-use goods bearing the traditional Jain, Buddhist, or Hindu symbols have been exported to the West, notably to North America and Europe, and have been interpreted by purchasers as bearing a Nazi symbol. This has resulted in several such products having been boycotted or pulled from shelves.\nWhen a ten-year-old boy in Lynbrook, New York, bought a set of Pok\u00e9mon cards imported from Japan in 1999, two of the cards contained the left-facing Buddhist swastika. The boy's parents misinterpreted the symbol as the right-facing Nazi swastika and filed a complaint to the manufacturer. Nintendo of America announced that the cards would be discontinued, explaining that what was acceptable in one culture was not necessarily so in another; their action was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who recognised that there was no intention to offend, but said that international commerce meant that \"Isolating [the swastika] in Asia would just create more problems.\"\nIn 2002, Christmas crackers containing plastic toy red pandas sporting swastikas were pulled from shelves after complaints from customers in Canada. The manufacturer, based in China, said the symbol was presented in a traditional sense and not as a reference to the Nazis, and apologised to the customers for the cross-cultural mix-up.\nIn 2020, the retailer Shein pulled a necklace featuring a left-facing swastika pendant from its website after receiving backlash on social media. The retailer apologized for the lack of sensitivity but noted that the swastika was a Buddhist symbol.\nSwastika as distinct from \"Hakenkreuz\" debate.\nBeginning in the early 2000s, partially as a reaction to the publication of a book titled \"The Swastika: Symbol Beyond Redemption?\" by Steven Heller, there has been a movement by Hindus, Buddhists, and Native Americans to \"reclaim\" the swastika as a sacred symbol. These groups argue that the swastika is distinct from the Nazi symbol. However, Hitler said that the Nazi symbol was the same as the Oriental symbol. On 13 August 1920, speaking to his followers in the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus am Platzl of Munich, Hitler said of the Nazi symbol: \"You will find this cross as a swastika as far as India and Japan, carved in the temple pillars. It is the swastika, which was once a sign of established communities of Aryan Culture.\"\nThe main barrier to the effort to \"reclaim\", \"restore\", or \"reassess\" the swastika comes from the decades of extremely negative association in the Western world following the Nazi Party's adoption of it in the 1920s. As well, white supremacist groups still cling to the symbol as an icon of power and identity.\nMany media organizations in the West also continue to describe neo-Nazi usage of the symbol as a swastika, or sometimes with the \"Nazi\" adjective written as \"Nazi Swastika\". Groups that oppose this media terminology do not wish to censor such usage, but rather to shift coverage of antisemitic and hateful events to describe the symbol in this context as a or 'hooked cross'.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It covered the southern portion of the current Province of Quebec and the Labrador region of the current Province of Newfoundland and Labrador (until the Labrador region was transferred to Newfoundland in 1809).\nLower Canada consisted of part of the former colony of Canada of New France, conquered by Great Britain in the Seven Years' War ending in 1763 (also called the French and Indian War in the United States). Other parts of New France conquered by Britain became the Colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.\nThe Province of Lower Canada was created by the \"Constitutional Act 1791\" from the partition of the British colony of the Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791) into the Province of Lower Canada and the Province of Upper Canada. The prefix \"lower\" in its name refers to its geographic position farther downriver from the headwaters of the St. Lawrence River than its contemporary Upper Canada, present-day southern Ontario.\nLower Canada was abolished in 1841 when it and adjacent Upper Canada were united into the Province of Canada.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nBefore Lower Canada, there was the Province of Quebec. The Province of Quebec was established from conquered French lands from the French and Indian War. The Quebec Act officially set up governance in those lands and incorporated French elements into the province's government. The Province of Quebec was split in 1791 by the Constitutional Act 1791 into Lower Canada and Upper Canada. The Constitutional Act placed English Law in Upper Canada, and French Law and institutions in Lower Canada. Catholics were also granted the ability to freely practise. \nTransition into the British Empire.\nSociety in New France was deeply dependent on nobles, clergy, and the military. After the British conquest, British aristocrats and military personnel replaced their French equivalents. A conflict arose between the British aristocrats and the French-Canadian middle class, which was worsened by the introduction of parliamentarianism. By the end of the 18th century, the nobility's power was totally dependent on the colonial government. These problems came to a head when the British merchants wanted to build canals on the St. Lawrence River to help with navigation across the river. The French nationalists held a majority in the legislative assembly and refused to allow the construction. This led to feelings of vulnerability in Lower Canada amongst British aristocracy.\nAnglophone aristocrats, often sought the support of the governor, colonial bureaucrats or the government in London, mostly because they could never form a majority in the legislative assembly. Their political defeats led them to defend their colonial ties to Britain and support conservative ideas. At the turn of the century the Anglophones began to control more and more the economic activity in Lower Canada, which lead to the French-Canadians viewing them as a threat.\nPolitical Tensions.\nThe tensions between Anglophone aristocrats and the French-Canadian middle class culminated in the formation of the Parti canadien, the first Canadian political party. The party advocated for the independence of the legislature from the Lieutenant-Governor and fought plans to unify Upper Canada and Lower Canada.\nIn 1810, the Governor James Henry Craig had editors of the Parti canadien's newspaper arrested to suppress them before dissolving the legislature. Louis-Joseph Papineau, leader of the party, decided then to focus on more limited results and to stray away from being views as an extremist party. He gained the support of Irish Catholics in Lower Canada which also gave him the support of the clergy.\nIn 1827, after pressure from militant groups, Papineau became more radical and began to turn towards the idea of independence. Taking from the ideas of the American government, all positions that held power then became elected positions. This nationalism gave the Parti canadien support amongst French-Canadians but almost completely lost them the support of Anglophones in Lower Canada.\nThe clergy in Lower Canada were also very unhappy with the political situation at the time and wanted their old privileges restored. They wanted the ability to educate in Lower Canada and were briefly granted that ability in 1824, with the passage of Parish Schools Act. In 1829, the Parti canadien established assembly schools, which removed the Catholic Church from education, creating another political divide. \nRebellion.\nThe three divides in Lower Canada ultimately reached a breaking point. To combat this the British government adopted the Russell Resolutions, which rejected the 92 Resolutions created by the Parti canadien. After the Patriote Rebellion in the Rebellions of 1837\u20131838 was suppressed by government troops and Loyal volunteers, the 1791 Constitution was suspended on 27 March 1838 and a special council was appointed to administer the colony. An abortive attempt by revolutionary Robert Nelson to declare a Republic of Lower Canada was quickly thwarted.\nThe provinces of Lower Canada and Upper Canada were combined as the United Province of Canada in 1841, when the \"Act of Union 1840\" came into force. Their separate legislatures were combined into a single parliament with equal representation for both constituent parts, even though Lower Canada had a greater population.\nConstitution.\nThe Province of Lower Canada inherited the mixed set of French and English institutions that existed in the Province of Quebec during the 1763\u20131791 period and which continued to exist later in Canada-East (1841\u20131867) and ultimately in the current Province of Quebec (since 1867). \nPopulation.\nLower Canada was populated mainly by Canadiens, an ethnic group who trace their ancestry to French colonists who settled in Canada from the 17th century onward.\nTransportation.\nTravelling around Lower Canada was mainly by water along the St. Lawrence River. On land, the only long-distance route was the Chemin du Roy, or King's Highway; it was built in the 1730s by New France. The King's Highway was, in addition to the mail route, the primary means of long-distance passenger travel until steamboats (1815) and railways (1850s) began to challenge the royal road. The royal road's importance waned after the 1850s and would not re-emerge as a key means of transportation until the highway system of Quebec was created in the 20th century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its waters flow in a northeasterly direction from Lake Ontario to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, traversing Ontario and Quebec in Canada and New York in the United States. A section of the river demarcates the Canada\u2013U.S. border.\nAs the primary drainage outflow of the Great Lakes Basin, the St. Lawrence has the second-highest discharge of any river in North America (after the Mississippi River) and the 16th-highest in the world. The estuary of the St. Lawrence is often cited by scientists as the largest in the world. Significant natural landmarks of the river and estuary include the 1,864 river islands of the Thousand Islands, the endangered whales of Saguenay\u2013St. Lawrence Marine Park, and the limestone monoliths of the Mingan Archipelago.\nLong a transportation route to Indigenous peoples, the St. Lawrence River has played a key role in the history of Canada and in the development of cities such as Montreal and Quebec City. The river remains an important shipping route as the backbone of the St. Lawrence Seaway, a lock and canal system that enables world marine traffic to access the inland ports of the Great Lakes Waterway.\nEtymology.\nThe river has historically been given a variety of different names by local First Nations. Beginning in the 16th century, French explorers visited what is now Canada and gave the river names such as the \"Grand fleuve de Hochelaga\" and the \"Grande rivi\u00e8re du Canada\", where \"fleuve\" and \"rivi\u00e8re\" are two French words (\"fleuve\" being a river that flows into the sea).\nThe river's present name has been used since 1604 when it was recorded on a map by Samuel de Champlain. Champlain opted for the names \"Grande riviere de sainct Laurens\" and \"Fleuve sainct Laurens\" in his writings, supplanting the earlier names. In contemporary French, the name is rendered as the \"fleuve Saint-Laurent\". The name \"Saint-Laurent\" (Saint Lawrence) was originally applied to the eponymous bay by Jacques Cartier upon his arrival into the region on the 10th of August feast day for Saint Lawrence in 1535.\nIndigenous people use the following names:\nGeography.\nMarine weather.\nIn winter, the St. Lawrence River begins producing ice in December between Montreal and Quebec City. The prevailing winds and currents push this ice towards the estuary, and it reaches the east of Les M\u00e9chins at the end of December. Ice covers the entire Gulf of St. Lawrence in January and February.\nIce helps navigation by preventing the formation of waves, and therefore spray, and prevents the icing of ships.\nWatershed.\nWith the draining of the Champlain Sea, due to a rebounding continent from the Last Glacial Maximum, the St. Lawrence River was formed. The Champlain Sea lasted from about 13,000 years ago to about 10,000 years ago and was continuously shrinking during that time, a process that continues today. The head of the St. Lawrence River, near Lake Ontario, is home to the Thousand Islands.\nToday, the St. Lawrence River begins at the outflow of Lake Ontario and flows adjacent to Cape Vincent, Gananoque, Clayton, Alexandria Bay, Brockville, Morristown, Ogdensburg, Massena, Cornwall, Montreal, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, and Quebec City before draining into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, often given as the largest estuary in the world. The estuary begins at the eastern tip of \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans, just downstream from Quebec City. The river becomes tidal around Quebec City.\nThe St. Lawrence River runs from the farthest headwater to the mouth and from the outflow of Lake Ontario. These numbers include the estuary; without the estuary, the length from Lake Ontario is c. 500\u00a0km (c. 300\u00a0mi). The farthest headwater is the North River in the Mesabi Range at Hibbing, Minnesota. Its drainage area, which includes the Great Lakes, the world's largest system of freshwater lakes, is , of which is in Canada and is in the United States. The basin covers parts of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and nearly the entirety of the state of Michigan in the United States. The average discharge below the Saguenay River is . At Quebec City, it is . The average discharge at the river's source, the outflow of Lake Ontario, is .\nThe St. Lawrence River includes Lake Saint Francis at Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Lake Saint-Louis south of Montreal and Lake Saint Pierre east of Montreal. It encompasses four archipelagoes: the Thousand Islands chain near Alexandria Bay, New York and Kingston, Ontario; the Hochelaga Archipelago, including the Island of Montreal and \u00cele J\u00e9sus (Laval); the Lake St.\u00a0Pierre Archipelago (classified a biosphere world reserve by the UNESCO in 2000) and the smaller Mingan Archipelago. Other islands include \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans near Quebec City and Anticosti Island north of the Gasp\u00e9. It is the second longest river in Canada.\nLake Champlain and the Ottawa, Richelieu, Saint-Maurice, Saint-Fran\u00e7ois, Chaudi\u00e8re and Saguenay rivers drain into the St. Lawrence.\nThe St. Lawrence River is in a seismically active zone where fault reactivation is believed to occur along late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic normal faults related to the opening of the Iapetus Ocean. The faults in the area are rift-related and comprise the Saint Lawrence rift system.\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, the St. Lawrence Valley is a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian division, containing the Champlain section. However, in Canada, where most of the valley is, it is instead considered part of a distinct St. Lawrence Lowlands physiographic division, and not part of the Appalachian division.\nSources.\nThe source of the North River in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota (Seven Beaver Lake) is considered to be the source of the St. Lawrence River. Because it crosses so many lakes, the water system frequently changes its name. From source to mouth, the names are:\nThe St. Lawrence River also passes through Lake Saint-Louis and Lake Saint-Pierre in Quebec.\nTributaries.\nThe St. Lawrence River and the largest tributaries of the Great Lakes.\nThe St. Lawrence River tributaries are listed upstream from the mouth. The major tributaries of the inter-lake sections are also shown, as well as the major rivers that flow into the Great Lakes. Great Lakes tributaries are listed in alphabetical order.\nThe list includes all tributaries with a drainage area of at least 1,000 square kilometres and an average flow of more than 10 cubic metres per second.\nBiodiversity.\nThe diversity of the St. Lawrence River includes:\nMarine mammals.\nLarge marine mammals travel in all the seas of the earth, the research and observations of these giants concern fishermen and shipping industry, exercise a fascination and a keen interest for laymen and, subjects of endless studies for scientists from Quebec, Canada and around the world.\nThirteen species of cetaceans frequent the waters of the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence:\nHistory.\nFirst Nations.\nFlowing through and adjacent to numerous Indigenous homelands, the river was a primary thoroughfare for many peoples. Beginning in Dawnland at the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the river borders Mi'kma'ki in the South (what is today known as the Canadian Maritimes), and Nitassinan in the North, the national territory of the Innu people. On the south shore beyond the Mi'kmaw district of Gespe'gewa'ki, the river passes Wolastokuk (the Maliseet homeland), P\u03b1naw\u03b1hpskewahki (the Penobscot homeland), and Ndakinna (the Abenaki homeland). Continuing, the river passes through the former country of the St. Lawrence Iroquois and then three of the six homelands of the Haudenosaunee: the Mohawk or Kanien\u02bckeh\u00e1\ua789ka, the Oneida or Onyota'a:ka, and the Onondaga or On\u00f6\u00f1da\u2019gaga\u2019.\nIn the early 17th century, the Wendat Nation migrated from their original country of Huronia to what is now known as centred around Wendake. Nionwents\u00efo occupies both the north and south shores of the river, overlapping with Nitassinan and the more western Wabanaki or Dawnland countries. Adjacent on the north shore is the Atikamekw territorial homeland of Nitaskinan and, upstream, the further reaches of Anishinaabewaki, specifically the homelands of the Algonquin and Mississauga Nations.\nEuropean exploration.\nThe Norse explored the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the 11th century and were followed by fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century European mariners, such as John Cabot, and the brothers Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real. The first European explorer known to have sailed up the St. Lawrence River itself was Jacques Cartier. At that time, the land along the river described as \"about two leagues, a mountain as tall as a heap of wheat\" was inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians. During Cartier's second voyage in 1535, because Cartier arrived in the estuary on Saint Lawrence's feast day 10 August, he named it the \"Gulf of Saint Lawrence\".\nThe St. Lawrence River is today partly within the U.S. and as such is that country's sixth oldest surviving European place-name.\nEarly colonists.\nThe earliest regular Europeans in the area were the Basques, who came to the St Lawrence Gulf and River in pursuit of whales from the early 16th century. The Basque whalers and fishermen traded with indigenous Americans and set up settlements, leaving vestiges all over the coast of eastern Canada and deep into the St. Lawrence River. Basque commercial and fishing activity reached its peak before the \"Armada Invencible\"'s disaster (1588), when the Basque whaling fleet was confiscated by King Philip II of Spain. Initially, the whaling galleons from Labourd were not affected by the Spanish defeat.\nUntil the early 17th century, the French used the name \"Rivi\u00e8re du Canada\" to designate the St. Lawrence upstream to Montreal and the Ottawa River after Montreal. The St. Lawrence River served as the main route for European exploration of the North American interior, first pioneered by French explorer Samuel de Champlain.\nColonial control.\nControl of the river was crucial to British strategy to capture New France in the Seven Years' War. Having captured Louisbourg in 1758, the British sailed up to Quebec the following year thanks to charts drawn up by James Cook. British troops were ferried via the St. Lawrence to attack the city from the west, which they successfully did at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The river was used again by the British to defeat the French siege of Quebec under the Chevalier de L\u00e9vis in 1760.\nIn 1809, the first steamboat to ply its trade on the St. Lawrence was built and operated by John Molson and associates, a scant two years after Fulton's steam-powered navigation of the Hudson River. The \"Accommodation\" with ten passengers made her maiden voyage from Montreal to Quebec City in 66 hours, for 30 of which she was at anchor. She had a keel of 75 feet, and a length overall of 85 feet. The cost of a ticket was eight dollars upstream, and nine dollars down. She had berths that year for twenty passengers.\nWithin a decade, daily service was available in the hotly-contested Montreal-Quebec route.\nBecause of the virtually impassable Lachine Rapids, the St. Lawrence was once continuously navigable only as far as Montreal. Opened in 1825, the Lachine Canal was the first to allow ships to pass the rapids. An extensive system of canals and locks, known as the St. Lawrence Seaway, was officially opened on 26 June 1959 by Elizabeth II (representing Canada) and President Dwight D. Eisenhower (representing the United States). The Seaway (including the Welland Canal) now permits ocean-going vessels to pass all the way to Lake Superior.\nModern Canada.\nAlcoa, Reynolds Metals Company, and General Motors (GM) Central Foundry operated along the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries for decades. The Alcoa plant opened in 1903, and Reynolds and GM began operations in the late 1950s. These facilities released toxic substances into the St. Lawrence River and the surrounding area, including PCBs, PAHs, cyanide, fluoride, and dioxins.\nDuring the Second World War, the Battle of the St. Lawrence involved submarine and anti-submarine actions throughout the lower St. Lawrence River and the entire Gulf of St. Lawrence, Strait of Belle Isle and Cabot Strait from May to October 1942, September 1943, and again in October and November 1944. During this time, German U-boats sank several merchant marine ships and three Canadian warships.\nIn the late 1970s, the river was the subject of a successful ecological campaign (called \"Save the River\"), originally responding to planned development by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The campaign was organized, among others, by Abbie Hoffman.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pure minimal deterrence is a doctrine of no first use, holding that the only mission of nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear adversary by making the cost of a first strike unacceptably high. To present a credible deterrent, there must be the assurance that any attack would trigger a retaliatory strike. In other words, minimal deterrence requires rejecting a counterforce strategy in favor of pursuing survivable force that can be used in a countervalue second strike.\nWhile the United States and the Soviet Union each developed robust first- and second-strike capabilities during the Cold War, the People's Republic of China pursued a doctrine of minimal nuclear deterrence. Assuming that decision-makers make cost-benefit analyses when deciding to use force, China's doctrine calls for acquiring a nuclear arsenal only large enough to destroy an adversary's \"strategic points\" in such a way that the expected costs of a first strike outweigh the anticipated benefits. India has also adopted this strategy, which they term Minimum Credible Deterrence.\nThe \"minimum credible deterrence\" (also known as N-deterrence) policy of Pakistan is a defence and strategic principle on which the country's nuclear weapons program is based. This doctrine is not a part of the nuclear doctrine, which is designed for the use of the atomic weapons in a full-scale declared war if the conditions of the doctrine are surpassed. Instead, the policy of the Minimum Credible Deterrence falls under minimal deterrence as an inverse to the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), which is widely regarded as designed to dissuade India from taking any military actions against Pakistan, as it did during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.\nMinimal deterrence represents one way of solving the security dilemma and avoiding an arms race. Decision-makers often feel pressured to expand their arsenals when they perceive them to be vulnerable to an adversary's first strike, especially when both sides seek to achieve the advantage. Eliminating this perceived vulnerability reduces the incentive to produce more and advanced weapons. For example, the United States\u2019 nuclear force exceeds the requirements of minimal deterrence, and is structured to strike numerous targets in multiple countries and to have the ability to conduct successful counterforce strikes with high confidence. In response to this, China continues to modernize its nuclear forces because its leaders are concerned about the survivability of their arsenal in the face of the United States\u2019 advances in strategic reconnaissance, precision strike, and missile defense.\nOne disadvantage of minimal deterrence is that it requires an accurate understanding of the level of damage an adversary finds unacceptable, especially if that understanding changes over time so that a previously credible deterrent is no longer credible. A minimal deterrence strategy must also account for the nuclear firepower that would be \"lost\" or \"neutralized\" during an adversary's counterforce strike. Additionally, a minimal deterrence capability may embolden a state when it confronts a superior nuclear power, as has been observed in the relationship between China and the United States. Finally, while pursuing minimal deterrence during arms negotiations allows states to make reductions without becoming vulnerable, further reductions may be undesirable once minimal deterrence is reached because they will increase a state's vulnerability and provide an incentive for an adversary to secretly expand its nuclear arsenal.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This symptom is also referred to as association chaining, and sometimes, glossomania.\nLucas C. Steuber defines it as \"repeating chains of words that are associated semantically or phonetically[,] with no relevant context\". This may include compulsive rhyming or alliteration without apparent logical connection between words.\nClanging refers specifically to behavior that is situationally inappropriate. While a poet rhyming is not evidence of mental illness, disorganized speech that impedes the patient's ability to communicate is a disorder in itself, often seen in schizophrenia.\nExample.\nThis can be seen by a section of a 1974 transcript of a patient with schizophrenia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are all felines. Siamese cat balls. They stand out. I had a cat, a manx, still around here somewhere. You'll know him when you see him. His name is GI Joe; he's black and white. I have a goldfish too, like a clown. Happy Halloween down. Down.\nThe speaker makes semantic chain associations on the topic of cats, to the colour of her cat, which (either the topic of colours/patterns, or the topic of pets) leads her to jump from her goldfish to the associated \"clown\", a point she reaches via the word \"clownfish\". The patient also exhibits a pattern of rhyming and associative clanging: \"clown\" to \"Halloween\" (presumably an associative clang) to \"down\".\nThis example highlights how the speaker was distracted by the sound or meaning of her own words, and led herself off the topic, sentence by sentence. In essence, it is a form of derailment driven by self-monitoring.\nAs a type of formal thought disorder.\nFormal thought disorders (FTD) are a syndrome with several symptoms, leading to thought, language and communication problems, being a core feature in schizophrenia.\nThought disorders are measured using the Thought, Language and Communication Scale (TLC) developed by Andreasen in 1986. This measures tendencies of 18 subtypes of formal thought disorder (with strong inter-coder reliability) including clanging as a type of FTD.\nThe TLC scale for FTD sub-types remains the standard and most inclusive \u2013 so clanging is officially recognised as a type of FTD.\nThere has been much debate about whether FTDs are a symptom of thought or language, yet the basis for FTD analysis is the verbal behaviour of the patients. As a result, whether abnormal speech among individuals with schizophrenia is a result of abnormal neurology, abnormal thought or linguistic processes \u2013 researchers agree that people with schizophrenia do have abnormal language.\nOccurrences in mental disorders.\nClanging is associated with the irregular thinking apparent in psychotic mental illnesses (e.g. mania and schizophrenia).\nIn schizophrenia.\nFormal Thought Disorders are one of five characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV-TR. FTD symptoms such as Glossomania are correlated to schizophrenia spectrum disorders and to a family history of schizophrenia. In an analysis of speech in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls, Steuber found that glossomania (association chaining) is a characteristic of speech in schizophrenic patients - despite no significant difference between normal controls and individuals with schizophrenia.\nIn mania/bipolar disorder.\nGustav Aschaffenburg found that manic individuals generated these \"clang-associations\" roughly 10\u201350 times more than non-manic individuals. Aschaffenburg also found that the frequency of these associations increased for all individuals as they became more fatigued.\nAndreasen found that when comparing Formal Thought Disorder symptoms between people with schizophrenia and people with Mania, that there was greater reported incidence of clang associations of people with mania.\nIn depression.\nResearch investigated by Steuber found no significant difference of glossomania occurrences for patients with schizophrenia compared to patients with depression.\nDisagreements in the literature.\nBeing a niche area of symptoms of mental disorders, there have been disagreements in the definitions of clanging, and how it may nor may not fall under the subset of Formal Thought Disorder symptoms in schizophrenia. Steuber argues that although it is a FTD, that it should come under the umbrella of the subtype 'distractibility'.\nMoreover, due to limited research there have been discrepancies in the definition of clanging used: an alternative definition for clanging is: \"word selection based on phonemic relatedness, rather than semantic meaning; frequently manifest as rhyming\". Here it is evident that the semantic association chains are not included as part of the definition seen at the start \u2013 even though it is the more widely used definition of clanging and glossomania (where the terms are used interchangeably).\nBiological factors.\nUnderstanding of such language impairments and FTDs take a biological approach.\nCandidate genes for such vulnerability of schizophrenia are the FOXP2 (which is linked to a familial language disorder and autism) and dysbindin 1 genes43,44. This distal explanation not only does not explain clanging specifically, but also fails to include other environmental influences on the development of schizophrenia. Moreover, if a person does develop schizophrenia, it does not guarantee they have the symptom of clanging.\nSass and Pienkos 2013 suggest that a more nuanced understanding of structural (neural changes) patterns that occur in a sufferer's brain could be important in understanding the disorder. However, more research is required into not only understanding the causes of such symptoms, but how it works.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is based on the theory of rational deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.\nThe result may be a nuclear peace, in which the presence of nuclear weapons decreases the risk of crisis escalation, since parties will seek to avoid situations that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. Proponents of nuclear peace theory therefore believe that controlled nuclear proliferation may be beneficial for global stability. Critics argue that nuclear proliferation increases the chance of nuclear war through either deliberate or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons, as well as the likelihood of nuclear material falling into the hands of violent non-state actors.\nThe term \"mutual assured destruction\", commonly abbreviated \"MAD\", was coined by Donald Brennan, a strategist working in Herman Kahn's Hudson Institute in 1962. Brennan conceived the acronym cynically, spelling out the English word \"mad\" to argue that holding weapons capable of destroying society was irrational.\nTheory.\nUnder MAD, each side has enough nuclear weaponry to destroy the other side. Either side, if attacked for any reason by the other, would retaliate with equal or greater force. The expected result is an immediate, irreversible escalation of hostilities resulting in both combatants' mutual, total, and assured destruction. The doctrine requires that neither side construct shelters on a massive scale. If one side constructed a similar system of shelters, it would violate the MAD doctrine and destabilize the situation, because it would have less to fear from a second strike. The same principle is invoked against missile defense.\nThe doctrine further assumes that neither side will dare to launch a first strike because the other side would launch on warning (also called fail-deadly) or with surviving forces (a second strike), resulting in unacceptable losses for both parties. The payoff of the MAD doctrine was and still is expected to be a tense but stable global peace. However, many have argued that mutually assured destruction is unable to deter conventional war that could later escalate. Emerging domains of cyber-espionage, proxy-state conflict, and high-speed missiles threaten to circumvent MAD as a deterrent strategy.\nThe primary application of this doctrine started during the Cold War (1940s to 1991), in which MAD was seen as helping to prevent any direct full-scale conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union while they engaged in smaller proxy wars around the world. MAD was also responsible for the arms race, as both nations struggled to keep nuclear parity, or at least retain second-strike capability. Although the Cold War ended in the early 1990s, the MAD doctrine continues to be applied.\nProponents of MAD as part of the US and USSR strategic doctrine believed that nuclear war could best be prevented if neither side could expect to survive a full-scale nuclear exchange as a functioning state. Since the credibility of the threat is critical to such assurance, each side had to invest substantial capital in their nuclear arsenals even if they were not intended for use. In addition, neither side could be expected or allowed to adequately defend itself against the other's nuclear missiles. This led both to the hardening and diversification of nuclear delivery systems (such as nuclear missile silos, ballistic missile submarines, and nuclear bombers kept at fail-safe points) and to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\nThis MAD scenario is often referred to as rational nuclear deterrence.\nWhen the possibility of nuclear warfare between the United States and Soviet Union started to become a reality, theorists began to think that mutual assured destruction would be sufficient to deter the other side from launching a nuclear weapon. Kenneth Waltz, an American political scientist, believed that nuclear forces were in fact useful, but even more useful in the fact that they deterred other nuclear threats from using them, based on mutually assured destruction. The theory of mutually assured destruction being a safe way to deter continued even farther with the thought that nuclear weapons intended on being used for the winning of a war, were impractical, and even considered too dangerous and risky. Even with the Cold War ending in 1991, deterrence from mutually assured destruction is still said to be the safest course to avoid nuclear warfare.\nEffectiveness of the theory according to empirical studies.\nA study published in the \"Journal of Conflict Resolution\" in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis and found support for the existence of the stability-instability paradox. The study determined that nuclear weapons promote strategic stability and prevent large-scale wars but simultaneously allow for more low intensity conflicts. If a nuclear monopoly exists between two states, and one state has nuclear weapons and its opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, if there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.\nHistory.\nPre-1945.\nThe concept of MAD had been discussed in the literature for nearly a century before the invention of nuclear weapons. One of the earliest references comes from the English author Wilkie Collins, writing at the time of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870: \"I begin to believe in only one civilizing influence\u2014the discovery one of these days of a destructive agent so terrible that War shall mean annihilation and men's fears will force them to keep the peace.\" The concept was also described in 1863 by Jules Verne in his novel \"Paris in the Twentieth Century\", though it was not published until 1994. The book is set in 1960 and describes \"the engines of war\", which have become so efficient that war is inconceivable and all countries are at a perpetual stalemate.\nMAD has been invoked by more than one weapons inventor. For example, Richard Jordan Gatling patented his namesake Gatling gun in 1862 with the partial intention of illustrating the futility of war. Likewise, after his 1867 invention of dynamite, Alfred Nobel stated that \"the day when two army corps can annihilate each other in one second, all civilized nations, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops.\" In 1937, Nikola Tesla published \"The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media\", a treatise concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla described his device as a \"superweapon that would put an end to all war.\"\nThe March 1940 Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum, the earliest technical exposition of a practical nuclear weapon, anticipated deterrence as the principal means of combating an enemy with nuclear weapons.\nEarly Cold War.\nIn August 1945, the United States became the first nuclear power after the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Four years later, on August 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its own nuclear device. At the time, both sides lacked the means to effectively use nuclear devices against each other. However, with the development of aircraft like the American Convair B-36 and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-95, both sides were gaining a greater ability to deliver nuclear weapons into the interior of the opposing country. The official policy of the United States became one of \"Instant Retaliation\", as coined by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, which called for massive atomic attack against the Soviet Union if they were to invade Europe, regardless of whether it was a conventional or a nuclear attack.\nBy the time of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, both the United States and the Soviet Union had developed the capability of launching a nuclear-tipped missile from a submerged submarine, which completed the \"third leg\" of the nuclear triad weapons strategy necessary to fully implement the MAD doctrine. Having a three-branched nuclear capability eliminated the possibility that an enemy could destroy all of a nation's nuclear forces in a first-strike attack; this, in turn, ensured the credible threat of a devastating retaliatory strike against the aggressor, increasing a nation's nuclear deterrence.\nCampbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko argue that Nikita Khrushchev (Soviet leader 1953 to 1964) decided that policies that facilitated nuclear war were too dangerous to the Soviet Union. His approach did not greatly change his foreign policy or military doctrine but is apparent in his determination to choose options that minimized the risk of war.\nStrategic Air Command.\nBeginning in 1955, the United States Strategic Air Command (SAC) kept one-third of its bombers on alert, with crews ready to take off within fifteen minutes and fly to designated targets inside the Soviet Union and destroy them with nuclear bombs in the event of a Soviet first-strike attack on the United States. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy increased funding for this program and raised the commitment to 50 percent of SAC aircraft.\nDuring periods of increased tension in the early 1960s, SAC kept part of its B-52 fleet airborne at all times, to allow an extremely fast retaliatory strike against the Soviet Union in the event of a surprise attack on the United States. This program continued until 1969. Between 1954 and 1992, bomber wings had approximately one-third to one-half of their assigned aircraft on quick reaction ground alert and were able to take off within a few minutes. SAC also maintained the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP, pronounced \"kneecap\"), also known as \"Looking Glass\", which consisted of several EC-135s, one of which was airborne at all times from 1961 through 1990. During the Cuban Missile Crisis the bombers were dispersed to several different airfields, and sixty-five B-52s were airborne at all times.\nDuring the height of the tensions between the US and the USSR in the 1960s, two popular films were made dealing with what could go terribly wrong with the policy of keeping nuclear-bomb-carrying airplanes at the ready: \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964) and \"Fail Safe\" (1964).\nRetaliation capability (second strike).\nThe strategy of MAD was fully declared in the early 1960s, primarily by United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. In McNamara's formulation, there was the very real danger that a nation with nuclear weapons could attempt to eliminate another nation's retaliatory forces with a surprise, devastating first strike and theoretically \"win\" a nuclear war relatively unharmed. The true second-strike capability could be achieved only when a nation had a \"guaranteed\" ability to fully retaliate after a first-strike attack.\nThe United States had achieved an early form of second-strike capability by fielding continual patrols of strategic nuclear bombers, with a large number of planes always in the air, on their way to or from fail-safe points close to the borders of the Soviet Union. This meant the United States could still retaliate, even after a devastating first-strike attack. The tactic was expensive and problematic because of the high cost of keeping enough planes in the air at all times and the possibility they would be shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft missiles before reaching their targets. In addition, as the idea of a missile gap existing between the US and the Soviet Union developed, there was increasing priority being given to ICBMs over bombers.\nIt was only with the advent of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, starting with the \" George Washington\" class in 1959, that a genuine survivable nuclear force became possible and a retaliatory second strike capability guaranteed.\nThe deployment of fleets of ballistic missile submarines established a guaranteed second-strike capability because of their stealth and by the number fielded by each Cold War adversary\u2014it was highly unlikely that all of them could be targeted and preemptively destroyed (in contrast to, for example, a missile silo with a fixed location that could be targeted during a first strike). Given their long-range, high survivability and ability to carry many medium- and long-range nuclear missiles, submarines were credible and effective means for full-scale retaliation even after a massive first strike.\nThis deterrence strategy and the program have continued into the 21st century, with nuclear submarines carrying Trident II ballistic missiles as one leg of the US strategic nuclear deterrent and as the sole deterrent of the United Kingdom. The other elements of the US deterrent are intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) on alert in the continental United States, and nuclear-capable bombers. Ballistic missile submarines are also operated by the navies of China, France, India, and Russia.\nThe US Department of Defense anticipates a continued need for a sea-based strategic nuclear force. The first of the current \"Ohio\"-class SSBNs are expected to be retired by 2029, meaning that a replacement platform must already be seaworthy by that time. A replacement may cost over $4 billion per unit compared to the USS \"Ohio\"'s $2 billion. The USN's follow-on class of SSBN will be the Columbia class, which began construction in 2021 and enter service in 2031.\nABMs threaten MAD.\nIn the 1960s both the Soviet Union (A-35 anti-ballistic missile system) and the United States (LIM-49 Nike Zeus) developed anti-ballistic missile systems. Had such systems been able to effectively defend against a retaliatory second strike, MAD would have been undermined. However, multiple scientific studies showed technological and logistical problems in these systems, including the inability to distinguish between real and decoy weapons.\nMIRVs.\nMIRVs as counter against ABM.\nThe multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle (MIRV) was another weapons system designed specifically to aid with the MAD nuclear deterrence doctrine. With a MIRV payload, one ICBM could hold many separate warheads. MIRVs were first created by the United States in order to counterbalance the Soviet A-35 anti-ballistic missile systems around Moscow. Since each defensive missile could be counted on to destroy only one offensive missile, making each offensive missile have, for example, three warheads (as with early MIRV systems) meant that three times as many defensive missiles were needed for each offensive missile. This made defending against missile attacks more costly and difficult. One of the largest US MIRVed missiles, the LGM-118A Peacekeeper, could hold up to 10 warheads, each with a yield of around \u2014all together, an explosive payload equivalent to 230 Hiroshima-type bombs. The multiple warheads made defense untenable with the available technology, leaving the threat of retaliatory attack as the only viable defensive option. MIRVed land-based ICBMs tend to put a premium on striking first. The START II agreement was proposed to ban this type of weapon, but never entered into force.\nIn the event of a Soviet conventional attack on Western Europe, NATO planned to use tactical nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union countered this threat by issuing a statement that any use of nuclear weapons (tactical or otherwise) against Soviet forces would be grounds for a full-scale Soviet retaliatory strike (massive retaliation). Thus it was generally assumed that any combat in Europe would end with apocalyptic conclusions.\nLand-based MIRVed ICBMs threaten MAD.\nMIRVed land-based ICBMs are generally considered suitable for a first strike (inherently counterforce) or a counterforce second strike, due to:\nUnlike a decapitation strike or a countervalue strike, a counterforce strike might result in a potentially more constrained retaliation. Though the Minuteman III of the mid-1960s was MIRVed with three warheads, heavily MIRVed vehicles threatened to upset the balance; these included the SS-18 Satan which was deployed in 1976, and was considered to threaten Minuteman III silos, which led some neoconservatives to conclude a Soviet first strike was being prepared for. This led to the development of the aforementioned Pershing II, the Trident I and Trident II, as well as the MX missile, and the B-1 Lancer.\nMIRVed land-based ICBMs are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on striking first. When a missile is MIRVed, it is able to carry many warheads (up to eight in existing US missiles, limited by New START, though Trident II is capable of carrying up to 12) and deliver them to separate targets. If it is assumed that each side has 100 missiles, with five warheads each, and further that each side has a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing two warheads at each silo, then the attacking side can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about five by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads, and keeping the rest of 60 missiles in reserve. As such, this type of weapon was intended to be banned under the START II agreement; however, the START II agreement was never brought into force, and neither Russia nor the United States ratified the agreement.\nLate Cold War.\nThe original US MAD doctrine was modified on July 25, 1980, with US President Jimmy Carter's adoption of \"countervailing strategy\" with Presidential Directive 59. According to its architect, Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, \"countervailing strategy\" stressed that the planned response to a Soviet attack was no longer to bomb Soviet population centers and cities primarily, but first to kill the Soviet leadership, then attack military targets, in the hope of a Soviet surrender before total destruction of the Soviet Union (and the United States). This modified version of MAD was seen as a winnable nuclear war, while still maintaining the possibility of assured destruction for at least one party. This policy was further developed by the Reagan administration with the announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, nicknamed \"Star Wars\"), the goal of which was to develop space-based technology to destroy Soviet missiles before they reached the United States.\nSDI was criticized by both the Soviets and many of America's allies (including Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher) because, were it ever operational and effective, it would have undermined the \"assured destruction\" required for MAD. If the United States had a guarantee against Soviet nuclear attacks, its critics argued, it would have first-strike capability, which would have been a politically and militarily destabilizing position. Critics further argued that it could trigger a new arms race, this time to develop countermeasures for SDI. Despite its promise of nuclear safety, SDI was described by many of its critics (including Soviet nuclear physicist and later peace activist Andrei Sakharov) as being even more dangerous than MAD because of these political implications. Supporters also argued that SDI could trigger a new arms race, forcing the USSR to spend an increasing proportion of GDP on defense\u2014something which has been claimed to have been an indirect cause of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev himself in 1983 announced that \u201cthe continuation of the S.D.I. program will sweep the world into a new stage of the arms race and would destabilize the strategic situation.\u201d\nProponents of ballistic missile defense (BMD) argue that MAD is exceptionally dangerous in that it essentially offers a single course of action in the event of a nuclear attack: full retaliatory response. The fact that nuclear proliferation has led to an increase in the number of nations in the \"nuclear club\", including nations of questionable stability (e.g. North Korea), and that a nuclear nation might be hijacked by a despot or other person or persons who might use nuclear weapons without a sane regard for the consequences, presents a strong case for proponents of BMD who seek a policy which both protect against attack, but also does not require an escalation into what might become global nuclear war. Russia continues to have a strong public distaste for Western BMD initiatives, presumably because proprietary operative BMD systems could exceed their technical and financial resources and therefore degrade their larger military standing and sense of security in a post-MAD environment. Russian refusal to accept invitations to participate in NATO BMD may be indicative of the lack of an alternative to MAD in current Russian war-fighting strategy due to the dilapidation of conventional forces after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nProud Prophet.\nProud Prophet was a series of war games played out by various American military officials. The simulation revealed MAD made the use of nuclear weapons virtually impossible without total nuclear annihilation, regardless of how nuclear weapons were implemented in war plans. These results essentially ruled out the possibility of a limited nuclear strike, as every time this was attempted, it resulted in a complete expenditure of nuclear weapons by both the United States and USSR. Proud Prophet marked a shift in American strategy; following Proud Prophet, American rhetoric of strategies that involved the use of nuclear weapons dissipated and American war plans were changed to emphasize the use of conventional forces.\nTTAPS Study.\nIn 1983, a group of researchers including Carl Sagan released the TTAPS study (named for the respective initials of the authors), which predicted that the large scale use of nuclear weapons would cause a \u201cnuclear winter\u201d. The study predicted that the debris burned in nuclear bombings would be lifted into the atmosphere and diminish sunlight worldwide, thus reducing world temperatures by \u201c-15\u00b0 to -25\u00b0C\u201d. These findings led to theory that MAD would still occur with many fewer weapons than were possessed by either the United States or USSR at the height of the Cold War. As such, nuclear winter was used as an argument for significant reduction of nuclear weapons since MAD would occur anyway.\nPost-Cold War.\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation emerged as a sovereign entity encompassing most of the territory of the former USSR. Relations between the United States and Russia were, at least for a time, less tense than they had been with the Soviet Union.\nWhile MAD has become less applicable for the US and Russia, it has been argued as a factor behind Israel's acquisition of nuclear weapons. Similarly, diplomats have warned that Japan may be pressured to nuclearize by the presence of North Korean nuclear weapons. The ability to launch a nuclear attack against an enemy city is a relevant deterrent strategy for these powers.\nThe administration of US President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in June 2002, claiming that the limited national missile defense system which they proposed to build was designed only to prevent nuclear blackmail by a state with limited nuclear capability and was not planned to alter the nuclear posture between Russia and the United States.\nWhile relations have improved and an intentional nuclear exchange is more unlikely, the decay in Russian nuclear capability in the post\u2013Cold War era may have had an effect on the continued viability of the MAD doctrine. A 2006 article by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press stated that the United States could carry out a nuclear first strike on Russia and would \"have a good chance of destroying every Russian bomber base, submarine, and ICBM.\" This was attributed to reductions in Russian nuclear stockpiles and the increasing inefficiency and age of that which remains. Lieber and Press argued that the MAD era is coming to an end and that the United States is on the cusp of global nuclear primacy.\nHowever, in a follow-up article in the same publication, others criticized the analysis, including Peter Flory, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, who began by writing \"The essay by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press contains so many errors, on a topic of such gravity, that a Department of Defense response is required to correct the record.\" Regarding reductions in Russian stockpiles, another response stated that \"a similarly one-sided examination of [reductions in] U.S. forces would have painted a similarly dire portrait\".\nA situation in which the United States might actually be expected to carry out a \"successful\" attack is perceived as a disadvantage for both countries. The strategic balance between the United States and Russia is becoming less stable, and the objective, the technical possibility of a first strike by the United States is increasing. At a time of crisis, this instability could lead to an accidental nuclear war. For example, if Russia feared a US nuclear attack, Moscow might make rash moves (such as putting its forces on alert) that would provoke a US preemptive strike.\nAn outline of current US nuclear strategy toward both Russia and other nations was published as the document \"Essentials of Post\u2013Cold War Deterrence\" in 1995.\nIn November 2020, the US successfully destroyed a dummy ICBM outside the atmosphere with another missile. Bloomberg Opinion writes that this defense ability \"ends the era of nuclear stability\".\nIndia and Pakistan.\nMAD does not entirely apply to all nuclear-armed rivals. India and Pakistan are an example of this; because of the superiority of conventional Indian armed forces to their Pakistani counterparts, Pakistan may be forced to use their nuclear weapons on invading Indian forces out of desperation regardless of an Indian retaliatory strike. As such, any large-scale attack on Pakistan by India could precipitate the use of nuclear weapons by Pakistan, thus rendering MAD inapplicable. However, MAD is applicable in that it may deter Pakistan from making a \u201csuicidal\u201d nuclear attack rather than a defensive nuclear strike.\nNorth Korea.\nSince the emergence of North Korea as a nuclear state, military action has not been an option in handling the instability surrounding North Korea because of their option of nuclear retaliation in response to any conventional attack on them, thus rendering non-nuclear neighboring states such as South Korea and Japan incapable of resolving the destabilizing effect of North Korea via military force. MAD may not apply to the situation in North Korea because the theory relies on rational consideration of the use and consequences of nuclear weapons, which may not be the case for potential North Korean deployment.\nChina.\nSince 2020, China has undertaken an ambitious expansion and modernization of its nuclear arsenal. As of March 2025, it is estimated to possess approximately 600 nuclear warheads. It has developed new variants of intercontinental ballistic missiles and is capable of delivering nuclear warheads via land-based ballistic missiles, sea-based ballistic missiles, and bombers. A 2023 Pentagon report estimated that China could possess 1,000 operational warheads by 2030. China also has the world\u2019s second-largest economy and a highly capable military force. China\u2019s intense development of its nuclear program complicates mutual assured destruction with other countries, including the United States. As its nuclear program expands, the prospect of a credible MAD relationship with the US is likely to increase. China seeks to develop second-strike capabilities to counter other nations, following years of adhering to a declared no-first-use policy. Several analysts have cited China\u2019s nuclear developments as a means of leveraging power to bolster China\u2019s demands due to an increased threat. However, others have claimed that China is simply seeking to boost its deterrence to fortify its own security in a rapidly developing world.\nChina\u2019s nuclear arsenal is currently smaller than the arsenals of Russia and the United States. Historically, the United States has possessed a strong nuclear advantage over China. Despite the various different analyses by defense experts and academics of China\u2019s nuclear buildup, its exact intentions remain largely up to speculation.\nThere does not exist an official consensus on whether or not the United States and China have full mutual assured destruction. However, China\u2019s ambitious nuclear policy signals that the country is potentially seeking to establish a MAD relationship with the United States. China\u2019s nuclear buildup also plays a role in regional nuclear dynamics. In a conflict involving Taiwan, for example, the presence of nuclear forces could lead to a rapid escalation in the situation. When the stakes of a conflict become existential, urgency on all sides increases rapidly and intensely. This similarly complicates security guarantees and other forms of alliances with countries across the world, potentially involving allies and/or strategic partners across the world.\nOfficial policy.\nWhether MAD was the officially accepted doctrine of the United States military during the Cold War is largely a matter of interpretation. The United States Air Force, for example, has retrospectively contended that it never advocated MAD as a sole strategy, and that this form of deterrence was seen as one of numerous options in US nuclear policy. Former officers have emphasized that they never felt as limited by the logic of MAD (and were prepared to use nuclear weapons in smaller-scale situations than \"assured destruction\" allowed), and did not deliberately target civilian cities (though they acknowledge that the result of a \"purely military\" attack would certainly devastate the cities as well). However, according to a declassified 1959 Strategic Air Command study, US nuclear weapons plans specifically targeted the populations of Beijing, Moscow, Leningrad, East Berlin, and Warsaw for systematic destruction. MAD was implied in several US policies and used in the political rhetoric of leaders in both the United States and the USSR during many periods of the Cold War:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To continue to deter in an era of strategic nuclear equivalence, it is necessary to have nuclear (as well as conventional) forces such that in considering aggression against our interests any adversary would recognize that no plausible outcome would represent a victory or any plausible definition of victory. To this end and so as to preserve the possibility of bargaining effectively to terminate the war on acceptable terms that are as favorable as practical, if deterrence fails initially, we must be capable of fighting successfully so that the adversary would not achieve his war aims and would suffer costs that are unacceptable, or in any event greater than his gains, from having initiated an attack.\u2014\u200a\nThe doctrine of MAD was officially at odds with that of the USSR, which had, contrary to MAD, insisted survival was possible. The Soviets believed they could win not only a strategic nuclear war, which they planned to absorb with their extensive civil defense planning, but also the conventional war that they predicted would follow after their strategic nuclear arsenal had been depleted. Official Soviet policy, though, may have had internal critics towards the end of the Cold War, including some in the USSR's own leadership:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nuclear use would be catastrophic.Other evidence of this comes from the Soviet minister of defense, Dmitriy Ustinov, who wrote that \"A clear appreciation by the Soviet leadership of what a war under contemporary conditions would mean for mankind determines the active position of the USSR.\" The Soviet doctrine, although being seen as primarily offensive by Western analysts, fully rejected the possibility of a \"limited\" nuclear war by 1975.\nCriticism.\nDeterrence theory has been criticized by numerous scholars for various reasons. A prominent strain of criticism argues that rational deterrence theory is contradicted by frequent deterrence failures, which may be attributed to misperceptions. Critics have also argued that leaders do not behave in ways that are consistent with the predictions of nuclear deterrence theory. For example, it has been argued that it is inconsistent with the logic of rational deterrence theory that states continue to build nuclear arsenals once they have reached the second-strike threshold. For a more inconsistent example, Mao Zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if \"half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist.\"\nAdditionally, many scholars have advanced philosophical objections against the principles of deterrence theory on purely ethical grounds. Included in this group is Robert L. Holmes who uses a reductio ad absurdum argument to observe that mankind's reliance upon a system of preventing war which is based exclusively upon the threat of waging war is inherently irrational and must be considered immoral according to fundamental deontological principles. In addition, he questions whether it can be conclusively demonstrated that such a system has in fact served to prevent warfare in the past and may actually serve to increase the probability of waging war in the future due to its reliance upon the continuous development of new generations of technologically advanced nuclear weapons.\nChallengeable assumptions.\nInherent instability.\nAnother reason is that deterrence has an inherent instability. As Kenneth Boulding said: \"If deterrence were really stable... it would cease to deter.\" If decision-makers were perfectly rational, they would never order the largescale use of nuclear weapons, and the credibility of the nuclear threat would be low.\nHowever, that apparent perfect rationality criticism is countered and so is consistent with current deterrence policy. In \"Essentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence\", the authors detail an explicit advocation of ambiguity regarding \"what is permitted\" for other nations and its endorsement of \"irrationality\" or, more precisely, the perception thereof as an important tool in deterrence and foreign policy. The document claims that the capacity of the United States, in exercising deterrence, would be hurt by portraying US leaders as fully rational and cool-headed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fact that some elements may appear to be potentially 'out of control' can be beneficial to creating and reinforcing fears and doubts in the minds of an adversary's decision makers. This essential sense of fear is the working force of deterrence. That the U.S. may become irrational and vindictive if its vital interests are attacked should be part of the national persona we project to all adversaries.\nTerrorism.\nHowever Robert Gallucci, the president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, argues that although traditional deterrence is not an effective approach toward terrorist groups bent on causing a nuclear catastrophe, \"the United States should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence, which focuses not solely on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them. By threatening retaliation against those states, the United States may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent.\"\nGraham Allison makes a similar case and argues that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material: \"After a nuclear bomb detonates, nuclear forensic cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory for radiological analysis. By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material, including its impurities and contaminants, one could trace the path back to its origin.\" The process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints: \"The goal would be twofold: first, to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons; second, to give leaders every incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition to the actual use of nuclear weapons whether in the battlefield or strategically, a large part of nuclear strategy involves their use as a bargaining tool.\nSome of the issues considered within nuclear strategy include:\nMany strategists argue that nuclear strategy differs from other forms of military strategy. The immense and terrifying power of the weapons makes their use, in seeking victory in a traditional military sense, impossible.\nPerhaps counterintuitively, an important focus of nuclear strategy has been determining how to prevent and deter their use, a crucial part of mutually assured destruction.\nIn the context of nuclear proliferation and maintaining the balance of power, states also seek to prevent other states from acquiring nuclear weapons as part of nuclear strategy.\nNuclear deterrent composition.\nThe doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD) assumes that a nuclear deterrent force must be credible and survivable. That is, each deterrent force must survive a first strike with sufficient capability to effectively destroy the other country in a second strike. Therefore, a first strike would be suicidal for the launching country.\nIn the late 1940s and 1950s as the Cold War developed, the United States and Soviet Union pursued multiple delivery methods and platforms to deliver nuclear weapons. Three types of platforms proved most successful and are collectively called a \"nuclear triad\". These are air-delivered weapons (bombs or missiles), ballistic missile submarines (usually nuclear-powered and called SSBNs), and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), usually deployed in land-based hardened missile silos or on vehicles.\nAlthough not considered part of the deterrent forces, all of the nuclear powers deployed large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons in the Cold War. These could be delivered by virtually all platforms capable of delivering large conventional weapons.\nDuring the 1970s there was growing concern that the combined conventional forces of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact could overwhelm the forces of NATO. It seemed unthinkable to respond to a Soviet/Warsaw Pact incursion into Western Europe with strategic nuclear weapons, inviting a catastrophic exchange. Thus, technologies were developed to greatly reduce collateral damage while being effective against advancing conventional military forces. Some of these were low-yield neutron bombs, which were lethal to tank crews, especially with tanks massed in tight formation, while producing relatively little blast, thermal radiation, or radioactive fallout. Other technologies were so-called \"suppressed radiation devices,\" which produced mostly blast with little radioactivity, making them much like conventional explosives, but with much more energy.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Fictional cloaking devices have been used as plot devices in various media for many years.\nDevelopments in scientific research show that real-world cloaking devices can obscure objects from at least one wavelength of EM emissions. Scientists already use artificial materials called metamaterials to bend light around an object. However, over the entire spectrum, a cloaked object scatters more than an uncloaked object.\nFictional origins.\nCloaks with magical powers of invisibility appear from the earliest days of story-telling. Since the advent of modern Science fiction, many variations on the theme with proposed basis in reality have been imagined. \"\" screenwriter Paul Schneider, inspired in part by the 1958 film \"Run Silent, Run Deep,\" and in part by \"The Enemy Below,\" which had been released in 1957, imagined cloaking as a space-travel analog of a submarine submerging, and employed it in the 1966 \"Star Trek\" episode \"Balance of Terror\", in which he introduced the Romulan species, whose space vessels employ cloaking devices extensively. (He likewise predicted, in the same episode, that invisibility, \"selective bending of light\" as described above, would have an enormous power requirement.) Another \"Star Trek\" screenwriter, D.C. Fontana, coined the term \"cloaking device\" for the 1968 episode \"The \"Enterprise\" Incident\", which also featured Romulans.\n\"Star Trek\" placed a limit on use of this device: a space vessel cannot fire weapons, employ defensive shields, or operate transporters while cloaked; thus it must \"decloak\" to fire. At this point, Trek parted ways with the submarine analogy (subs don't \"surface\" to launch torpedoes), instead anticipating a significant limitation of Stealth technology: aircraft like the B-2 bomber cannot avoid becoming un-stealthy during the time their bomb bay doors are open.\nWriters and game designers have since incorporated cloaking devices into many other science-fiction narratives, including \"Doctor Who\", \"Star Wars\", and \"Stargate\".\nScientific experimentation.\nAn operational, non-fictional cloaking device might be an extension of the basic technologies used by stealth aircraft, such as radar-absorbing dark paint, optical camouflage, cooling the outer surface to minimize electromagnetic emissions (usually infrared), or other techniques to minimize other EM emissions, and to minimize particle emissions from the object. The use of certain devices to jam and confuse remote sensing devices would greatly aid in this process, but is more properly referred to as \"active camouflage\". Alternatively, metamaterials provide the theoretical possibility of making electromagnetic radiation pass freely around the 'cloaked' object.\nMetamaterial research.\nOptical metamaterials have featured in several proposals for invisibility schemes. \"Metamaterials\" refers to materials that owe their refractive properties to the way they are structured, rather than the substances that compose them. Using transformation optics it is possible to design the optical parameters of a \"cloak\" so that it guides light around some region, rendering it invisible over a certain band of wavelengths.\nThese spatially varying optical parameters do not correspond to any natural material, but may be implemented using metamaterials. There are several theories of cloaking, giving rise to different types of invisibility.\nIn 2014, scientists demonstrated good cloaking performance in murky water, demonstrating that an object shrouded in fog can disappear completely when appropriately coated with metamaterial. This is due to the random scattering of light, such as that which occurs in clouds, fog, milk, frosted glass, etc., combined with the properties of the metamaterial coating. When light is diffused, a thin coat of metamaterial around an object can make it essentially invisible under a range of lighting conditions.\nActive camouflage.\n\"Active camouflage\" (or \"adaptive camouflage\") is a group of camouflage technologies which would allow an object (usually military in nature) to blend into its surroundings by use of panels or coatings capable of changing color or luminosity. Active camouflage can be seen as having the potential to become the perfection of the art of camouflaging things from visual detection.\n\"Optical camouflage\" is a kind of active camouflage in which one wears a fabric which has an image of the scene directly behind the wearer projected onto it, so that the wearer appears invisible. The drawback to this system is that, when the cloaked wearer moves, a visible distortion is often generated as the 'fabric' catches up with the object's motion. The concept exists for now only in theory and in proof-of-concept prototypes, although many experts consider it technically feasible.\nIt has been reported that the British Army has tested an invisible tank. Mercedes demonstrated an invisible car using LED and camera in 2012.\nPlasma stealth.\nPlasma at certain density ranges absorbs certain bandwidths of broadband waves, potentially rendering an object invisible. However, generating plasma in air is too expensive and a feasible alternative is generating plasma between thin membranes instead. The Defense Technical Information Center is also following up research on plasma reducing RCS technologies. A plasma cloaking device was patented in 1991.\nMetascreen.\nA prototype Metascreen is a claimed cloaking device, which is just few micrometers thick and to a limited extent can hide 3D objects from microwaves in their natural environment, in their natural positions, in all directions, and from all of the observer's positions. It was prepared at the University of Texas at Austin by Professor Andrea Al\u00f9.\nThe metascreen consisted of a 66 micrometre thick polycarbonate film supporting an arrangement of 20 micrometer thick copper strips that resembled a fishing net. In the experiment, when the metascreen was hit by 3.6\u00a0GHz microwaves, it re-radiated microwaves of the same frequency that were out of phase, thus cancelling out reflections from the object being hidden. The device only cancelled out the scattering of microwaves in the first order. The same researchers published a paper on \"plasmonic cloaking\" the previous year.\nHowell/Choi cloaking device.\nUniversity of Rochester physics professor John Howell and graduate student Joseph Choi have announced a scalable cloaking device which uses common optical lenses to achieve visible light cloaking on the macroscopic scale, known as the \"Rochester Cloak\". The device consists of a series of four lenses which direct light rays around objects which would otherwise occlude the optical pathway.\nCloaking in mechanics.\nThe concepts of cloaking are not limited to optics but can also be transferred to other fields of physics. For example, it was possible to cloak acoustics for certain frequencies as well as touching in mechanics. This renders an object \"invisible\" to sound or even hides it from touching.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is opposed to synthetic languages, which synthesize many concepts into a single word, using affixes regularly. \nSyntactic roles are assigned to words primarily by word order. For example, by changing the individual words in the Latin phrase \"f\u0113l-is pisc-em c\u0113pit\" (\"the cat caught the fish\") to \"f\u0113l-em pisc-is c\u0113pit\" (\"the fish caught the cat\"), the fish becomes the subject, while the cat becomes the object. This transformation is not possible in an analytic language without altering the word order. Typically, analytic languages have a low morpheme-per-word ratio, especially with respect to inflectional morphemes. \nNo natural language, however, is purely analytic or purely synthetic.\nBackground.\nThe term \"analytic\" is commonly used in a relative rather than an absolute sense. The most prominent and widely used Indo-European analytic language is Modern English, which has lost much of the inflectional morphology that it inherited from Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Germanic and Old English over the centuries and has not gained any new inflectional morphemes in the meantime, which makes it more analytic than most other Indo-European languages.\nFor example, Proto-Indo-European had much more complex grammatical conjugation, grammatical genders, dual number and inflections for eight or nine cases in its nouns, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, participles, postpositions and determiners. Standard English has lost nearly all of them (except for three modified cases for pronouns) along with genders and dual number and simplified its conjugation.\nLatin, German, Greek, and Russian and a majority of the Slavic languages, characterized by free word order, are synthetic languages. Nouns in Russian inflect for at least six cases, most of which descended from Proto-Indo-European cases, whose functions English translates by instead using other strategies like prepositions, verbal voice, word order, and possessive \"'s\".\nModern Hebrew is more analytic than Classical Hebrew mostly with nouns. Classical Hebrew relies heavily on inflectional morphology to convey grammatical relationships, while in Modern Hebrew, there has been a significant reduction of the use of inflectional morphology.\nIsolating language.\nA related concept is that of isolating languages, which are those with a low morpheme-per-word ratio (taking into account derivational morphemes as well). Purely isolating languages are by definition analytic and lack inflectional morphemes. However, the reverse is not necessarily true, and a language can have derivational morphemes but lack inflectional morphemes. For example, Mandarin Chinese has many compound words, which gives it a moderately high ratio of morphemes per word, but since it has almost no inflectional affixes at all to convey grammatical relationships; it is a very analytic language.\nEnglish is not totally analytic in its nouns, since it uses inflections for number (e.g., \"one day, three days; one boy, four boys\") and possession (\"The boy's ball\" vis-\u00e0-vis \"The boy has a ball\"). Mandarin Chinese, by contrast, has no inflections on its nouns: Compare 'one day', 'three days' (literally 'three day'); 'one boy' (lit. 'one [entity of] male child'), 'four boys' (lit. 'four [entity of] male child'). However, English is considered weakly inflected, and comparatively more analytic than most other Indo-European languages.\nPersian is a synthetic language, not an analytical one. It has some features of agglutination, making use of prefixes and suffixes attached to the stems of verbs and nouns, thus making it a synthetic language rather than an analytic one. It is also is an SOV (subject, object, and then verb) language, thus having a head-final phrase structure. Example in Persian: \"Kuchiktarinhayeshunra barnemigardundam\" meaning \"'\"I wouldn\u2019t return the smallest ones of them\"\"' \"(\"literally 'Small+diminutive+comparative+superlative+plural+possessive+object_marker re+not+ing+turn+to+did+I')\nList of analytic languages.\nSynthetic languages that encounter heavy influence, or become creolized, often become more analytic, as the complex rules of synthesis break down. Thus many of these languages are ones like English or Mandarin that became a significant admixture of more than one language (with English, this includes Old English, Norman French, Latin, Danish, and Common Brittonic), or are new languages made from old ones, like Haitian Creole.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nicknamed the \"Father of Rock and Roll\", he refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as \"Maybellene\" (1955), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957), and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music.\nBorn into a middle-class black family in St. Louis, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student, he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded \"Maybellene\"\u2014Berry's adaptation of the country song \"Ida Red\"\u2014which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on \"Billboard\" magazine's rhythm and blues chart.\nBy the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act\u2014he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines for the purpose of having sex. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more successful songs, including \"No Particular Place to Go\", \"You Never Can Tell\", and \"Nadine\". However, these did not achieve the same success or lasting impact of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgia performer, playing his past material with local backup bands of variable quality. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion.\nBerry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having \"laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance.\" Berry is included in several of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"greatest of all time\" lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 2nd greatest guitarist of all time in 2023. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry's: \"Johnny B. Goode\", \"Maybellene\", and \"Rock and Roll Music\". \"Johnny B. Goode\" is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.\nEarly life.\nCharles Edward Anderson Berry was born on October 18, 1926, in St. Louis, the youngest child of Henry William Berry and Martha Bell Berry (n\u00e9e Banks). He grew up in the north St. Louis neighbourhood known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry (1895\u20131987) was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha (1894\u20131980) was a certified public school principal. Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School in St. Louis; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berry's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a non-functional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men (now the Algoa Correctional Center) in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.\nOn October 28, 1948, Berry married Themetta \"Toddy\" Suggs, who gave birth to Darlin Ingrid Berry on October 3, 1950. Chuck supported his family by taking various jobs in St. Louis, working briefly as a factory worker at two automobile assembly plants and as a janitor in the apartment building where he and his wife lived. Afterwards, he trained as a beautician at the Poro College of Cosmetology, founded by Annie Turnbo Malone. He was doing well enough by 1950 to buy a \"small three room brick cottage with a bath\" on Whittier Street, which is now listed as the Chuck Berry House on the National Register of Historic Places.\nCareer.\n1952\u20131955: Music career beginnings.\nBy the early 1950s, Chuck Berry was working with local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income. He had been playing blues since his teens, and he borrowed both guitar riffs and showmanship techniques from the blues musician T-Bone Walker. He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris, which laid the foundation for his guitar style. By early 1953, Berry was performing with Johnnie Johnson's trio, starting a long-time collaboration with the pianist. The band played blues and ballads as well as country. Berry wrote, \"Curiosity provoked me to lay a lot of our country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering 'who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?' After they laughed at me a few times, they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it.\"\nIn 1954, Berry recorded the tracks \"I Hope These Words Will Find You Well\" and \"Oh, Maria!\" with the group Joe Alexander &amp; the Cubans. The songs were released as a single on the Ballad label. Berry's showmanship, along with a mix of country tunes and R&amp;B tunes, sung in the style of Nat King Cole set to the music of Muddy Waters brought in a wider audience, particularly affluent white people.\n1955\u20131962: Signing with Chess: \"Maybellene\" to \"Come On\".\nIn May 1955, Berry traveled to Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. Berry thought his blues music would interest Chess, but Chess was a larger fan of Berry's take on \"Ida Red\". On May 21, 1955, Berry recorded an adaptation of the song \"Ida Red\", under the title \"Maybellene\", with Johnnie Johnson on the piano, Jerome Green (from Bo Diddley's band) on the maracas, Ebby Hardy on the drums and Willie Dixon on the bass. \"Maybellene\" sold over a million copies, reaching number one on \"Billboard\" magazine's rhythm and blues chart and number five on its Best Sellers in Stores chart for September 10, 1955. Berry said, \"It came out at the right time when Afro-American music was spilling over into the mainstream pop.\"\nWhen Berry first saw a copy of the \"Maybellene\" record, he was surprised that two other individuals, including DJ Alan Freed, had been given writing credit; that would entitle them to some of the royalties. After a court battle, Berry was able to regain full writing credit.\nAt the end of June 1956, his song \"Roll Over Beethoven\" reached number 29 on the \"Billboard\"'s Top 100 chart, and Berry toured as one of the \"Top Acts of '56\". He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that \"I knew when I first heard Chuck that he'd been affected by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great.\" In late 1957, Berry took part in Alan Freed's \"Biggest Show of Stars for 1957\", touring the United States with the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and others. He was a guest on ABC's \"Guy Mitchell Show\", singing his hit song \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\". The hits continued from 1957 to 1959, with Berry scoring over a dozen chart singles during this period, including the US Top 10 hits \"School Days\", \"Rock and Roll Music\", \"Sweet Little Sixteen\", and \"Johnny B. Goode\". He appeared in two early rock-and-roll movies: \"Rock Rock Rock\" (1956), in which he sang \"You Can't Catch Me\", and \"Go, Johnny, Go!\" (1959), in which he had a speaking role as himself and performed \"Johnny B. Goode\", \"Memphis, Tennessee\", and \"Little Queenie\". His performance of \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958 was captured in the motion picture \"Jazz on a Summer's Day\".\nThe opening guitar riff of \"Johnny B. Goode\" is similar to the one used by Louis Jordan in his \"Ain't That Just Like a Woman\" (1946). Berry acknowledged the debt to Jordan and several sources have indicated that his work was influenced by Jordan in general.\nBy the end of the 1950s, Berry was a high-profile established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had opened a racially integrated St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand, and invested in real estate. But in December 1959, he was arrested under the Mann Act after allegations that he had had sex with a 14-year-old Apache waitress, Janice Escalante, whom he had transported across state lines to work as a hatcheck girl at his club. After a two-week trial in March 1960, he was convicted, fined $5,000, and sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed the decision, arguing that the judge's comments and attitude were racist and prejudiced the jury against him. The appeal was upheld and a second trial was heard in May and June 1961, resulting in another conviction and a three-year prison sentence. After another appeal failed, Berry served one and one-half years in prison from February 1962 to October 1963. He continued recording and performing during the trials, but his output had slowed as his popularity declined; his last single released before he was imprisoned was \"Come On\".\n1963\u20131969: \"Nadine\" and move to Mercury.\nWhen Berry was released from prison in 1963, his return to recording and performing was made easier because British invasion bands\u2014notably the Beatles and the Rolling Stones\u2014had sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs, and other bands had reworked some of them, such as the Beach Boys' 1963 hit \"Surfin' U.S.A.\", which used the melody of Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\". In 1964 and 1965 Berry released eight singles, including three that were commercially successful, reaching the top 20 of the \"Billboard\" 100: \"No Particular Place to Go\" (a humorous reworking of \"School Days\", concerning the introduction of seat belts in cars), \"You Never Can Tell\", and the rocking \"Nadine\". Between 1966 and 1969, Berry released five albums for Mercury Records, including his second live album (and first recorded entirely onstage), \"Live at Fillmore Auditorium\"; for the live album he was backed by the Steve Miller Band.\nAlthough this period was not a successful one for studio work, Berry was still a top concert draw. In May 1964, he had made a successful tour of the UK, but when he returned in January 1965, his behavior was erratic and moody, and his touring style of using unrehearsed local backing bands and a strict nonnegotiable contract was earning him a reputation as a difficult and unexciting performer. He also played at large events in North America, such as the Schaefer Music Festival, in New York City's Central Park in July 1969, and the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival in October.\n1970\u20131979: Back to Chess: \"My Ding-a-Ling\" to White House concert.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBerry helped give life to a subculture\u00a0... Even \"My Ding-a-Ling\", a fourth-grade wee-wee joke that used to mortify true believers at college concerts, permitted a lot of twelve-year-olds new insight into the moribund concept of \"dirty\" when it hit the airwaves\u00a0...\nRobert Christgau\nBerry returned to Chess from 1970 to 1973. There were no hit singles from the 1970 album \"Back Home\", but in 1972, Chess released a live recording of \"My Ding-a-Ling\", a novelty song that he had recorded in a different version as \"My Tambourine\" on his 1968 LP \"From St. Louie to Frisco\". The track became his only number-one single. A live recording of \"Reelin' and Rockin'\", issued as a follow-up single in the same year, was his last Top 40 hit in both the US and the UK. Both singles were included on the part-live, part-studio album \"The London Chuck Berry Sessions\" (other albums of London sessions were recorded by Chess's mainstay artists Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf). Berry's second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album \"Chuck Berry\", after which he did not make a studio record until \"Rockit\" for Atco Records in 1979, which would be his last studio album for 38 years.\nIn the 1970s, Berry toured on the strength of his earlier successes. He was on the road for many years, carrying only his Gibson guitar, confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went. AllMusic said that in this period his \"live performances became increasingly erratic,\u00a0... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy, out-of-tune performances\" which \"tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers\" alike. In March 1972, he was filmed, at the BBC Television Theatre in Shepherds Bush, for \"Chuck Berry in Concert\", part of a 60-date tour backed by the band Rocking Horse. Among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with Berry in the 1970s, were Bruce Springsteen and Steve Miller when each was just starting his career. (Springsteen related in the documentary film \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll\" that Berry did not give the band a set list and expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro. Berry did not speak to the band after the show. Nevertheless, Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.) At the request of Jimmy Carter, Berry performed at the White House on June 1, 1979.\nIn 1979 Berry pleaded guilty to evading nearly $110,000 in federal income tax owed on his 1973 joint earnings of $374,982. He was sentenced to 120 days in prison.\n1980\u20132017: Last years on the road.\nBerry continued to play 70 to 100 one-nighters per year in the 1980s, still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop. In 1986, Taylor Hackford made a documentary film, \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll\", of a celebration concert for Berry's sixtieth birthday, organized by Keith Richards. Eric Clapton, Etta James, Julian Lennon, Robert Cray, and Linda Ronstadt, among others, appeared with Berry on stage and in the film. During the concert, Berry played a Gibson ES-355, the luxury version of the ES-335 that he favored on his 1970s tours. Richards played a black Fender Telecaster Custom, Cray a Fender Stratocaster and Clapton a Gibson ES 350T, the same model that Berry used on his early recordings.\nIn the late 1980s, Berry bought the Southern Air, a restaurant in Wentzville, Missouri. In 1982, Berry performed a television special at The Roxy in West Hollywood with Tina Turner as his special guest. The concert was released a year later on home video. In November 2000, Berry faced legal issues when he was sued by his former pianist Johnnie Johnson who claimed that he had co-written over 50 songs, including \"No Particular Place to Go\", \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" and \"Roll Over Beethoven\", that credit Berry alone. The case was dismissed when the judge ruled that too much time had passed since the songs were written.\nIn 2008, Berry toured Europe, with stops in Sweden, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, Poland, and Spain. In mid-2008, he played at the Virgin Festival in Baltimore. During a concert on New Year's Day 2011 in Chicago, Berry, suffering from exhaustion, passed out and had to be helped off stage.\nBerry lived in Ladue, Missouri, approximately west of St. Louis. He also had a home at \"Berry Park\", near Wentzville where he lived part-time since the 1950s and was the home in which he died. The home with the guitar-shaped swimming pool, is seen in scenes near the end of the film \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll\".\nWhen Berry performed he often required payment up front in a paper bag which he transferred to an attach\u00e9 case, PBS on \"In Their Own Words\", relates. He gave interviews where he talked about having been ripped off during his early career. Thus he protected his own interests.\nHe regularly performed one Wednesday each month at Blueberry Hill, a restaurant and bar located in the Delmar Loop neighborhood of St. Louis, from 1996 to 2014. Berry announced on his 90th birthday that his first new studio album since \"Rockit\" in 1979, entitled \"Chuck\", would be released in 2017. His first new record in 38 years, it includes his children, Charles Berry Jr. and Ingrid, on guitar and harmonica with songs \"covering the spectrum from hard-driving rockers to soulful thought-provoking time capsules of a life's work\" and dedicated to his wife Toddy.\nDeath and funeral.\nOn March 18, 2017, Berry was found unresponsive at his home near Wentzville. Emergency workers called to the scene were unable to revive him, and he was pronounced dead by his personal physician. TMZ posted an audio recording on its website in which a 911 operator can be heard responding to a reported cardiac arrest at Berry's home.\nBerry's funeral was held on April 9, 2017, at The Pageant, in Berry's home town of St. Louis. He was remembered with a public viewing by family, friends, and fans in The Pageant. He was viewed and buried with a new cherry-red Gibson ES-355 guitar like the one he used throughout his career, bolted to the inside lid of the coffin and with flower arrangements that included one sent by the Rolling Stones in the shape of a guitar. Afterwards a private service was held in the club celebrating Berry's life and musical career, with the Berry family inviting 300 members of the public into the service. Gene Simmons of Kiss gave an impromptu, unadvertised eulogy at the service, while Little Richard was scheduled to lead the funeral procession but was unable to attend due to an illness. The night before, many St. Louis area bars held a mass toast at 10 pm in Berry's honor.\nOne of Berry's attorneys estimated that his estate was worth $50 million, including $17 million in music rights. Berry's music publishing accounted for $13 million of the estate's value. The Berry estate owned roughly half of his songwriting credits (mostly from his later career), while BMG Rights Management controlled the other half; most of Berry's recordings are currently owned by Universal Music Group. In September 2017, Dualtone, the label which released Berry's final album, \"Chuck\", agreed to publish all his compositions in the United States.\nBerry is interred in a mausoleum in Bellerive Gardens Cemetery in St. Louis.\nControversies.\nIn 1987, Berry was charged with assaulting a woman at New York's Gramercy Park Hotel. He was accused of causing \"lacerations of the mouth, requiring five stitches, two loose teeth, [and] contusions of the face.\" He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of harassment and paid a $250 fine. In 1990, he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a video camera in the bathroom of his restaurant. Berry claimed that he had the camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Although his guilt was never proven in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. One of his biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees. His lawyers said he had been the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth.\nReportedly, according to \"Rolling Stone\", a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women. Also found in the raid were 62 grams of marijuana. Felony drug charges were filed and Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence, placed on two years unsupervised probation, and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhile no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll, Chuck Berry comes the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together. It was his particular genius to graft country &amp; western guitar licks onto a rhythm &amp; blues chassis in his very first single, \"Maybellene\".\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame\nA pioneer of rock and roll, Berry was a significant influence on the development of both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle. With songs such as \"Maybellene\" (1955), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances, fast cars, high school life, and consumer culture, and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music. Thus Berry, the songwriter, according to critic Jon Pareles, invented rock as \"a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit).\" Berry contributed three things to rock music: an irresistible swagger, a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling. His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical, showmanship and musical components of rock and roll. In addition to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, a large number of significant popular-music performers have recorded Berry's songs. Although not technically accomplished, his guitar style is distinctive\u2014he incorporated electronic effects to mimic the sound of bottleneck blues guitarists and drew on the influence of guitar players such as Carl Hogan, and T-Bone Walker to produce a clear and exciting sound that many later guitarists would acknowledge as an influence in their own style. Berry's showmanship has been influential on other rock guitarists, particularly his one-legged hop routine, and the \"duck walk\", which he first used as a child when he walked \"stooping with full-bended knees, but with my back and head vertical\" under a table to retrieve a ball and his family found it entertaining; he used it when \"performing in New York for the first time and some journalist branded it the duck walk.\"\nOn July 29, 2011, Berry was honored in a dedication of an eight-foot, in-motion Chuck Berry Statue in the Delmar Loop in St. Louis right across the street from Blueberry Hill. Berry said, \"It's glorious\u2014I do appreciate it to the highest, no doubt about it. That sort of honor is seldom given out. But I don't deserve it.\"\nRock critic Robert Christgau considers Berry \"the greatest of the rock and rollers\", and John Lennon said, \"if you tried to give rock and roll another name, you might call it 'Chuck Berry'.\" Ted Nugent said, \"If you don't know every Chuck Berry lick, you can't play rock guitar.\" Bob Dylan called Berry \"the Shakespeare of rock 'n' roll\". Bruce Springsteen tweeted, \"Chuck Berry was rock's greatest practitioner, guitarist, and the greatest pure rock 'n' roll writer who ever lived.\" When asked what caused the explosion of the popularity of rock 'n roll which took place in the 1950s, with him and a handful of others, mainly him, Berry said, \"Well, actually they begin to listen to it, you see, because certain stations played certain music. The music that we, the blacks, played, the cultures were so far apart, we would have to have a play station in order to play it. The cultures begin to come together, and you begin to see one another's vein of life, then the music came together.\"\nAmong the honors Berry received were the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2000. He was ranked seventh on \"Time\" magazine's 2009 list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time. On May 14, 2002, he was honored as one of the first BMI Icons at the 50th annual BMI Pop Awards. He was presented the award along with BMI affiliates Bo Diddley and Little Richard. In August 2014, Berry was made a laureate of the Polar Music Prize.\nBerry is included in several of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"Greatest of All Time\" lists. In September 2003, the magazine ranked him number 6 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". In November his compilation album \"The Great Twenty-Eight\" was ranked 21st in \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In March 2004, Berry was ranked fifth on the list of \"The Immortals\u2013 The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Joe Perry wrote in tribute, \"As a songwriter, Chuck Berry is like the Ernest Hemingway of rock &amp; roll. He gets right to the point. He tells a story in short sentences. You get a great picture in your mind of what's going on, in a very short amount of space, in well-picked words... kids today are playing the same three chords, trying to play in that same style. Turn the guitars up, and it's punk rock. It's the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. I hear it in the White Stripes, too. People will always cover Chuck Berry songs. When bands go do their homework, they will have to listen to Chuck Berry. If you want to learn about rock &amp; roll, if you want to play rock &amp; roll, you have to start there.\" In December 2004, six of his songs were included in \"Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\": \"Johnny B. Goode\" (No. 7), \"Maybellene\" (No. 18), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (No. 97), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (No. 128), \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" (No. 272) and \"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\" (No. 374). In June 2008, his song \"Johnny B. Goode\" was ranked first in the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\". In 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Berry at number 96 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\nThe journalist Chuck Klosterman has argued that in 300 years Berry will still be remembered as the rock musician who most closely captured the essence of rock and roll. \"Time\" magazine said, \"There was no one like Elvis. But there was 'definitely' no one like Chuck Berry.\" \"Rolling Stone\" called him \"the father of rock &amp; roll\" who \"gave the music its sound and its attitude, even as he battled racism\u2014and his own misdeeds\u2014all the way\", reporting that Leonard Cohen said, \"All of us are footnotes to the words of Chuck Berry.\" Kevin Strait, curator of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC, said that Berry is \"one of the primary sonic architects of rock and roll.\"\nAccording to Cleveland.com's Troy L. Smith, \"Chuck Berry didn't invent rock and roll all by his lonesome. But he was the man who took rhythm and blues and transformed it into a new genre that would ever change popular music. Songs like 'Maybellene,' 'Johnny B. Goode,' 'Roll Over Beethoven' and 'Rock and Roll Music' would showcase the core elements of what rock and roll would become. The sound, the format and the style were built on the music Berry created. To some extent, everyone who followed was a copycat.\"\n\"Johnny B. Goode\" is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record. In 2020, the International Astronomical Union named a small crater on Mercury after Berry.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45966", "revid": "50978567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45966", "title": "No first use", "text": "Policy on use of nuclear weapons\nA no first use (NFU) policy refers to a commitment by a nuclear power not to initiate the use of nuclear weapons. Such a pledge would allow for a unique state of affairs in which a given nuclear power can be engaged in a conflict of conventional weaponry while it formally forswears any of the strategic advantages of nuclear weapons, provided the enemy power does not possess or utilize any such weapons of their own. The concept is primarily invoked in reference to nuclear mutually assured destruction but has also been applied to chemical and biological warfare, as is the case of the official WMD policy of India.\nChina and India are currently the only two nuclear powers to formally maintain a no first use policy, adopting pledges in 1964 and 1998 respectively. Both NATO and a number of its member states have repeatedly rejected calls for adopting a NFU policy, as during the lifetime of the Soviet Union a pre-emptive nuclear strike was commonly argued as a key option to afford NATO a credible nuclear deterrent, compensating for the overwhelming conventional weapon superiority enjoyed by the Soviet Army in Eurasia. In 1993, Russia dropped a pledge against first use of nuclear weapons made in 1982 by Leonid Brezhnev, with Russian military doctrine later stating in 2000 that Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons \"in response to a large-scale conventional aggression\". Pakistan has also made similar statements, largely in reference to intermittent military tensions with India. North Korea has publicly pledged to refrain from a preemptive nuclear strike, while threatening retaliation up to and including WMD against conventional aggression. Israel has not declared a NFU policy and it maintains the stance of nuclear ambiguity, but has said it would not be the first country to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons into the Middle East. \nCountries pledging no-first-use.\nIndia.\nIndia first adopted a \"no first use\" policy after its second series of nuclear tests, Pokhran-II, in 1998. In August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of \"retaliation only\". The document also maintains that India \"will not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail\" and that decisions to authorise the use of nuclear weapons would be made by the prime minister or his \"designated successor(s)\". According to the National Research Development Corporation, despite the escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan in 2001\u20132002, India remained committed to its nuclear no-first-use policy. India is in the process of developing a nuclear doctrine based on \"credible minimum deterrence\".\nIn a speech at the National Defence College by India's National Security Advisor, Shivshankar Menon, on October 21, 2010, the wording was changed from \"no first use\" to \"no first use against non-nuclear weapon states\", but some argued that it was not a substantive change but \"an innocent typographical or lexical error in the text of the speech\". In April 2013, Shyam Saran, convener of the National Security Advisory Board, affirmed that regardless of the size of a nuclear attack against India, be it a tactical nuclear weapon or a strategic nuclear weapon, India would retaliate massively. That was in response to reports that Pakistan had developed a tactical battlefield nuclear weapon in an attempt to supposedly nullify an Indian \"no first use\" retaliatory doctrine. In April 2014, before the general elections, Prime Minister Modi reiterated commitment to a no-first-use policy. On November 10, 2016, the Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar questioned the no-first-use policy of India, and asked why should India \"bind\" itself when it is a \"responsible nuclear power\". He clarified that it was his personal opinion.\nIndian defence minister Rajnath Singh, speaking on the anniversary of the death of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on August 16, 2019, said that India's no-first-use policy might change depending upon the \"circumstances\". Vajpayee's government conducted the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. On September 26, 2013, Indian Minister of External Affairs Salman Khurshid, reiterated India's policy of no first use at the High Level Meeting of the General Assembly on Nuclear Disarmament, New York.\nCountries without a no-first-use policy.\nPakistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France say that they will use nuclear weapons against either nuclear or non-nuclear states only in the case of invasion or other attack against their territory or against one of their allies. Historically, NATO military strategy, taking into account the numerical superiority of Warsaw Pact conventional forces, assumed that tactical nuclear weapons would have to be used to defeat a Soviet invasion.\nAt the 16th NATO summit in April 1999, Germany proposed that NATO adopt a no-first-use policy, but the proposal was rejected. In 2022, leaders of the five NPT nuclear-weapon states issued a statement on prevention of nuclear war, saying \"We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"\nSoviet Union/Russia.\nIn its final years, the Soviet Union adopted a formal no-first-use policy in 1982 when Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko read out at the United Nations a pledge by General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev not to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike. On April 26, 1983, American child actress Samantha Smith received a mail directly from new leader Andropov, also emphasis that \"Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that never\u2014never\u2014 will it use nuclear weapons first against any country\". However, this pledge was not taken very seriously, and later leaked Soviet Armed Forces documents confirmed that the military had made plans for a pre-emptive nuclear strike and considered launching one during the Able Archer 83 crisis. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation formally reversed this policy in 1993 due to the weakness of the Russian Armed Forces in the post-Soviet era. Russia describes its entire military doctrine as defensive military doctrine.\nWith regard to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons:\nThe military doctrine of 2014 did not depart from this stance. The 2020 Presidential Executive Order on Nuclear Deterrence in Article 4 uses the following wording: \"deterrence of a potential adversary from aggression against the Russian Federation and/or its allies. In the event of a military conflict, this Policy provides for the prevention of an escalation of military actions and their termination on conditions that are acceptable for the Russian Federation and/or its allies.\" This has been interpreted as describing non-nuclear scenarios where Russia might use nuclear weapons to achieve its military goals. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, observers expressed concern that Russia would preemptively use tactical nuclear weapons after President Vladimir Putin announced the mobilization of Russian nuclear forces to \"combat-ready\" status. In December 2022, Putin claimed that Russia would not be the first to use nuclear weapons or the second, and that \"Russian nuclear doctrine is premised on self-defense.\"\nRussia and China maintain a mutual agreement to have a no first use policy which was developed under the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation in 2001. Under the second paragraph of article two, China and Russia agreed that \"The contracting parties reaffirm their commitment that they will not be the first to use nuclear weapons against each other nor target strategic nuclear missiles against each other.\"\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn March 2002, the Secretary of State for Defence Geoff Hoon stated that the UK was prepared to use nuclear weapons against \"rogue states\" such as Ba'athist Iraq if they ever used \"weapons of mass destruction\" against British Armed Forces troops in the field. This policy was restated in February 2003 and again under the Ministry of Defence's Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010. In April 2017 Defence Secretary Michael Fallon confirmed that the UK would use nuclear weapons in a \"pre-emptive initial strike\" in \"the most extreme circumstances\". Fallon stated in a parliamentary answer that the UK has neither a 'first use' or 'no first use' in its nuclear weapon policy so that its adversaries would not know when the UK would launch nuclear strikes.\nUnited States.\nThe United States has refused to adopt a no first use policy and says that it \"reserves the right to use\" nuclear weapons first in the case of conflict. This was partially to provide a nuclear umbrella over its allies in NATO as a deterrent against a conventional Warsaw Pact attack during the Cold War, and NATO continues to oppose a no-first-use policy. Not only did the United States and NATO refuse to adopt a no first use policy, but until 1967 they maintained a nuclear doctrine of \"massive retaliation\" in which nuclear weapons would explicitly be used to defend North America or Western Europe against a conventional attack. Although this strategy was revised, they both reserved the right to use nuclear weapons first under the new doctrine of \"flexible response\".\nReleased on April 6, 2010, the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review reduces the role of U.S. nuclear weapons: \"The fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons, which will continue as long as nuclear weapons exist, is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners.\" The U.S. doctrine also includes the following assurance to other states: \"The United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.\"\nFor states eligible for the assurance, the United States would not use nuclear weapons in response to a chemical or biological attack but states that those responsible for such an attack would be held accountable and would face the prospect of a devastating conventional military response. Even for states that are not eligible for the assurance, the United States would consider the use of nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners. The Nuclear Posture Review also notes, \"It is in the U.S. interest and that of all other nations that the nearly 65-year record of nuclear non-use be extended forever.\"\nThis supersedes the doctrine of the George W. Bush administration set forth in \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" and written under the direction of Air Force General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That now superseded doctrine envisioned commanders requesting presidential approval to use nuclear weapons to preempt an attack by a nation or a terrorist group using weapons of mass destruction. The now superseded doctrine also included the option of using nuclear weapons to destroy known enemy stockpiles of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.\nIn August 2016, President Barack Obama reportedly considered adopting a no first use policy. Obama was persuaded by several Cabinet officials such as Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, and Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz that 'no first use' would rattle U.S. allies and decided not to take up the policy.\nDuring the 2017\u20132018 North Korea crisis, there were efforts to either require congressional approval for a pre-emptive nuclear strike or to ban it altogether and impose an NFU policy. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Bob Corker held its first meeting on the President's authority to use nuclear weapons in 41 years. Since 2017, Ted Lieu, Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren, and Adam Smith all introduced bills to limit the President's ability to order a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Calls to limit the President of the United States' ability to unilaterally launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike increased after the January 6 United States Capitol attack. In 2025, Ted lieu introduced a bill called Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2025 (H.R 669). This bill would restrict the president from launching a first-use nuclear strike and prohibit the use of federal funds without approval from Congress.https:// During the 2020 United States presidential election the eventual victor Joe Biden expressed support for a \"sole purpose\" declaration confirming that the only use of U.S. nuclear weapons would be as a deterrent, although this is distinct from a \"no first use\" declaration identifying that the United States would not unilaterally use them.\nPakistan.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Shamshad Ahmad warned that if Pakistan is ever invaded or attacked, it will use \"any weapon in its arsenal\" to defend itself.\nPakistan refuses to adopt a no first use doctrine and indicates that it would launch nuclear weapons even if the other side did not use such weapons first. Pakistan's asymmetric nuclear posture has significant influence on India's ability to retaliate, as shown in 2001 and 2008 crises, when non-state actors carried out deadly terrorist attacks on India, only to be met with a relatively subdued response from India. A military spokesperson stated that \"Pakistan's threat of nuclear first-use deterred India from seriously considering conventional military strikes.\"\nPakistan's National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz defended the policy of first use. Aziz stated that Pakistan's first use doctrine is entirely deterrent in nature. He explained that it was effective after the 2001 Indian Parliament attack and argued that if Pakistan had a no first use policy, there would have been a major war between the two countries.\nNorth Korea.\nNorth Korea's stated policy position is that nuclear weapons \"will never be abused or used as a means for preemptive strike\", but if there is an \"attempt to have recourse to military force against us\" North Korea may use their \"most powerful offensive strength in advance to punish them\".\nIsrael.\nAlthough Israel does not officially confirm or deny having nuclear weapons, the country is widely believed to be in possession of them. Its continued ambiguous stance puts it in a difficult position since to issue a statement pledging 'no first use' would confirm their possession of nuclear weapons.\nIsrael has said that it \"would not be the first country in the Middle East to formally introduce nuclear weapons into the region\".\nIf Israel's very existence is threatened, some speculate that Israel would use a \"Samson Option\", a \"last resort\" deterrence strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons, should the State of Israel be substantially damaged and/or near destruction. According to Israeli historian Avner Cohen, Israel's policy on nuclear weapons, which was set down in 1966, revolves around four \"red lines\" which could lead to an Israeli nuclear response:\nRationale.\nDebates in the international community on strategic no-first-use of nuclear weapons include legal, ethical, moral and political arguments from intergovernmental organizations, regional blocs, non-governmental organizations and civil society actors as well as countries. In 2023, former IPPNW program director John Loretz wrote: \"With the risk of nuclear war greater than at any time since the Cold War of the 1980s (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 2023)\u2014exacerbated even further by the prolonged war in Ukraine\u2014it comes as no surprise that academics, diplomats, and nuclear strategists are focusing anew on risk reduction proposals. One idea that has been in circulation for some time is a global-no-first-use agreement (GNFU), with unilateral or bilateral NFUs as another option.\"\nAccording to SIPRI's 1984 analysis, first use of nuclear weapons as a right of self-defense in warfare is the \"most controversial\" under international law\u2014a right, in their view, not unlimited. Highlighted also were the views of \"religious, political and military authorities\" who questioned a first-use doctrine. SIPRI concluded that a meaningful no-first-use declaration \"would have to be accompanied\u2014or preferably preceded\u2014by changes in the deployment of both nuclear and conventional forces\".\nSparking debate with their 1982 \"Foreign Affairs\" article, former US national security advisor McGeorge Bundy, US diplomat George F. Kennan, former US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and US lead negotiator for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks Gerard C. Smith challenged the US and the Atlantic Alliance \"to consider the possibilities, the requirements, the difficulties, and the advantages of a policy of no-first-use\" and urged that citizens, too, consider these policy questions. The authors believed that fully exploring NFU as a strategy and policy would reveal greater advantages than costs and \"help the peoples and governments of the Alliance to find the political will to move in this direction\". They called \"both fear and mistrust\u00a0... the most immediate enemies\", arguing that: \"The Soviet government has repeatedly offered to join the West in declaring such a policy, and while such declarations may have only limited reliability, it would be wrong to disregard the real value to both sides of a jointly declared adherence to this policy.\" They also maintained that an NFU posture and policy \"could help to open the path toward serious reduction of nuclear armaments on both sides\", cautioning that \"[a]s long as the weapons themselves exist, the possibility of use will remain.\"\nIn the context of Japan's reliance on US extended deterrence, former Japanese diplomat, director of JIIA's Center for the Promotion of Disarmament and Nonproliferation (2008\u20132014) and commissioner of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission (2014\u20132017) Nobuyasu Abe in 2018 called for re-examining the role of nuclear weapons alongside the non-nuclear military situation in the regional security environment to bridge the \"great divide between idealists and realists\" on adopting a no-first-use policy. He described the political divide in Japan as the skepticism of the Japanese government, the ruling LDP, and \"center/right conservatives\" on the one hand, and the support of the ruling coalition's junior partner Komeito, opposition parties, and \"left/center anti-nuclear idealists\" on the other. In its analysis of South Korea's reliance on US extended deterrence, the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in January 2022 wrote that, were the US to adopt an NFU position, the credibility of its extended deterrence would be diminished. The institute's public attitudes survey findings, published in May 2023, include naming North Korea as the most pressing security concern, followed by China. In its November 2017 policy brief, the European Council on Foreign Relations concluded that North Korea's posture is one of \"nuclear pre-emption\" and its government \"concerned that a first strike could destroy it\"; in contrast, China pursues \"what Beijing calls 'nuclear counterstrike campaigns'\", having declared its NFU doctrine out of the belief \"that neither its government nor its nuclear arsenal could be eliminated in a first strike by a hostile power\". And in the foreground of strained relations between South Korea and Japan, stemming from Japan's 1910\u20131945 occupation of Korea, the June 2023 trilateral meeting of the countries' military chiefs signaled closer nuclear strategy consultation at the urging of their US counterpart.\nNonresident Senior Fellows in Brookings's Center for East Asia Policy Studies Richard C. Bush and Jonathan D. Pollack in 2016 noted that \"non-nuclear states living in the shadow of nuclear-armed adversaries\" are willing to forego developing their own nuclear arms because of US security guarantees, and that adopting an NFU doctrine \"would represent a profound shift\" in those guarantees. Co-founder Keith B. Payne and Research Scholar Michaela Dodge of the National Institute for Public Policy in 2023 noted that for decades \"US allies\" have continued to oppose such a shift, citing a reported survey by the Biden Administration as the most recent indicator, and called for, among other things, \"a more informed public discourse\" by strengthening and expanding participation in strategic deterrence dialogues. The authors also noted that further enlargement of \"underlying 'anti-nuclear' sentiment among some allied governments and/or their publics\u00a0... would essentially eliminate the existing US extended nuclear deterrence policy, particularly (but not only) undercutting NATO allied participation in NATO's nuclear deterrence policy.\" Former chair of the Bundestag Subcommittee on Disarmament and Arms Control Uta Zapf in 2021 characterized NFU policy adoption as \"a first step and a door-opener for an urgently needed dialog on the role of NW in military doctrines and strategies\". Dominic Tierney, political science professor at Swarthmore College and author of \"The Right Way to Lose a War: America in an Age of Unwinnable Conflicts\", in 2016 wrote: \"Champions and critics of no-first-use often cast it as a principled policy and a revolutionary step, for good or for ill. But the idealistic symbolism of no-first-use betrays an underlying reality. Disavowing a first strike is a luxury afforded to the strong.\u00a0... No-first-use is the policy of Goliath, not Gandhi.\"\nFrom the perspective of TPNW supporters, ambassador and director for Disarmament, Arms Control and Non-Proliferation at the Austrian Foreign Ministry Alexander Kmentt in 2020 explained that nuclear risk reduction measures, including de-alerting and de-targeting as well as no-first-use declarations, are \"assessed as having a negative impact on the credibility of nuclear deterrence\" and \"considered only insofar, as they do not impact the nuclear deterrence calculus, which in itself is the origin of nuclear risk\". In her 2018 view of narratives surrounding the TPNW, Heather Williams of King's College London acknowledged the importance of deterrence as a security tool to many states and proposed a \"bridge-building framework\" involving supporters and opponents finding common ground and working together, for example, on nuclear risk reduction.\nBy 2020 new NFU commitments and ideas had stalled, according to Wilfred Wan, UNIDIR researcher on the global nonproliferation regime, because of the deep divide over whether they reduce risk or, for example, increase risk by undermining strategic stability, while John Borrie, lead for UNIDIR's research program on WMDs, noted that even the definition of strategic stability was evolving due to the unpredictability of and increasing strategic concerns. In the same publication, Manpreet Sethi, lead researcher for the Centre for Air Power Studies, recommended that China's and India's unilateral NFU declarations be turned into a bilateral statement as a step towards nuclear risk reduction in South Asia, \"since the risk of not taking any would be quite risky indeed\". The following year, the India-based Observer Research Foundation co-authored an opinion piece with Manpreet Sethi, mentioning the reintroduction of the No First Use Act in both chambers of the US Congress as \"hope rekindled\" and noting that, given the reality of countries unwilling to give up their nuclear weapons, an NFU \"allows nations to maintain a notional sense of security from their nuclear weapons, but significantly reduces possibilities of use\". And in its effort to shape proposals and ideas on nuclear risk reduction \"into a pathway to achieve the treaty-mandated disarmament end state of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\" the Council on Strategic Risks places the universal adoption of NFU at \"the starting gate for any process towards full nuclear disarmament.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was called \"the natural successor to Olivier\" by critic Kenneth Tynan. Burton's perceived failure to live up to those expectations disappointed some critics and colleagues; his heavy drinking added to his reputation as a great performer who had wasted his talent. Nevertheless, he is widely regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation.\nBurton was nominated for an Academy Award seven times but never won. He was nominated for his performances in \"My Cousin Rachel\" (1952), \"The Robe\" (1953), \"Becket\" (1964), \"The Spy Who Came In from the Cold\" (1965), \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966), \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" (1969) and \"Equus\" (1977). He received numerous accolades, including a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Grammy Award. He received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of King Arthur in the Lerner and Loewe musical \"Camelot\" (1960).\nIn the mid-1960s, Burton became a top box-office star. By the late 1960s, he was one of the highest-paid actors in the world, receiving fees of $1 million or more plus a share of the gross receipts. Burton remained closely associated in the public mind with his second wife, Elizabeth Taylor. The couple's turbulent relationship, married twice and divorced twice, was rarely out of the news.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nBurton was born Richard Walter Jenkins Jr. on 10 November 1925 in a house at 2 Dan-y-bont in Pontrhydyfen, Glamorgan, Wales. He was the twelfth of thirteen children born into the Welsh-speaking family of Richard Walter Jenkins Sr. (5 March 1876 \u2013 25 March 1957), and Edith Maude Jenkins (n\u00e9e Thomas; 28 January 1883 \u2013 31 October 1927). Jenkins Sr., called Daddy Ni by the family, was a coal miner, while his mother worked as a barmaid at a pub called the Miners Arms in the village where she met her husband. They married, without approval of her parents, at Neath Register Office on 24 December 1900. According to biographer Melvyn Bragg, Richard is quoted saying that Daddy Ni was a \"twelve-pints-a-day man\" who sometimes went off on drinking and gambling sprees for weeks, and that \"he looked very much like me\". Jenkins Sr. was badly burned in a mining explosion and his father Thomas relied on a wheelchair after a mining accident.\nHe remembered his mother to be \"a very strong woman\" and \"a religious soul with fair hair and a beautiful face\". Richard was barely two years old when his mother died on 31 October, six days after the birth of Graham, the family's thirteenth child. Edith's death was a result of postpartum infections; Richard believed it occurred because of \"hygiene neglect\". According to biographer Michael Munn, Edith \"was fastidiously clean\", but her exposure to the dust from the coal mines resulted in her death. Following Edith's death, Richard's elder sister Cecilia, whom he affectionately addressed as \"Cis\", and her husband Elfed James, also a miner, took him under their care until the age of seventeen. Richard lived with Cis, Elfed and their two daughters, Marian and Rhianon, in their three-bedroom terraced cottage on 73 Caradoc Street, Taibach, a suburban district in Port Talbot, which Bragg describes as \"a tough steel town, English-speaking, grind and grime\".\nRichard remained grateful and loving to Cis throughout his life, later going on to say: \"When my mother died she, my sister, had become my mother, and more mother to me than any mother could ever have been\u00a0... I was immensely proud of her\u00a0... she felt all tragedies except her own\". Daddy Ni would occasionally visit the homes of his grown daughters but was otherwise absent. Another important figure in Richard's early life was Ifor, his brother, 19 years his senior. A miner and rugby union player, Ifor \"ruled the household with the proverbial firm hand\". He was also responsible for nurturing a passion for rugby in young Richard. Although Richard also played cricket, tennis, and table tennis, biographer Bragg notes rugby union football to be his greatest interest. On rugby, Richard said he \"would rather have played for Wales at Cardiff Arms Park than Hamlet at The Old Vic\". The Welsh rugby union centre, Bleddyn Williams, believed Richard \"had distinct possibilities as a player\".\nFrom the age of five to eight, Richard was educated at the Eastern Primary School, and he attended the boys' segment of the same school from eight to twelve years old. He took a scholarship exam for admission into Port Talbot Secondary School in March 1937 and passed it. Biographer Hollis Alpert notes that both Daddy Ni and Ifor considered Richard's education to be \"of paramount importance\" and planned to send him to the University of Oxford. Richard became the first member of his family to go to secondary school. He displayed an excellent speaking and singing voice from childhood, even winning an eisteddfod prize as a boy soprano. Whilst a pupil at Port Talbot Secondary School, Richard also showed immense interest in reading poetry as well as English and Welsh literature. He earned pocket money by running messages, hauling horse manure, and delivering newspapers.\nPhilip Burton years.\nIn 1939, Richard was bolstered by winning a certificate&lt;ref name=\"walesonline/1794198\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"bbc/walesarts/2011/burton_memorabilia\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at Maesteg Town Hall&lt;ref name=\"walesonline/2313666\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; during a local Eisteddfod and wanted to repeat his success. He chose to sing Sir Arthur Sullivan's \"Orpheus with his Lute\" (1866), which biographer Alpert thought \"a difficult composition\". He requested the help of his schoolmaster, Philip Burton, but his voice cracked during their practice sessions. This incident marked the beginning of his association with Philip. Philip later recalled, \"His voice was tough to begin with but with constant practice it became memorably beautiful.\" Richard made his first foray into theatre with a minor role in his school's production of the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw's \"The Apple Cart\". He decided to leave school by the end of 1941 and work as a miner like Elfed. However, he ended up with a job, which he came to dislike intensely, at the local Taibach Co-operative retail store as a draper's assistant in the menswear department, limited at that time by war-time rationing. He also simultaneously considered other professions for his future, including boxing, religious ministry and singing. It was also during this period that Richard took up smoking and drinking despite being underage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne day in 1964 when Richard [Burton] was playing in \"Hamlet\" on Broadway, he and I were interviewed jointly in a private corner of an Eighth Avenue bar and restaurant much frequented by theatre people. We had a live audience of one, Richard's wife, Elizabeth Taylor. One of the questions aimed at me was, \"How did you come to adopt him?\" [...] Richard jumped in with \"He didn't adopt me; I adopted him.\" There was much truth in that. He needed me, and, as I realised later, he set out to get me.\nPhilip Burton in his 1992 autobiography \"Richard &amp; Philip: The Burtons : a Book of Memories\".\nWhen he joined the Port Talbot Squadron 499 of the Air Training Corps section of the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a cadet, he re-encountered Philip, who was the squadron commander. He also joined the Taibach Youth Centre, a youth drama group founded by Meredith Jones and led by Leo Lloyd, a steel worker and avid amateur thespian, who taught him the fundamentals of acting. Richard played the role of an escaped convict in Lloyd's play, \"The Bishop's Candlesticks\", an adaptation of a section of Victor Hugo's \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\". The play did not have any dialogue, but Alpert noted that Richard \"mimed his role\". Philip gave him a part in a radio documentary/adaptation of his play for BBC Radio, \"Youth at the Helm\" (1942). Seeing the talent Richard possessed, both Jones and Philip re-admitted him to school on 5 October 1942. Philip tutored his charge intensely in school subjects and also worked at developing the youth's acting voice, including outdoor voice drills which improved his projection. Richard called the experience \"the most hardworking and painful period\" in his life. Philip called Richard \"my son to all intents and purposes. I was committed to him\", while Burton later wrote of Philip, \"I owe him everything\".\nIn March 1943, aged 17, Richard left his sister's home as a result of his brother-in-law's resentment at supporting his resumed education. He sought the help of Philip Burton, who arranged his transfer to the home of widow Elizabeth 'Ma' Smith where he himself lodged. By the autumn of that year Philip planned to adopt Richard but was not able to do so as he was 20 days too young to be 21 years older than his adoptee, a legal requirement. As a result, with consent of his father, Richard became Philip's legal ward and, just aged 18, changed his surname on 26 November 1943 to \"Burton\", after Philip's own surname, by means of deed poll. It was also in 1943 that Richard qualified for admission into a university after excelling in the School Certificate Examination. Philip requested Richard to study at Exeter College, Oxford, as a part of a six-month scholarship programme offered by the RAF for qualified cadets prior to active service.\nCareer.\n1943\u20131947: Early career and service in the RAF.\nIn 1943, Burton played Professor Henry Higgins in a school production of another Shaw play directed by Philip, \"Pygmalion\". The role won him favourable reviews and caught the attention of the dramatist, Emlyn Williams, who offered Burton a small role as the lead character's elder brother, Glan, in his play \"The Druid's Rest\". The play debuted at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool on 22 November 1943, and later premiered in St Martin's Theatre, London in January 1944. Burton thought the role was \"a nothing part\" and that he \"hardly spoke at all\". He was paid ten pounds a week for playing the role (), which was \"three times what the miners got\". Alpert states that the play garnered mixed critical reviews, but James Redfern of the \"New Statesman\" took notice of Burton's performance and wrote: \"In a wretched part, Richard Burton showed exceptional ability.\" Burton noted that single sentence from Redfern changed his life.\nWhile an undergraduate at Exeter College, University of Oxford, Burton featured as \"the complicated sex-driven puritan\" Angelo in the Oxford University Dramatic Society's 1944 production of William Shakespeare's \"Measure for Measure\". The play was directed by Burton's English literature professor, Nevill Coghill, and was performed at the college in the presence of additional contributors to West End theatre including John Gielgud, Terence Rattigan and Binkie Beaumont. On Burton's performance, fellow actor and friend, Robert Hardy recalled, \"There were moments when he totally commanded the audience by this stillness. And the voice which would sing like a violin and with a bass that could shake the floor.\" Gielgud appreciated Burton's performance and Beaumont, who knew about Burton's work in \"The Druid's Rest\", suggested that he \"look him up\" after completing his service in the RAF if he still wanted to pursue acting as a profession.\nIn late 1944, Burton successfully completed his six-month scholarship at Exeter College, Oxford, and went to the RAF classification examinations held in Torquay to train as a pilot. He was disqualified for pilot training because his eyesight was below par, and was classified as a navigator trainee. He had a short term posting for training at a temporary RCAF training base in Carberry, Manitoba. He served in the RAF for three years, during which time rather than flight crew he was assigned as an Aircraftman 1st Class to perform an administrative role in a Wiltshire-based RAF Hospital.. Burton's habits of drinking and smoking increased during this period; he was involved in a brief casual affair with actress Eleanor Summerfield. Burton was cast in an uncredited and unnamed role of a bombing officer by BBC Third Programme in a 1946 radio adaptation of \"In Parenthesis\", an epic poem of the First World War by David Jones. Burton was discharged from the RAF on 16 December 1947.\n1948\u20131951: Rise through the ranks and film debut.\nIn 1948, Burton moved to London to make contact with H. M. Tennent Ltd., where he again met Beaumont, who put him under a contract of \u00a3500 per year (\u00a310 a week). Daphne Rye, the casting director for H. M. Tennent Ltd., offered Burton rooms on the top floor of her house in Pelham Crescent, London as a place for him to stay. Rye cast Burton in a minor role as a young officer, Mr. Hicks, in \"Castle Anna\" (1948), a drama set in Ireland.\nWhile touring with the cast and crew members of Wynyard Browne's \"Dark Summer\", Burton was called by Emlyn Williams for a screen test for his film, \"The Last Days of Dolwyn\" (1949). Burton performed the screen test for the role of Gareth, which Williams wrote especially for him, and was subsequently selected when Williams sent him a telegram that quoted a line from \"The Corn Is Green\" \u2014 \"You have won the scholarship.\" This led to Burton making his mainstream film debut. Filming took place during the summer and early autumn months of 1948. It was on the sets of this film that Burton was introduced by Williams to Sybil Williams, whom he married on 5 February 1949 at a register office in Kensington. \"The Last Days of Dolwyn\" opened to generally positive critical reviews. Burton was praised for his \"acting fire, manly bearing and good looks\" and film critic Philip French of \"The Guardian\" called it an \"impressive movie debut\". After marrying Sybil, Burton moved into a flat at 6 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead NW3, where he lived from 1949 to 1956.\nPleased with the feedback Burton received for his performance in \"The Last Days of Dolwyn\", the film's co-producer Alexander Korda offered him a contract at a stipend of \u00a3100 a week (), which he signed. The contract allowed Korda to lend Burton to films produced by other companies. Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, Burton acted in small parts in various British films such as \"Now Barabbas\" (1949) with Richard Greene and Kathleen Harrison, \"The Woman with No Name\" (1950) opposite Phyllis Calvert, and \"Waterfront\" (1950) with Harrison. Burton had a bigger part as Robert Hammond, a spy for a newspaper editor in \"Green Grow the Rushes\" (1951) alongside Honor Blackman. His performance in \"Now Barabbas\" received positive feedback from critics. C. A. Lejeune of \"The Observer\" believed Burton had \"all the qualities of a leading man that the British film industry badly needs at this juncture: youth, good looks, a photogenic face, obviously alert intelligence and a trick of getting the maximum effort with the minimum of fuss.\" For \"The Woman With No Name\", a critic from \"The New York Times\" thought Burton \"merely adequate\" in his role of the Norwegian aviator, Nick Chamerd. Biographer Bragg states the reviews for Burton's performance in \"Waterfront\" were \"not bad\", and that \"Green Grow the Rushes\" was a box office bomb.\nRye recommended Richard to director Peter Glenville for the part of Hephaestion in Rattigan's play about Alexander the Great, \"Adventure Story\", in 1949. The play was directed by Glenville and starred the then up-and-coming actor Paul Scofield as the titular character. Glenville, however, rejected him as he felt that Burton was too short compared to Scofield. Rye came to the rescue again by sending Burton to audition for a role in \"The Lady's Not for Burning\", a play by Christopher Fry and directed by Gielgud. The lead roles were played by Gielgud himself, and Pamela Brown, while Burton played a supporting role as Richard alongside the then-relatively unknown actress Claire Bloom. Gielgud was initially uncertain about selecting Burton and asked him to come back the following day to repeat his audition. Burton got the part the second time he auditioned for the role. He was paid \u00a315 a week for the part, which was five more than what Beaumont was paying him. After getting the part, he pushed for a raise in his salary from \u00a310 to \u00a330 a week with Williams' assistance, in addition to the \u00a3100 Korda paid him; Beaumont accepted it after much persuasion. Bloom was impressed with Burton's natural way of acting, noting that \"he just was\" and went further by saying \"He was recognisably a star, a fact he didn't question.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe was marvellous at rehearsals. There was the true theatrical instinct. You only had to indicate\u2014scarcely even that. He would get it and never changed it.\nGielgud on Burton's acting.\nThe play opened at the Globe Theatre in May 1949 and had a successful run in London for a year. Writer and journalist Samantha Ellis of \"The Guardian\", in her overview of the play, thought critics found Burton to be \"most authentic\" for his role. Gielgud took the play to Broadway in the United States, where it opened at the Royale Theatre on 8 November 1950. Theatre critic Brooks Atkinson appreciated the performances and praised the play's \"hard glitter of wit and skepticism\", while describing Fry as precocious with \"a touch of genius\". The play ran on Broadway until 17 March 1951, and received the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for the Best Foreign Play of 1951. Burton received the Theatre World Award for his performance, his first major award.\nBurton went on to feature in two more plays by Fry \u2013 \"The Boy With A Cart\" and \"A Phoenix Too Frequent\". The former opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in February 1950, while the latter premiered at the Dolphin Theatre, Brighton the following month. Gielgud, who also directed \"The Boy With A Cart\", said that Burton's role in the play \"was one of the most beautiful performances\" he had ever seen. During its month-long run, Anthony Quayle, who was looking for a young actor to star as Prince Hal in his adaptations of \"Henry IV, Part I\" and \"Henry IV, Part 2\" as a part of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre season for the Festival of Britain, came to see the play and as soon as he beheld Burton, he realised he had found his man and got his agreement to play the parts. Both plays opened in 1951 at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon to mixed reviews, but Burton received acclaim for his role as Prince Hal, with many critics dubbing him \"the next Laurence Olivier\". Theatre critic Kenneth Tynan said of his performance, \"His playing of Prince Hal turned interested speculation to awe almost as soon as he started to speak; in the first intermission local critics stood agape in the lobbies.\" He was also praised by Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall after both saw the play. Bacall later said of him: \"He was just marvellous [...] Bogie loved him. We all did.\" Burton celebrated his success by buying his first car, a Standard Flying Fourteen, and enjoyed a drink with Bogart at a pub called The Dirty Duck. Philip too was happy with the progress his ward made, and felt \"proud, humble, and awed by god's mysterious ways\".\nBurton went on to perform in \"Henry V\" as the titular character, and played Ferdinand in \"The Tempest\" as a part of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre season as well. Neither role was overwhelmingly received by the critics, with a reviewer saying \"he lacked inches\" as Henry V. Olivier defended Burton by retaliating that he too received the same kind of review by the same critic for the same role. His last play in 1951 was as a musician named Orph\u00e9e in Jean Anouilh's \"Eurydice\" opposite Dorothy McGuire and fellow Welsh actor Hugh Griffith. The play, retitled as \"Legend of Lovers\", opened in the Plymouth Theatre, New York City and ran for only a week, but critics were kind to Burton, with Bob Francis of \"Billboard\" magazine finding him \"excellent as the self-tortured young accordionist\".\n1952\u20131954: Hollywood and The Old Vic.\nBurton began 1952 by starring alongside Noel Willman in the title role of Emmanuel Robl\u00e8s adventure \"Montserrat\", which opened on 8 April at the Lyric Hammersmith. The play only ran for six weeks but Burton once again won praise from critics. According to Bragg, some of the critics who watched the performance considered it to be Burton's \"most convincing role\" till then. Tynan lauded Burton's role of Captain Montserrat, noting that he played it \"with a variousness which is amazing when you consider that it is really little more than a protracted exposition of smouldering dismay\". Burton successfully made the transition to Hollywood on the recommendation of film director George Cukor when he was given the lead role in the Gothic romance film, \"My Cousin Rachel\" (1952) opposite Olivia de Havilland. Darryl F. Zanuck, co-founder of 20th Century Fox, negotiated a deal with Korda to lend Burton to the company for three films as well as pay Burton a total of $150,000 ($50,000 per film). De Havilland did not get along well with Burton during filming, calling him \"a coarse-grained man with a coarse-grained charm and a talent not completely developed, and a coarse-grained behavior [\"sic\"] which makes him not like anyone else\". One of Burton's friends opined it may have been because of Burton's making remarks to her that she did not find in good taste.\nWhile shooting \"My Cousin Rachel\", Burton was offered the role of Mark Antony in \"Julius Caesar\" (1953) by the production company, Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM), but Burton refused it to avoid schedule conflicts. The role subsequently went to Marlon Brando for which he earned a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Based on the 1951 novel of the same name by Daphne du Maurier, \"My Cousin Rachel\" is about a man who suspects his rich cousin was murdered by his wife in order to inherit his wealth, but ends up falling in love with her, despite his suspicions. Upon release, the film was successful at the box office, and Burton's performance received mostly excellent reviews. Bosley Crowther, writing for \"The New York Times\", appreciated Burton's emotional performance, describing it as \"most fetching\"; he called him \"the perfect hero of Miss du Maurier's tale\". The \"Los Angeles Daily News\" reviewer stated \"young Burton registers with an intense performance that stamps him as an actor of great potential\". Conversely, a critic from the \"Los Angeles Examiner\" labelled Burton as \"terribly, terribly tweedy\". The film earned Burton the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year\u00a0\u2013 Actor and his first Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category.\nThe year 1953 marked an important turning point in Burton's career. He arrived in Hollywood at a time when the studio system was struggling. The rise of television was drawing viewers away and the studios looked to new stars and film technologies to tempt viewers back to cinemas. He first appeared in the war film \"The Desert Rats\" with James Mason, playing an English captain in the North African campaign during World War II who takes charge of a hopelessly outnumbered Australian unit against the indomitable German field marshal, Erwin Rommel, who was portrayed by Mason. The film received generally good reviews from critics in London, although they complained the British contribution to the campaign had been underplayed. The critic from \"Variety\" magazine thought Burton was \"excellent\" while \"The New York Times\" reviewer noted his \"electric portrayal of the hero\" made the film look \"more than a plain, cavalier apology\". Burton and Sybil became good friends with Mason and his wife Pamela Mason, and stayed at their residence until Burton returned home to the UK in June 1953 in order to play Prince Hamlet as a part of The Old Vic 1953\u201354 season. This was to be the first time in his career he took up the role.\nBurton's second and final film of the year was in the Biblical epic historical drama, \"The Robe\", notable for being the first-ever motion picture to be made in CinemaScope. He replaced Tyrone Power, who was originally cast in the role of Marcellus Gallio, a noble but decadent Roman military tribune in command of the detachment of Roman soldiers that were involved in crucifying Jesus Christ. Haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion, he is eventually led to his own conversion. Marcellus' Greek slave Demetrius (played by Victor Mature) guides him as a spiritual teacher, and his wife Diana (played by Jean Simmons) follows his lead. The film established a trend for Biblical epics such as \"Ben-Hur\" (1959). Based on Lloyd C. Douglas' 1942 historical novel of the same name, \"The Robe\" was well received at the time of its release, but contemporary reviews have been less favourable. \"Variety\" magazine termed the performances of the lead cast \"effective\" and complemented the fight sequences between Burton and Jeff Morrow. Crowther believed that Burton was \"stalwart, spirited and stern\" as Marcellus. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" called \"The Robe\" \"pious claptrap\". The film was a commercial success, grossing $17\u00a0million against a $5\u00a0million budget, and Burton received his second Best Actor nomination at the 26th Academy Awards.\nBolstered by \"The Robe\"'s box office collections, Zanuck offered Burton a seven-year, seven-picture $1\u00a0million contract (), but he politely turned it down as he was planning to head home to portray \"Hamlet\" at The Old Vic. Zanuck threatened to force Burton into cutting the deal, but the duo managed to come to a compromise when Burton agreed to a less binding contract, also for seven years and seven films at $1\u00a0million, that would begin only after he returned from his stint at The Old Vic's 1953\u201354 season. News of the incident soon spread and his decision to walk out on a million-dollar contract for a stipend of \u00a3150 a week at The Old Vic was met with both appreciation and surprise. Bragg believed Burton defied the studio system with this act when that would have been expected to guarantee unemployment for him. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper considered Burton's success in his first three films in Hollywood to be \"the most exciting success story since Gregory Peck's contracts of ten years back\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Elizabeth Taylor] was so extraordinarily beautiful that I nearly laughed out loud [...] She was undeniably gorgeous [...] She was lavish. She was a dark unyielding \"largesse\". She was, in short, too bloody much, and not only that, she was totally ignoring me.\n\u00a0\u2014 Burton's first impression of Elizabeth Taylor.\nAt a party held at Simmons' residence in Bel Air, Los Angeles to celebrate the success of \"The Robe\", Burton met Elizabeth Taylor for the first time. Taylor, who at the time was married to actor Michael Wilding and was pregnant with their first child, recalled her first impression of Burton being \"rather full of himself. I seem to remember that he never stopped talking, and I had given him the cold fish eye.\" Hamlet was a challenge that both terrified and attracted him, as it was a role many of his peers in the British theatre had undertaken, including Gielgud and Olivier. He shared his anxiety with de Havilland whilst coming to terms with her. Bogart too, didn't make it easy for him when he retorted: \"I never knew a man who played \"Hamlet\" who didn't die broke.\"\nNotwithstanding, Burton began his thirty-nine-week stint at The Old Vic by rehearsing for \"Hamlet\" in July 1953, with Philip providing expert coaching on how to make Hamlet's character match Burton's dynamic acting style. Burton reunited with Bloom, who played Ophelia. \"Hamlet\" opened at the Assembly Hall in Edinburgh, Scotland in September 1953 as part of The Old Vic season during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The play and Burton's Hamlet were, on the whole, well received, with critics describing his interpretation of the character as \"moody, virile and baleful\" and that he had \"dash, attack and verve\". Burton's Hamlet was quite popular with the young audience, who came to watch the play in numbers as they were quite taken with the aggressiveness with which he portrayed the role. Burton also received appreciation from Winston Churchill. Gielgud was not too happy with Burton's Hamlet and asked him while both were backstage: \"Shall I go ahead and wait until you're better?... ah, I mean ready?\" Burton picked up the hint and infused some of Gielgud's traits to his own in later performances as Hamlet. A greater success followed in the form of the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in \"Coriolanus\". At first, Burton refused to play Coriolanus as he didn't like the character's initial disdain for the poor and the downtrodden. Michael Benthall, who was renowned for his association with Tyrone Guthrie in a 1944 production of \"Hamlet\", sought Philip's help to entice Burton into accepting it. Philip convinced Burton by making him realise that it was Coriolanus' \"lack of ambivalence\" which made him an admirable character. Burton received even better reviews for Coriolanus than Hamlet. Hardy thought Burton's Hamlet was \"too strong\" but that \"His Coriolanus is quite easily the best I've ever seen.\" Olivier too agreed it was the greatest Coriolanus he had ever seen till then.\nBurton's other roles for the season were Sir Toby Belch in \"Twelfth Night\", Caliban in \"The Tempest\" and Philip of Cognac in \"King John\". All five of Burton's plays were directed by Benthall; three of those plays featured Bloom. While Belch was considered \"disappointing\", owing to Burton's not putting on the proper make-up for the part, his reviews for Caliban and Philip of Cognac were positive. Alpert believed Burton's presence made the 1953\u201354 season of The Old Vic a commercial success. Burton was an ardent admirer of poet Dylan Thomas since his boyhood days. On the poet's death on 9 November 1953, he wrote an essay about him and took the time to make a 1954 BBC Radio adaptation of one of his final works, \"Under Milk Wood\", in which Burton performed the role of First Voice in an all-Welsh cast. The entire cast of the radio adaptation, including Burton, played their roles free of charge. Burton reprised his role in the play's 1972 film adaptation with Taylor. Burton was also involved in narrating Lindsay Anderson's short documentary film about The Royal School for the Deaf in Margate, \"Thursday's Children\" (1954).\n1955\u20131959: Setback in films and on-stage fame.\nAfter The Old Vic season ended, Burton's contract with Fox required him to do three more films. The first was \"Prince of Players\" (1955), where he was cast as the 19th-century Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth, who was John Wilkes Booth's brother. Maggie McNamara played Edwin's wife, Mary Devlin Booth. Philip thought the script was \"a disgrace\" to Burton's name. The film's director Philip Dunne observed, \"He hadn't mastered yet the tricks of the great movie stars, such as Gary Cooper, who knew them all. The personal magnetism Richard had on the sound stage didn't come through the camera.\" This was one aspect that troubled Richard throughout his career on celluloid. The film flopped at the box office and has since been described as \"the first flop in CinemaScope\". Crowther, however, lauded Burton's scenes where he performed Shakespeare plays such as \"Richard III\".\nShortly after the release of \"Prince of Players\", Burton met director Robert Rossen, who was well known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, \"All the King's Men\" (1949). Rossen planned to cast Burton in \"Alexander the Great\" (1956) as the eponymous character. Burton accepted Rossen's offer after the director reassured him he had been studying the Macedonian king for two years to make sure the film was historically accurate. Burton was loaned by Fox to the film's production company United Artists, which paid him a fee of $100,000 (). \"Alexander the Great\" was made mostly in Spain during February 1955 and July 1955 on a budget of $6\u00a0million. The film reunited Burton with Bloom and it was also the first film he made with her. Bloom played the role of Barsine, the daughter of Artabazos II of Phrygia, and one of Alexander's three wives. Fredric March, Danielle Darrieux, Stanley Baker, Michael Hordern and William Squire were respectively cast as Philip II of Macedon, Olympias, Attalus, Demosthenes and Aeschines.\nAfter the completion of \"Alexander the Great\", Burton had high hopes for a favourable reception of the \"intelligent epic\", and went back to complete his next assignment for Fox, Jean Negulesco's \"The Rains of Ranchipur\" (1955). In this remake of Fox's own 1939 film \"The Rains Came\", Burton played a Hindu doctor, Rama Safti, who falls in love with Lady Edwina Esketh (Lana Turner), an invitee of the Maharani of the fictional town of Ranchipur. Burton faced the same troubles with playing character roles as before with Belch. \"The Rains of Ranchipur\" released on 16 December 1955, three months before \"Alexander the Great\" rolled out on 28 March 1956. Contrary to Burton's expectations, both the films were critical and commercial failures, and he rued his decision to act in them. \"Time\" magazine critic derided \"The Rains of Ranchipur\" and even went as far as to say Richard was hardly noticeable in the film. A. H. Weiler of \"The New York Times\", however, called Burton's rendering of Alexander \"serious and impassioned\".\nBurton returned to The Old Vic to perform \"Henry V\" for a second time. The Benthall-directed production opened in December 1955 to glowing reviews and was a much-needed triumph for Burton. Tynan made it official by famously saying Burton was now \"the next successor to Olivier\". The reviewer from \"The Times\" began by pointing out the deficiencies in Burton's previous rendition of the character in 1951 before stating \"Mr. Burton's progress as an actor is such that already he is able to make good all the lacks of a few short years ago ... what was greatly metallic has been transformed into a steely strength which becomes the martial ring and hard brilliance of the patriotic verse. There now appears a romantic sense of a high kingly mission and the clear cognisance of the capacity to fulfil it ... the whole performance\u00a0\u2014 a mostly satisfying one\u00a0\u2014 is firmly under the control of the imagination\".\nIn January 1956, the \"London Evening Standard\" honoured Burton by presenting to him its Theatre Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Henry V. His success in and as Henry V led him to be called the \"Welsh Wizard\". \"Henry V\" was followed by Benthall's adaptation of \"Othello\" in February 1956, where he alternated on successive openings between the roles of Othello and Iago with John Neville. As Othello, Burton received both praise for his dynamism and criticism with being less poetical with his dialogues, while he was acclaimed as Iago.\nBurton's stay at The Old Vic was cut short when he was approached by the Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini for Fox's \"Sea Wife\" (1957), a drama set in World War II about a nun and three men marooned on an island after the ship they travel on is torpedoed by a U-boat. Joan Collins, who played the nun, was his co-star. Burton's role was that of an RAF officer who develops romantic feelings for the nun. Rossellini was informed by Zanuck not to have any kissing scenes between Burton and Collins, which Rossellini found unnatural; this led to him walking out of the film and being replaced by Bob McNaught, one of the executive producers. According to Collins, Burton had a \"take-the-money-and-run attitude\" toward the film. \"Sea Wife\" was not a successful venture, with biographer Munn observing that his salary was the only positive feature that came from the film. Philip saw it and said he was \"ashamed\" that it added another insult to injury in Burton's career.\nAfter \"Sea Wife\", Burton next appeared as the British Army Captain Jim Leith in Nicholas Ray's \"Bitter Victory\" (1957). Burton admired Ray's \"Rebel Without A Cause\" (1955) and was excited about working with him, but unfortunately despite positive feedback, \"Bitter Victory\" tanked as well. By mid-1957, Burton had no further offers in his kitty. He could not return to the UK because of his self-imposed exile from taxation, and his fortunes in film were dwindling. It was then that film producer and screenwriter Milton Sperling offered Burton to star alongside Helen Hayes and Susan Strasberg in Patricia Moyes' adaptation of Jean Anouilh's play, \"Time Remembered\" (\"L\u00e9ocadia\" in the original French version). Sensing an opportunity for a career resurgence, Burton readily agreed to do the role of Prince Albert, who falls in love with a milliner named Amanda (Strasberg). It was on 10 September 1957, a day before he left for New York, that Sybil gave birth to their first child, Kate Burton. \"Time Remembered\" was well received on its opening nights at Broadway's Morosco Theatre and also at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. The play went on to have a good run of 248 performances for six months. Burton received his first Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination while Hayes won her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her role as Burton's mother, The Duchess of Pont-Au-Bronc.\nIn 1958, Burton appeared with Yvonne Furneaux in DuPont Show of the Month's 90-minute television adaptation of Emily Bront\u00eb's classic novel \"Wuthering Heights\" as Heathcliff. The film, directed by Daniel Petrie, aired on 9 May 1958 on CBS with Burton garnering plaudits from both the critics and Philip, who thought he was \"magnificent\" in it. Burton next featured as Jimmy Porter, \"an angry young man\" role, in the film version of John Osborne's play \"Look Back in Anger\" (1959), a gritty drama about middle-class life in the British Midlands, directed by Tony Richardson, again with Claire Bloom as co-star. Biographer Bragg observed that \"Look Back in Anger\" \"had defined a generation, provided a watershed in Britain's view of itself and brought [Osborne] into the public prints as a controversial, dangerous figure\". Burton was able to identify himself with Porter, finding it \"fascinating to find a man who came presumably from my sort of class, who actually could talk the way I would like to talk\". The film, and Burton's performance, received mixed reviews upon release. Biographer Alpert noted that though reviews in the UK were favourable, those in the United States were more negative. Crowther wrote of Burton: \"His tirades are eloquent but tiring, his breast beatings are dramatic but dull and his occasional lapses into sadness are pathetic but endurable.\" Geoff Andrew of \"Time Out\" magazine felt Burton was too old for the part, and the \"Variety\" reviewer thought \"the role gives him little opportunity for variety\".\nContemporary reviews of the film have been better and it has a rating of 89% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. \"Look Back in Anger\" is now considered one of the defining films of the British New Wave cinema, a movement from the late 1950s to the late 1960s in which working-class characters became the focus of the film and conflict of social classes a central theme. Jimmy Porter is also considered one of Burton's best on-screen roles; he was nominated in the Best Actor categories at the BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards but lost to Peter Sellers for \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959) and Anthony Franciosa for \"Career\" (1959) respectively. Though it didn't do well commercially, Burton was proud of the effort and wrote to Philip, \"I promise you that there isn't a shred of self-pity in my performance. I am for the first time ever looking forward to seeing a film in which I play.\" While filming \"Look Back in Anger\", Burton did another play for BBC Radio, participating in two versions, one in Welsh and another in English, of Welsh poet Saunders Lewis' \"Brad\", which was about the 20 July plot. Burton voiced one of the conspirators, Caesar von Hofacker.\n1960\u20131969: Broadway, \"Hamlet\" and films with Elizabeth Taylor.\nIn 1960, Burton appeared in two films for Warner Bros., neither of which were successful: \"The Bramble Bush\" which reunited him with his \"Wuthering Heights\" director Petrie, and Vincent Sherman's adaptation of Edna Ferber's \"Ice Palace\". Burton called the latter a \"piece of shit\". He received a fee of $125,000 for both films. Burton's next appearance was as the stammering secularist, George Holyoake in BBC's documentary-style television adaptation of John Osborne's \"A Subject of Scandal and Concern\". According to Osborne's biographer Luc Gilleman, the film garnered little attention. Burton returned to the United States for the filming of John Frankenheimer's television adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's \"The Fifth Column\". He also provided narration for 26 episodes of \"The Valiant Years\", an American Broadcasting Company (ABC) series based on Winston Churchill's memoirs.\nBurton made a triumphant return to the stage with Moss Hart's 1960 Broadway production of \"Camelot\" as King Arthur. The play, written by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, had Julie Andrews fresh from her triumph in \"My Fair Lady\" playing Guinevere, and Robert Goulet as Lancelot completing the love triangle. Roddy McDowall played the villainous Mordred. Hart first came up with the proposal to Burton after learning from Lerner about his ability to sing. Burton consulted Olivier on whether he should take the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a week. Olivier pointed out this salary was good and that he should accept the offer. The production was troubled, with both Loewe and Hart falling ill and the pressure was building, owing to great expectations and huge advance sales. The show's running time was nearly five hours. Burton's intense preparation and competitive desire to succeed served him well. He immediately drafted Philip, who revised the musical's script and cut its running time to three hours while also incorporating three new songs. Burton was generous and supportive to everyone throughout the production and coached the understudies himself. According to Lerner, \"he kept the boat from rocking, and \"Camelot\" might never have reached New York if it hadn't been for him\". Burton's reviews were excellent, with the critic from \"Time\" magazine observing that Richard \"gives Arthur the skillful and vastly appealing performance that might be expected from one of England's finest young actors\". Broadway theatre reviewer Walter Kerr noted Richard's syllables, \"sing, the account of his wrestling the stone from the sword becomes a bravura passage of house-hushing brilliance\" and complemented his duets with Andrews, finding Burton's rendition to possess \"a sly and fretful and mocking accent to take care of the humor [\"sic\"] without destroying the man\".\nHowever, on the whole, the play initially received mixed reviews on its opening at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway and was slow to earn money. Advance sales managed to keep \"Camelot\" running for three months until a twenty-minute extract was broadcast on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" which helped \"Camelot\" achieve great success, and an unprecedented three-year run overall from 1960 to 1963. Its success led to Burton being called \"The King of Broadway\", and he went on to receive the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. The original soundtrack of the musical topped the \"Billboard\" charts throughout 1961 after its release at the end of 1960. John F. Kennedy, who was then the President of the United States, reportedly enjoyed the play and invited Burton to the White House for a visit. In 1962, Burton appeared as Flying Officer David Campbell, an RAF fighter pilot in \"The Longest Day\", which included a large ensemble cast featuring: McDowall, George Segal, Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Mel Ferrer, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger and Sean Connery. The same year he provided narration for the Jack Howells documentary \"Dylan Thomas\". The short won the Best Documentary Short Subject at the 35th Academy Awards ceremony.\nAfter performing \"Camelot\" for six months, in July 1961, Burton met producer Walter Wanger who asked him to replace Stephen Boyd as Mark Antony in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus \"Cleopatra\". Burton was paid $250,000 for four months work in the film (). The gigantic scale of the film's troubled production, Taylor's bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, Burton's off-screen relationship with the actress, (which he gave the sardonic nickname \"Le Scandale\") all generated enormous publicity; \"Life\" magazine proclaimed it the \"Most Talked About Movie Ever Made\". Fox's future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40\u00a0million. During filming, Burton met and fell in love with Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to Eddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their first meeting on the set while posing for their publicity photographs, Burton said, \"Has anyone ever told you that you're a very pretty girl?\" Taylor later recalled, \"I said to myself, \"Oy gevalt\", here's the great lover, the great wit, the great intellectual of Wales, and he comes out with a line like that.\" Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that Burton could not stand Taylor at first, calling her \"Miss Tits\" and opined to Mankiewicz, \"I expect she shaves\"; he saw her simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. All that changed when, in their first scene together, Burton was shaky and forgot his lines, and she soothed and helped him; it was at this instance, according to Taylor, that she fell for him. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Fisher and Sybil were unable to bear it. While Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first to C\u00e9ligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by Burton's affair with Taylor, cabled him: \"Make up your mind, dear heart. Do you want to be a great actor or a household word?\". Burton replied \"Both\".\n\"Cleopatra\" was finally released on 11 June 1963 with a run time of 243 minutes, to polarising reviews. The \"Time\" magazine critic found the film \"riddled with flaws, [lacking] style both in image and in action\", and wrote Burton \"staggers around looking ghastly and spouting irrelevance\". In a contradictory review, Crowther termed the film \"generally brilliant, moving, and satisfying\" and thought Burton was \"exciting as the arrogant Antony\". Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" commented positively on the chemistry between Burton and Taylor, describing it as \"entrancing in the movie's drama as it was in life\". \"Cleopatra\" grossed over $26 million (), becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1963. It was not enough to prevent Fox from entering bankruptcy. The studio sued Burton and Taylor for allegedly damaging the film's prospects at the box office with their behaviour, but it proved unsuccessful. \"Cleopatra\" was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design and Best Visual Effects.\nThe film marked the beginning of a series of collaborations with Taylor, in addition to making Burton one of the Top 10 box office draws until 1967. Burton played her tycoon husband Paul Andros in Anthony Asquith's \"The V.I.P.s\" (1963), an ensemble cast film described by Alpert as a \"kind of \"Grand Hotel\" story\" that was set in the VIP lounge of London Heathrow Airport; it proved to be a box-office hit despite mixed reviews. It was after \"The V.I.P.s\" that Burton became considerably more selective about his roles; he credited Taylor for this as he simply acted in films \"to get rich\" and she \"made me see what kind of rubbish I was doing\". Burton divorced Sybil in April 1963 after completing \"The V.I.P.s\" while Taylor was granted divorce from Fisher on 6 March 1964. Taylor then took a two-year hiatus from films until her next venture with Burton, \"The Sandpiper\" (1965). The supercouple, dubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the press, continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88\u00a0million over the next decade and spending $65\u00a0million. Regarding their earnings, in a 1976 interview with Lester David and Jhan Robbins of \"The Ledger\", Burton stated that \"they say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations\" and that the couple \"often outspent\" the Greek business tycoon Aristotle Onassis.\nIn 1964, Burton portrayed Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, in the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play \"Becket\". Both Alpert and historian Alex von Tunzelmann noted Burton gave an effective, restrained performance, contrasting with co-actor and friend Peter O'Toole's manic portrayal of Henry. Burton asked the film's director, Peter Glenville, not to oust him from the project like he had done for \"Adventure Story\" before accepting the role of Becket. Writing for \"The Christian Science Monitor\", Peter Rainer labelled Burton as \"extraordinary\". Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" appreciated Burton's on-screen chemistry with O'Toole and thought his portrayal of Becket served as \"a reminder of how fine an actor Burton was\". The film received twelve Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for both Burton and O'Toole; they lost to Harrison for \"My Fair Lady\" (1964). Burton and O'Toole also received nominations for Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Motion Picture Drama at the 22nd Golden Globe Awards, with O'Toole emerging victorious. Burton's triumph at the box office continued with his next appearance as the defrocked clergyman Dr. T. Lawrence Shannon in Tennessee Williams' \"The Night of the Iguana\" (1964) directed by John Huston; the film was also critically well received. Alpert believed Burton's success was due to how well he varied his acting with the three female characters, each of whom he tries to seduce differently: Ava Gardner (the randy hotel owner), Sue Lyon (the nubile American tourist), and Deborah Kerr (the poor, repressed artist). The success of \"Becket\" and \"The Night of the Iguana\" led \"Time\" magazine to term him \"the new Mr. Box Office\".\nDuring the production of \"Becket\", Burton went to watch Gielgud perform in the 1963 stage adaptation of Thornton Wilder's 1948 novel, \"The Ides of March\". There he was confronted by Gielgud who asked what Burton planned to do as a part of the celebration of Shakespeare's quatercentenary. Burton told him he was approached by theatrical producer Alexander H. Cohen to do \"Hamlet\" in New York City. Burton had accepted Cohen's offer under the condition that Gielgud would direct it, which he conveyed to Gielgud. Gielgud agreed and soon production began in January 1964 after Burton had completed his work in \"Becket\" and \"The Night of the Iguana\". Taking into account Burton's dislike for wearing period clothing, as well as fellow actor Harley Granville-Barker's notion that the play was best approached as a \"permanent rehearsal\", Gielgud decided for \"Hamlet\" to be performed in a 'rehearsal' version with an incomplete set with the actors performing wearing their own clothes. Unaccustomed to this freedom, the cast found it hard to select the appropriate clothes and wore different attire day by day. After the first performance in Toronto, Gielgud decreed that the actors must wear capes as he felt it \"lacked colour\". In addition to being the play's director, Gielgud appeared as the Ghost of Hamlet's father. According to Gielgud's biographer Jonathan Croall, Burton's basic reading of Hamlet was \"a much more vigorous, extrovert\" version of Gielgud's own performance in 1936. Burton varied his interpretations of the character in later performances; he even tried a homosexual Hamlet.\nWhen the play debuted at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City, Burton garnered good reviews for his portrayal of a \"bold and virile\" Hamlet. Howard Taubman of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a performance of electrical power and sweeping virility\", noting that he had never known or seen \"a Hamlet of such tempestuous manliness\". A critic from \"Time\" magazine said that Burton \"put his passion into Hamlet's language rather than the character. His acting is a technician's marvel. His voice has gem-cutting precision.\" Walter Kerr felt that though Burton carried \"a certain lack of feeling\" in his performance, he appreciated Burton's \"reverberating\" vocal projections. The opening night party was a lavish affair, attended by six hundred celebrities. The play ran for 137 performances, beating the previous record set by Gielgud himself in 1936. The most successful aspect of the production, apart from Burton's performance, was generally considered to be Hume Cronyn's performance as Polonius, winning him the only Tony Award he would ever receive in a competitive category. Burton himself was nominated for his second Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play but lost to Alec Guinness for his portrayal of the poet Dylan Thomas. The performance was immortalised in a film that was created by recording three live performances on camera from 30 June 1964 to 1 July 1964 using a process called Electronovision; it played in US theatres for a week in 1964. The play was also the subject of books written by cast members William Redfield and Richard L. Sterne.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe had a theory that Hamlet could be played a hundred ways, and he tested every one of them. Within one scene, you might get Heathcliff, Sir Toby Belch, and Peck's Bad Boy.\nAlfred Drake, who played King Claudius, on how Burton made variations to the character of Hamlet.\nBurton helped Taylor make her stage debut in \"A Poetry Reading\", a recitation of poems by the couple as well as anecdotes and quotes from the plays Burton had participated in thus far. The idea was conceived by Burton as a benefit performance for his mentor Philip, whose conservatory, the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, had fallen short of funds. \"A Poetry Reading\" opened at the Lunt-Fontanne on 21 June 1964 to a packed house; the couple received a standing ovation at the end of their performance. Burton remarked on Taylor's performance, \"I didn't know she was going to be this good.\"\nAfter \"Hamlet\" came to a close in August 1964, Burton and Taylor continued making films together. The first film after their marriage, \"The Sandpiper\", was poorly received but still became a commercially successful venture. According to Bragg, the films they made during the mid-1960s contained a lot of innuendos that referred directly to their private lives. Burton went on to star opposite Claire Bloom and Oskar Werner in \"The Spy Who Came In from the Cold\" (1965), a Cold War espionage story about a British Intelligence agent, Alec Leamas (Burton), who is sent to East Germany on a mission to find and expose a mole working within his organisation for an East German Intelligence officer, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck). Martin Ritt, the film's director and producer, wanted Burton's character to exhibit more anonymity, which meant no display of eloquent speeches or intense emotional moments. Bragg believed this decision worried Burton, as he had generated his reputation as an actor with those exact traits, and wondered how the film's would turn out. Ritt, a non-drinker, was displeased with Burton's drinking habits as he felt it \"lacked a certain discipline\" and expected the same level of commitment from him as everyone else during filming. In spite of their differences, Alpert notes that the film transpired well. Based on the 1963 novel of the same name by John le Carr\u00e9, \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\" garnered positive reviews, with Fernando F. Croce of \"Slant Magazine\" describing Burton's performance as more of \"tragic patsy than swashbuckler\" and believed his scenes with Werner \"have sharp doses of suspicion, cynicism and sadness\". Dave Kehr of the \"Chicago Reader\" called the film \"Grim, monotonous, and rather facile\", he found Burton's role had \"some honest poignancy\". \"Variety\" thought Burton fitted \"neatly into the role of the apparently burned out British agent\". Burton also made a brief appearance the same year in Clive Donner's comedy \"What's New Pussycat?\" as a man who meets the womaniser Michael James (O'Toole) in a bar.\nIn 1966, Burton and Taylor enjoyed their greatest on-screen success in Mike Nichols's film version of Edward Albee's black comedy play \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", in which a bitter erudite couple trade vicious barbs in front of their guests, Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis). Burton wanted Taylor for the character of Martha \"to stop everyone else from playing it\". He didn't want anyone else to do it as he thought it could be for Elizabeth what \"Hamlet\" was for him. Burton was not the first choice for the role of George. Jack Lemmon was offered the role initially, but when he turned it down, Warner Bros. president Jack L. Warner agreed on Burton and paid him $750,000. Nichols was hired to helm the project at Taylor's request, despite having never directed a film. Albee preferred Bette Davis and James Mason for Martha and George respectively, fearing that the Burtons' strong screen presence would dominate the film. Instead, it proved to be what Alpert described as \"the summit of both Richard's and Elizabeth's careers\".\nThe film's script, adapted from Albee's play by Ernest Lehman, broke new ground for its raw language and harsh depiction of marriage. So immersed had the Burtons become in the roles of George and Martha over the months of shooting that, after it was wrapped up, he and Taylor found it difficult not to be George and Martha, \"I feel rather lost.\" Later the couple would state that the film took its toll on their relationship, and that Taylor was \"tired of playing Martha\" in real life. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" garnered critical acclaim, with film critic Stanley Kauffmann of \"The New York Times\" calling it \"one of the most scathingly honest American films ever made\". Kaufman observed Burton to be \"utterly convincing as a man with a great lake of nausea in him, on which he sails with regret and compulsive amusement\", and Taylor \"does the best work of her career, sustained and urgent\". In her review for \"The New York Daily News\", Kate Cameron thought Taylor \"nothing less than brilliant as the shrewish, slovenly. blasphemous, frustrated, slightly wacky, alcoholic wife\" while noting that the film gave Burton \"a chance to display his disciplined art in the role of the victim of a wife's vituperative tongue\". However, Andrew Sarris of \"The Village Voice\" criticised Taylor, believing her performance \"lack[ed] genuine warmth\" but his review of Burton was more favourable, noting that he gave \"a performance of electrifying charm\". Although all four actors received Academy Award nominations for their roles in the film, which received a total of thirteen nominations, only Taylor and Dennis went on to win. Both Burton and Taylor won their first BAFTA Awards for Best British Actor and Best British Actress respectively; the former also for his role in \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\".\nBurton and Taylor next performed a 1966 Oxford Playhouse adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\"; the couple did the play to benefit the Oxford University Dramatic Society and as a token of Burton's gratitude to Nevill Coghill. Burton starred as the titular character, Doctor Faustus while Taylor played her first stage role as Helen of Troy, a non-speaking part. The play received negative reviews but Burton's and Taylor's performances were reviewed constructively. Irving Wardle of \"The Times\" called it \"University drama at its worst\" while the American newspaper columnist John Crosby, in his review for \"The Observer\", lauded Burton's speech where he asks God to be merciful, stating that: \"It takes a great actor to deliver that speech without wringing a strangled sob of laughter out of one. But Burton did it.\" The play nevertheless made $22,000, which Coghill was happy with. \"Doctor Faustus\" was adapted for the screen the following year by both Burton and Coghill, with Burton making his directorial debut. He also co-produced the film with Taylor and Coghill; it was critically panned and was a box office failure. The couple's next collaboration was Franco Zeffirelli's lively version of Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1967). The film was a challenge for Burton, who had to chase Taylor on rooftops, noting that he was \"permitted to do extreme physical things that wouldn't have been allowed with any other actress\". Zeffirelli recalled that Taylor, who had no prior experience performing in a Shakespeare play, \"gave the more interesting performance because she invented the part from scratch\". Of Burton, the director felt he was, to an extent, \"affected by his knowledge of the classics\". \"The Taming of the Shrew\" also became a notable critical and commercial success. He had another quick collaboration with Zeffirelli narrating the documentary, \"\", which was about the 1966 flood of the Arno that devastated the city of Florence, Italy; the film raised $20\u00a0million for the flood relief efforts. By the end of 1967, the combined box office gross of films Burton and Taylor had acted in had reached $200\u00a0million. According to biographers John Cottrell and Fergus Cashin, when Burton and Taylor contemplated taking a three-month break from acting, Hollywood \"almost had a nervous breakdown\" as nearly half the U.S. cinema industry's income for films in theatrical distribution came from pictures starring one or both of them. Later collaborations from the Burtons like \"The Comedians\" (1967), which was based on Graham Greene's 1966 novel of the same name, and the Tennessee Williams adaptation \"Boom!\" (1968) were critical and commercial failures.\nIn 1968, Burton enjoyed a commercial blockbuster with Clint Eastwood in the World War II action film \"Where Eagles Dare\"; he received a $1\u00a0million fee plus a share of the film's box office gross. According to his daughter Kate Burton, \"He did that one for us kids, because we kept asking him, 'Can you do a fun movie that we can go see?'\" Eastwood thought the script \"terrible\" and was \"all exposition and complications\". He asked the film's producer Elliott Kastner and its screenwriter Alistair MacLean to be given less dialogue, later remarking \"I just stood around firing my machine gun while Burton handled the dialogue.\" Burton enjoyed working with Eastwood and said of the picture that he \"did all the talking and [Eastwood] did all the killing\". Burton's last film of the decade, \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" (1969) for which he was paid $1.25\u00a0million, () was commercially successful but garnered mixed opinions from reviewers. Noted British film critic Tom Milne of \"Time Out\" magazine believed that Burton \"plays throughout on a monotonous note of bluff ferocity\". Conversely, Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" appreciated Burton's portrayal of the English monarch, noting that he \"is in excellent form and voice\u2014funny, loutish and sometimes wise\". \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" received ten nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards, including one for Burton's performance as Henry VIII of England, which many thought to be largely the result of an expensive advertising campaign by Universal Studios. The same year, \"Staircase\" in which he and his \"Cleopatra\" co-star Rex Harrison appeared as a bickering homosexual couple, received negative reviews and was unsuccessful.\n1970\u20131984: Later career and final years.\nAppointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1970 Birthday Honours, he received the honour at Buckingham Palace on his 45th birthday; Taylor and Cis attended the ceremony. He attributed not being knighted to changing his residence from London to C\u00e9ligny to escape taxes. From the 1970s, after his completion of \"Anne of the Thousand Days\", Burton began to work in mediocre films, which hurt his career. This was partly due to the Burtons' extravagant spending, his increasing addiction to alcohol, and his claim that he could not \"find any worthy material that is pertinent to our times\". He recognised his financial need to work, and understood in the New Hollywood era of cinema, neither he nor Taylor would be paid as well as at the height of their stardom. Some of the films he made during this period include: \"Bluebeard\" (1972), \"Hammersmith Is Out\" (1972), \"Battle of Sutjeska\" (1973), \"The Klansman\" (1974), and \"\" (1977). His last film with Taylor was the two-part melodrama \"Divorce His, Divorce Hers\" (1973). He did enjoy one major critical success in the 1970s with the film version of his stage hit \"Equus\", winning the Golden Globe Award as well as garnering an Academy Award nomination. Public sentiment towards his perennial frustration at not winning an Oscar made many pundits consider him the favourite to finally win the award, but he lost to Richard Dreyfuss in \"The Goodbye Girl\".\nIn 1976, Burton received a Grammy Award in the category of Best Recording for Children for his narration of \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. His narration of \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds\" became such a necessary part of the concept album that a hologram of Burton was used to narrate the live stage show (touring in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010) of the musical. In 2011, however, Liam Neeson was cast in the part for a \"New Generation\" re-recording, and replaced Burton as the hologram character in the stage show.\nBurton had an international box-office hit with \"The Wild Geese\" (1978), an adventure tale about mercenaries in Africa. The film was a success in Europe but had only limited distribution in the United States owing to the collapse of the studio that distributed it. He returned to films with \"The Medusa Touch\" (1978), \"Circle of Two\" (1980), and the title role in \"Wagner\" (1983). His last film performance as O'Brien in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1984) was critically acclaimed though he was not the first choice for the role. According to the film's director, Michael Radford, Paul Scofield was originally contracted to play the part, but had to withdraw due to a broken leg; Sean Connery, Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger were all approached before Burton was cast. He had \"heard stories\" about Burton's heavy drinking, which had concerned the producers.\nBurton's last acting appearance was in the miniseries \"Ellis Island\", which aired posthumously on CBS in November 1984. At the time of his death, he was preparing to film \"Wild Geese II\", the sequel to \"The Wild Geese\", which was eventually released in 1985. Burton was to reprise the role of Colonel Faulkner, while Laurence Olivier was cast as Rudolf Hess. After his death, Burton was replaced by Edward Fox, and the character changed to Faulkner's younger brother.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and relationships.\nBurton was married five times, twice consecutively to Taylor.\nFrom 1949 until 1963, he was married to Sybil Williams, with whom he had two daughters, Kate (born 1957) and Jessica Burton (born 1959). During the marriage Burton had a long affair with actress Claire Bloom. Burton told biographer Michael Munn \"'I only ever loved two women before Elizabeth,' Sybil was one, Claire Bloom the other.\"\nBurton's marriages to Taylor lasted from 15 March 1964 to 26 June 1974 and from 10 October 1975 to 29 July 1976. Their first wedding was at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Montreal. Of their marriage, Taylor proclaimed, \"I'm so happy you can't believe it. This marriage will last forever.\" Their second wedding took place 16 months after their divorce, in Chobe National Park in Botswana. Taylor and Eddie Fisher adopted a daughter from Germany, Maria McKeown (born 1961), who was re-adopted by Burton after he and Taylor married. Burton also re-adopted Taylor and producer Mike Todd's daughter, Elizabeth Frances \"Liza\" Todd (born 1957), who had been first adopted by Fisher.\nThe relationship Burton and Taylor portrayed in the film \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" was popularly likened to their real-life marriage. Burton disagreed with others about Taylor's famed beauty, saying that calling her \"the most beautiful woman in the world is absolute nonsense. She has wonderful eyes, but she has a double chin and an overdeveloped chest, and she's rather short in the leg.\" In August 1976, a month after his second divorce from Taylor, Burton married model Suzy Miller, the former wife of Formula 1 Champion James Hunt; the marriage ended in divorce in 1982. From 1983 until his death in 1984, Burton was married to a freelance production assistant Sally Hay.\nIn 1974, between his divorce from and remarriage to Taylor, he was briefly engaged to Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia.\nIn 1957, Burton had earned a total of \u00a382,000 from \"Prince of Players\", \"The Rains of Ranchipur\" and \"Alexander the Great\", but only managed to keep \u00a36,000 for personal expenses due to taxation imposed by the then-ruling Conservative government. As a result, he consulted his lawyer, Aaron Frosch, who suggested he move to Switzerland where the tax payment was comparatively less. Burton acceded to Frosch's suggestion and moved with Sybil in January 1957 to C\u00e9ligny, Switzerland, where he purchased a villa. In response to criticism from the British government, Burton remarked: \"I believe that everyone should pay them \u2014 except actors.\" Burton lived there until his death. In 1968, Burton's elder brother, Ifor, slipped and fell, breaking his neck, after a lengthy drinking session with Burton in C\u00e9ligny. The injury left him paralysed from the neck down. His younger brother Graham Jenkins speculated that guilt over this may have caused Burton to start drinking very heavily, particularly after Ifor died in 1972.\nIn a February 1975 interview with his friend David Lewin, he said he \"tried\" homosexuality. He also suggested that perhaps all actors were latent homosexuals, and \"we cover it up with drink\". In 2000, Ellis Amburn's biography of Elizabeth Taylor suggested that Burton had an affair with Olivier and tried to seduce Eddie Fisher, although this was strongly denied by Burton's younger brother Graham Jenkins.\nBurton admired and was inspired by the actor and dramatist Emlyn Williams. He employed his son, Brook Williams, as his personal assistant and adviser, and he was given small roles in some of the films in which Burton starred.\nPersonal views.\nPolitically, Burton was a lifelong socialist, although he was never as heavily involved in politics as his close friend Stanley Baker. He admired Democratic senator Robert F. Kennedy and once got into a sonnet-quoting contest with him.\nIn 1972, Burton played Leon Trotsky in \"The Assassination of Trotsky.\" The next year, he agreed to play Josip Broz Tito in a film biography, since he admired the Yugoslav leader. While filming in Yugoslavia he publicly proclaimed that he was a communist, saying he felt no contradiction between earning vast sums of money for films and holding left-wing views since \"unlike capitalists, I don't exploit other people\".\nIn November 1974, Burton was banned permanently from BBC productions for writing two newspaper articles questioning the sanity of Winston Churchill and others in power during World War II. Burton reported hating them \"virulently\" for the alleged promise to wipe out all Japanese people on the planet. The publication of these articles coincided with what would have been the 100th year since Churchill's birth and came after Burton had played him in a favourable light in \"A Walk with Destiny\".\nOn his religious views, Burton was an atheist, stating: \"I wish I could believe in a God of some kind but I simply cannot.\"\nHealth problems.\nBurton was a heavy smoker. In a December 1977 interview with Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Burton said he was smoking 60\u2013100 cigarettes per day. According to his younger brother, as stated in Graham Jenkins's 1988 book \"Richard Burton: My Brother\", he smoked at least 100 cigarettes a day. After his father died from a cerebral haemorrhage in March 1957, Burton declined to attend his funeral. Burton was also an alcoholic most of his adult life. According to biographer Robert Sellers, \"At the height of his boozing in the mid-70s he was knocking back three to four bottles of hard liquor a day.\"\nAfter nearly drinking himself to death during the shooting of \"The Klansman\" (1974), Burton dried out at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Burton was allegedly inebriated while making the movie, and many of his scenes had to be filmed with him sitting or lying down due to his inability to stand upright. In some scenes, he appears to slur his words or speak incoherently. Burton later said that he could not remember making the film. Co-star O. J. Simpson said \"There would be times when he couldn't move\".\nAccording to his diaries, Burton used Antabuse to try to stop his excessive consumption of alcohol, which he blamed for wrecking his marriage to Taylor. Burton himself said of the time leading up to his near loss of life, \"I was fairly sloshed for five years. I was up there with John Barrymore and Robert Newton. The ghosts of them were looking over my shoulder.\" He said that he turned to the bottle for solace \"to burn up the flatness, the stale, empty, dull deadness that one feels when one goes offstage\". The 1988 biography by Melvyn Bragg provides a detailed description of the many health issues that plagued Burton throughout his life. In his youth, Burton had been known for being exceptionally strong and athletic.\nBy the age of 41, he had declined so far in health that by his own admission, his arms were thin and weak. He suffered from bursitis, possibly aggravated by faulty treatment, arthritis, dermatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and kidney disease, as well as developing, by his mid-forties, a pronounced limp. How much of this was due to his intake of alcohol is impossible to ascertain, according to Bragg, because of Burton's reluctance to be treated for alcoholism. In 1974, Burton spent six weeks in a clinic to recuperate from a period during which he had drunk three bottles of vodka a day. Health issues continued to plague him until his death.\nDeclining health and death.\nBurton died from intracerebral haemorrhage on 5 August 1984 at his home in C\u00e9ligny, Switzerland, at the age of 58. Although his death was sudden, his health had been declining for several years, and he suffered from constant and severe neck pain. As early as March 1970, he had been warned that his liver was enlarged, and he was diagnosed with cirrhosis and kidney disease in April 1981.\nBurton was buried at the Old Cemetery (\"Vieux Cimeti\u00e8re\") of C\u00e9ligny with a copy of Dylan Thomas's poems.\nBurton left an estate worth US$4.58 million (). The bulk of his estate consisted of real estate, investments in three countries and works of art. Most of his estate was bequeathed to his widow.\nActing credits and accolades.\nBurton received numerous accolades including a British Academy Film Award, two Golden Globe Awards, a Grammy Award, and two Tony Awards (including a Special Tony Award) as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award. For his contributions to cinema, Burton was inducted posthumously into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013 with a motion pictures star located at 6336 Hollywood Boulevard. For his contributions to theatre, Burton was inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame.\nDespite seven Academy Award nominations Burton failed to win an Oscar.\nOver his distinguished career he has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following performances:\nOn 10 November 2025, the centenary of his birth, blue plaques were unveiled at Burton's birth place at Pontrhydyfen, and at the Port Talbot house where he lived with his legal ward, Philip Burton.\nSociety and culture.\nBurton is portrayed by Dominic West, opposite Helena Bonham Carter, in 2013's \"Burton &amp; Taylor\". In 2025, \"Mr Burton\", a British biographical drama film starring Harry Lawtey as a young Richard Burton and Toby Jones as Philip Burton, was released.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nWorks by Burton\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary works\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary works\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His career began with a string of top 10 hits in the 1960s and he has since toured regularly, with appearances in Las Vegas from 1967 to 2011. His voice has been described by AllMusic as a \"full-throated, robust baritone\".\nJones's performing range has included pop, R&amp;B, show tunes, country, dance, soul, and gospel. In 2008, the \"New York Times\" called him a \"musical shapeshifter [who could] slide from soulful rasp to pop croon, with a voice as husky as it was pretty\". He has sold over 100\u00a0million records, with 36 Top 40 hits in the UK and 19 in the US, including \"It's Not Unusual\", \"What's New Pussycat?\", the theme song for the James Bond film \"Thunderball\" (1965), \"Green, Green Grass of Home\", \"Delilah\", \"She's a Lady\", \"Sex Bomb\", and a cover of Prince's \"Kiss\".\nJones has also occasionally dabbled in acting, first making his debut in the lead role of the television film \"Pleasure Cove\" (1979). He also appeared as himself in Tim Burton's film \"Mars Attacks!\" (1996). In 1970, he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy nomination for hosting the television series \"This Is Tom Jones\". In 2012, he played his first dramatic acting role in an episode of \"Playhouse Presents\". He received a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966, an MTV Video Music Award in 1989, and two Brit Awards: Best British Male in 2000 and Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2003. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 for services to music. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 2010s due to his role as a coach on the talent show \"The Voice UK\" (2012\u20132015, 2017\u2013present).\nEarly life.\nThomas John Woodward was born at 57 Kingsland Terrace in Treforest in Wales on 7 June 1940, the son of Freda Jones (1914\u20132003) and coal miner Thomas Woodward (1910\u20131981). He is primarily of English descent. His maternal grandfather was Welsh, and his maternal grandmother was born in Wales to English parents from Somerset and Wiltshire. His English paternal grandfather was from Gloucestershire, and his English paternal grandmother was from Wiltshire. \nHe attended Wood Road Infants School, Wood Road Junior School, and Pontypridd Central Secondary Modern School. He began singing at an early age; he would regularly sing at family gatherings, weddings, and in his school choir. He did not like school or sports, but gained confidence through his singing talent. At the age of 12, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Many years later, he said, \"I spent two years in bed recovering. It was the worst time of my life.\" During this time, he could do little else but listen to music and draw.\nCareer.\nRise to fame.\nJones's voice has been described as a \"full-throated, robust baritone\". According to Jones himself, his young voice was a tenor voice. He said: \"What you lose on the top end, you gain on the bottom end. I used to be able to hit a top C when I was young now it's a B flat.\" He became the frontman in 1963 for Tommy Scott and the Senators, a Welsh beat group. They soon gained a local following and reputation in South Wales. In 1964, the group recorded several solo tracks with producer Joe Meek, who took them to various record labels, but they had little success. Later that year, Decca producer Peter Sullivan saw Tommy Scott and the Senators performing in a club and directed them to manager Phil Solomon, but the partnership was short-lived.\nThe group continued playing gigs around South Wales. Gordon Mills met Jones, became his manager, and introduced him to London, where Mills worked in music. Mills renamed him \"Tom Jones\", to exploit the popularity of the Academy Award-winning 1963 film.\nEventually, Mills got Jones a recording contract with Decca. His first single, \"Chills and Fever\", was released in late 1964. It did not chart, but the follow-up, \"It's Not Unusual\", became an international hit after offshore pirate radio station Radio Caroline promoted it. The following year was the most prominent of Jones's career, making him one of the most popular vocalists of the British Invasion. In early 1965, \"It's Not Unusual\" reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and the top ten in the United States. During 1965, Mills secured a number of film themes for Jones to record, including the James Bond film \"Thunderball\", and \"What's New Pussycat?\" (written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David). Jones was sceptical about the latter song when first approached about it. He said when it was offered to him, he felt it was \"sort of a backhanded compliment: 'I've got to have you, but this is the song.'\" Jones said it took convincing from Bacharach to perform \"What's New Pussycat?\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"When I first heard it I thought, 'Christ! What the bloody hell do they want me to sing this for?' But Burt Bacharach explained, 'I want the big voice to sing this bloody crazy song.' And you put it on, it's a classic.\"\nJones was awarded the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966. During a filming break at Paramount Studios (1965) in Hollywood, Jones met Elvis Presley for the first time; he recalls Presley singing, \"With These Hands\" as he walked towards him from the film set. The two men became good friends.\nIn 1966, Jones's popularity began to slip somewhat, causing Mills to reshape the singer's image into that of a crooner. Jones also began to sing broader material. Jones soon topped UK charts and reached the top 40 in US charts. Over the next few years he scored a string of hits on both sides of the Atlantic, including \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\", \"I'm Coming Home\", and \"Delilah\", each of which reached No. 2 in the UK chart.\n1967 to 1987.\nIn 1967, Jones performed in Las Vegas for the first time, at the Flamingo. His performances and style of dress became part of his stage act, and increasingly featured his open, half-unbuttoned shirts and tight trousers. He soon chose to record less and focus on club performances. Jones played in Las Vegas at least one week each year until 2011.\nJones had an internationally successful television variety show titled \"This Is Tom Jones\" from 1969 to 1971. The Associated Television-produced show was worth a reported US$ to Jones over three years. It was broadcast by ITV in the UK and by the American Broadcasting Company in the US. As a result of the show, Jones was nominated in 1970 for a \"best actor\" Golden Globe. From 1980 to 1981, he had a second television variety show, \"Tom Jones\", which was produced in Vancouver, Canada, and lasted 24 episodes. \nBoth television shows were the subject of litigation with the original licence holder C/F International. As of \u00a02004[ [update]], C/F International was a secured judgment creditor of Classic World Productions and its principal, Darryl Payne, for approximately US$, and was the principal secured creditor at the time of the subsequent bankruptcy filing by the company. C/F International's action against Classic World Productions and owner Darryl Payne was based on unpaid royalty payments from \"This Is Tom Jones\" and related recordings. \"This Is Tom Jones\" is sold on DVD by Time Life rather than by Classic World Productions or C/F International.\nC/F International's rights to later Tom Jones material were also disputed. In March 2007, Tom Jones and Tom Jones Enterprises sued C/F International to stop the company from licensing sound recordings made from the 1981 \"Tom Jones\" series. It was contended that any rights that C/F International had to license the \"Tom Jones\" show did not include the right to make and license separate recordings of the performances on the show, and that any rights that C/F International had in the \"Tom Jones\" show no longer existed because of numerous breaches of contract. Examples of contentious CDs are \"Live on the Tom Jones Show\", released in 2006, and \"Greatest Hits Live\", originally issued by C/F International in 1981 and later licensed to and issued by Prism Leisure Corporation as \"30 Greatest Hits \u2013 Live in Concert\".\nOn 26 April 1970, CBS released the Raquel Welch television special \"Raquel!\" directed by David Winters, in it Jones is among guests.\nIn the 1970s, Jones toured with the female singing groups Quiet Elegance and the Blossoms as his backing groups.

He did, however, have a big hit in 1976 with \"Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow\", which went to No. 1 on the US country chart, No. 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 40 on the UK Singles Chart.\nIn 1972, he co-starred with Jennifer O'Neill in David Winters's television special \"The Special London Bridge Special\". Jones explained that he accepted to do the special because it allowed him to continue doing television without having the confinement of a series.\nIn 1976, Jones was set to make his film debut in the film \"Yockowald\", in which he was to play a CIA assassin. The film was shelved after the production ran out of money three weeks into filming.\nIn 1979, Jones made his acting debut in \"Pleasure Cove\", an ABC television film which was a pilot for a potential television series but was not picked up. In the film, he played a suave conman named Raymond Gordon staying at the holiday island resort of the title. His co-stars in the film included Constance Forslund, Tanya Roberts and David Hasselhoff. In 1984, he guest-starred in an episode of the television series \"Fantasy Island\" as an accountant who fantasises about living life as Dick Turpin.\nIn the early 1980s, Jones started to record country music. From 1980 to 1986, he had nine songs in the US country top 40, yet failed to crack the top 100 in the UK or the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Jones's manager Gordon Mills died of cancer on 29 July 1986, and Jones's son Mark became his manager.\nIn 1987, Tom Jones re-entered the singles chart with \"A Boy from Nowhere\", which went to No. 2 in the UK.

After receiving a knighthood, Jones stated: \"When you first come into show business and get a hit record, it is the start of something. As time goes by it just gets better. This is the best thing I have had. It's a wonderful feeling, a heady feeling.\"\n2007\u20132009.\nOn 1 July 2007, Jones was among the artists who performed at Wembley Stadium at the Concert for Diana, joined on stage by guitarist Joe Perry of Aerosmith and soul singer Joss Stone. In addition to performing some of his own songs, the group covered the Arctic Monkeys song \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\".

Jones, who was still performing over 200 dates a year as he approached his seventieth birthday, set out on a world tour to promote the album. \"The fire is still in me. Not to be an oldie, but a goodie. I want to be a contender\", Jones said. Also in 2008, Jones was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. On 16 November 2008, he was invited to perform on BBC's \"Strictly Come Dancing\"; he performed the debut single from \"24 Hours\", \"If He Should Ever Leave You\", which was named the ninth-best song of 2008 by Spinner.

The record, which was inspired by the song's having featured in the BBC's hit sitcom \"Gavin &amp; Stacey\", was released in aid of Comic Relief and reached No. 1 in March 2009. This was his first UK chart topper since \"Green, Green Grass of Home\" in 1967, setting a new record of 42 years between two UK number ones; this record would be surpassed by Kate Bush when \"Running Up That Hill\" topped the charts in 2022, a 44-year gap between number ones.\n2010\u20132020.\nJones's album \"Praise &amp; Blame\" was released on 26 July 2010.

The single was first made available through independent record shops in 7\" vinyl format on 5 March. An exclusive three-coloured vinyl was also sold at only one shop \u2013 Spillers Records in Cardiff. The shop, which Jones visited as a boy, was founded in 1894 and is listed in \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's oldest record shop.\nJones experienced a resurgence in notability in the 2010s due to his coaching role on the BBC talent show \"The Voice UK\" from 2012 (with the exception of 2016). In March 2012 he became a coach on the show and was joined by will.i.am, Jessie J and Danny O'Donoghue. He mentored Leanne Mitchell to win the first series. Jones returned to coach in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In August 2015, it was announced that Jones's contract with the show would not be renewed and that he would be replaced by Boy George. Jones criticised BBC executives for \"sub-standard behaviour\", having not consulted with him and informing him only 24 hours before the official announcement.\nIn May 2012 Jones released the album \"Spirit in the Room\" on Island Records/Universal Music.

After the performance, Jones explained the meaning behind the song: \"My wife, she was dying of lung cancer [...] I was always able to fix stuff, I was always able to do things, if she needed me for anything I was always there, but she said 'you can't crumble with me, don't fall with me now, you've done everything you can, you must carry on and do what you do' [...] When I heard it I thought, 'My God it's like this was written for this situation'. It's a lovely song.\" Within 24 hours, the song had peaked on the UK iTunes chart at number 1. The song debuted at number 3 on the UK Official Singles Downloads Chart on 9 September 2022.\nDuring the series 11 blind auditions of Jones\u2019 tenth year on The Voice UK, the very first contestant was Anthonia Edwards, who received a 4-chair turn from the coaches. Edwards would choose Jones as her coach. On 29 October 2022, Edwards was announced as the winner of series 11, making Jones the first coach to mentor 3 winners on The Voice UK.\nPersonal life.\nJones was married to his school girlfriend, Melinda Rose \"Linda\" Trenchard, from 2 March 1957 until her death from cancer on 10 April 2016. They were married at the age of 16 when she became pregnant; their son, Mark, was born shortly after the wedding. To support his young family, Jones worked in construction and at a glove factory before finding success as a singer. He stayed married to Trenchard despite his many well-publicised infidelities. After his wife's death, Jones sold the family's Los Angeles mansion and its contents, apart from treasured photos, and moved into an apartment in London, which was his wife's dying wish.\nJones has stated that he had sex with up to 250 groupies a year at his peak of fame. He had affairs with famous American women such as singer Mary Wilson, presenter Charlotte Laws, and former Miss World Marjorie Wallace, engaged at the time to American race car driver Peter Revson. Actress Cassandra Peterson, better known as her character Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, revealed in 2008 that she lost her virginity to Jones, calling the experience \"painful and horrible\" and stating that she required stitches afterwards. \nOne of his affairs resulted in a son. While on tour in the United States in October 1987, he had a brief relationship with model Katherine Berkery, who later discovered she was pregnant. After a legal battle that included DNA testing, a U.S. court ruled in 1989 that Jones was the boy's father. He denied the court's findings until 2008, when he admitted they were true, but expressed no interest in meeting his son, singer Jonathan Berkery.\nFollowing the UK's 1974 election of a Labour government, Jones became a tax exile to avoid a 98% income tax. In 1976, he purchased the mansion at 363 Copa De Oro Road in the East Gate Bel Air area of Los Angeles from Dean Martin for $500,000. He sold it to Nicolas Cage in 1998 for a reported $6.4\u00a0million.\nJones met his idol Elvis Presley in 1965 at the Paramount film stage, when Elvis was filming \"Paradise, Hawaiian Style\". They became good friends, spending more time together in Las Vegas singing and carousing until the early hours at Presley's private suite. The friendship endured until Presley's death in 1977. One year after the death of Jones' wife, rumours began that he had started dating Presley's wife Priscilla. In 2021, he said they had known each other since the 1960s and simply enjoyed spending time together. People had thought they were dating because they had been seen together dining and at Jeff Franklin's house.\nIn 2015, Jones' autobiography \"Over the Top and Back\" was published by Michael Joseph. Reviewing the book in the \"Daily Express\", Clair Woodward said, \"In the tradition of so many autobiographies these days, Tom Jones's doesn't tell you what you really want to hear. [...] What you are left with is a riotously enjoyable story of Jones 'The Voice' which nicely doubles as the story of British pop and light entertainment from the Sixties onwards.\" In 2021, Jones revealed that he uses inversion therapy to stay in good health.\nArtistry and influence.\nJones' singing style developed out of the sound of American soul music. His early influences included blues, R&amp;B, and rock and roll singers such as Little Richard, Solomon Burke, Jackie Wilson, Brook Benton, Elvis Presley (his idol and later close friend), and Jerry Lee Lewis.\nSpace and Cerys Matthews released \"The Ballad of Tom Jones\", a song about a fighting couple who are calmed down by listening to Jones's music on the radio. The song reached No. 4 in the UK in 1998.\nA musical, \"Tom: A Story of Tom Jones\", based on his life and recordings, produced by Theatr na n\u00d3g, opened at the Wales Millennium Centre in March 2016. Another jukebox musical, \"What's New Pussycat?\" based on Henry Fielding's 1749 novel \"The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling\" (set in the 1960s) which uses Jones' music opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in October 2021 to critical acclaim. It is written by Joe DiPietro, directed by Luke Sheppard, and choreographed by Arlene Phillips.\nSimilar to Presley with his impersonators, Jones has his own imitators around the world.\nIn the 2006 film \"Flushed Away\", the main character, Roddy, is mistaken for Jones by another character while Roddy performs \"She's a Lady\". Jones' song, \"What's New Pussycat?\", is played during the ending credits.\nIn the video game \"Team Fortress 2\", the Scout character is a collector of Tom Jones merchandise, and Jones is depicted being murdered by the Soldier character in the tie-in comics. The Spy character later uses his shape-shifting ability to convince the Scout that Jones is his father. Jones is also depicted using the phrase \"What's new pussycat?\" several times.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLive albums\nBox sets\nCompositions.\nJones wrote or co-wrote the following songs: \"And I Tell the Sea\", \"Looking Out My Window\", \"Feel the Rain\" from the 2002 \"Mr. Jones\" album, \"Jezebel\", \"The Letter\", \"Younger Days\", \"Tom Jones International\", \"Holiday\", \"The Road\", \"24 Hours\", \"Seasons\", \"We Got Love\", \"Seen That Face\", \"Give a Little Love\", \"If He Should Ever Leave You\", \"Whatever it Takes\", and \"Traveling Shoes\" from the 2012 album \"Spirit in the Room\".\nAccolades.\nAmadeus Austrian Music Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45969", "revid": "50266015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45969", "title": "Joan Crawford", "text": "American actress (c. 1900s \u2013 1977)\nJoan Crawford (born Lucille Fay LeSueur; March 23, 190?\u00a0\u2013 May 10, 1977) was an American actress. She started her career as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway. Crawford was signed to a motion-picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925. Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her roles, Crawford launched a publicity campaign and built an image as a nationally known flapper by the end of the 1920s. By the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo. Crawford often played hardworking, young women who find romance and financial success. These \"rags-to-riches\" stories were well received by Depression-era audiences and were popular with women. Crawford became one of Hollywood's most prominent movie stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money. By the end of the 1930s, she was labeled \"box office poison\".\nAfter an absence of nearly two years from the screen, Crawford staged a comeback by starring in \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1955, she became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company, through her marriage to company president Alfred Steele. After his death in 1959, Crawford was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors but was forced to retire in 1973. She continued acting in film and television regularly through the 1960s, when her performances became fewer; after the release of the horror film \"Trog\" in 1970, Crawford retired from the screen. She withdrew from public life and became increasingly reclusive until her death in 1977.\nCrawford married four times. Her first three marriages ended in divorce; the last ended with the death of husband Al Steele. She adopted five children, one of whom was reclaimed by his birth mother. Crawford's relationships with her two older children, Christina and Christopher, were acrimonious. Crawford disinherited the two and, after Crawford's death, Christina published the tell-all memoir \"Mommie Dearest\".\nEarly life.\nBorn Lucille Fay LeSueur, of French-Huguenot, English, Dutch, and Irish ancestry in San Antonio, Texas, she was the youngest of two children of Thomas E. LeSueur (born January 2, 1867, in Tennessee; died January 1, 1938), a construction worker, and Anna Bell Johnson (died August 15, 1958), later known as Anna Cassin. Crawford's mother was likely under 20 when her first two children were born. Crawford had one half-sister, Daisy McConnell (1901\u20131904), and one brother, Hal LeSueur.\nThomas LeSueur abandoned the family when Lucille was ten months old, eventually resettling in Abilene, Texas, reportedly working in construction. In 1909, while working as a sales associate at Simpson's, Crawford's mother married Henry J. Cassin (1868\u20131922) in Fort Worth, who is incorrectly listed in the 1910 census as her second husband rather than her third. They lived in Lawton, Oklahoma, where Cassin ran the Ramsey Opera House, booking such diverse and noted performers as Anna Pavlova and Eva Tanguay. As a child, Crawford, who preferred the nickname \"Billie\", enjoyed watching vaudeville acts perform on the stage of her stepfather's theater. At that time, Crawford was reportedly unaware that Cassin, whom she called \"Daddy\", was not her biological father; her brother later told her the truth.\nFrom childhood, Crawford's ambition was to be a dancer. One day, in an attempt to escape piano lessons, she leapt from the front porch of her home and cut her foot severely on a broken milk bottle. She had three surgeries to repair the damage, and for 18 months was unable to attend elementary school or continue dancing lessons.\nIn June 1917, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, after Cassin was accused of embezzlement; although acquitted, he was blacklisted in Lawton. After the move, Cassin, a Catholic, placed Crawford at St. Agnes Academy in Kansas City. When her mother and stepfather separated, she remained at school as a work student, where she spent far more time working, primarily cooking and cleaning, than studying. She later attended Rockingham Academy, also as a working student. While there, she began dating, and had her first serious relationship: a trumpet player, Ray Sterling, who reportedly inspired her to challenge herself academically.\nIn 1922, she registered at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, giving her year of birth as 1906. She attended Stephens for a few months and then withdrew after she realized that she was not ready for college. Due to her family's instability, Crawford's schooling never surpassed the primary level.\nCareer.\n1924\u20131925: Early career.\nUnder the name Lucille LeSueur, Crawford began dancing in the choruses of traveling revues, and was spotted dancing in Detroit by producer Jacob J. Shubert. Shubert put her in the chorus line for his 1924 show, \"Innocent Eyes\", at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in New York City. While appearing in \"Innocent Eyes\", Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924, and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.\nCrawford wanted additional work, and approached Loews Theaters publicist Nils Granlund. Granlund secured a position for her with singer Harry Richman's act and arranged for her to do a screen test, which he sent to producer Harry Rapf in Hollywood. Rapf notified Granlund on December 24, 1924, that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) had offered Crawford a contract at $75 a week. Granlund immediately wired Crawford, who had returned to her mother's home in Kansas City, with the news; she borrowed $400 for travel expenses.\nCredited as Lucille LeSueur, her first film was \"Lady of the Night\" in 1925, as the body double for Norma Shearer, MGM's most popular female star. She also appeared in \"The Circle\" and \"Pretty Ladies\" (both 1925), starring comedian ZaSu Pitts. This was soon followed by equally small and unbilled roles in two other 1925 silent films: \"The Only Thing\", and \"The Merry Widow\".\nMGM publicity head Pete Smith recognized her ability to become a major star, but felt her name sounded fake; he told studio head Louis B. Mayer that her last name, LeSueur, reminded him of a sewer. Smith organized a contest called \"Name the Star\" in \"Movie Weekly\" to allow readers to select her new stage name. The initial choice was \"Joan Arden\", but after another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternative surname \"Crawford\" became the choice. She later said that she wanted her first name to be pronounced Jo-Anne, and that she hated the name Crawford because it sounded like \"crawfish\", but also admitted she \"liked the security\" that went with the name.\n1925\u20131928: Self-promotion and early successes.\nGrowing increasingly frustrated over the size and quality of the parts she was given, Crawford embarked on a campaign of self-promotion. As MGM screenwriter Frederica Sagor Maas recalled, \"No one decided to make Joan Crawford a star. Joan Crawford became a star because Joan Crawford decided to become a star.\" She began attending dances in the afternoons and evenings at hotels around Hollywood and at dance venues on the beach piers, where she often won dance competitions with her performances of the Charleston and the Black Bottom.\nHer strategy worked and MGM cast her in the film where she first made an impression on audiences, Edmund Goulding's \"Sally, Irene and Mary\" (1925). From the beginning of her career, Crawford considered Norma Shearer \u2013 the studio's most-popular actress \u2013 her professional nemesis. Shearer was married to MGM Head of Production Irving Thalberg; hence, she had the first choice of scripts, and had more control than other stars in what films she would and would not make. Crawford was quoted to have said: \"How can I compete with Norma? She sleeps with the boss!\"\nCrawford was named one of 1926's WAMPAS Baby Stars, along with Mary Astor, Dolores del R\u00edo, Janet Gaynor, and Fay Wray, among others. That same year, she co-starred in \"Paris\" with Charles Ray. Within a few years, she became the romantic lead to many of MGM's top male stars, including Ram\u00f3n Novarro, John Gilbert, William Haines, and Tim McCoy.\nCrawford appeared as a skimpily clad young carnival assistant in \"The Unknown\" (1927), starring Lon Chaney, Sr. as a carnival knife thrower with no arms who hopes to marry her. She stated that she learned more about acting from watching Chaney work than from anyone else in her career. \"It was then\", she said, \"I became aware for the first time of the difference between standing in front of a camera, and acting.\" Also in 1927, she appeared alongside her close friend, William Haines, in \"Spring Fever\", which was the first of three movies the duo made together.\nIn 1928, Crawford starred opposite Ram\u00f3n Novarro in \"Across to Singapore\", but it was her role as Diana Medford in \"Our Dancing Daughters\" (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity who rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, and Hollywood's foremost flapper. A stream of hits followed \"Our Dancing Daughters\", including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald wrote of Crawford:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Joan Crawford is doubtless the best example of the flapper, the girl you see in smart night clubs, gowned to the apex of sophistication, toying iced glasses with a remote, faintly bitter expression, dancing deliciously, laughing a great deal, with wide, hurt eyes. Young things with a talent for living.\nCrawford described her glamorous onscreen persona more succinctly, saying, \"If you want to see the girl next door, go next door.\"\n1929\u20131936: Transition to sound and continued success.\nAfter the release of \"The Jazz Singer\" in 1927\u2014the first feature-length film with some audible dialogue\u2014sound films became all the rage. The transition from silent to sound caused panic for many, if not all, involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents, or simply because of their refusal to make the transition to talkies. Many studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last of the major studios to switch over to sound. \"The Hollywood Revue of 1929\" was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song \"Got a Feeling for You\" during the film's first act. She studied singing with Estelle Liebling, the voice teacher of Beverly Sills, in the 1920s and 1930s.\nTo rid herself of her Southwestern accent, Crawford tirelessly practiced diction and elocution. She said:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If I were to speak lines, it would be a good idea, I thought, to read aloud to myself, listen carefully to my voice quality and enunciation, and try to learn in that manner. I would lock myself in my room and read newspapers, magazines and books aloud. At my elbow, I kept a dictionary. When I came to a word I did not know how to pronounce, I looked it up and repeated it correctly fifteen times.\nCrawford made a successful transition to talkies with her first starring role in the all-talking feature-length film \"Untamed\" (1929), co-starring Robert Montgomery. Despite the success of the film at the box office, it received mixed reviews from critics, who noted that while Crawford seemed nervous at making the transition to sound, she had become one of the most popular actresses in the world.\" Montana Moon\" (1930), an uneasy mix of Western clich\u00e9s and music, teamed her with John Mack Brown and Ricardo Cortez. Although the film had problems with censors, it was a major success at the time of its release. \"Our Blushing Brides\" (1930), the final installment in the \"Our Dancing Daughters\" franchise co-starring Robert Armstrong and Anita Page, where Crawford \"carries the burden of dramatics in this photoplay and comes off splendidly and intelligently.\"\nHer next movie, \"Paid\" (1930), paired her with Robert Armstrong, and was another success. During the early sound era, MGM began to place Crawford in more sophisticated roles, rather than continuing to promote her flapper-inspired persona of the silent era. In 1931, MGM cast Crawford in five films. Three of them teamed her opposite Clark Gable, the studio's soon-to-be biggest male star and \"King of Hollywood\". \"Dance, Fools, Dance\", released in February 1931, was the first pairing of Crawford and Gable. Their second movie together, \"Laughing Sinners\", released in May 1931, was directed by Harry Beaumont and also co-starred Neil Hamilton. \"Possessed\", their third film together, released in October, was directed by Clarence Brown. These films were immensely popular with audiences and were generally well received by critics, establishing Crawford's position as one of MGM's top female stars of the decade along with Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo and Jean Harlow. Her only other notable film of 1931, \"This Modern Age\", was released in August and despite unfavorable reviews was a moderate success.\nMGM next cast her in the film \"Grand Hotel\", directed by Edmund Goulding. As the studio's first all-star production, Crawford co-starred opposite Greta Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Beery, among others. Receiving third billing, she played the middle-class stenographer to Beery's controlling general director. Crawford later admitted to being nervous during the filming of the movie because she was working with accomplished actors, and that she was disappointed that she had no scenes with one she had admired, the \"divine Garbo\". \"Grand Hotel\" was released in April 1932 to critical and commercial success. It was one of the highest-grossing movies of the year, and won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nCrawford achieved continued success in \"Letty Lynton\" (1932). Soon after this movie's release, a plagiarism suit forced MGM to withdraw it; it is therefore considered the \"lost\" Crawford film. Designed by Adrian, the gown with large ruffled sleeves which Crawford wore in the movie became a popular style that same year, and was even copied by Macy's. On loan to United Artists, she played prostitute Sadie Thompson in \"Rain\" (1932), a film version of John Colton's 1923 play. Actress Jeanne Eagels played the role on stage, and Gloria Swanson had originated the part on screen in the 1928 film version. Crawford's performance was panned, and the film was not a success. Despite the failure of \"Rain\", in 1932, the publishing of the first \"Top Ten Money-Making Stars Poll\" placed Crawford third in popularity at the box office, behind only Marie Dressler and Janet Gaynor. She remained on the list for the next several years, last appearing on it in 1936.\nShe was again teamed with Clark Gable, along with Franchot Tone and Fred Astaire, in the hit \"Dancing Lady\" (1933), in which she received top billing. She next played the title role in \"Sadie McKee\" (1934), opposite Tone and Gene Raymond. She was paired with Gable for the fifth time in \"Chained\", and for the sixth time in \"Forsaking All Others\" (both 1934). Crawford's films of this era were some of the most-popular and highest-grossing films of the mid-1930s.\nCrawford continued her reign as a popular movie actress well into the mid-1930s. \"No More Ladies\" (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama \"I Live My Life\" (1935), directed by W. S. Van Dyke, and it was well received by critics.\nShe next starred in \"The Gorgeous Hussy\" (1936), opposite Robert Taylor and Lionel Barrymore, as well as Tone. It was a critical and box-office success, and became one of Crawford's biggest hits of the decade. \"Love on the Run\" (1936), a romantic comedy directed by W. S. Van Dyke, was her seventh film co-starring Clark Gable.\n1937\u20131943: Career decline at MGM.\nEven though Crawford remained a respected MGM actress, and her films still earned profits, her popularity declined in the late 1930s. In 1937, Crawford was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by \"Life\" magazine. She unexpectedly slipped from seventh to sixteenth place at the box office that year, and her public popularity also began to wane. Richard Boleslawski's comedy-drama \"The Last of Mrs. Cheyney\" (1937) teamed her opposite William Powell in their sole screen pairing. The film was also Crawford's last box-office success before the onset of her \"box office poison\" period.\nShe co-starred opposite Franchot Tone for the seventh\u2014and final\u2014time in \"The Bride Wore Red\" (1937). \"Mannequin\", co-starring Spencer Tracy, also released in 1937 did, as the \"New York Times\" stated, \"restore Crawford to her throne as queen of the working girls\". On May 3, 1938, Crawford\u2014along with Greta Garbo, Mae West, Edward Arnold, Marlene Dietrich, Katharine Hepburn, and Kay Francis\u2014was dubbed \"Box Office Poison\" in an advertisement in the \"Hollywood Reporter\". The list was submitted by Harry Brandt, president of the Independent Theatre Owners Association of America. Brandt stated that while these stars had \"unquestioned\" dramatic abilities, their high salaries did not reflect in their ticket sales, thus hurting the movie exhibitors involved. (Later, an article in the \"Independent Film Journal\", stated that some of the other stars considered Box Office Poison included Norma Shearer, Dolores del Rio, Fred Astaire, John Barrymore and Luise Rainer). Crawford's follow-up movie, Frank Borzage's \"The Shining Hour\" (1938), also starring Margaret Sullavan and Melvyn Douglas, was well received by critics, but it was a box-office flop.\nShe made a comeback in 1939 with her role as home-wrecker Crystal Allen in \"The Women\", opposite her professional nemesis, Norma Shearer. A year later, she played against type in the unglamorous role of Julie in \"Strange Cargo\" (1940), her eighth\u2014and final\u2014film with Clark Gable. She later starred as a facially disfigured blackmailer in \"A Woman's Face\" (1941), a remake of the Swedish film \"En kvinnas ansikte\" which had starred Ingrid Bergman in the lead role three years earlier. While the film was only a moderate box office success, Crawford's performance was hailed by many critics.\nAfter 18 years, Crawford requested to be released from her contract with MGM, which was terminated by mutual consent on June 29, 1943. In lieu of the last film remaining under her contract, MGM bought her out for $100,000.\n1943\u20131952: Move to Warner Bros..\nFor $500,000, Crawford signed with Warner Bros. for a three-movie deal, and was placed on the payroll on July 1, 1943. Her first film for the studio was \"Hollywood Canteen\" (1944), an all-star morale-booster film that teamed her with several other top movie stars at the time. \nShe wanted to play the title role in \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945), but director Michael Curtiz instead lobbied for the casting of Barbara Stanwyck. Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test; she agreed and ultimately received the role. \"Mildred Pierce\" was a resounding critical and commercial success. It epitomized the lush visual style and the hard-boiled film noir sensibility that defined Warner Bros. movies of the late forties. Crawford earned the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.\nThe success of \"Mildred Pierce\" revived Crawford's film career. Her next film was \"Humoresque\" (1946), co-starring John Garfield. She starred alongside Van Heflin in \"Possessed\" (1947), for which she received a second Academy Award nomination for \"Best Actress\". In \"Daisy Kenyon\" (1947), she appeared opposite Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda, and in \"Flamingo Road\" (1949), her character has an ultimately deadly feud with a corrupt southern sheriff played by Sydney Greenstreet. She made a cameo in \"It's a Great Feeling\" (1949), poking fun at her own screen image. In 1950, she starred in the film noir \"The Damned Don't Cry\" and in the melodrama \"Harriet Craig\".\nAfter the completion of \"This Woman Is Dangerous\" (1952), she asked to be released from her Warner Bros. contract. Later the same year, she received her third Academy Award nomination for \"Best Actress\" in \"Sudden Fear\" for RKO Radio Pictures.\nRadio and television.\nCrawford worked in the radio series \"The Screen Guild Theater\" on January 8, 1939; \"Good News\"; \"Baby\", broadcast on March 2, 1940, on Arch Oboler's \"Lights Out\"; \"The Word\" on \"Everyman's Theater\" (1941); \"Chained\" on the \"Lux Radio Theater\", and Norman Corwin's \"Document A/777\" (1948). She appeared in episodes of anthology television series in the 1950s, and, in 1959, made a pilot for \"The Joan Crawford Show\".\n1952\u20131972: Later career.\nAfter her Academy Award-nominated performance in 1952's \"Sudden Fear\", Crawford continued to work steadily throughout the rest of the decade. After a 10-year absence from MGM, she returned to that studio to star in \"Torch Song\" (1953), a musical drama centering on the life of a demanding stage star who falls in love with a blind pianist, played by Michael Wilding.\nIn 1954, she starred in \"Johnny Guitar\", a cult classic directed by Nicholas Ray, co-starring Sterling Hayden and Mercedes McCambridge. She also starred in \"Female on the Beach\" (1955) with Jeff Chandler, and in \"Queen Bee\" (1955), alongside John Ireland. The following year, she starred opposite a young Cliff Robertson in \"Autumn Leaves\" (1956), and filmed a leading role in \"The Story of Esther Costello\" (1957), co-starring Rossano Brazzi.\nCrawford, who had been left near-penniless following Alfred Steele's death, accepted a small role in \"The Best of Everything\" (1959). Although she was not the star of the film, she received positive reviews. By 1961, Joan Crawford was once again her own publicity machine, with a new script, \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\", sent by Robert Aldrich.\nCrawford starred as Blanche Hudson, an elderly, disabled former A-list movie star who lives in fear of her psychotic sister Jane, in the highly successful psychological thriller \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested Bette Davis for the role of Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them.\nThe film was a huge success, recouping its costs within eleven days of its nationwide release and reviving Crawford's career. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. \nIn 1964, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in William Castle's horror mystery \"Strait-Jacket\" (1964). During the same year, Aldrich reteamed Crawford and Davis in \"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\" (1964). After a purported campaign of harassment by Davis on location in Louisiana, Crawford returned to Hollywood and entered a hospital. After a prolonged absence, Aldrich was forced to replace her with Olivia de Havilland. Crawford, who was devastated, said \"I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ... I cried for nine hours.\" Despite being replaced, brief footage of Crawford made it into the film when she is seen sitting in a taxi in a wide shot.\nIn 1965, she played Amy Nelson in \"I Saw What You Did\", another William Castle vehicle. She starred as circus owner Monica Rivers in Herman Cohen's thriller \"Berserk!\" (1967). After the film's release, Crawford guest-starred as herself on \"The Lucy Show\". The episode, \"Lucy and the Lost Star\", first aired on February 26, 1968. Crawford allegedly struggled during rehearsals, however, she was letter-perfect on the day of the show, which included dancing the Charleston, and received two standing ovations from the studio audience.\nIn October 1968, Crawford's 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who was then acting in New York in the soap opera \"The Secret Storm\"), needed immediate medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor. Despite the fact that Christina's character was a 28-year-old, Crawford played the role for one week.\nCrawford's appearance in the 1969 television film \"Night Gallery\" (which served as pilot to the series that followed) was the first occasion when Steven Spielberg directed a professional actor. Crawford made a cameo appearance as herself in the first episode of \"The Tim Conway Show\", which aired on January 30, 1970. She starred on the big screen one final time, playing Dr. Brockton in Herman Cohen's science fiction horror film \"Trog\" (1970), rounding out a career spanning 45 years and more than 80 motion pictures. Crawford made three more television appearances, including one as Stephanie White in a 1970 episode (\"The Nightmare\") of \"The Virginian\", and as Joan Fairchild (her final dramatic performance) in a 1972 episode (\"Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death\") of \"The Sixth Sense\".\nPersonal life.\nMarriages.\nOn June 3, 1929, Crawford eloped with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. at Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church (known as \"The Actors' Chapel\", owing to its proximity to Broadway theatres) in Manhattan, although neither was Catholic. Fairbanks was the son of Douglas Fairbanks and the stepson of Mary Pickford, who were considered Hollywood royalty. Fairbanks Sr. and Pickford were opposed to the sudden marriage, and did not invite the couple to their home at Pickfair for eight months after the marriage.\nThe relationship between Crawford and Fairbanks, Sr., eventually warmed; she called him \"Uncle Doug\", and he called her \"Billie\", her childhood nickname, but one that close friends used throughout her life. Following that first invitation, Crawford and Fairbanks, Jr., became more frequent guests. While the Fairbanks men played golf together, Crawford was either left with Pickford, who would retire to her quarters, or simply left alone.\nIn May 1933, Crawford divorced Fairbanks, citing \"grievous mental cruelty\". Crawford claimed Fairbanks had \"a jealous and suspicious attitude\" toward her friends, and that they had \"loud arguments about the most trivial subjects\" lasting \"far into the night\".\nIn 1935, Crawford married Franchot Tone, a stage actor from New York who planned to use his film earnings to finance his theatre group. The couple built a small theatre at Crawford's Brentwood home, and put on productions of classic plays for select groups of friends who lived in the popular Brentwood area like Clark Gable and Charley Chase. Tone and Crawford had first appeared together in \"Today We Live\" (1933), but Crawford was hesitant about entering into another romance so soon after her split from Fairbanks.\nBefore and during their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone's Hollywood career, but he was not interested in being a star, ultimately wanting to just be an actor, and Crawford wearied of the effort. During their marriage they tried on two separate occasions for children, both ending in miscarriage. Tone allegedly began drinking and became physically abusive. She filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939. Crawford and Tone later rekindled their friendship, and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When he died in 1968, Crawford arranged for him to be cremated and his ashes scattered at Muskoka Lakes, Canada.\nCrawford met actor Phillip Terry in June 1942 after press agent Harry Mines asked if he could bring Terry along for dinner at Crawford's home. On July 21, 1942, the couple married 10 minutes after midnight at the home of Crawford's lawyer, Neil McCarthy, by Judge Flynn, six weeks after their first date in San Fernando Valley. On December 16, 1945, Crawford and Terry separated. Later, on March 12, 1946, Crawford filed for divorce on \"grounds of cruelty\". On April 25, they divorced.\nCrawford married her fourth\u2014and final\u2014husband, Alfred Steele, at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas on May 10, 1955. Crawford and Steele met at a party in 1954. By that time, Steele had become president of Pepsi-Cola. He later was named chairman of the board of Pepsi-Cola. They remained married until his death in May 1959.\nChildren.\nCrawford adopted her first child, a daughter, in June 1940. Because she was single, California law prevented her from adopting within the state, so she arranged the adoption through an agency in Las Vegas. The child was temporarily called Joan, until Crawford changed her name to Christina. Christina's birth mother was a 19-year-old unmarried girl who had moved to Los Angeles with her family. Christina's birth mother contracted with a baby broker for Crawford to adopt her baby after its birth.\nWhile married to Phillip Terry, the couple adopted a son (born Marcus Gary Kullberg on June 3, 1941, prior to changing his name to David Gary Deatherage) whom they named Christopher. His mother, Rebecca, had been a married woman who had become pregnant after having an affair with a neighbor. Ten days after the child's birth, Crawford picked him up, but when Rebecca learned the child had been adopted by a celebrity, she attempted to blackmail Crawford for money, which resulted in Crawford giving the child back to her. After his return, Rebecca's husband was physically and emotionally abusive, refusing to let Christopher in his sight (his mother would have to hide him in closets). After he threw an infant Christopher against a wall, rupturing his hernia, Rebecca placed him back up for adoption, and he was adopted by a loving family. However, losing him devastated Crawford, and none of her other children dared mention him, as it was a tender subject for her.In 1942, Crawford and Terry adopted another boy, whom they named Phillip Terry Jr. After the marriage ended in 1946, Crawford changed that child's name to Christopher Crawford. In 1944, when Rebecca learned of the child (who was unrelated to her son), she claimed he was also her child, leading to her arrest and her being placed in a psychiatric hospital. Christopher changed his name to Davis Gary Deatherage and wrote a memoir of his childhood titled \"The Other Side of My Life\", which released in 2006. He lamented not being able to meet her personally, and Crawford's twin daughters told him about how Crawford felt about losing him.\nChristopher Crawford, not Rebecca's son, often ran away from home. He was expelled from several schools and went to a military academy for his high school days. At 18, Christopher married; by the time he was 19, he and his wife had a daughter named Janet. In 1961, he took them to meet Crawford in Miami, Florida. He told the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 1978, \"J.C. [Crawford] was staying at the Fontainebleau. My daughter was six weeks old and I thought J.C. would like to see her granddaughter. She held Janet for about 10 seconds, I think. I said, 'Janet, that's your grandmother; she's a very famous lady.\u2019 J.C. said, \u2018I'm nobody's grandmother. I'm Aunt Joan.\u2019 Then she handed her back to me and said, 'She doesn't look anything like you!'\" He never saw Crawford in person again after this meeting. His second daughter, Bonnie, was born around 1973. In the same interview, he recalled, \"When Bonnie was born, she had a lot of trouble. She was just a tiny little mass of bones with some skin stretched over them. So I called J.C. and said, 'I need your help. Your granddaughter needs blood and she needs it now. She might die.\u2019 J.C. said, 'She's not my granddaughter. You were adopted.\u2019 I lost my temper and slammed down the phone so hard I broke the receiver. That was it between J.C. and me.\" As of 1978, Christopher had remarried and had another daughter, Chrystal. \"She was not a family,\" he said of Crawford. \"I honestly to this day do not believe that she ever cared for me.\" Christopher died in 2006.In 1947, Crawford adopted two fraternal twin daughters and named them Catherine \"Cathy\" and Cynthia \"Cindy\". They were born prematurely on January 13, 1947, and required hospital supervision for several weeks. Cathy and Cynthia are the only children adopted by Crawford from the Tennessee Children's Home Society. Their birth mother was ill and died less than a week after the twins were born due to kidney failure; their biological father abandoned their mother during birth. Their biological mother made the adoption arrangements before Cathy and Cindy were born.\nCrawford's fourth husband, Alfred Steele, took on a father-figure role to the children after his marriage to Crawford in 1955.\nCathy described her mother as wise, warm, realistic, caring, and a \"good friend\". Cathy attended Vernon Court Junior College, the Fashion Institute of Technology, and the International Fine Arts College. In November 1967, Crawford announced that Cathy, was engaged to Navy petty officer, Jerome Jon Lalonde. They met while Cathy was working part time as a waitress while attending college. They were married in Alexandria Bay on August 10, 1968. Herbert L. Barnet, then CEO of Pepsi Cola, gave Cathy away at the wedding. Cathy designed and sewed her own wedding dress. They had two children together. The couple separated in 1984, later divorcing. Cynthia married John Jordan and also had two children. They would eventually divorce.\nIn the 1990s, the twins reconnected with their biological family in Tennessee. Cynthia died on October 14, 2007. Cathy died on January 11, 2020, of lung cancer.\nPepsi-Cola.\nDuring her marriage to Alfred Steele, Crawford traveled extensively on behalf of Pepsi. Following Steele's death on April 19, 1959, Crawford was elected as the first female to the board of directors and later took on the role of goodwill ambassador. In 1966, Crawford estimated that she traveled over a year for the company.\nIn 1963, Crawford received the Pepsi's sixth annual \"Pally Award\", which was in the shape of a bronze Pepsi bottle. It was awarded to the employee making the most significant contribution to company sales. In 1973, Crawford retired from Pepsi's board of directors upon her official age of 65.\nLater life.\nOn February 2, 1970, Crawford was presented with the Cecil B. DeMille Award by John Wayne at the Golden Globes, held at the Coconut Grove at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. In 1970, she also spoke at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, where she had been a student for two months in 1922.\nCrawford published her autobiography, \"A Portrait of Joan\", co-written with Jane Kesner Ardmore, in 1962 through Doubleday. Crawford's next book, \"My Way of Life\", was published in 1971 by Simon &amp; Schuster.\nJoan Crawford's last official public appearance was on April 8, 1973, at Town Hall in Manhattan, New York. Crawford appeared as the fourth legend in John Springer's \"Legendary Ladies\" series. The event was sold out, with the 1,500 seat venue filled to capacity. The audience watched a series of highlight scenes from Crawford's screen career. Afterward, Crawford came on stage for a question-and-answer session with the audience. Upon Crawford's departure, approximately 200 fans surrounded her limousine and would not let it move for several minutes.\nIn September 1973, Crawford moved from apartment 22-G to a smaller apartment next door, 22-H, at the Imperial House, 150 East 69th Street, New York City. Her last public appearance was made on September 23, 1974, at a book party co-hosted with her old friend Rosalind Russell at New York's Rainbow Room, after which unflattering photographs were published.\nDeath.\nCrawford had a heart attack on May 10, 1977, and died in her apartment in Lenox Hill, New York City. Her age was reported as 69. Four days earlier on May 6, 1977, Crawford had given away her Shih Tzu, Princess Lotus Blossom, because she was too weak to continue to care for her.\nA funeral was held at Campbell Funeral Home, New York, on May 13, 1977, and her cremated ashes were placed in a crypt at Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum, Hartsdale, Westchester County, New York, next to her fourth and last husband Alfred Steele.\nDisposing of her $2\u00a0million estate in her will, which had been signed on October 28, 1976, Crawford bequeathed $77,500 to each of her two youngest children, Cindy and Cathy, and $35,000 to her longtime friend and secretary Betty Barker, and smaller bequests to a few other people. Crawford also left money to her favorite charities: the United Service Organizations New York centre, the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital, the American Cancer Society, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the American Heart Association, and the Wiltwyck School for Boys.\nShe disinherited her two eldest children, Christina and Christopher, stating in her will: \"It is my intention to make no provision herein for my son, Christopher, or my daughter, Christina, for reasons which are well known to them.\" Both of them challenged the will and received a $55,000 settlement. She also bequeathed nothing to her niece, Joan Lowe (1933\u20131999; born Joan Crawford LeSueur, the only child of her estranged brother, Hal).\nA memorial service was held for Crawford at All Souls' Unitarian Church on Lexington Avenue in New York on May 17, 1977. In attendance were long-time friend Myrna Loy and co-stars Geraldine Brooks and Cliff Robertson, who gave eulogies; Pearl Bailey sang \"He'll Understand\". Another memorial service, organized by George Cukor, was held on June 24 in the Samuel Goldwyn Theater at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, California.\nLegacy.\nJoan Crawford's handprints and footprints were imprinted in a block in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on September 14, 1929.\nShe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1752 Vine Street, for her contributions to the motion picture industry.\nIn 1999, Crawford was voted the tenth-greatest female star of the classic American cinema by the American Film Institute.\n\"Playboy\" listed Crawford as number 84 of the \"100 Sexiest Women of the 20th century\".\nCrawford has also attracted a following in the gay community. In \"Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography\", the author wrote that Crawford appealed to many gay men because they sympathized with her struggle for success in both the entertainment industry and her personal life.\nCharity contributions.\nThroughout her life, Crawford was heavily involved in charity work, as well as contributing to various efforts for service members. In the 1930s, Crawford was named one of the vice presidents on the board of the Motion Picture Relief Fund. Throughout the 1930s, Crawford supported the cause by promoting, donating, attending board meetings, and collecting contributions \"from actors and directors who were remiss\". In 1938, Crawford, Adolphe Menjou, and Jackie Cooper were on the organization's stamp committee whose goal was to raise money from used stamps. The sales from the stamps to collectors would benefit actors in need of aid. Crawford donated all her stamped envelopes from fan letters to the cause that year. In 1933, Crawford donated her large doll collection she had been collecting since the 1920s to a children's hospital.\nDuring World War II, Crawford did much to help in the war effort which included promoting the sale of war bonds to the public. In 1942, she began volunteering at the Hollywood Canteen in Los Angeles to entertain and serve service members. In 1943, she began volunteering for American Women's Voluntary Services nurseries as a member by giving of her time and money to provide support service to the children of service members. During WWII, Crawford volunteered as the guarantor for English actor and writer, Margaret Chute. Chute required a guarantor to move from England to the United States during war.\nIn 1942, Crawford donated her entire $112,500 salary from \"They All Kissed the Bride\" to charities in memory of Carole Lombard. They included the American Red Cross ($50,000) which helped in recovery efforts following Lombard's death, the Infantile Paralysis Drive ($25,000), Motion Picture Relief ($25,000), and the Navy Relief Fund ($12,500).\nIn June 1952, Crawford travelled to Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas for charity and helped raise thousands of dollars, shook hands, and met with 575 people in one night. In 1955, she donated some of her clothes for auction to support the Boys Republic, a rehabilitation centre for teenagers. Crawford was also named Chairman of the \"1959 National Multiple Sclerosis Society Fund campaign\", renamed the \"Alfred N. Steele Memorial Campaign for the MS Hope Chest\" following Steele's death in May 1959.\nIn the 1960s, Crawford sponsored the Philadelphia Cotillion Society's annual Christmas Cotillion, aimed at raising funds for https:// and the NAACP.\nIn 1965, the U.S.O. named Crawford the \"Woman of The Year\" for her ongoing contributions to the organization and the support of American service members. Crawford continued her commitment to service members into the 1960s, by visiting army hospitals to cheer up soldiers who were injured in the Vietnam War.\nAside from volunteering to war efforts and service members, Crawford also volunteered for a great number of charity organizations, which included the American Red Cross, C.A.R.E., various charities for the advancement of care and cures for crippled children and the American Cancer Society, for which Crawford served as national chairwoman in 1972. From 1966 until 1973, Crawford appeared on the annual muscular dystrophy telethon to encourage the public to pledge funds to help those affected by the illness.\nCrawford was elected as ball chairman of the 16th annual Animal Kingdom Ball on January 20, 1965, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. On March 25, 1971, Crawford accepted a position as honorary chairmanship of the board of advisers to help raise funds for the Negro Ensemble Company. Crawford also sent out the invitations for Alan King's first charity benefit in support of children with mental disabilities.\nFollowing her death, it was revealed that for many years Crawford had paid for hospital rooms and specialists for hundreds of indigent people who could not afford medical care\u2014many of whom were members of the film industry who were down on their luck and destitute. Crawford never publicized these contributions, and did not want the public (or the patients) to know she was paying their medical bills.\n\"Mommie Dearest\".\nOn October 2, 1978, Christina Crawford published a memoir titled \"Mommie Dearest\", alleging her late adoptive mother was emotionally and physically abusive. In 1981, the book was made into the film \"Mommie Dearest\", starring Faye Dunaway.\nCrawford's two other twin daughters, Cathy Crawford Lalonde and Cynthia Crawford Jordan, denounced the book, categorically denying any abuse. Cindy told reporters in 1979, \"I can't understand how people believe this stupid stuff Tina has written.\" Cathy claimed in 1981 both the book and movie were \"untrue\".\nOn May 28, 1981, Cathy appeared on \"Good Morning America\", claiming their mother was \"warm\" and Christina's book was a \"great work of fiction\".\nOn July 20, 1998, Cathy filed a lawsuit against Christina for \"defamation of character\". Cathy stated in her lawsuit that during the 20th-anniversary book tour of \"Mommie Dearest\", Christina publicly claimed to interviewers that LaLonde and her twin sister, Cynthia, were not biological sisters, and that their adoption was never legal. LaLonde stated neither claim by Christina was true and attached copies of the twin girls' birth certificates and adoption documentation to the lawsuit. The lawsuit was later settled out of court for $5,000 plus court costs. Later in 2008, Cathy told biographer Charlotte Chandler in 2008, \"I don't know where [Christina] got her ideas. Our Mommie was the best mother anyone ever had.\"\nHelen Hayes, June Allyson, and Vincent Sherman stated they had witnessed strict discipline. For example, Hayes and Sherman both stated in their autobiographies that they felt Joan was too strict a parent. Allyson stated in her autobiography that she witnessed Joan put Christina in \"time-out\", and did not let her go to a friend's birthday party as a punishment. However, these people never stated they witnessed any outright abuse. James MacArthur stated he spent a weekend with the Crawford family when he was a child and never saw any abuse, but did observe that Christopher was harnessed in his bed at night. Unbeknownst to MacArthur, according to Christopher's daughter, Janet, Christopher was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Joan's family doctor recommended the store-bought child harness to keep Christopher in bed at night and prevent him from wandering outside to play and possibly fall into the swimming pool. Christopher's daughter stated to columnist Cindy Adams, \"I have two boys, one is identical to my brother and my father. We're treating his hyperactivity with medication, but three generations have had this condition. It must come from something. Joan said she didn't believe in heredity, but my dad proves her wrong. He, my brother, and my son all look alike and act alike.\"\nMany of Crawford's friends and co-workers, including Van Johnson, Ann Blyth, Katharine Hepburn, Cesar Romero, Gary Gray, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Crawford's first husband), denied the claims. In her 1987 autobiography, Myrna Loy stated, \"She [Christina] wanted to be Joan Crawford. I think that's the basis of the book she wrote afterward and everything else. I saw what Christina's mind created, the fantasy world she lived in.\"\nChristina's husband, producer Harvey Medlinsky, said in response to Christina's memoir, \"I have only good things to say about Joan Crawford. She was always nice to me and Christina.\" \"The Secret Storm\" producer Gloria Monty, countered Christina's allegation that Joan \"stole\" Christina's role on the television show when she fell ill in 1968. According to Monty, Christina lied regarding this situation. Monty stated that she and CBS asked Joan to substitute for her daughter on the show, and that Joan agreed only in the interest of not allowing Christina to be permanently replaced by another actress until she could return to the show. Monty added, \"I'll tell you that I saw Joan Crawford do everything she could to save that girl's life and job.\"\nBette Davis, Crawford's lifelong rival, also defended Crawford. \"I was not Miss Crawford's biggest fan but, wisecracks to the contrary, I did and still do respect her talent. What she did not deserve was that detestable book written by her daughter. I've forgotten her name. Horrible.\"\nSince the publication of \"Mommie Dearest\" in 1978, Christina has attempted to capitalize on its monetary success with a one-woman show entitled \"Surviving Mommie Dearest\" in 2013, and in 2019, attempted to produce a musical version of her memoir, though it did not come to fruition.\nAutobiographies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45971", "revid": "1778754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45971", "title": "Pentecost", "text": "Christian holy day\nPentecost (also called Whit Sunday, Whitsunday or Whitsun) is a Christian holiday that takes place on the 49th day (50th day when inclusive counting is used) after Easter. It commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles of Jesus, Mary, and other followers of the Christ, while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:1\u201331). Pentecost marks the \"Birthday of the Church\".\nPentecost is one of the Great feasts in the Eastern Orthodox Church, a Solemnity in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, and a Principal Feast in the Anglican Communion. Many Christian denominations provide a special liturgy for this holy celebration. Since its date depends on the date of Easter, Pentecost is a \"moveable feast\". The Monday after Pentecost is a legal holiday in many European, African and Caribbean countries.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Pentecost\" comes from . One of the meanings of \"Pentecost\" in the Septuagint, the Koine translation of the Hebrew Bible, refers to the festival of Shavuot, one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals, which is celebrated on the fiftieth day after Passover according to Deuteronomy 16:10, and Exodus 34:22, where it is referred to as the \"Festival of Weeks\" (). The Septuagint uses the term in this context in the Book of Tobit and 2 Maccabees.\nThe translators of the Septuagint also used the word in two other senses: to signify the year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25:10) an event that occurs every 50th year, and in several passages of chronology as an ordinal number. The term has also been used in the literature of Hellenistic Judaism by Philo of Alexandria and Josephus to refer to Shavuot.\nBackground.\nIn Judaism, Shavuot is a harvest festival that is celebrated seven weeks and one day after the first day of Passover in Deuteronomy 16:9, or seven weeks and one day after the Sabbath according to Leviticus 23:16. It is discussed in the Mishnah and the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Arakhin. The actual mention of fifty days comes from Leviticus 23:16.\nThe Festival of Weeks is also known as the Feast of Harvest in Exodus 23:16 and the Day of First Fruits in Numbers 28:26. In Exodus 34:22, it is called the \"first fruits of the wheat harvest.\"\nSometime during the Hellenistic period, the ancient harvest festival also became a day of renewing the Noahic covenant, described in Genesis 9:17, which is established between God and \"all flesh that is upon the earth\". After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, offerings could no longer be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and the focus of the festival shifted from agriculture to the Israelites receiving the Torah.\nBy this time, some Jews were already living in the Diaspora. According to there were Jews from \"every nation under heaven\" in Jerusalem, possibly visiting the city as pilgrims during Pentecost.\nNew Testament.\nThe narrative in Acts 2 of the Pentecost includes numerous references to earlier biblical narratives like the Tower of Babel, and the flood and creation narratives from the Book of Genesis. It also includes references to certain theophanies, with certain emphasis on God's incarnate appearance on biblical Mount Sinai when the Ten Commandments were presented to Moses. Theologian Stephen Wilson has described the narrative as \"exceptionally obscure\" and various points of disagreement persist among bible scholars.\nThere is no literary evidence to confirm the location of the (\"house\"), given as the location of the events in Acts 2:2. Some semantic details suggest that the \"house\" could be the \"upper room\" () mentioned in , but there is no textual evidence to confirm the location with certainty and it remains a subject of debate among biblical commentators.\nThe events of Acts Chapter 2 are set against the backdrop of the celebration of Pentecost in Jerusalem. There are several major features to the Pentecost narrative presented in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. The author begins by noting that the disciples of Jesus \"were all together in one place\" on the \"day of Pentecost\" (). The verb used in Acts 2:1 to indicate the arrival of the day of Pentecost carries a connotation of fulfillment.\nThere is a \"mighty rushing wind\" (wind is a common symbol for the Holy Spirit) and \"tongues as of fire\" appear. The gathered disciples were \"filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance\". Some scholars have interpreted the passage as a reference to the multitude of languages spoken by the gathered disciples, while others have taken the reference to \"tongues\" () to signify ecstatic speech.\nIn Christian tradition, this event represents fulfillment of the promise that Christ will baptize his followers with the Holy Spirit. Out of the four New Testament gospels, the distinction between baptism by water and the baptism by Christ with \"Holy Spirit and fire\" is only found in Matthew and Luke.\nThe narrative in Acts evokes the symbolism of Jesus's baptism in the Jordan River, and the start of his ministry, by explicitly connecting the earlier prophecy of John the Baptist to the baptism of the disciples with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. The timing of the narrative during the law giving festival of Pentecost symbolizes both continuity with the giving of the law, but also the central role of the Holy Spirit for the early church. The central role of Christ in Christian faith signified a fundamental theological separation from the traditional Jewish faith, which was grounded in the Torah and Mosaic Law.\nPeter's sermon in stresses the resurrection and exaltation. In his sermon, Peter quotes and Psalm 16 to indicate that first Pentecost marks the start of the Messianic Age. About one hundred and twenty followers of Christ (Acts 1:15) were present, including the Twelve Apostles (Matthias was Judas's replacement) (Acts 1:13, 26), Jesus's mother Mary, other female disciples and his brothers (). While those on whom the Spirit had descended were speaking in many languages, the Apostle Peter stood up with the eleven and proclaimed to the crowd that this event was the fulfillment of the prophecy.\nIn Acts 2:17, it reads: \"'And in the last days,' God says, 'I will pour out my spirit upon every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams.\" He also mentions () that it was the third hour of the day (about 9:00\u00a0am). then reports: \"Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.\"\nSome critical scholars believe some features of the narrative are theological constructions. They believe that even if the Pentecost narrative is not literally true, it does signify an important event in the history of the early church which enabled the rapid spread of Christianity. Within a few decades important congregations had been established in all major cities of the Roman Empire.\nConcerning Acts 2, Gerd L\u00fcdemann considers the Pentecost gathering as very possible, and the apostolic instruction to be historically credible. Wedderburn acknowledges the possibility of a \u2018mass ecstatic experience\u2019, and notes it is difficult to explain why early Christians later adopted this Jewish festival if there had not been an original Pentecost event as described in Acts. He also holds the description of the early community in Acts 2 to be reliable.\nL\u00fcdemann views Acts 3:1\u20134:31 as historical. Wedderburn notes what he sees as features of an idealized description, but nevertheless cautions against dismissing the record as unhistorical. Hengel likewise insists that Luke described genuine historical events, even if he has idealized them.\nBiblical commentator Richard C. H. Lenski has noted that the use of the term \"Pentecost\" in Acts is a reference to the Jewish festival. He writes that a well-defined, distinct Christian celebration did not exist until later years, when Christians kept the name of \"Pentecost\" but began to calculate the date of the feast based on Easter rather than Passover.\nPeter stated that this event was the beginning of a continual outpouring that would be available to all believers from that point on, Jews and Gentiles alike.\nLiturgical celebration.\nEastern churches.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Pentecost is one of the Orthodox Great Feasts and is considered to be the highest ranking Great Feast of the Lord, second in rank only to Pascha (Easter). The service is celebrated with an All-night Vigil on the eve of the feast day, and the Divine Liturgy on the day of the feast itself. Orthodox churches are often decorated with greenery and flowers on this feast day, and the celebration is intentionally similar to the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which celebrates the giving of the Mosaic Law. In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Pentecost is one of the seven Major \"Lord's Feasts\".\nThe feast itself lasts three days. The first day is known as \"Trinity Sunday\"; the second day is known as \"Spirit Monday\" (or \"Monday of the Holy Spirit\"); and the third day, Tuesday, is called the \"Third Day of the Trinity.\" The Afterfeast of Pentecost lasts for one week, during which fasting is not permitted, even on Wednesday and Friday. In the Orthodox Tradition, the liturgical color used at Pentecost is green, and the clergy and faithful carry flowers and green branches in their hands during the services.\nAll of the remaining days of the ecclesiastical year, until the preparation for the next Great Lent, are named for the day after Pentecost on which they occur. This is again counted inclusively, such that the 15th day of Pentecost is 14 days after Trinity Sunday. The exception is that the Melkite Greek Catholic Church marks Sundays \"after Holy Cross\".\nThe Orthodox icon of the feast depicts the Twelve Apostles seated in a semicircle (sometimes the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) is shown sitting in the center of them). At the top of the icon, the Holy Spirit, in the form of tongues of fire, is descending upon them. At the bottom is an allegorical figure, called \"Kosmos\", which symbolizes the world. Although Kosmos is crowned with earthly glory he sits in the darkness caused by the ignorance of God. He is holding a towel on which have been placed 12 scrolls, representing the teaching of the Twelve Apostles.\nKneeling Prayer.\nAn extraordinary service called the \"Kneeling Prayer\" is observed on the night of Pentecost. This is a Vespers service to which are added three sets of long poetical prayers, the composition of Basil the Great, during which everyone makes a full prostration, touching their foreheads to the floor (prostrations in church having been forbidden from the day of Pascha (Easter) up to this point). Uniquely, these prayers include a petition for all of those in hell, that they may be granted relief and even ultimate release from their confinement, if God deems this possible. In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, it is observed at the time of ninth hour (3:00\u00a0pm) on the Sunday of Pentecost.\nApostles' Fast.\nThe Second Monday after Pentecost is the beginning of the Apostles' Fast (which continues until the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on June 29). Theologically, Orthodox do not consider Pentecost to be the \"birthday\" of the church; they see the church as having existed before the creation of the world (cf. \"The Shepherd of Hermas\"). In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the \"Apostles Fast\" has a fixed end date on the fifth of the Coptic month of Epip (which currently falls on July 12, which is equivalent to June 29, due to the current 13-day Julian-Gregorian calendar offset). The fifth of Epip is the commemoration of the Martyrdom of St. Peter and Paul.\nWestern churches.\nThe liturgical celebrations of Pentecost in Western churches are as rich and varied as those in the East. The typical image of Pentecost in the West is that of the Virgin Mary seated centrally and prominently among the disciples with flames resting on the crowns of their heads. Occasionally, parting clouds suggesting the action of the \"mighty wind\"; rays of light and the dove are also depicted. the Western iconographic style is less static and stylized than that of the East, and other very different representations have been produced, and, in some cases, have achieved great fame such as the Pentecosts by Titian, Giotto, and el Greco.\nSt. Paul already in the 1st century notes the importance of this festival to the early Christian communities: see: and . Since the lifetime of some who may have been eyewitnesses, annual celebrations of the descent of the Holy Spirit have been observed.\nIn the Roman Catholic liturgy, Pentecost marks the end and completion of the Easter season, and the birth or \"great beginning\" of the church.\nBefore the Second Vatican Council Pentecost Monday as well was a Holy Day of Obligation during which the Catholic Church addressed the newly baptized and confirmed. Since the council, Pentecost Monday is no longer solemnized. Pentecost Monday remains an official festival in many Protestant churches, such as the (Lutheran) Church of Sweden, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, and others. In the Byzantine Catholic Rite Pentecost Monday is no longer a Holy Day of Obligation, but rather a simple holiday. In the Extraordinary Form of the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, as at Easter, the liturgical rank of Monday and Tuesday of Pentecost week is a Double of the First Class and across many Western denominations, Pentecost is celebrated with an octave culminating on Trinity Sunday. However, in the modern Roman Rite (Ordinary Form), Pentecost ends after Evening Prayer on the feast day itself, with Ordinary Time resuming the next day.\nMarking the festival's importance, as the principal feast of the church and the fulfilment of Christ's purpose in coming into the world, namely bringing the Holy Spirit which had departed with Adam and Eve's fall, back into the world, all 33 following Sundays are \"Sundays after Pentecost\" in the Orthodox Church. In several denominations, such as the Lutheran, Episcopal, and United Methodist churches, and formerly in the Roman Catholic Church, all the Sundays from the holiday itself until Advent in late November or December are designated the 2nd, 3rd, etc. Sunday after Pentecost, again traditionally reckoned inclusively. Throughout the year, in Roman Catholic piety, Pentecost is the third of the Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary, as well as being one of the Stations of the Resurrection or Via Lucis.\nIn some Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, where there is less emphasis on the liturgical year, Pentecost may still be one of the greatest celebrations in the year, such as in Germany or Romania. In other cases, Pentecost may be ignored as a holy day in these churches. In many evangelical churches in the United States, the secular holiday, Mother's Day, may be more celebrated than the biblical feast of Pentecost. Some evangelicals and Pentecostals are observing the liturgical calendar and observe Pentecost as a day to teach the Gifts of the Holy Spirit.\nAcross denominational lines Pentecost has been an opportunity for Christians to honor the role of the Holy Spirit in their lives, and celebrate the birth of the Christian Church in an ecumenical context.\nRed symbolism.\nThe main sign of Pentecost in the West is the colour red. It symbolizes joy and the fire of the Holy Spirit.\nPriests or ministers, and choirs wear red vestments, and in modern times, the custom has extended to the lay people of the congregation wearing red clothing in celebration as well. Red banners are often hung from walls or ceilings to symbolize the blowing of the \"mighty wind\" and the free movement of the Spirit.\nIn some cases, red fans, or red handkerchiefs, are distributed to the congregation to be waved during the procession, etc. Other congregations have incorporated the use of red balloons, signifying the \"Birthday of the Church\". These may be borne by the congregants, decorate the sanctuary, or released all at once.\nFlowers, fruits, and branches.\nThe celebrations may depict symbols of the Holy Spirit, such as the dove or flames, symbols of the church such as Noah's Ark and the Pomegranate, or especially within Protestant churches of Reformed and Evangelical traditions, words rather than images naming for example, the gifts and Fruits of the Spirit. Red flowers at the altar/preaching area, and red flowering plants such as geraniums around the church are also typical decorations for Pentecost masses/services.\nThese symbolize the renewal of life, the coming of the warmth of summer, and the growth of the church at and from the first Pentecost. In the southern hemisphere, for example, in southern Australia, Pentecost comes in the mellow autumntide, after the often great heat of summer, and the red leaves of the poinsettia have often been used to decorate churches then.\nThese flowers often play an important role in the ancestral rites, and other rites, of the particular congregation. For example, in both Protestant and Catholic churches, the plants brought in to decorate for the holiday may be each \"sponsored\" by individuals in memory of a particular loved one, or in honor of a living person on a significant occasion, such as their Confirmation day.\nIn German-speaking and other Central European countries, and also in overseas congregations originating from these countries through migration, green branches are also traditionally used to decorate churches for Pentecost. Birch is the tree most typically associated with this practice in Europe, but other species are employed in different climates.\nLowering of doves.\nIn the Middle Ages, cathedrals and great churches throughout Western Europe were fitted with a peculiar architectural feature known as a Holy Ghost hole: a small circular opening in the roof that symbolized the entrance of the Holy Spirit into the midst of the congregation. At Pentecost, these Holy Ghost holes would be decorated with flowers, and sometimes a dove figure lowered through into the church while the narrative of Pentecost was read. Holy Ghost holes can still be seen today in European churches such as Canterbury Cathedral.\nSimilarly, a large two dimensional dove figure would be, and in some places still is, cut from wood, painted, and decorated with flowers, to be lowered over the congregation, particularly during the singing of the sequence hymn, or \"Veni Creator Spiritus\". In other places, particularly Sicily and the Italian peninsula, rose petals were and are thrown from the galleries over the congregation, recalling the tongues of fire. (see below) In modern times, this practice has been revived, and adapted as well, to include the strewing of origami doves from above or suspending them, sometimes by the hundreds, from the ceiling.\nHymns and music.\nThe singing of Pentecost hymns is also central to the celebration in the Western tradition. Hymns such as Martin Luther's \"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\" (Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord), Charles Wesley's \"Spirit of Faith Come Down\" and \"Come Holy Ghost Our Hearts Inspire\" or Hildegard von Bingen's \"O Holy Spirit Root of Life\" are popular. Some traditional hymns of Pentecost make reference not only to themes relating to the Holy Spirit or the church, but to folk customs connected to the holiday as well, such as the decorating with green branches. Other hymns include \"Oh that I had a Thousand Voices\" (\"\"O da\u00df ich tausend Zungen h\u00e4tte\") by German, Johann Mentzer Verse 2: \"Ye forest leaves so green and tender, that dance for joy in summer air\"\u00a0...\" or \"O Day Full of Grace\" (\"\"Den signede Dag\") by Dane, N. F. S. Grundtvig verse 3: \"Yea were every tree endowed with speech and every leaflet singing\"\u00a0...\".\nAs Pentecost closes the Easter Season in the Roman Catholic Church, the dismissal with the double alleluia is sung at the end of Mass. The Paschal Candle is removed from the sanctuary at the end of the day.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, Veni Sancte Spiritus is the sequence hymn for the Day of Pentecost. This has been translated into many languages and is sung in many denominations today. As an invocation of the Holy Spirit, Veni Creator Spiritus is sung during liturgical celebrations on the feast of Pentecost.\nTrumpeters or brass ensembles are often specially contracted to accompany singing and provide special music at Pentecost services, recalling the Sound of the mighty wind. While this practice is common among a wide spectrum of Western denominations (Eastern Churches do not employ instrumental accompaniment in their worship) it is particularly typical, and distinctive to the heritage of the Moravian Church.\nAnother custom is reading the appointed Scripture lessons in multiple foreign languages recounting the speaking in tongues recorded in .\nFasting and devotions.\nFor some Protestants, the nine days between Ascension Day, and Pentecost are set aside as a time of fasting and universal prayer in honour of the disciples' time of prayer and unity awaiting the Holy Spirit. Similarly among Roman Catholics, special Pentecost novenas are prayed. The Pentecost Novena is considered the first novena, all other novenas prayed in preparation of various feasts deriving their practice from those original nine days of prayer observed by the disciples of Christ.\nWhile the Eve of Pentecost was traditionally a day of fasting for Catholics, contemporary canon law no longer requires it. Both Catholics and Protestants may hold spiritual retreats, prayer vigils, and litanies in the days leading up to Pentecost. In some cases vigils on the Eve of Pentecost may last all night. Pentecost is also one of the occasions specially appointed for the Lutheran Litany to be sung.\nOn the morning of Pentecost, a popular custom is \"to ascend hill tops and mountains during the early dawn of Whitsunday to pray. People call this observance 'catching the Holy Ghost.' Thus they express in symbolic language the spiritual fact that only by means of prayer can the divine Dove be 'caught' and the graces of the Holy Spirit obtained.\"\nAnother custom is for families to suspend \"artfully carved and painted wooden doves, representing the Holy Spirit\" over the dining tables as \"a constant reminder for members of the family to venerate the Holy Spirit.\" These are left hanging year-round and are cleaned before the feast of Pentecost, often being \"encased in a globe of glass\".\nOn the vigil of Pentecost, a traditional custom is practiced, in which \"flowers, fields, and fruit trees\" are blessed.\nSacraments.\nFrom the early days of Western Christianity, Pentecost became one of the days set aside to celebrate Baptism. In Northern Europe Pentecost was preferred even over Easter for this rite, as the temperatures in late spring might be supposed to be more conducive to outdoor immersion as was then the practice. It is proposed that the term Whit Sunday derives from the custom of the newly baptized wearing white clothing, and from the white vestments worn by the clergy in English liturgical uses. The holiday was also one of the three days each year (along with Christmas and Easter) Roman Catholics were required to confess and receive Holy Communion in order to remain in good ecclesiastical standing.\nHoly Communion is likewise often a feature of the Protestant observance of Pentecost as well. It is one of the relatively few Sundays some Reformed denominations may offer the communion meal, and is one of the days of the year specially appointed among Moravians for the celebration of their Love Feasts. Ordinations are celebrated across a wide array of Western denominations at Pentecost, or near to it. In some denominations, for example the Lutheran Church, even if an ordination or consecration of a deaconess is not celebrated on Pentecost, the liturgical color will invariably be red, and the theme of the service will be the Holy Spirit.\nAbove all, Pentecost is a day to hold Confirmation celebrations for youth. Flowers, the wearing of white robes or white dresses recalling Baptism, rites such as the laying on of hands, and vibrant singing play prominent roles on these joyous occasions, the blossoming of Spring forming an equal analogy with the blossoming of youth.\nRosalia.\nA popular tradition arose in both west and east of decorating the church with roses on Pentecost, leading to a popular designation of Pentecost as or \"Rose Feast\"; in Greek this became (). This led to \"Rusalii\" becoming the Romanian-language term for the feast, as well as the Neapolitan popular designation \"Pasca rusata\" (\"rosey Easter\"). In modern times, the term in Greek refers to the eve of Pentecost, not Pentecost itself; or, in the case of Megara in Attica, to the Monday and Tuesday after \"Pascha\", as roses are often used during the whole liturgical season of the Pentecostarion, not just Pentecost. John Chrysostom warned his flock not to allow this custom to replace spiritually adorning themselves with virtue in reception of the Fruits of the Holy Spirit.\nMariology.\nA secular iconography in both Western and Eastern Churches reflects the belief of the presence of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the day of Pentecost and her central role in the divine concession of the gift of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles.\n confirms the presence of the Mother of Jesus with the Twelve in a spiritual communion of daily prayer. It is the unique reference to the Mother of God after Jesus's entrusting to John the Apostle during the Crucifixion.\nAccording to that iconographic tradition, the Latin encyclical \"Mystici Corporis Christi\" officially stated: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She it was through her powerful prayers obtained that the spirit of our Divine Redeemer, already given on the Cross, should be bestowed, accompanied by miraculous gifts, on the newly founded Church at Pentecost; and finally, bearing with courage and confidence the tremendous burden of her sorrows and desolation, she, truly the Queen of Martyrs, more than all the faithful \"filled up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ...for His Body, which is the Church\"; and she continues to have for the Mystical Body of Christ, born of the pierced Heart of the Savior, the same motherly care and ardent love with which she cherished and fed the Infant Jesus in the crib.\u2014\u200a\nThe Catholic and the Orthodox Churches accord the Mother of God a special form of veneration called \"hyperdulia\". It corresponds to the special power of intercessory prayers dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary over those of all saints. Popes have stated that Mary prayed to God and her intercession was capable to persuade God to send the Holy Spirit as a permanent gift to the Twelve and their successors, thus forming the Apostolic Church.\nIn a similar way, Pope John Paul II, in the general audience held in Vatican on May 28, 1997, affirmed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Retracing the course of the Virgin Mary\u2019s life, the Second Vatican Council recalls her presence in the community waiting for Pentecost. \u201cBut since it had pleased God not to manifest solemnly the mystery of the salvation of the human race before he would pour forth the Spirit promised by Christ, we see the Apostles before the day of Pentecost \u2018persevering with one mind in prayer with the women and Mary the Mother of Jesus, and with his brethren\u2019 (Acts 1:14), and we also see Mary by her prayers imploring the gift of the Spirit, who had already overshadowed her in the Annunciation\u201d (Lumen gentium, n.59). The first community is the prelude to the birth of the Church; the Blessed Virgin\u2019s presence helps to sketch her definitive features, a fruit of the gift of Pentecost. [...]\nIn contemplating Mary\u2019s powerful intercession as she waits for the Holy Spirit, Christians of every age have frequently had recourse to her intercession on the long and tiring journey to salvation, in order to receive the gifts of the Paraclete in greater abundance. [...]\nIn the Church and for the Church, mindful of Jesus\u2019s promise, she waits for Pentecost and implores a multiplicity of gifts for everyone, in accordance with each one's personality and mission.\u2014\u200a\nThe Marian intercessory prayer is dated to the day before Pentecost; while it is not explicitly stated that she was with the Apostles, it is in consideration of the fact she was called \u201cfull of grace\u201d by the Archangel Gabriel at the Annunciation.\nMary's special relationship with the Holy Spirit and her presence at Pentecost gave way to one of her devotional titles being \u201cMother of the Church\u201d. In 2018 Pope Francis designated the Monday after Pentecost each year as the feast of Mary, Mother of the Church.\nMusic.\nSeveral hymns were written and composed for Pentecost, the earliest in use today being \"Veni Creator Spiritus\" in (Come, Creator Spirit), attributed to the 9th-century Rabanus Maurus, and translated throughout the centuries in different languages.\nThis one and some more are suitable also for other occasions imploring the Holy Spirit, such as ordinations and coronations, as well as the beginning of school years.\nClassical compositions.\nThe Lutheran church of the Baroque observed three days of Pentecost. Some composers wrote sacred cantatas to be performed in the church services of these days. Johann Sebastian Bach composed several cantatas for Pentecost, including \"Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten!\" BWV 172, in 1714 and \"Also hat Gott die Welt geliebt\", BWV 68, in 1725. Gottfried Heinrich St\u00f6lzel wrote cantatas such as \"Werdet voll Geistes\" (Get full of spirit) in 1737. Mozart composed an antiphon \"Veni Sancte Spiritus\" in 1768.\nGustav Mahler composed a setting of Maurus' hymn \"Veni, Creator Spiritus\" as the first part of his Symphony No. 8, premiered in 1910.\nOlivier Messiaen composed an organ mass \"Messe de la Pentec\u00f4te\" in 1949/50. In 1964 Fritz Werner wrote an oratorio for Pentecost \"Veni, sancte spiritus\" (Come, Holy Spirit) on the sequence \"Veni Sancte Spiritus\", and Jani Christou wrote \"Tongues of Fire\", a Pentecost oratorio. Richard Hillert wrote a \"Motet for the Day of Pentecost\" for choir, vibraphone, and prepared electronic tape in 1969. Violeta Dinescu composed \"Pfingstoratorium\", an oratorio for Pentecost for five soloists, mixed chorus and small orchestra in 1993. Daniel Elder's 21st century piece, \"Factus est Repente\", for a cappella choir, was premiered in 2013.\nRegional customs and traditions.\nIn Italy it was customary to scatter rose petals from the ceiling of the churches to recall the miracle of the fiery tongues; hence in Sicily and elsewhere in Italy, the feast is called \"Pasqua rosatum\". The Italian name \"Pasqua rossa\" comes from the red colours of the vestments used on Whitsunday.\nIn France it was customary to blow trumpets during Mass, to recall the sound of the mighty wind which accompanied the Descent of the Holy Spirit.\nIn the northwest of England, church and chapel parades called Whit Walks take place at Whitsun (sometimes on Whit Friday, the Friday after Whitsun). Typically, the parades contain brass bands and choirs; girls attending are dressed in white. Traditionally, Whit Fairs (sometimes called Whitsun Ales) took place. Other customs such as morris dancing and cheese rolling are also associated with Whitsun.\nIn Hungary the day (called P\u00fcnk\u00f6sd in Hungarian) is surrounded by many unique rites, which probably have their origins in ancient Hungarian customs. The girls dressed in festive costumes choose a Little Queen (Kiskir\u00e1lyn\u00e9 not to be confused with the P\u00fcnk\u00f6sdi Kir\u00e1lyn\u00e9), who is raised high. Then a figure dressed as an animal appears and dies, and is brought back to life by his attendant chanting a joke incantation.\nIn Finland there is a saying known virtually by everyone which translates as \"if one has no sweetheart until Pentecost, he/she will not have it during the whole summer.\"\nIn Port Vila, the capital of Vanuatu, people originating from Pentecost Island usually celebrate their island's name-day with a special church service followed by cultural events such as dancing.\nIn (Catholic) southern Germany (and to a lesser part in Lower Saxony) very young birch trees are cut and these and leaved birch stems surround churches and other holy places, having evolved from planting birch tees to evade evil spirits (Pfingstbaumpflanzen).\nIn Ukraine the springtime feast day of \"Zeleni Sviata\" became associated with the Pentecost. (The exact origin of the relationship is not known). The customs for the festival were performed in the following order: first, home and hearth would be cleaned; second, foods were prepared for the festival; finally, homes and churches were decorated with wildflowers and various types of green herbs and plants. A seven course meal may have been served as the Pentecost feast which may have included traditional dishes such as cereal with honey (\"kolyvo\"), rice or millet grains with milk, sauerkraut soup (\"kapusniak\"), chicken broth with handmade noodles (\"yushka z zaterkoiu\"), cheese turnovers (\"pyrizhky z syrom\"), roast pork, buckwheat pancakes served with eggs and cheese (\"mlyntsi\"), and baked kasha.\nDate and public holiday.\nThe earliest possible date is May 10 (as in 1818 and 2285). The latest possible date is June 13 (as in 1943 and 2038). The day of Pentecost is seven weeks after Easter Sunday: that is to say, the fiftieth day after Easter inclusive of Easter Sunday. Pentecost may also refer to the 50 days from Easter to Pentecost Sunday inclusive of both. Because Easter itself has no fixed date, this makes Pentecost a moveable feast. In the United Kingdom, traditionally the next day, Whit Monday, was until 1970 a public holiday. Since 1971, by statute, the last Monday in May has been a Bank Holiday.\nWhile Eastern Christianity treats Pentecost as the last day of Easter in its liturgies, in the Roman liturgy it is usually a separate feast. The fifty days from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday may also be called Eastertide.\nSince Pentecost itself is on a Sunday, it is automatically considered to be a public holiday in countries with large Christian denominations. However, in Hungary, it is distinguished from a regular Sunday due to the stricter trading laws, forcing most businesses to close on even if they are normally open on Sundays (the same restrictions apply to the following Monday).\nPentecost Monday is a public holiday in many countries including Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Benin, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania (since 2008), Senegal, (most parts of) Switzerland, Togo and Ukraine. It is also a public holiday in Catalonia, where it is known as \"la Segona Pasqua\" (Second Easter).\nIn Sweden it was also a public holiday, but Pentecost Monday (Annandag Pingst) was replaced by Swedish National Day on June 6, by a government decision on December 15, 2004. In Italy and Malta, it is no longer a public holiday. It was a public holiday in Ireland until 1973, when it was replaced by Early Summer Holiday on the first Monday in June. In the United Kingdom the day is known as Whit Monday, and was a bank holiday until 1967 when it was replaced by the Spring Bank Holiday on the last Monday in May. In France, following reactions to the implementation of the \"Journ\u00e9e de solidarit\u00e9 envers les personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es\", Pentecost Monday has been reestablished as a regular (not as a \"working\") holiday on May 3, 2005.\nLiterary allusions.\nAccording to legend, King Arthur always gathered all his knights at the round table for a feast and a quest on Pentecost:\nSo ever the king had a custom that at the feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year, he would not go that day to meat until he had heard or seen of a great marvel.\nGerman poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe declared Pentecost \"das liebliche Fest\" \u2013 the lovely feast, in a selection by the same name in his \"Reineke Fuchs\".\nPfingsten, das liebliche Fest, war gekommen;\nes gr\u00fcnten und bl\u00fchten Feld und Wald;\nauf H\u00fcgeln und H\u00f6hn, in B\u00fcschen und Hecken\n\u00dcbten ein fr\u00f6hliches Lied die neuermunterten V\u00f6gel;\nJede Wiese sprosste von Blumen in duftenden Gr\u00fcnden,\nFestlich heiter gl\u00e4nzte der Himmel und farbig die Erde.\n\"Pfingsten, das liebliche Fest\", speaks of Pentecost as a time of greening and blooming in fields, woods, hills, mountains, bushes and hedges, of birds singing new songs, meadows sprouting fragrant flowers, and of festive sunshine gleaming from the skies and coloring the earth \u2013 iconic lines idealizing the Pentecost holidays in the German-speaking lands.\nFurther, Goethe records an old peasant proverb relating to Pentecost in his \"Sankt-Rochus-Fest zu Bingen\"\n\u2013 \"Ripe strawberries at Pentecost mean a good wine crop.\"\nAlexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re mentions of Pentecost in \"Twenty Years After\" (French: Vingt ans apr\u00e8s), the sequel to \"The Three Musketeers\". A meal is planned for the holiday, to which La Ram\u00e9e, second in command of the prison, is invited, and by which contrivance, the Duke is able to escape. He speaks sarcastically of the festival to his jailor, foreshadowing his escape : \"Now, what has Pentecost to do with me? Do you fear, say, that the Holy Ghost may come down in the form of fiery tongues and open the gates of my prison?\"\nWilliam Shakespeare mentions Pentecost in a line from \"Romeo and Juliet\" Act 1, Scene V. At the ball at his home, Capulet speaks in refuting an overestimate of the time elapsed since he last danced: \"What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much! 'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.\" Note here the allusion to the tradition of mumming, Morris dancing and wedding celebrations at Pentecost.\n\"The Whitsun Weddings\" is one of Philip Larkin's most famous poems, describing a train journey made through England on a Whitsun weekend.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

What\u00ec is located by Lac La Martre, about northwest of the territorial capital of Yellowknife.\nHistory.\nWith rich and varied wildlife, the area has long been a favoured hunting ground of the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (Dogrib Dene) Indigenous people. The North West Company established a trading post there in 1793, and many natives began settling there permanently, while they continued to hunt and fish in the area. With the establishment of a trading post at Fort Rae on Great Slave Lake in the late 19th century, most regional trading was accomplished at the Hudson's Bay Company and free traders posts there. A trading post at Lac La Martre was not again established until the 1920s.\nOn January 1, 1996, the community officially changed its name from Lac La Martre to the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb name \"Wha Ti\", meaning \"Marten Lake,\" the same meaning as the French and then on August 4, 2005 to the current spelling. Other traditional T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb names for the settlement include Tsoti ('fouled water lake') and Mine Go Kola ('net fishing with houses').\nBefore 2005, the community was unincorporated, and local governance was provided by a First Nations band government, Wha Ti First Nation. Under the terms of the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb Agreement, most responsibilities of Wha Ti have been transferred to a new What\u00ec Community Government. However, the First Nation is still recognized by the federal government for Indian Act enrollment.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, What\u00ec had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of .

{"id": "45976", "revid": "18481282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45976", "title": "Compromise of 1850", "text": "American political compromise\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Events leading to the American Civil War\nThe Compromise of 1850 was a package of five separate bills passed by the United States Congress in September 1850 that temporarily defused tensions between slave and free states during the years leading up to the American Civil War. Designed by Whig senator Henry Clay and Democratic senator Stephen A. Douglas, with the support of President Millard Fillmore, the compromise centered on how to handle slavery in recently acquired territories from the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348).\nThe provisions of the compromise included a provision that approved California's request to enter the Union as a free state, and strengthened fugitive slave laws with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. The compromise also banned the slave trade in Washington, D.C. (while still allowing slavery itself there), defined northern and western borders for Texas while establishing a territorial government for the Territory of New Mexico, with no restrictions on whether any future state from this territory would be a free or slave state and established a territorial government for the Territory of Utah also with no restrictions on if the territory would become a slave or free state.\nA debate over slavery in the territories erupted during the Mexican\u2013American War, as many Southerners sought to expand slavery to the newly acquired lands and many Northerners opposed any such expansion. The debate was further complicated by Texas's claim to all former Mexican territory north and east of the Rio Grande, including areas it had never effectively controlled. These issues prevented the passage of organic acts to create organized territorial governments for the land acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War. In early 1850, Clay proposed a package of eight bills that would settle most of the pressing issues before Congress. Clay's proposal was opposed by President Zachary Taylor, anti-slavery Whigs like William Seward, and pro-slavery Democrats like John C. Calhoun, and congressional debate over the territories continued. The debates over the bill are among the most famous in Congressional history, and the divisions devolved into fistfights and drawn guns on the floor of Congress.\nAfter Taylor died and was succeeded by Fillmore, Douglas took the lead in passing Clay's compromise through Congress as five separate bills. Under the compromise, Texas surrendered its claims to present-day New Mexico and other states in return for federal assumption of Texas's public debt. California was admitted as a free state, while the remaining portions of the Mexican Cession were organized into New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory. Under the concept of popular sovereignty, the people of each territory would decide whether or not slavery would be permitted. The compromise also included a more stringent Fugitive Slave Law and banned the slave trade in Washington, D.C. The issue of slavery in the territories would be re-opened by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act (1854), but the Compromise of 1850 played a major role in postponing the Civil War.\nBackground.\nThe Republic of Texas declared its independence from Mexico following the Texas Revolution of 1836, and, partly because Texas had been settled by a large number of Americans, there was a strong sentiment in both Texas and the United States for the annexation of Texas by the United States. In December 1845, President James K. Polk signed a resolution annexing Texas, and Texas became the 28th state in the union. Polk, an expansionist and slave owner, sought further expansion through the acquisition of the Mexican province of Alta California, which represented new lands to settle as well as a potential gateway to trade in Asia. His administration attempted to purchase California from Mexico, but the annexation of Texas stoked tensions between Mexico and the United States. Relations between the two countries were further complicated by Texas's claim to all land north of the Rio Grande; Mexico argued that the more northern Nueces River was the proper Texan border.\nIn March 1846, a skirmish broke out on the northern side of the Rio Grande, ending in the death or capture of dozens of American soldiers. Shortly thereafter, the United States declared war on Mexico, beginning the Mexican\u2013American War. In August 1846, Polk asked Congress for an appropriation that he hoped to use as a down payment for the purchase of California in a treaty with Mexico, igniting a debate over the status of future territories. A freshman Democratic Representative, David Wilmot of Pennsylvania, offered an amendment known as the Wilmot Proviso that would ban slavery in any newly acquired lands. The Wilmot Proviso was defeated in the Senate, but it injected the slavery debate into national politics.\nIn September 1847, an American army under General Winfield Scott captured the Mexican capital in the Battle for Mexico City. Several months later, Mexican and American negotiators agreed to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, under which Mexico agreed to recognize the Rio Grande as Texas's southern border and to cede Alta California and New Mexico. The Missouri Compromise had settled the issue of the geographic reach of slavery within the Louisiana Purchase territories by prohibiting slavery in states north of 36\u00b030\u2032 latitude, and Polk sought to extend this line into the newly acquired territory. However, the divisive issue of slavery blocked any such legislation. As his term came to a close, Polk signed the lone territorial bill passed by Congress, which established the Territory of Oregon and banned slavery in it. Polk declined to seek re-election in the 1848 presidential election, and the 1848 election was won by the Whig ticket of Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore.\nProphetically, Ralph Waldo Emerson quipped that \"Mexico will poison us\", referring to the ensuing divisions around whether the newly conquered lands would be slave or free. At the moment when Taylor was elected in 1848, the issue was not yet apparent. Taylor was both a Whig and a slaveholder; though Whigs were increasingly anti-slavery, Taylor's slaveholding had reassured the South, and he won handily. Taylor made a key electoral promise that he would not veto any congressional resolution on slavery. Much to the horror of Southerners, however, Taylor indicated that true to his promise, he would not even veto the Wilmot Proviso if it were passed. Tensions accelerated quickly into the fall of 1849. Midterm elections worsened matters, as the Free Soil Party had gained 12 seats, which gave it a king-maker position in the closely divided House: 105 Whigs to 112 Democrats. After three weeks and 62 ballots, the House could not elect a speaker; the main issue was slavery in the new territories. The tumult of that period was severe, with a loaded revolver drawn on the floor of Congress, several fistfights between Northerners and Southerners, and then Senator Jefferson Davis challenging an Illinois representative to a duel. Southern representatives increasingly bandied around the idea of secession. Finally, the House adopted a resolution that allowed a speaker to be elected with a plurality, and elected Howell Cobb on the 63rd ballot. As James McPherson puts it: \"It was an inauspicious start to the 1850's.\"\nIssues.\nThree major types of issues were addressed by the Compromise of 1850: a variety of boundary issues, the status of territory issues, and the issue of slavery. While capable of analytical distinction, the boundary and territory issues were included in the overarching issue of slavery. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests were each concerned with both the amount of land on which slavery was permitted and with the number of States in the slave or free camps. Since Texas was a slave state, not only the residents of that state but also both camps on a national scale had an interest in the size of Texas.\nTexas.\nThe independent Republic of Texas won the decisive Battle of San Jacinto (April 21, 1836) against Mexico and captured Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. He signed the Treaties of Velasco, which recognized the Rio Grande as the boundary of the Republic of Texas. The treaties were then repudiated by the government of Mexico, which insisted that Mexico remained sovereign over Texas since Santa Anna had signed the treaty under coercion, and promised to reclaim the lost territories. To the extent that there was a \"de facto\" recognition, Mexico treated the Nueces River as its northern boundary control. A vast, largely unsettled area lay between the two rivers. Neither Mexico nor the Republic of Texas had the military strength to assert its territorial claim. On December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States and became the 28th state. To facilitate US annexation, Sam Houston played a ploy on the American government by flirting with the British. The British believed that they could make the state abolish slavery by purchasing it. However, Southern leaders, alarmed by the threat of British emancipation of Texan slaves, pushed harder for annexation. Eventually, John Tyler, in hopes of appealing to southern Democrats, led the push for annexation with Abel Upshur. Texas was staunchly committed to slavery, with its constitution making it illegal for the legislature to free slaves.\nThe United States inherited the Texas-Mexican boundary dispute after annexing Texas, which quickly led to the Mexican-American War. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war, defined the new Mexico\u2013United States border, which followed the Rio Grande in part, but made no specific reference the claims of the Republic of Texas. The southwestern part of the ceded territory was referred to as the Mexican Cession; but the boundaries between this Cession and the State of Texas were unclear, and Texas continued to claim all the territory north and east of the Rio Grande, which included a large stretch of land that it had never effectively controlled in present-day eastern New Mexico. New Mexico had long prohibited slavery, a fact that affected the debate over its territorial status, but many New Mexican leaders opposed joining Texas primarily because Texas's capital lay hundreds of miles away and because Texas and New Mexico had a history of conflict dating back to the 1841 Santa Fe Expedition. Outside of Texas, many Southern leaders supported Texas's claims to New Mexico, in order to secure as much territory as possible for the expansion of slavery.\nAnother issue that would affect the compromise was Texas's debt; it had approximately $10 million in debt left over from its time as an independent nation, and that debt would become a factor in the debates over the territories.\nCalifornia.\nCalifornia was part of the Mexican Cession. After the Mexican War, California was essentially run by military governors. President James K. Polk tried to get Congress to establish a territorial government in California officially, but the increasingly sectional debates prevented that. The South wanted to extend slave territory to Southern California and to the Pacific Coast, but the North did not. The issue of whether it would be free or slave might well have gone undecided for years, as it had already after the end of the Mexican American war, if not for the finding of natural riches.\nNear the end of Polk's term in 1848, incredible news reached Washington: gold had been discovered in California. So began the California Gold Rush, which transformed California from a sleepy and almost forgotten land into a burgeoning hub with a population bigger than Delaware or Florida. The mostly lawless land found itself in desperate need of governance. Californians wanted to be made into a territory or state promptly. In response to growing demand for a better more representative government, a Constitutional Convention was held in 1849. The delegates unanimously outlawed slavery. They had no interest in extending the Missouri Compromise Line through California and splitting the state; the lightly populated southern half never had slavery and was heavily Hispanic. The issue of California would play a central role in the exhausting 1849 speaker dispute.\nOther issues.\nAside from the disposition of the territories, other issues had risen to prominence during the Taylor years. The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 in part due to improving means of transportation, as the enslaved used roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied by the lack of due process in these cases, had passed personal liberty laws that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South. Congress also faced the issue of Utah, which like California and New Mexico, had been ceded by Mexico. Utah was inhabited largely by Latter-day Saints whose then-practice of polygamy was unpopular elsewhere in the United States.\nPassage.\nTaylor takes office.\nWhen Taylor took office, the issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession remained unresolved. While a Southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. In Taylor's view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. In October 1849, a California constitutional convention unanimously agreed to join the Union\u2014and to ban slavery within their borders. In his December 1849 State of the Union report, Taylor endorsed California's and New Mexico's applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and \"should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character\".\nMain figures.\nThe problem of what to do with the territories became the leading issue in Congress. So began the most famous debates in the history of Congress. At the head were the three titans of Congress: Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun. All had been born during the American Revolution, and had carried the torch of the Founding Fathers. This represented their last and greatest act in politics. The nationalists Clay and Webster sought compromise, while Southern sectionalist Calhoun warned of imminent disaster. The triumvirate would be broken before long as Calhoun would die of tuberculosis. In March, shortly before his death, his final speech was delivered by his friend, Virginia Senator James M. Mason, as the blanket-wrapped Calhoun sat nearby, too weak to do it himself. He provided a prescient warning that the South perceived the balance between North and South as broken, and that any further imbalance might lead to war. The situation was severe.\nOther players included a variety of rising politicians who would play key roles in the Civil War, such as the staunch anti-slavery William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase, who would be in Lincoln's cabinet, the future president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, and rival to Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas.\nClay proposes compromise.\nOn January 29, 1850, Senator Henry Clay introduced a plan which combined the major subjects under discussion. His legislative package of eight bills included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. Clay had originally favored voting on each of his proposals separately, but Senator Henry S. Foote of Mississippi convinced him to combine the proposals regarding California's admission and the disposition of Texas's borders into one bill. Clay hoped that this combination of measures would convince House members from both North and South to support the overall package of laws even if they objected to specific provisions. Clay's proposal attracted the support of some Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs, but it lacked the backing necessary to win passage, and debate over the bill continued. Seven months of agonizing politicking lay ahead.\nOpposition.\nPresident Taylor opposed the compromise and continued to call for immediate statehood for both California and New Mexico. Senator Calhoun and some other Southern leaders argued that the compromise was biased against the South because it would lead to the creation of new free states. Most Northern Whigs, led by William Henry Seward, who delivered his famous \"Higher Law\" speech during the controversy, opposed the Compromise as well because it would apply the Wilmot Proviso to the western territories and because of the pressing of ordinary citizens into duty on slave-hunting patrols. That provision was inserted by Democratic Virginia Senator James M. Mason to entice border-state Whigs, who faced the greatest danger of losing slaves as fugitives but were lukewarm on general sectional issues related to the South on Texas's land claims.\nDebate and results.\nOn April 17, a \"Committee of Thirteen\" agreed on the border of Texas as part of Clay's plan. The dimensions were later changed. That same day, during debates on the measures in the Senate, Vice President Fillmore and Senator Benton verbally sparred, with Fillmore charging that the Missourian was \"out of order.\" During the heated debates, Compromise floor leader Henry S. Foote of Mississippi drew a pistol on Benton.\nIn early June, nine slave-holding Southern states sent delegates to the Nashville Convention to determine their course of action if the compromise passed. While some delegates preached secession, the moderates ruled and proposed a series of compromises, including extending the dividing line designated by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 to the Pacific Coast.\nTaylor died in July 1850, and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore, who had privately come to support Clay's proposal. The various bills were initially combined into one \"omnibus\" bill. Despite Clay's efforts, it failed in a crucial vote on July 31, opposed by southern Democrats and by northern Whigs. He announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to pass each part of the bill. The 73-year-old Clay, however, was physically exhausted as the effects of tuberculosis, which would eventually kill him, began to take their toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in Newport, Rhode Island, and Senator Stephen A. Douglas took the lead in attempting to pass Clay's proposals through the Senate.\nFillmore, anxious to find a quick solution to the conflict in Texas over the border with New Mexico, which threatened to become an armed conflict between Texas militia and the federal soldiers, reversed the administration's position late in July and threw its support to the compromise measures. At the same time, Fillmore denied Texas's claims to New Mexico, asserting that the United States had promised to protect the territorial integrity of New Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Fillmore's forceful response helped convince Texas's U.S. Senators, Sam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk, to support Stephen Douglas's compromise. With their support, a Senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas's borders won passage days after Fillmore delivered his message. Under the terms of the bill, the U.S. would assume Texas's debts, while Texas's northern border was set at the 36\u00b0 30' parallel north (the Missouri Compromise line) and much of its western border followed the 103rd meridian. The bill attracted the support of a bipartisan coalition of Whigs and Democrats from both sections, though most opposition to the bill came from the South. The Senate quickly moved on to the other major issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law.\nThe debate then moved to the House of Representatives, where Fillmore, Senator Daniel Webster, Douglas, Representative Linn Boyd, and Speaker of the House Howell Cobb took the lead in convincing members to support the compromise bills that had been passed in the Senate. The Senate's proposed settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary faced intense opposition from many Southerners, as well as from some Northerners who believed that Texas did not deserve monetary compensation. After a series of close votes that nearly delayed consideration of the issue, the House voted to approve a Texas bill similar to that which had been passed by the Senate. Following that vote, the House and the Senate quickly agreed on each of the major issues, including the banning of the slave trade in Washington. The president quickly signed each bill into law save for the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850; he ultimately signed that law as well after Attorney General Crittenden assured him that the law was constitutional. Though some in Texas still favored sending a military expedition into New Mexico, in November 1850 the state legislature voted to accept the compromise.\nProvisions.\nThe general solution that was adopted by the Compromise of 1850 was to transfer a considerable part of the territory claimed by Texas state to the federal government; to organize two new territories formally, the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah, which expressly would be allowed to locally determine whether they would become slave or free territories, to add another free state to the Union (California), to adopt a severe measure to recover slaves who had escaped to a free state or free territory (the Fugitive Slave Law); and to abolish the slave trade in the District of Columbia. A key provision of each of the laws respectively organizing the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah was that slavery would be decided by local option, called popular sovereignty. That was an important repudiation of the idea behind the failure to prohibit slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. However, the admission of California as a free state meant that Southerners were giving up their goal of a coast-to-coast belt of slave states.\nSettlement of borders.\nTexas was allowed to keep the following portions of the disputed land: south of the 32nd parallel and south of the 36\u00b030' parallel north and east of the 103rd meridian west. The rest of the disputed land was transferred to the United States. The final border was designed to keep the frontier settlement of El Paso in Texas, since despite that settlement's geographic, historic, and economic ties to New Mexico, Texas had recently established a county government in El Paso and thus successfully claimed it as an integral part of Texas. A similar attempt to keep Santa Fe in Texas failed, and Santa Fe became part of the New Mexico territory. The United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 3) does not permit Congress unilaterally to reduce the territory of any state, so the first part of the Compromise of 1850 had to take the form of an offer to the Texas State Legislature, rather than a unilateral enactment. This ratified the bargain and, in due course, the transfer of a broad swath of land from the state of Texas to the federal government was accomplished. In return for Texas's giving up this land, the United States assumed the debts of Texas.\nFrom the Mexican Cession, the New Mexico Territory received most of the present-day state of Arizona, most of the western part of the present-day state of New Mexico, and the southern tip of present-day Nevada (south of the 37th parallel). The territory also received most of present-day eastern New Mexico, a portion of present-day Colorado (east of the crest of the Rocky Mountains, west of the 103rd meridian, and south of the 38th parallel); all of this land had been claimed by Texas.\nFrom the Mexican Cession, the Utah Territory received present-day Utah, most of present-day Nevada (everything north of the 37th parallel), a major part of present-day Colorado (everything west of the crest of the Rocky Mountains), and a small part of present-day Wyoming. That included the newly founded colony at Salt Lake, of Brigham Young. The Utah Territory also received some land that had been claimed by Texas; this land is now part of present-day Colorado that is east of the crest of the Rocky Mountains.\nFugitive Slave Act.\nPerhaps the most important part of the Compromise received the least attention during debates. Enacted September 18, 1850, it is informally known as the Fugitive Slave Law, or the Fugitive Slave Act. It bolstered the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. The new version of the Fugitive Slave Law now required federal judicial officials in all states and federal territories, including free states, to assist with the return of escaped slaves to their masters in slave states. Any federal marshal or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave was liable to a fine of $1,000 (). Law enforcement everywhere in the US now had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a fugitive slave on no more evidence than a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. Suspected slaves could neither ask for a jury trial nor testify on their own behalf. Also, aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was now a crime nationwide, punished by six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Officers capturing a fugitive slave were entitled to a fee for their work, and this expense was to be paid by the Federal Government.\nThe law was so completely pro-slavery as to prohibit the admission of the testimony of a person accused of being an escaped slave into evidence at the judicial hearing to determine the status of the accused escaped slave. Thus, if free Blacks were claimed to be escaped slaves, they could not resist their return to slavery (or enslavement for the first time) by truthfully telling their actual history. Furthermore, the federal commissioners overseeing the hearings were paid $5 for ruling that a person was free, but were paid $10 for determining that he or she was a slave, thus providing a financial incentive to rule in favor of slavery regardless of the evidence. The law further exacerbated the problem of free Blacks being kidnapped and sold as slaves.\nThe Fugitive Slave Act was essential to meet Southern demands. In terms of public opinion in the North, the critical provision was that ordinary citizens were required to aid slave catchers and that it was a crime to assist a fugitive. Many Northerners deeply resented these provisions. The violent process of returning slaves to the South made the act abhorrent to many Northerners. Resentment towards the Act further heightened tensions between the North and South, which were then inflamed further by abolitionists such as Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her novel, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", stressed the horrors of recapturing escaped slaves and outraged Southerners.\nEnd of slave trade in District of Columbia.\nA statute enacted as part of the compromise prohibited the slave trade in Washington, D.C., but not slave ownership. Southerners in Congress, alarmed and outraged, were unanimous in opposing the provision, seen as a concession to the abolitionists and a bad precedent, but they were outvoted. However, Washington's residents could still easily buy and sell slaves in the nearby states of Virginia and Maryland.\nImplications.\nPassage of the Compromise of 1850, as it came to be known, caused celebration in Washington and elsewhere, with crowds shouting, \"The Union is saved!\" Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a \"final settlement\" of sectional issues, though the future of slavery in New Mexico and Utah remained unclear. The admission of new states, or the organization of territories in the remaining unorganized portion of the Louisiana Purchase, could also potentially reopen the polarizing debate over slavery.\nNot all accepted the Compromise of 1850. Longing for the former national influence of the South, a South Carolina newspaper wrote, \"the Rubicon is passed ... and the Southern States are now vassals in this Confederacy.\" (This was not referring to the then-future Confederate States of America; many still considered the United States a confederacy at the time.) Many Northerners, meanwhile, were displeased by the Fugitive Slave Act. The debate over slavery in the territories would be re-opened in 1854 through the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. It continued throughout the late 1850s, which culminated in one of the more well-known debates over slavery, the Lincoln-Douglas debates.\nIn hindsight, the Compromise merely postponed the American Civil War for a decade, contrary to the expectations of many at the time, who felt the issue of slavery had finally been settled. During that decade, the Whig Party completely broke down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North, while Democrats reigned in the South.\nOthers argue that the Compromise only made the pre-existing sectional divisions more obvious, and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law as helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the consequences of the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the Antebellum period. The deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, also contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.\nThe delay of hostilities for ten years allowed the Northern states to continue to industrialize. The Southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability to industrialize heavily.\nAccording to historian Mark Stegmaier, \"The Fugitive Slave Act, the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia, the admission of California as a free state, and even the application of the formula of popular sovereignty to the territories were all less important than the least remembered component of the Compromise of 1850\u2014the statute by which Texas relinquished its claims to much of New Mexico in return for federal assumption of the debts.\"\nOther proposals.\nProposals in 1846 to 1850 on the division of the Southwest included the following (some of which are not mutually exclusive):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She rose to prominence in the 1990s as a member of the pop group the Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Posh Spice. After the Spice Girls disbanded in 2001, Beckham signed with Virgin Records, to release her self-titled debut solo album, which produced two UK Top 10 singles. Beckham has also become an internationally recognised style icon and fashion designer.\nBeckham has starred in seven official documentaries and reality shows, including \"Victoria's Secrets\" (2000), \"Being Victoria Beckham\" (2002), \"The Real Beckhams\" (2003), \"Victoria Beckham \u2013 A Mile in Their Shoes\" (2004), \"\" (2007), \"Beckham\" (2023), and the Netflix documentary \"Victoria Beckham\" (2025). She is married to former association football player Sir David Beckham, and they have four children, including Brooklyn and Romeo. As of May 2019, the couple's joint wealth is estimated at \u00a3355\u00a0million. \nFollowing high-profile collaborations with other brands, Beckham launched an eponymous label in 2008, and a lower-priced (diffusion) label in 2011. The Victoria Beckham label was named designer brand of the year in the UK in 2011; in 2012 the brand was assessed as the star performer in the Beckham family's business interests. Writing in the \"Daily Telegraph\" in 2011, Belinda White noted that the transition from WAG to fashion designer had been more successful than most had predicted, saying: \"She has gathered a significant celebrity following and won over the scathing fashion pack who now clamour for a ticket to her bi-annual show at New York Fashion Week.\" Beckham was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the fashion industry.\nEarly life.\nVictoria Caroline Adams was born on 17 April 1974 at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, England, and raised in Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire. She is the eldest of three children of Jacqueline Doreen (n\u00e9e Cannon), a former insurance clerk and hairdresser, and Anthony William Adams, who worked as an electronics engineer. They founded an electronics wholesale business which allowed a comfortable upbringing for Victoria, her sister, Louise, and her brother, Christian Adams. Beckham's great-great-great-grandfather was German artist and revolutionary Carl Heinrich Pf\u00e4nder and her great-great-great-granduncle was Minnesota politician William Pfaender.\nAfter watching the musical film \"Fame\" in 1980, she decided to pursue a musical career. Jacqueline and Anthony Adams enrolled her at Jason Theatre School. In 1991, Beckham entered Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom, Surrey and studied dance and modelling. Beckham attended St. Mary's High School in Cheshunt, where she was embarrassed by her family's wealth and often begged her father not to drop her off outside the school in their Rolls-Royce. Eventually, she became a member of a band called Persuasion.\nMusic career.\n1994\u20132000: Spice Girls.\nBeckham auditioned for a March 1994 advertisement in \"The Stage\" which required girls who were \"street smart, extrovert[ed], ambitious and able to sing and dance\". In 1994, Beckham joined the all-female group, the Spice Girls. In the recordings before her marriage, she is credited with her maiden name as Victoria Adams. The group's first single was called \"Wannabe\" (1996), and she worked alongside Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Mel B and Melanie C. It went to number one in the United Kingdom and United States, and another 35 countries. It was followed by eight further number one singles from their albums \"Spice\", \"Spiceworld\" and \"Forever\". Each member of the group received a nickname from the media and Beckham was named \"Posh Spice\". The group is the best-selling female group of all time, selling over 80\u00a0million records worldwide. After the release of their third album, \"Forever\", which charted at number two in the UK but was far less successful than their previous two albums, the Spice Girls stopped recording, concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future.\n2000\u20132002: \"Victoria Beckham\".\nOn 14 August 2000, Beckham released her first solo single, \"Out of Your Mind\" in collaboration with Dane Bowers and Truesteppers. The week of release coincided with the release of \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" by Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor, resulting in a chart battle dubbed 'Posh vs. Posher' by the tabloids. Before the single's release, on 8 July 2000, Beckham made her public solo debut at London's Hyde Park at a concert to raise money for the Prince's Trust charity. She sang \"Out of Your Mind\" to a 100,000-strong audience. Beckham then signed a recording contract with her group label Virgin Records. Her next single as a solo artist, \"Not Such An Innocent Girl\", was released on 17 September 2001. Again, she faced competition in another hugely hyped chart battle, this time with Kylie Minogue's single \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\". Despite a huge promotional campaign, Beckham was outsold eight to one, and her single debuted at number 6. Beckham's eponymous debut album, which was released on 1 October 2001, reached Number 10 in the UK album chart. The album cost a reputed \u00a35\u00a0million to produce and it sold a modest 50,000 copies.\nThe second and final single to be released from the album was \"A Mind of Its Own\" on 11 February 2002. The single reached number 6 in the UK and sold 56,500 copies. Rumours soon spread that Beckham was to be dropped by her label for not charting in the Top Three. These were strongly denied at the time. Beckham commented \"You know what newspapers are like, they just like to put all the negative stuff in, but as far as I'm concerned and the record company is concerned it is all great.\" A third single, \"I Wish\", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on \"Friday Night's All Wright\". Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B, but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: \"No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue.\"\n2002\u20132004: Unreleased albums and final solo releases.\nIn 2002, Beckham signed a contract with Telstar Records and 19 Management worth \u00a31.5\u00a0million. In 2002, she began recording an electropop-influenced album, tentatively titled \"Open Your Eyes\". However, desiring a more urban sound, she began working with producer Damon Dash the following year on R&amp;B and hip hop influenced tracks for an album tentatively titled \"Come Together.\" The Dash-produced track \"It's That Simple\" featuring M.O.P. premiered on radio stations in July 2003 as a promotional single, generating mixed reviews. Beckham's first single with Telstar, the double A-side \"Let Your Head Go\" / \"This Groove\", was released in the UK on 29 December 2003, utilizing one song from both projects: \"Let Your Head Go\" from \"Open Your Eyes\" and \"This Groove\" from \"Come Together.\" The release received heavy promotion and many TV appearances across the Christmas period and charted at number three in the UK. Outside of the UK, Simon Fuller reportedly had planned to market Beckham\u2019s music in the US. In April 2004, Telstar announced bankruptcy and both albums were cancelled, while Beckham, disappointed with wasted time in studio, gave up music to focus on her fashion career. The albums were never released, but have since leaked online in their entirety.\n2007\u20132012: Return of the Spice Girls.\nIn 2007, the Spice Girls reformed and announced plans to embark upon a reunion tour, from which they were said to have earned \u00a310\u00a0million each (approximately $20\u00a0million). Beckham had previously stated that she and her former Spice colleagues were enjoying their solo careers in various fields, saying \"We're all still doing our own thing.\" Their \"Greatest Hits\" album was released in early-November 2007 and the tour began on 2 December 2007. At its advent, Beckham said \"I wanted my children to see that Mummy was a pop star. It was the last opportunity for them to stand in a crowd full of people screaming for the Spice Girls.\" When Beckham had her hair coloured brown for the tour, she stated that her sons immediately reacted by saying \"Oh my goodness, it's Posh Spice. She's back.\"\nFilm-maker Bob Smeaton directed an official film of the tour titled \"Spice Girls: Giving You Everything\", which was first aired on Fox8 in Australia. It later aired in the UK, on 31 December 2007 on BBC One. As well as their sell-out tour, the Spice Girls were contracted to appear in Tesco advertisements, for which they were paid \u00a31\u00a0million each.\nIn October 2009, reports suggested that the Spice Girls were to star in a reality show in which they would cast female actors to play their roles in a musical. The following year, Judy Craymer teamed up with the Spice Girls and Simon Fuller to start developing a Spice Girls musical titled \"Viva Forever!\". On 26 June 2012, all five Spice Girls were in attendance at a press conference in London to promote the launch of \"Viva Forever!\" The musical opened at the West End's Piccadilly Theatre on 11 December 2012. On 12 August 2012, after much speculation, Beckham and the Spice Girls performed a medley of \"Wannabe\" and \"Spice Up Your Life\" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting solely for the event. Their performance was the most tweeted moment of Olympics closing ceremony with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute.\nThe band reunited again for a 2019 tour, however Beckham opted not to participate in the reunion choosing to focus on her fashion label instead. When the American television presenter Ellen DeGeneres asked her why she chose not to join with the other Spice Girls for the reunion tour, she said \"It just didn't feel like the right thing to do. [But] I'll always be Posh Spice, always.\"\nFashion.\nBeckham made a guest appearance on the catwalk for Maria Grachvogel on 17 February 2000, marking her debut as a model at London Fashion Week. Beckham also acted as a British ambassador for Dolce and Gabbana and was briefly the face of Rocawear in 2003. Beckham designed a limited-edition fashion line for Rock &amp; Republic called VB Rocks in 2004, consisting mainly of jeans for the high end of the market, retailing at approximately $300 in the US.\nOn 16 January 2006, Beckham walked the runway for Roberto Cavalli at Milan Fashion Week, and was for a period exclusively dressed by him for red-carpet and social events. For the March 2006 issue of \"Harper's Bazaar\", Beckham acted as fashion editor when she styled her close friend, Katie Holmes, for a fashion shoot. She has admitted to a personal love of sunglasses, saying \"I'm quite obsessed with sunglasses. I collect vintage Guccis and Carreras \u2013 they can make virtually any outfit look cool.\" After Beckham's departure from Rock &amp; Republic, in September 2006, she furthered her fashion ventures by launching her own denim label, dvb Style. Beckham then launched a new official website, dvbstyle.com to promote her fashion work.\nOn 14 June 2007, Beckham launched dvb Denim collection in New York at Saks Fifth Avenue, along with unveiling her eyewear range in the United States for the first time. In the same month, Beckham made her first appearance at London's annual Graduate Fashion Week as a judge alongside Glenda Bailey (editor-in-chief of \"Harper's Bazaar\") and Lanvin's Alber Elbaz, to choose the winner of the River Island Gold Award, worth \u00a320,000. In August 2007, Intimately Beckham perfume was launched into US stores, one of more than 20 perfumes she and David Beckham have introduced over the years. In September 2007 her cosmetics line V-Sculpt was launched in Tokyo. In a 2007 appearance at an LA Galaxy press conference, Beckham is credited with having popularised Roland Mouret's 'moon dress' and his brand, and Beckham was also the face of Marc Jacobs for his Spring 2008 collection.\nThe fashion magazine covers Beckham has appeared on during her career include \"I-D\" in 2004 and \"W\" in 2007. Her first \"Vogue\" appearance was the April 2008 British edition. This was followed by \"Vogue India\", \"Vogue Paris\" as well as the German, Russian, Australian, Turkish, Taiwanese, Chinese and Spanish editions. Beckham has also graced various international editions of \"Harper's Bazaar\" and \"Elle\". On 17 July 2018, Victoria's collection of her Reebok collaboration was launched.\nLaunch of fashion label.\nBeckham's eponymous label was launched in September 2008. By 2011, it had grown into a fixture of New York Fashion Week and a lower-priced Victoria by Victoria Beckham label was introduced. In the first quarter of 2011\u201312, it was predicted to generate annual sales of more than \u00a360\u00a0million. Known initially for its dresses, the range has expanded into separates and luxury handbags selling at up to \u00a318,000. Alongside the main fashion line and diffusion range, the Victoria Beckham brand still includes separate denim, eyewear and fragrance lines. In November 2011, Victoria Beckham won Designer Brand of the Year at the British Fashion Awards.\nIn September 2012, Victoria Beckham was the most talked about designer on Twitter during New York Fashion Week, also acquiring 57,000 new followers during the shows according to research by The Whispr Group. Writing in \"The Independent\" in February 2014, Alexander Fury described how Victoria Beckham had made the transition from novelty to respected designer, citing her recent guest editorship of French \"Vogue\" and forthcoming participation in a panel discussion with the dean of Parsons design school in New York. The article concluded that the brand's sales were down to the appeal of the designs themselves, not the celebrity association.\nIn 2017, Beckham's new collection for Target featured a wide range of sizes from XS to 3X for women. Beckham also introduced a new line for children's wear. In 2018, the collection was presented at London Fashion Week instead of at New York Fashion Week as normal. In 2019, a spokesperson for the brand confirmed that the line would remain fur-free, and announced that as of the autumn/winter collection, it would also be free of any exotic skins.\nBusiness difficulties.\nDespite her high social profile, her fashion brand has not been a business success. In 2018 the label was losing \u00a34,000 a day. In November 2019, the BBC reported that \"Victoria Beckham's fashion business has posted another annual loss as demand for the former Spice Girl's high end clothes \"plateaued\". Victoria Beckham Limited, which has not made a profit since it launched in 2008, reported a loss of \u00a312.3m for 2018. Sales slipped 16% to \u00a335m, amid weaker wholesale demand. Chairman Ralph Toledano said sales of clothing and accessories had levelled off after years of growth. \"The performance was in line with expectations, so we were not surprised. Our goal is to reach profitability as soon as possible,\" he told trade journal Business of Fashion. \"Mrs Beckham launched her label in 2008 with a collection of luxury dresses, and now sells fashion and accessories in more than 400 stores around the world.\" \n In 2022, Beckham's fashion label was \u00a354 million in debt.\nVictoria Beckham Beauty.\nIn September 2019, Beckham launched the beauty brand \"Victoria Beckham Beauty\".\u00a0Together with co-founder Sarah Creal, she showcased the brand at London Fashion Week. Secondary packaging of the makeup is made from 100% post-consumer waste, while shipping materials are either recyclable or biodegradable. Beckham has described it as \"active and effective, but clean and kind\". The brand's first line of products was eye makeup, and included eye liner, individual eye shadows, and an eye shadow palette. A line of lip products, comprising a lip tint and waterproof lip pencils, was released the following month.\nTelevision.\nBeckham has shot five official documentaries. The first, dated 11 January 2000, was called \"Victoria's Secrets\", a programme only shown in the UK on Channel 4. It involved Beckham being followed by cameras while also discussing and interviewing other British celebrities, such as Elton John.\nThe second, \"Being Victoria Beckham\", was broadcast in March 2002 and saw Beckham discussing her career as a solo artist with the release of her first album, and also showed her at various photo shoots and recording sessions. The documentary attracted a strong audience of 8.83\u00a0million, coming top in its timeslot. One critic described her as \"so clearly level-headed, happy with her not inconsiderable lot and seemingly unfazed by the madly intrusive nature of her monumentally ridiculous fame\". The third, \"The Real Beckhams\", aired on 24 December 2003 on ITV1 and focused on the Beckhams' move to Madrid from London after David Beckham was signed to Real Madrid. In those years, she suffered a jealousy attack and had a fight in a gym with Ana Obreg\u00f3n because her husband David and Ana had been sending phone messages. It also featured Victoria Beckham re-launching her solo career and showed her mocking the tabloid stories she reads in the paper every day. The special received an audience of 6.10\u00a0million viewers and was later released on DVD on 2 February 2004.\nThe fourth was titled \"Full Length &amp; Fabulous: The Beckhams' 2006 World Cup Party\", and followed Victoria and David Beckham organising and making preparations to host a 2006 World Cup Party at a marquee in the grounds of their mansion in Hertfordshire, which aimed to raise money for their charity. Two tickets to attend the ball were auctioned on-line for charity, and sold for \u00a3103,000. The documentary aired on 28 May 2006 and showed the event itself, where the menu was designed, especially by friend and chef Gordon Ramsay, and the charity auction was hosted by Graham Norton. Ramsay catered for 600 guests, with the aid of 40 chefs and 100 waiting staff. The ITV documentary attracted an average of 7.56\u00a0million viewers.\nTo document Victoria Beckham's preparations for her family's move to the US, she signed a deal with NBC for six episodes of a half-hour unscripted reality TV series. Despite original plans for six episodes, the show was cut to a one-hour special only as there \"just wasn't enough (material) for a series.\" The show, called \"\", aired on 16 July 2007 in the US and Canada. It was heavily scrutinised by the American media and critics, with the \"New York Post\" describing it as \"an orgy of self-indulgence\" and also describing Beckham as \"vapid and condescending\". The programme was the third-most-watched programme in its time-slot and received viewing figures of 4.9\u00a0million in the US, beaten by a repeat of \"Wife Swap\" and two sitcoms. The programme aired in Britain on 17 July 2007 on ITV with 3.84\u00a0million viewers tuning in. The programme was produced by Simon Fuller who managed her and the Spice Girls on their come-back tour.\nIn July 2007, it was announced that Beckham would shortly begin filming a cameo appearance as herself in an episode of the second season of ABC's TV series \"Ugly Betty\". The episode, \"A Nice Day for a Posh Wedding\", aired on 9 November 2007 in the United States and on 23 November in the United Kingdom. Despite her forays into television, Beckham has denied plans to embark upon a Hollywood movie career. In February 2008, it was revealed that Beckham would be the guest judge for the finale of fourth season of \"Project Runway\", which aired on 5 March 2008 in the US.\nIt was reported in October 2007 that Beckham had turned down the opportunity to appear in \"\". She stated in an interview: \"[I was] asked to be in the \"Sex and the City\" film, which I would have loved to have done, but because I am in full-on Spice Girls rehearsal mode, unfortunately, I can't do it.\" In 2010, Beckham voiced Queen Amphitrite in an episode of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". She said it was thrilling to get the invitation, as her children were fans of the show.\nBooks.\nOn 13 September 2001, Beckham released her first book, \"Learning to Fly\". The title was taken from a line in a song from the musical \"Fame\", which Beckham had enjoyed as a child. The verse that inspired the title was: \"I'm gonna live forever, I'm gonna learn how to fly\". The autobiography documents her childhood, time during the Spice Girls, her marriage and family life, as well as her career at the time. \n\"Learning to Fly\" became the third best-selling non-fiction title of 2001 and the total UK sales stand at more than 500,000 copies. When the book was first released, it went to Number 1 in the book charts after four weeks of release, relegating Robbie Williams' book to second place. A high-profile guest appearance on \"Parkinson\", watched by nine million people, helped to promote the book. \"Hello!\", \"Daily Mail\" and \"The Mail on Sunday\" joined to buy the rights to preview and serialise the book before its publication. The figure paid was thought to be near \u00a31\u00a0million.\nBeckham was quoted by a Spanish journalist in 2005 as saying: \"I've never read a book in my life\". She later explained this was a mistranslation from the original Spanish in which the interview was printed, saying she actually stated that she never had time to finish reading a book because she was always too busy looking after her children.\nBeckham's second book, a fashion advice guide titled \"That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between\", was published on 27 October 2006. \"That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between\" includes tips from Beckham on fashion, style and beauty, and also contains photography by Mario Testino, Annie Leibovitz and Steven Meisel. The book became another best-seller, and has sold 400,000 copies in Britain alone since it was published in hardcover. The rights have since been sold to the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, Portugal, Lithuania, Russia, and, most recently, China.\nPower and influence.\nIn 2007, Beckham was the 52nd richest woman in Britain and the 19th richest person in Britain along with her husband David, with an estimated joint wealth of \u00a3112\u00a0million ($225\u00a0million). According to \"The Guardian\", Beckham Ventures, a company linked to the Victoria Beckham fashion business, was the best performing brand in the family's three businesses in 2012, coming close to matching turnover in a sister company that promotes the David Beckham brand.\nIn 2010, Beckhams's charity work with Save the Children was nominated for the Do Something With Style Award, an awards show, produced by VH1. She is an International Goodwill Ambassador for UNAIDS and a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Beckham promotes faux/synthetic furs. Her stand against the fur industry generated praise from animal rights organizations, including PETA; Beckham has stated that she is \"supportive of its [PETA's] high-profile anti-fur campaigns\", and pledged \"never to work with fur in any of her own fashion collections\". In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the UK in the fashion category by \"Woman's Hour\" on BBC Radio 4. In 2014, Beckham joined the Ban Bossy campaign as a spokesperson advocating leadership roles for girls.\nBeckham was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the fashion industry. She stated she was \"delighted and humbled for the recognition,\" which her husband also received in 2003. However, as recipients of honours are sworn to secrecy, and Beckham had announced her honour before the 2017 New Year Honours' official publication, she was criticised for the \"betrayal of etiquette\" by the Conservative MP Peter Bone.\nPersonal life.\nBeckham was engaged to electrician Mark Wood with whom she was in a relationship from 1988 to 1994. She then had a relationship with Canadian actor Corey Haim in 1995, which ended on mutual terms. She collects handbags, and owns over 100 Birkin bags, made by Herm\u00e8s, including a \u00a3100,000 pink one. The full collection is estimated to be worth more than \u00a31.5\u00a0million.\nMarriage and children.\nIn early 1997 she started dating footballer David Beckham, after they met at a charity football match; prior to this he had watched her music videos and commented to teammates that he was attracted to her, but had been overcome with shyness when they were first introduced. A few months earlier, Victoria had also expressed a wish to meet David during a Spice Girls football photo session (by chance, she wore the kit of his club Manchester United for the feature as the group's manager was a supporter). Of their initial meeting, she said, \"I didn't really know who he was. I was never into football.\" Initially, they kept their relationship out of the public eye. The couple announced their engagement in 1998 and were dubbed \"Posh and Becks\" by the media.\nOn 4 July 1999, Victoria and David were married by the Bishop of Cork, Paul Colton, at Luttrellstown Castle, Ireland. The wedding attracted much media coverage. Beckham's teammate, Gary Neville, was the best man, and the couple's four-month-old son Brooklyn was the ring bearer. Most of the media were kept away from the ceremony as an exclusive deal with \"OK!\" magazine had been arranged, but photographs were released showing the Beckhams sitting on golden thrones. Victoria wore a diamond coronet created for her by jewellery designer Slim Barrett. A total of 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost \u00a3500,000 (US$823,650).\nThe couple bought what became their most famous home for \u00a32.5\u00a0million in 1999; the property, which is set in of land, was given a \u00a33\u00a0million renovation and was subsequently dubbed Beckingham Palace by the media. They sold the property in 2014. In 2024 they bought a mansion on North Beach Road in Miami Beach for a record-setting $72 million. Victoria and David have four children: sons Brooklyn (born 1999), Romeo (born 2002) and Cruz (born 2005), and daughter, Harper (born 2011). Elton John and David Furnish are reportedly the godparents of Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham and their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley. Two children were baptized Catholic at Holy Trinity, Chipping Norton; among their godparents were Eva Longoria and Marc Anthony.\nAlleged kidnap and death threats.\nIn January 2000, a tip-off to Scotland Yard detectives exposed a plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in Hampstead, London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made. In March of that year, she received a death threat prior to performing at the Brit Awards with the Spice Girls, and at the show's rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a fire door was found to be lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she was terrified by the experience. In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper. All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.\nEating disorder.\nIn a new documentary released by Netflix, Beckham details her struggles with an eating disorder saying that it \"made her good at lying.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
