{"id": "53847", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53847", "title": "Resource Description Framework", "text": "Formal language for describing data models\nThe Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a method to describe and exchange graph data. It was originally designed as a data model for metadata by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It provides a variety of syntax notations and formats, of which the most widely used is Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language).\nRDF is a directed graph composed of triple statements. An RDF graph statement is represented by: (1) a node for the subject, (2) an arc from subject to object, representing a predicate, and (3) a node for the object. Each of these parts can be identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). An object can also be a literal value. This simple, flexible data model has a lot of expressive power to represent complex situations, relationships, and other things of interest, while also being appropriately abstract.\nRDF was adopted as a W3C recommendation in 1999. The RDF 1.0 specification was published in 2004, and the RDF 1.1 specification in 2014. SPARQL is a standard query language for RDF graphs. RDF Schema (RDFS), Web Ontology Language (OWL) and SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) are ontology languages that are used to describe RDF data.\nOverview.\nThe RDF data model is similar to classical conceptual modeling approaches (such as entity\u2013relationship or class diagrams). It is based on the idea of making statements about resources (in particular web resources) in expressions of the form subject\u2013predicate\u2013object, known as \"triples\". The subject denotes the resource; the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the resource, and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object.\nFor example, one way to represent the notion \"The sky has the color blue\" in RDF is as the triple: a subject denoting \"the sky\", a predicate denoting \"has the color\", and an object denoting \"blue\". Therefore, RDF uses subject instead of object (or entity) in contrast to the typical approach of an entity\u2013attribute\u2013value model in object-oriented design: entity (sky), attribute (color), and value (blue).\nRDF is an abstract model with several serialization formats (being essentially specialized file formats). In addition the particular encoding for resources or triples can vary from format to format.\nThis mechanism for describing resources is a major component in the W3C's Semantic Web activity: an evolutionary stage of the World Wide Web in which automated software can store, exchange, and use machine-readable information distributed throughout the Web, in turn enabling users to deal with the information with greater efficiency and certainty. RDF's simple data model and ability to model disparate, abstract concepts has also led to its increasing use in knowledge management applications unrelated to Semantic Web activity.\nA collection of RDF statements intrinsically represents a labeled, directed multigraph. This makes an RDF data model better suited to certain kinds of knowledge representation than other relational or ontological models.\nAs RDFS, OWL and SHACL demonstrate, one can build additional ontology languages upon RDF.\nHistory.\nThe initial RDF design, intended to \"build a vendor-neutral and operating system- independent system of metadata\", derived from the W3C's Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS), an early web content labelling system, but the project was also shaped by ideas from Dublin Core, and from the Meta Content Framework (MCF), which had been developed during 1995 to 1997 by Ramanathan V. Guha at Apple and Tim Bray at Netscape.\nA first public draft of RDF appeared in October 1997, issued by a W3C working group that included representatives from IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, Nokia, Reuters, SoftQuad, and the University of Michigan.\nIn 1999, the W3C published the first recommended RDF specification, the \"Model and Syntax Specification\" (\"RDF M&amp;S\"). This described RDF's data model and an XML serialization.\nTwo persistent misunderstandings about RDF developed at this time: firstly, due to the MCF influence and the RDF \"Resource Description\" initialism, the idea that RDF was specifically for use in representing metadata; secondly that RDF was an XML format rather than a data model, and only the RDF/XML serialisation being XML-based. RDF saw little take-up in this period, but there was significant work done in Bristol, around ILRT at Bristol University and HP Labs, and in Boston at MIT. RSS 1.0 and FOAF became exemplar applications for RDF in this period.\nThe recommendation of 1999 was replaced in 2004 by a set of six specifications: \"The RDF Primer\", \"RDF Concepts and Abstract\", \"RDF/XML Syntax Specification (revised)\", \"RDF Semantics\", \"RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0\", and \"The RDF Test Cases\".\nThis series was superseded in 2014 by the following six \"RDF 1.1\" documents: \"RDF 1.1 Primer\", \"RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax\", \"RDF 1.1 XML Syntax\", \"RDF 1.1 Semantics\", \"RDF Schema 1.1\", and \"RDF 1.1 Test Cases\".\nRDF topics.\nVocabulary.\nThe vocabulary defined by the RDF specification is as follows: \nProperties.\nrdf.\ncodice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11 are used for reification (see below).\nrdfs.\nThis vocabulary is used as a foundation for RDF Schema, where it is extended.\nSerialization formats.\nSeveral common serialization formats are in use, including:\nRDF/XML is sometimes misleadingly called simply RDF because it was introduced among the other W3C specifications defining RDF and it was historically the first W3C standard RDF serialization format. However, it is important to distinguish the RDF/XML format from the abstract RDF model itself. Although the RDF/XML format is still in use, other RDF serializations are now preferred by many RDF users, both because they are more human-friendly, and because some RDF graphs are not representable in RDF/XML due to restrictions on the syntax of XML QNames.\nWith a little effort, virtually any arbitrary XML may also be interpreted as RDF using GRDDL (pronounced 'griddle'), Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages.\nRDF triples may be stored in a type of database called a triplestore.\nResource identification.\nThe subject of an RDF statement is either a uniform resource identifier (URI) or a blank node, both of which denote resources. Resources indicated by blank nodes are called anonymous resources. They are not directly identifiable from the RDF statement. The predicate is a URI which also indicates a resource, representing a relationship. The object is a URI, blank node or a Unicode string literal. \nAs of RDF 1.1 resources are identified by Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs); IRI are a generalization of URI.\nIn Semantic Web applications, and in relatively popular applications of RDF like RSS and FOAF (Friend of a Friend), resources tend to be represented by URIs that intentionally denote, and can be used to access, actual data on the World Wide Web. But RDF, in general, is not limited to the description of Internet-based resources. In fact, the URI that names a resource does not have to be dereferenceable at all. For example, a URI that begins with \"http:\" and is used as the subject of an RDF statement does not necessarily have to represent a resource that is accessible via HTTP, nor does it need to represent a tangible, network-accessible resource\u2014such a URI could represent absolutely anything. However, there is broad agreement that a bare URI (without a # symbol) which returns a 300-level coded response when used in an HTTP GET request should be treated as denoting the internet resource that it succeeds in accessing.\nTherefore, producers and consumers of RDF statements must agree on the semantics of resource identifiers. Such agreement is not inherent to RDF itself, although there are some controlled vocabularies in common use, such as Dublin Core Metadata, which is partially mapped to a URI space for use in RDF. The intent of publishing RDF-based ontologies on the Web is often to establish, or circumscribe, the intended meanings of the resource identifiers used to express data in RDF. For example, the URI:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pre/styles.css\"/&gt;\nis intended by its owners to refer to the class of all Merlot red wines by vintner (i.e., instances of the above URI each represent the class of all wine produced by a single vintner), a definition which is expressed by the OWL ontology\u2014itself an RDF document\u2014in which it occurs. Without careful analysis of the definition, one might erroneously conclude that an instance of the above URI was something physical, instead of a type of wine.\nNote that this is not a 'bare' resource identifier, but is rather a URI reference, containing the '#' character and ending with a fragment identifier.\nStatement reification and context.\nThe body of knowledge modeled by a collection of statements may be subjected to reification, in which each \"statement\" (that is each triple \"subject-predicate-object\" altogether) is assigned a URI and treated as a resource about which additional statements can be made, as in \"\"Jane says that\" John is the author of document X\". Reification is sometimes important in order to deduce a level of confidence or degree of usefulness for each statement.\nIn a reified RDF database, each original statement, being a resource, itself, most likely has at least three additional statements made about it: one to assert that its subject is some resource, one to assert that its predicate is some resource, and one to assert that its object is some resource or literal. More statements about the original statement may also exist, depending on the application's needs.\nBorrowing from concepts available in logic (and as illustrated in graphical notations such as conceptual graphs and topic maps), some RDF model implementations acknowledge that it is sometimes useful to group statements according to different criteria, called \"situations\", \"contexts\", or \"scopes\", as discussed in articles by RDF specification co-editor Graham Klyne. For example, a statement can be associated with a context, named by a URI, in order to assert an \"is true in\" relationship. As another example, it is sometimes convenient to group statements by their source, which can be identified by a URI, such as the URI of a particular RDF/XML document. Then, when updates are made to the source, corresponding statements can be changed in the model, as well.\nImplementation of scopes does not necessarily require fully reified statements. Some implementations allow a single scope identifier to be associated with a statement that has not been assigned a URI, itself. Likewise \"named graphs\" in which a set of triples is named by a URI can represent context without the need to reify the triples.\nQuery and inference languages.\nThe predominant query language for RDF graphs is SPARQL. SPARQL is an SQL-like language, and a recommendation of the W3C as of January 15, 2008.\nThe following is an example of a SPARQL query to show country capitals in Africa, using a fictional ontology:\nPREFIX ex: &lt;http://example.com/exampleOntology#&gt;\nSELECT ?capital ?country\nWHERE {\n ?x ex:cityname ?capital ;\n ex:isCapitalOf ?y .\n ?y ex:countryname ?country ;\n ex:isInContinent ex:Africa .\nOther non-standard ways to query RDF graphs include:\nSHACL Advanced Features specification (W3C Working Group Note), the most recent version of which is maintained by the SHACL Community Group, defines support for SHACL Rules, used for data transformations, inferences and mappings of RDF based on SHACL shapes.\nValidation and description.\nThe predominant language for describing and validating RDF graphs is SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language). SHACL specification is divided in two parts: SHACL Core and SHACL-SPARQL. SHACL Core consists of a list of built-in constraints such as cardinality, range of values and many others. SHACL-SPARQL describes SPARQL-based constraints and an extension mechanism to declare new constraint components.\nOther non-standard ways to describe and validate RDF graphs include:\nExamples.\nExample 1: Description of a person named Eric Miller.\nThe following example is taken from the W3C website describing a resource with statements \"there is a Person identified by http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me, whose name is Eric Miller, whose email address is e.miller123(at)example (changed for security purposes), and whose title is Dr.\" \nThe resource \"http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me\" is the subject.\nThe objects are:\nThe subject is a URI.\nThe predicates also have URIs. For example, the URI for each predicate:\nIn addition, the subject has a type (with URI http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type), which is person (with URI http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person).\nTherefore, the following \"subject, predicate, object\" RDF triples can be expressed:\nIn standard N-Triples format, this RDF can be written as:\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#fullName&gt; \"Eric Miller\" .\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox&gt; &lt;mailto:e.miller123(at)example&gt; .\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#personalTitle&gt; \"Dr.\" .\n&lt;http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person&gt; .\nEquivalently, it can be written in standard Turtle (syntax) format as:\n@prefix eric: &lt;http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#&gt; .\n@prefix contact: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#&gt; .\n@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\neric:me contact:fullName \"Eric Miller\" .\neric:me contact:mailbox &lt;mailto:e.miller123(at)example&gt; .\neric:me contact:personalTitle \"Dr.\" .\neric:me rdf:type contact:Person .\nOr more concisely, using a common shorthand syntax of Turtle as:\n@prefix eric: &lt;http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#&gt; .\n@prefix contact: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#&gt; .\n@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\neric:me contact:fullName \"Eric Miller\" ;\n contact:mailbox &lt;mailto:e.miller123(at)example&gt; ;\n contact:personalTitle \"Dr.\" ;\n rdf:type contact:Person .\nOr, it can be written in RDF/XML format as:\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:contact=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#\" xmlns:eric=\"http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#\" xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"&gt;\n &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me\"&gt;\n &lt;contact:fullName&gt;Eric Miller&lt;/contact:fullName&gt;\n &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me\"&gt;\n &lt;contact:mailbox rdf:resource=\"mailto:e.miller123(at)example\"/&gt;\n &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me\"&gt;\n &lt;contact:personalTitle&gt;Dr.&lt;/contact:personalTitle&gt;\n &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me\"&gt;\n &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person\"/&gt;\n &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;\n&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\nExample 2: The postal abbreviation for New York.\nCertain concepts in RDF are taken from logic and linguistics, where subject-predicate and subject-predicate-object structures have meanings similar to, yet distinct from, the uses of those terms in RDF. This example demonstrates:\nIn the English language statement \" 'New York has the postal abbreviation NY' \",\" 'New York' \" would be the subject, \" 'has the postal abbreviation' \" the predicate and \" 'NY' \" the object.\nEncoded as an RDF triple, the subject and predicate would have to be resources named by URIs. The object could be a resource or literal element. For example, in the N-Triples form of RDF, the statement might look like:\n&lt;urn:x-states:New%20York&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative&gt; \"NY\" .\nIn this example, \"urn:x-states:New%20York\" is the URI for a resource that denotes the US state New York, \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative\" is the URI for a predicate (whose human-readable definition can be found here), and \"NY\" is a literal string. Note that the URIs chosen here are not standard, and do not need to be, as long as their meaning is known to whatever is reading them.\nExample 3: A Wikipedia article about Tony Benn.\nIn a like manner, given that \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn\" identifies a particular resource (regardless of whether that URI could be traversed as a hyperlink, or whether the resource is \"actually\" the Wikipedia article about Tony Benn), to say that the title of this resource is \"Tony Benn\" and its publisher is \"Wikipedia\" would be two assertions that could be expressed as valid RDF statements. In the N-Triples form of RDF, these statements might look like the following:\n&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title&gt; \"Tony Benn\" .\n&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/publisher&gt; \"Wikipedia\" .\nTo an English-speaking person, the same information could be represented simply as:\nThe title of this resource, which is published by Wikipedia, is 'Tony Benn'\nHowever, RDF puts the information in a formal way that a machine can understand. The purpose of RDF is to provide an encoding and interpretation mechanism so that resources can be described in a way that particular software can understand it; in other words, so that software can access and use information that it otherwise could not use.\nBoth versions of the statements above are wordy because one requirement for an RDF resource (as a subject or a predicate) is that it be unique. The subject resource must be unique in an attempt to pinpoint the exact resource being described. The predicate needs to be unique in order to reduce the chance that the idea of Title or Publisher will be ambiguous to software working with the description. If the software recognizes \"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title\" (a specific definition for the concept of a title established by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative), it will also know that this title is different from a land title or an honorary title or just the letters t-i-t-l-e put together.\nThe following example, written in Turtle, shows how such simple claims can be elaborated on, by combining multiple RDF vocabularies. Here, we note that the primary topic of the Wikipedia page is a \"Person\" whose name is \"Tony Benn\":\n@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\n@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .\n@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .\n&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn&gt;\n dc:publisher \"Wikipedia\" ;\n dc:title \"Tony Benn\" ;\n foaf:primaryTopic [\n a foaf:Person ;\n foaf:name \"Tony Benn\"\nApplications.\nSome uses of RDF include research into social networking. It will also help people in business fields understand better their relationships with members of industries that could be of use for product placement. It will also help scientists understand how people are connected to one another.\nRDF is being used to gain a better understanding of road traffic patterns. This is because the information regarding traffic patterns is on different websites, and RDF is used to integrate information from different sources on the web. Before, the common methodology was using keyword searching, but this method is problematic because it does not consider synonyms. This is why ontologies are useful in this situation. But one of the issues that comes up when trying to efficiently study traffic is that to fully understand traffic, concepts related to people, streets, and roads must be well understood. Since these are human concepts, they require the addition of fuzzy logic. This is because values that are useful when describing roads, like slipperiness, are not precise concepts and cannot be measured. This would imply that the best solution would incorporate both fuzzy logic and ontology.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the seventh-most populous city in the United States, second-most populous city in Texas and second-most populous city in the Southern U.S., with a population of 1.43 million at the 2020 census. The San Antonio metropolitan area, with an estimated 2.76 million residents, ranks as the third-largest metropolitan area in Texas and the 24th-largest in the nation. It is the county seat of Bexar County.\nFounded in 1718 as a Spanish mission and colonial outpost, San Antonio became the first chartered civil settlement in present-day Texas in 1731. The city was named in 1691 by a Spanish expedition in honor of Saint Anthony of Padua. It was part of the Spanish Empire, then the Mexican Republic from 1821 to 1836, before joining the United States. Straddling the regional divide between South and Central Texas, San Antonio anchors the southwestern corner of an urban megaregion colloquially known as the Texas Triangle. It lies about from Austin along the I-35 corridor, and together the San Antonio\u2013Austin metroplex is home to approximately 5 million people.\nSan Antonio is home to five 18th-century Spanish frontier missions, including The Alamo and those preserved in San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, which were collectively designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites in 2015. Major attractions include the River Walk, Tower of the Americas, SeaWorld San Antonio, Six Flags Fiesta Texas, and the Alamo Bowl. The city also hosts the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo and is home to the five-time NBA champion San Antonio Spurs. San Antonio welcomes approximately 32 million visitors annually and is a key military hub, hosting several major U.S. Armed Forces facilities, including Fort Sam Houston and nearby bases such as Lackland and Randolph Air Force Bases. The city is also home to four \"Fortune\" 500 companies, the South Texas Medical Center, and the largest majority-Hispanic populations in the U.S., with 64% of residents identifying as Hispanic.\nHistory.\nAt the time of European encounter, the Payaya people lived near the San Antonio River Valley in the San Pedro Springs area. They called the vicinity \"Yanaguana\", meaning \"refreshing waters\". In 1691, a group of Spanish explorers and missionaries came upon the river and Payaya settlement on June 13, the feast day of St. Anthony of Padua. They named the place and river \"San Antonio\" in his honor.\nIt was years before any Spanish settlement took place. Father Antonio de Olivares visited the site in 1709, and he was determined to found a mission and civilian settlement there. The viceroy gave formal approval for a combined mission and presidio in late 1716, as he wanted to forestall any French expansion into the area from their colony of \"La Louisiane\" to the east, as well as prevent illegal trading with the Payaya. He directed Mart\u00edn de Alarc\u00f3n, the governor of Coahuila y Tejas, to establish the mission complex. Differences between Alarc\u00f3n and Olivares resulted in delays, and construction did not start until 1718. Olivares built, with the help of the Payaya and the Pastia people, the Misi\u00f3n de San Antonio de Valero (The Alamo), the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, the bridge that connected both, and the Acequia Madre de Valero.\nThe families who clustered around the presidio and mission were the start of Villa de B\u00e9jar, destined to become the most important town in Spanish Texas. On May 1, the governor transferred ownership of the Mission San Antonio de Valero (later famous as The Alamo) to Fray Antonio de Olivares. On May 5, 1718, he commissioned the Presidio San Antonio de B\u00e9xar (\"B\u00e9jar\" in modern Spanish orthography) on the west side of the San Antonio River, one-fourth league from the mission.\nOn February 14, 1719, the Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo proposed to the king of Spain that 400 families be transported from the Canary Islands, Galicia, or Havana to populate the province of Texas. His plan was approved, and notice was given the Canary Islanders (\"isle\u00f1os\") to furnish 200 families; the Council of the Indies suggested that 400 families should be sent from the Canaries to Texas by way of Havana and Veracruz. By June 1730, 25 families had reached Cuba, and 10 families had been sent to Veracruz before orders from Spain came to stop the re-settlement.\nUnder the leadership of Juan Leal Goraz, the group marched overland from Veracruz to the Presidio San Antonio de B\u00e9xar, where they arrived on March 9, 1731. Due to marriages along the way, the party now included 15 families, a total of 56 persons. They joined the military community established in 1718. The immigrants formed the nucleus of the villa of San Fernando de B\u00e9xar, the first regularly organized civil government in Texas. Several older families of San Antonio trace their descent from the Canary Island colonists. Mar\u00eda Rosa Padr\u00f3n was the first baby born of Canary Islander descent in San Antonio.\nDuring the Spanish\u2013Mexican settlement of Southwestern lands, which took place over the following century, Juan Leal Goraz Jr. was a prominent figure. He claimed nearly 100,000 sq miles (153,766 acres) as Spanish territory and held some control for nearly three decades; this area stretched across six present-day states. San Antonio was designated as Leal Goraz's capital. It represented Mexican expansion into the area. With his robust military forces, he led exploration and establishing Spanish colonial bases as far as San Francisco, California. Widespread bankruptcy forced Leal Goraz Jr.'s army back into the current boundaries of Mexico; they fell into internal conflict and turmoil with neighboring entities.\nSan Antonio grew to become the largest Spanish settlement in Texas; it was designated as the capital of the Spanish, later Mexican, province of Tejas. From San Antonio, the Camino Real (today Nacogdoches Road), was built to the small frontier town of Nacogdoches. Mexico allowed European American settlers from the United States into the territory; they mostly occupied land in the eastern part. In 1835, when Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna unilaterally abolished the Mexican Constitution of 1824, violence ensued in many states of Mexico. which led to many short-lived independent republics. This, in addition to Mexico's abolition of slavery, and cultural differences between the Texians and the Mexicans, led to the Texas Revolution.\nIn a series of battles, the Texian Army, which was made up primarily of American citizens, succeeded in forcing Mexican soldiers out of the settlement areas east of San Antonio. Under the leadership of Ben Milam, in the Battle of Bexar, December 1835, Texian forces captured San Antonio from forces commanded by General Martin Perfecto de Cos, Santa Anna's brother-in-law. In the spring of 1836, Santa Anna marched on San Antonio. A volunteer force under the command of James C. Neill occupied and fortified the deserted Alamo mission.\nUpon his departure, the joint command of William Barrett Travis and James Bowie were left in charge of defending the old mission. The Battle of the Alamo took place from February 23 to March 6, 1836. The outnumbered Texian force was ultimately defeated, with all of the Alamo defenders killed. These men were seen as \"martyrs\" for the cause of Texas freedom and \"Remember the Alamo\" became a rallying cry in the Texian Army's eventual success at defeating Santa Anna's army.\nJuan Segu\u00edn, who organized the company of Tejano patriots, who fought for Texas independence, fought at the Battle of Concepci\u00f3n, the Siege of Bexar, and the Battle of San Jacinto, and served as mayor of San Antonio. He was forced out of office due to threats on his life by sectarian newcomers and political opponents in 1842 and was the last Tejano mayor for nearly 150 years. By 1850, Tejanos no longer constituted a majority of the San Antonio population, and would not resume majority status until 1968.\nIn 1845, the United States finally decided to annex Texas and include it as a state in the Union. This led to the Mexican\u2013American War. Though the U.S. ultimately won, the war was devastating to San Antonio. By its end, the population of the city had been reduced by almost two-thirds, to 800 inhabitants. Bolstered by migrants and immigrants, by 1860 at the start of the American Civil War, San Antonio had grown to a city of 15,000 people.\nIn the 1850s, Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect who designed Central Park in New York City, traveled throughout the Southern and Southwest U.S., and published accounts of his observations. In his 1859 book about Texas, Olmsted described San Antonio as having a \"jumble of races, costumes, languages, and buildings\", which gave it a quality that only New Orleans could rival in what he described as \"odd and antiquated foreignness.\" Following the Civil War, San Antonio prospered as a center of the cattle industry. During this period, it remained a frontier city, with a mixture of cultures that was different from other U.S. cities.\nGerman immigrants founded smaller surrounding towns such as New Braunfels, Castroville, Boerne, Comfort, Fredericksburg, and Bulverde, all towns far out from San Antonio. However, the Germans were then drawn to San Antonio for work, and many buildings and streets still bear German names such as Wurzbach, Huebner, and Jones Maltsberger, and Wiederstein. The German impact on San Antonio was great, in the early 1900s it is estimated that at least 1/3 of San Antonio was ethnically German. Many descendants of German immigrants in San Antonio spoke Texas German up to the fifth or sixth generations. Texas German is a dialect of German that evolved when the German language was separated from Germany. Texas German is best described as an anglicized-German dialect with a Texas twang. Many older generations in New Braunfels and Fredericksburg still speak Texas German to this day.\nIn 1877, following the Reconstruction Era, the Galveston, Harrisburg, &amp; San Antonio Railroad became the first railroad to reach San Antonio, connecting it to major markets and port cities. Texas was the first state to have major cities develop by railroads rather than waterways. In Texas, the railroads supported a markedly different pattern of development of major interior cities, such as San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth, compared to the historical development of coastal port cities in the established eastern states.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the streets of the city's downtown were widened to accommodate street cars and modern traffic.

The council effectively functions as the city's legislative body with the city manager acting as its chief executive, responsible for the management of day-to-day operations and execution of council legislation. The current city manager is Erik Walsh.\nThe city operates its own electric and gas utility, CPS Energy. The San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) is the city's municipal body of law enforcement. The San Antonio Fire Department (SAFD) provides the city with fire protection and EMS service.\nThe city stretches into several national congressional districts and is represented in Congress by:\nState and federal representation.\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) operates the Parole Division Region IV headquarters in the San Antonio Metro Parole Complex. San Antonio district parole offices I and III are in the parole complex, while office II is in another location.\nThe Texas Department of Transportation operates the San Antonio District Office in San Antonio.\nThe United States Postal Service operates San Antonio's main post office. Other post offices are located throughout San Antonio.\nGrowth policy.\nUnlike most large cities in the U.S., San Antonio is not completely surrounded by independent suburban cities, and under Texas state law it exercises extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) over much of the surrounding unincorporated land, including planning major thoroughfares and enforcing rules for platting and subdivision. It pursues an aggressive annexation policy and opposes the creation of other municipalities within its ETJ. Nearly three-fourths of its land area has been annexed since 1960.\nIn the 2000s the city annexed several long narrow corridors along major thoroughfares in outlying areas to facilitate eventual annexation of growth developing along the routes. The city planned to annex nearly 40 additional square miles by 2009.\nIn May 2010, the City of San Antonio agreed to release thousands of acres of land in its extraterritorial jurisdiction along Interstate 10 to Schertz. The agreement releases a total of of San Antonio's ETJ lands north of I-10 to Schertz. The ETJ lands are in an area bordered by FM 1518 to the west, Lower Seguin Road to the north, Cibolo Creek to the east and I-10 to the south.\nInvoluntary annexation is a controversial issue in those parts of unincorporated Bexar County affected by it. Residents attracted to the outlying areas by lower taxes and affordable real estate values often see annexation as a mechanism to increase property tax rates (which are primarily driven by school district taxes, not city taxes) without a corresponding improvement in services such as police and fire protection, while the city regards its annexation policy as essential to its overall prosperity.\nSince the city has annexed areas over time, San Antonio surrounds several independent enclave cities, including Alamo Heights, Balcones Heights, Castle Hills, Hill Country Village, Hollywood Park, Kirby, Leon Valley, Olmos Park, Shavano Park, and Terrell Hills.\nEducation.\nHigher education.\nSan Antonio hosts over 100,000 students in its 31 higher-education institutions. Publicly supported schools include UT Health San Antonio, the University of Texas at San Antonio, Texas A&amp;M University\u2013San Antonio, Troy University-San Antonio Student Support Center, and the Alamo Community College District. The University of Texas at San Antonio is San Antonio's largest university.\nPrivate universities include Trinity University, St. Mary's University, Our Lady of the Lake University, University of the Incarnate Word, Webster University, Baptist University of the Am\u00e9ricas, Hallmark University, Oblate School of Theology, ECPI University, and the Southwest School of Art, which enrolled its first BFA class in 2014. The San Antonio Public Library serves all of these institutions along with the 19 independent school districts within the Bexar County and Greater San Antonio metropolitan area. San Antonio is also home to a campus of The Culinary Institute of America.\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), one of Latin America's most prestigious universities, has a campus in San Antonio.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nThe city of San Antonio is also served by the following separate independent school districts (ISDs) which each encompass elementary, middle, and high schools:\nAdditionally the following school districts do not cover the San Antonio city limits but have locations which use San Antonio postal addresses:\nThe city is home to more than 30 private schools and charter schools. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio operates parochial Catholic schools in San Antonio. San Antonio's private and charter schools include: Keystone School, St. Gerard Catholic High School, Central Catholic Marianist High School, Incarnate Word High School, Saint Mary's Hall, The Atonement Academy, Antonian College Preparatory High School, San Antonio Academy, Holy Cross High School, Providence High School, The Carver Academy, Keystone School, TMI \u2013 The Episcopal School of Texas, St. Anthony Catholic High School, Lutheran High School of San Antonio, and Harmony Science Academy (School of Science and Technology).\nMilitary.\nSan Antonio is home to U.S. Air Force Basic Military Training (AFBMT). The Air Force only has one location for enlisted basic training: the 737th Training Group, at Lackland Air Force Base. All new Air Force recruits go through the same basic training at Lackland. Each year, over 35,000 new recruits go through AFBMT. In addition, METC (the Military Education and Training Campus), which provides the medical training for the U.S. military at Fort Sam Houston, hosts 30 programs and over 24,000 annual graduates. It is the largest medical education center in the world.\nMedia.\nPrint.\nSan Antonio has one major newspaper, the \"San Antonio Express-News\", which has served the area since 1865. The \"Express-News\" circulates as the largest newspaper service in South Texas. The Hearst Corporation, which owned a second newspaper, the \"San Antonio Light\", purchased the \"Express-News\" from News Corp. in 1992 and shut down the \"Light\" after failing to find a buyer.\nHearst, using the \"Express-News\" brand, also produces \"Conexi\u00f3n\", a weekly magazine written by an entirely Hispanic and Latin American staff with a Latino spin on weekly events. The San Antonio \"Current\" is the free \"alternative\" paper published weekly with local political issues, art and music news, restaurant listings and reviews, and listings of events and nightlife around town. The \"San Antonio Business Journal\" covers general business news. \"La Prensa\", a bilingual publication, also has a long history in San Antonio. They closed their doors in June 2018. \"Edible San Antonio\" is San Antonio's bimonthly food magazine, it reports on the city's food culture and it's chiefs, farmers and other figures related to food. The \"San Antonio Observer\" is the only weekly African American newspaper in San Antonio since 1995 and the largest in South Texas.\nThe \"San Antonio Report\", renamed in 2020 from the Rivard Report, is the city's only digital-only news publication. Founded in 2011 by former Express-News editor Robert Rivard, it began as a blog but has since become a non-profit news source covering civic issues.\nRadio.\nAbout 50 radio stations can be heard in the San Antonio area; 30 of them are in the city proper. San Antonio is home to iHeartMedia, the largest operator of radio stations in the U.S. Its flagship, WOAI AM-1200, is known for its local news operation, considered among the best in the country. It is a 50,000-watt clear channel station that reaches most of North America at night. The first radio station to broadcast in South Texas was KTSA AM-550 in 1922.\nThe region's National Public Radio member is Texas Public Radio, a group of three stations; KSTX 89.1 FM is NPR news/talk, KPAC 88.3 is a 24-hour classical music station, and KTXI 90.1 is a mix of NPR news/talk and classical music broadcast for the West Central Texas Hill Country. KSTX also broadcasts \"Riverwalk Jazz\", featuring Jim Cullum Jazz Band at The Landing, a fixture on the River Walk since 1963.\nKRTU 91.7 is a non-commercial radio station based at Trinity University. Unlike most other college radio stations in the U.S., the station plays jazz 17 hours a day and college rock/indie rock at night. College alternative station KSYM, 90.1 FM, is owned by the Alamo Community College District and operated by San Antonio College students; like KRTU, it plays the Third Coast music network during the day and alternative music at night.\nMost Latin American stations in the area play regional Mexican, Tejano or contemporary pop. On January 12, 2006, Univision-owned KMYO-FM \"La Kalle 95.1\" changed its format from Hispanic-Rhythmic Contemporary Hits to Spanish Oldies, then named \"Recuerdo 95.1\". On November 10, 2006, Univision flipped KLTO Tejano 97.7's format to reggaeton in an attempt to reintroduce the format to San Antonio. Then 97.7 was flipped again to feature a rock format. The station no longer broadcasts anything in English. While still owned by Univision, it broadcast music by artists such as Linkin Park, before being sold to the Educational Media Foundation and flipping once again to Air1.\n95.1 was then flipped back to the \"La Kalle\" format again after being flipped to feature a \"95X\" format. KLTO was acquired and is operated as a simulcast of KVBH-FM Vibe 107.5. San Antonio radio is diversified, due to an influx of non-Tejano Latinos, mostly from the East Coast, who serve in the city's various military bases, as well as immigrants from Mexico. Therefore, just like in the rest of the country, radio station conglomerates have been changing formats in San Antonio to reflect shifting demographics.\nTelevision.\nDespite the relatively large size of both the city proper and the metropolitan area, San Antonio has always been a medium-sized market. It presently ranks 33rd in the United States, according to marketing research firm ACNielsen. This is mainly because the nearby suburban and rural areas are not much larger than the city itself.\nSan Antonio-based television stations include KCWX channel 2 (MyNetworkTV), WOAI-TV channel 4 (NBC, with CW on DT2), KENS channel 5 (CBS), KLRN channel 9 (PBS), KSAT-TV channel 12 (ABC), KNIC-DT channel 17 (UniM\u00e1s), KABB channel 29 (FOX), KMYS channel 35 (Dabl), KWEX-DT channel 41 (Univision) and KVDA channel 60 (Telemundo). The market is also home to three religious stations, three independent stations and one Internet-based station (210 TV). As of 2010[ [update]], the San Antonio market has 65% cable TV penetration.\nTransportation.\nAir.\nSan Antonio International Airport (SAT) is located in Uptown San Antonio, about north of Downtown. San Antonio International Airport is the 6th busiest airport based on passenger boardings in Texas and 44th in the United States as of 2015. It has two terminals and is served by 20 airlines, 15 passenger and 5 cargo ones, serving many destinations throughout the United States and Mexico. Stinson Municipal Airport is a reliever airport located south of Downtown San Antonio. The airport has two runways serving primarily general aviation and is also home to the Texas Air Museum.\nMass transit.\nA bus system is provided by the city's metropolitan transit authority, VIA Metropolitan Transit. VIA began operating a bus rapid transit line known as VIA Primo in December 2012, which connects Downtown San Antonio to the South Texas Medical Center, the main campus of the University of Texas at San Antonio, and the independent enclave city of Leon Valley. Additionally, VIA also offers VIAtrans Paratransit Service, a wheelchair accessible ride-share service for people with disabilities.\nIn August 2010, VIA Metropolitan Transit unveiled buses that are powered by diesel-electric hybrid technology. The 30 hybrid buses were put into service on VIA's express routes to serve daily commuters across the city. This set of buses follows the introduction of new vehicles powered by compressed natural gas, which were unveiled in May 2010. In the fall of 2010, VIA took delivery of three new buses that are powered by electricity from on-board batteries. These buses serve the Downtown core area, and are the first revenue vehicles VIA operates which have zero emissions.\nVIA offers 90 regular bus routes and two Downtown streetcar routes. This includes express service from Downtown to park and ride locations in the south, west, northwest, north central and northeast sides of the city, with service to major locations such as UTSA, Six Flags Fiesta Texas and SeaWorld. VIA also offers a special service to city events including Spurs games and city parades from its park and ride locations.\nRail.\nSan Antonio is served by two Amtrak routes: the daily Chicago to San Antonio \"Texas Eagle\" and the thrice-weekly New Orleans to Los Angeles \"Sunset Limited.\" On the days that the \"Sunset Limited\" operates, a section of the \"Texas Eagle\" continues west with it, offering Chicago to Los Angeles through service. The old Sunset Station is now an entertainment venue owned by VIA and neighbored by the current station and the Alamodome.\nSan Antonio became the largest American city without an intra-city rail system when Phoenix, the former largest city without such a system, procured one in 2008. A proposed passenger rail line, Lone Star Rail, would have linked San Antonio to Austin, but was cancelled in 2016 after 19 years of planning.\nRoad.\nSan Antonio is served by these major freeways:\nOther highways include:\nAlong with FM 471, FM 1957, and SH 211\nAlso, the city has multiple streets with the same (or similar) names. As examples:\nA large portion of trade between Mexico and the United States passes through the San Antonio area's interstate highway system.\nOf the five largest cities in Texas, San Antonio (within city limits) is the largest city in the state without toll roads. (Houston, Dallas, Austin, and Fort Worth have toll roads.)\nSan Antonio enjoys less traffic congestion than other large Texas cities. In a 2022 study by TomTom, San Antonio is only the 41st-most congested city in the U.S. and the fifth-most congested city in Texas. By comparison, Houston, McAllen, Austin, and Dallas-Fort Worth rank higher than San Antonio for traffic congestion.\nBicycle paths.\nSan Antonio has about of bike lanes, routes or off-road paths. Off-road trails travel along the San Antonio River, linear greenways, or city parks. Although largely disconnected, the progress to create a bicycle-friendly environment was recognized when San Antonio was designated a bronze-level \"Bicycle Friendly Community\" in 2015 by the League of American Bicyclists.\nBicycle sharing.\nA bike sharing service was approved by the city council on June 17, 2010. The initial program consisted of 140 bikes at 14 locations supported by a \"central hub\". It is expected to serve both residents and visitors. San Antonio Bike Share, a non-profit, was formed to oversee the operation, locally operated and maintained by Bike World. B-Cycle, the same system used in Denver, supplies the bike share system. It began operation in March 2011.\nWalkability.\nAs of 2021[ [update]], Walk Score ranks San Antonio as the least walkable American city a population greater than one million and calls it car-dependent. This is due in large part to its rapid growth after World War II, the prevalence of single-family zoning and thousands of miles of missing or broken sidewalks.\nThe Howard W. Peak Greenway is an of hiking and biking trails that roughly forms a ring around the city. It is accessible by more than 65 trailheads and connects to dozens of parks. With construction beginning in 2007, the trails consist of the Leon Creek Greenway, the Salado Creek Greenway, the Westside Creeks, and the Medina River Greenway.\nInternational relations.\nSister cities.\nSan Antonio is twinned with:\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name has become synonymous with the U.S. film industry and the people associated with it. Many notable film studios such as Sony Pictures, Walt Disney Studios, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and Universal Pictures are located in or near Hollywood.\nHollywood was incorporated as a municipality in 1903. The northern and eastern parts of the neighborhood were consolidated with the City of Los Angeles in 1910. Soon thereafter, the prominent film industry migrated to the area.\nHistory.\nInitial development.\nH. J. Whitley, a real estate developer, arranged to buy the E.C. Hurd ranch. Whitley shared his plans for the new town with General Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the \"Los Angeles Times\", and Ivar Weid, a prominent businessman in the area.\nDaeida Wilcox, who donated land to help in the development of Hollywood, learned of the name \"Hollywood\" from an acquaintance who owned an estate by that name in Illinois.\nWilcox is quoted as saying, \"I chose the name Hollywood simply because it sounds nice and because I'm superstitious and holly brings good luck.\" She recommended the same name to her husband, Harvey H. Wilcox, who had purchased 120 acres on February 1, 1887. It was not until August 1887 that Wilcox decided to use that name and filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office on a deed and parcel map of the property.\nBy 1900, the region had a post office, newspaper, hotel, and two markets. Los Angeles, with a population of 102,479, lay east through the vineyards, barley fields, and citrus groves. A single-track streetcar line ran down the middle of Prospect Avenue from it, but service was infrequent and the trip took two hours. The old citrus fruit-packing house was converted into a livery stable, improving transportation for the inhabitants of Hollywood.\nThe Hollywood Hotel was opened in 1902 by Whitley, president of the Los Pacific Boulevard and Development Company. Having finally acquired the Hurd ranch and subdivided it, Whitley built the hotel to attract land buyers. Flanking the west side of Highland Avenue, the structure fronted on Prospect Avenue (later Hollywood Boulevard). Although it was still a dusty, unpaved road, it was regularly graded and graveled. The hotel became internationally known and was the center of the civic and social life and home of movie stars for many years.\nWhitley's company developed and sold one of the early residential areas, the Ocean View Tract. Whitley did much to promote the area. He paid thousands of dollars to install electricity and arrange for electric lighting, and he built both a bank and a road into the Cahuenga Pass. The lighting ran for several blocks down Prospect Avenue. Whitley's land was centered on Highland Avenue. His 1918 development, Whitley Heights, was named for him.\nIncorporation and merger.\nHollywood was incorporated as a municipality on November 14, 1903, by a vote of 88 for and 77 against. On January 30, 1904, the voters in Hollywood decided, 113 to\u00a096, to banish the sale of liquor within the city, except for medicinal purposes. Neither hotels nor restaurants were allowed to serve wine or liquor before or after meals.\nIn 1910, the city voted for a merger with Los Angeles in order to secure an adequate water supply and to gain access to the L.A. sewer system.\nWith annexation, the name of Prospect Avenue was changed to Hollywood Boulevard and all the street numbers in the new district changed. For example, 100 Prospect Avenue, at Vermont Avenue, became 6400 Hollywood Boulevard; and 100 Cahuenga Boulevard, at Hollywood Boulevard, changed to 1700 Cahuenga Boulevard.\nMotion picture industry.\nBy 1912, major motion-picture companies had come West to set up production near or in Los Angeles.\nIn the early 1900s, most motion picture camera and equipment patents were held by Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey, which often sued filmmakers to stop their productions. To escape this, filmmakers began moving to Los Angeles, where attempts to enforce Edison's patents were easier to evade. Also, the weather was ideal for filmmaking and there was quick access to various settings. Los Angeles became the capital of the film industry in the United States. The mountains, plains and low land prices made Hollywood a good place to establish film studios.\nDirector D. W. Griffith was the first to make a motion picture in Hollywood. His 17-minute short film \"In\u00a0Old\u00a0California\" (1910) was filmed for the Biograph Company. Although Hollywood banned movie theaters\u2014of which it had none\u2014before annexation that year, Los Angeles had no such restriction.\nThe first studio in Hollywood opened in early 1913, on Formosa Avenue down the street from Helen Muir's home.447 Her father John Muir returned from his tour of Europe and East Africa a few months later and continued work on Yosemite and his book, \"The Yosemite\".447 The Nestor Film Company was the first studio, established in October 1911 by the New Jersey\u2013based Centaur Film Company in a roadhouse at 6121 Sunset Boulevard (the corner of Gower). Four major film companies \u2013 Paramount, Warner Bros., RKO, and Columbia \u2013 had studios in Hollywood, as did several minor companies and rental studios. In the 1920s, Hollywood was the fifth-largest industry in the nation. By the 1930s, Hollywood studios became fully vertically integrated, as production, distribution and exhibition was controlled by these companies, enabling Hollywood to produce 600 films per year.\nHollywood became known as \"Tinseltown\"\nand the \"dream factory\" because of the glittering image of the movie industry.\nFurther development.\nA large sign reading \"HOLLYWOODLAND\" was erected in the Hollywood Hills in 1923 to advertise real estate developers Woodruff's and Shoults' housing development. In 1949, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce entered a contract with the City of Los Angeles to repair and rebuild the sign. The agreement stipulated that \"LAND\" be removed to spell \"HOLLYWOOD\" so the sign would now refer to the district, rather than the housing development.\nDuring the early 1950s, the State of California constructed the Hollywood Freeway through the northeast corner of Hollywood.\nThe Capitol Records Building on Vine Street, just north of Hollywood Boulevard, was built in 1956. The Hollywood Walk of Fame was created in 1958 as a tribute to artists and other significant contributors to the entertainment industry. The official opening was on February 8, 1960.\nThe Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nIn June 1999, the Hollywood extension of the Los Angeles Metro Rail Red Line subway opened from Downtown Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley, with stops along Hollywood Boulevard at Western Avenue (Hollywood/Western Metro station), Vine Street (Hollywood/Vine Metro station), and Highland Avenue (Hollywood/Highland Metro station).\nThe Dolby Theatre, which opened in 2001 as the Kodak Theatre at the Hollywood &amp; Highland Center mall, is the site of the annual Academy Awards programs. The mall is located where the Hollywood Hotel once stood.\nRevitalization.\nAfter the neighborhood underwent years of serious decline in the 1980s, with crime, drugs and increasing poverty among some residents, many landmarks were threatened with demolition. Columbia Square, at the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, is part of the ongoing rebirth of Hollywood. The Art Deco-style studio complex, completed in 1938, was once the Hollywood headquarters for CBS. It became home to a new generation of broadcasters when cable television networks MTV, Comedy Central, BET and Spike TV consolidated their offices there in 2014 as part of a $420 million office, residential and retail complex. Paramount Skydance Corporation moved their corporate headquarters to Hollywood in August 2025 following the merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global.\nSince 2000, Hollywood has been increasingly gentrified due to revitalization by private enterprise and public planners. Over 1,200 hotel rooms have been added in the Hollywood area between 2001 and 2016. Four thousand new apartments and over thirty low to mid-rise development projects were approved in 2019.\nSecession movement.\nIn 2002, some Hollywood voters began a campaign for the area to secede from Los Angeles and become a separate municipality. In June of that year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors placed secession referendums for both Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley on the ballot. To pass, they required the approval of a majority of voters in the proposed new municipality as well as a majority of voters in all of Los Angeles. In the November election, both measures failed by wide margins in the citywide vote.\nGeography.\nAccording to the Mapping L.A. project of the \"Los Angeles Times\", Hollywood is flanked by the Hollywood Hills to the north, Los Feliz to the northeast, East Hollywood or Virgil Village to the east, Larchmont and Hancock Park to the south, Fairfax to the southwest, West Hollywood to the west, and Hollywood Hills West to the northwest.\nStreet limits of the Hollywood neighborhood are: north, Hollywood Boulevard from La Brea Avenue to the east boundary of Wattles Garden Park and Franklin Avenue between Bonita and Western avenues; east, Western Avenue; south, Melrose Avenue, and west, La Brea Avenue or the West Hollywood city line.\nIn 1918, H.\u00a0J.\u00a0Whitley commissioned architect A.\u00a0S.\u00a0Barnes to design Whitley Heights as a Mediterranean-style village on the hills above Hollywood Boulevard. It became the first celebrity community.\nOther areas within Hollywood are Franklin Village, Little Armenia, Spaulding Square, Thai Town, and Yucca Corridor.\nFailed trademarking attempt.\nIn 1994, Hollywood, Alabama, and ten other towns named Hollywood successfully fought an attempt by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to trademark the name and force same-named communities to pay royalties to it.\nClimate.\nLike the rest of Los Angeles, Hollywood has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\") or dry-summer subtropical climate. Winters are typically mild and with light rain, but there are still plenty of warm, sunny days in the winter, as well. Summers are hot, sunny and dry, with virtually no rain falling between April and October; while summer days can be warm, they are considerably cooler than in the San Fernando Valley. Spring and fall are generally warm, sunny, and pleasant. Santa Ana winds typically occur during the fall and winter months, although they can occur during any month; Santa Ana winds bring heavy winds, higher temperatures and lower humidity levels, which increases the risk of wildfires, especially in dry years. Smog can sometimes occur during the summer months. May and June can be foggy and cloudy in Hollywood, a phenomenon known by southern California residents as \"May Gray\" or \"June Gloom\".\nThe all-time record high temperature in Hollywood is on June 26, 1990, and the all-time record low temperature is on both December 8, 1978, and December 23, 1990.\nDemographics.\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 77,818 residents in the Hollywood neighborhood\u2014an average of , the seventh-densest neighborhood in all of Los Angeles County. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 85,489. The median age for residents was 31, about the city's average.\nHollywood was said to be \"highly diverse\" when compared to the city at large. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was 42.2% Latino or Hispanic, 41% Non-Hispanic White, 7.1% Asian, 5.2% Black, and 4.5% other. Mexico (21.3%) and Guatemala (13%) were the most common places of birth for the 53.8% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high for the city as a whole.\nThe median household income in 2008 was $33,694, considered low for Los Angeles. The average household size of 2.1 people was also lower than the city norm. Renters occupied 92.4% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest.\nThe percentages of never-married men (55.1%), never-married women (39.8%) and widows (9.6%) were among the county's highest. There were 2,640 families headed by single parents, about average for Los Angeles.\nIn 2000, there were 2,828 military veterans, or 4.5%, a low rate for the city as a whole.\nThese were the ten neighborhoods or cities in Los Angeles County with the highest population densities, according to the 2000 census, with the population per square mile:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHomelessness.\nIn 2022, there were 1,374 homeless individuals in Hollywood.\nRadio and television.\nKNX was the last radio station to broadcast from Hollywood before it left CBS Columbia Square for a studio in the Miracle Mile in 2005.\nOn January 22, 1947, the first commercial television station west of the Mississippi River, KTLA, began operating in Hollywood. In December of that year, \"The Public Prosecutor\" became the first network television series to be filmed in Hollywood. Television stations KTLA and KCET, both on Sunset Boulevard, are the last broadcasters (television or radio) with Hollywood addresses, but KCET has since sold its studios to the Church of Scientology on Sunset, and plans to move to another location. KNBC moved in 1962 from the former NBC Radio City Studios at the northeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street to NBC Studios in Burbank. KTTV moved in 1996 from its former home at Metromedia Square on Sunset Boulevard to West Los Angeles, and KCOP left its home on La Brea Avenue to join KTTV at the modern-day Fox Television Center. KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV moved from their longtime home at CBS Columbia Square on Sunset Boulevard to a new facility at CBS Studio Center in Studio City.\nGovernment.\nAs a neighborhood within the Los Angeles city limits, Hollywood does not have its own municipal government. A person was appointed by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to serve as an honorary \"Mayor of Hollywood\" for ceremonial purposes. Johnny Grant held this position from 1980 until his death on January 9, 2008.\nEmergency services.\nThe Los Angeles Police Department is responsible for police services. The Hollywood police station is at 1358 N. Wilcox Avenue.\nLos Angeles Fire Department operates four fire stations, 27, 41, 52, and\u00a082\u00a0in the area.\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Hollywood-Wilshire Health Center in Hollywood.\nPost office.\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Hollywood Post Office, the Hollywood Pavilion Post Office, and the Sunset Post Office.\nNeighborhood councils.\nHollywood is included within the Hollywood United Neighborhood Council (HUNC), Hollywood Hills West Neighborhood Council, and the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council. Neighborhood Councils cast advisory votes on such issues as zoning, planning, and other community issues. The council members are voted in by stakeholders, generally defined as anyone living, working, owning property, or belonging to an organization within the boundaries of the council.\nEducation.\nHollywood residents aged 25 and older holding a four-year degree amounted to 28% of the population in 2000, about the same as in the county at large.\nPublic libraries.\nThe Will and Ariel Durant Branch, John C. Fremont Branch, and the Frances Howard Goldwyn \u2013 Hollywood Regional Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library are in Hollywood.\nSchools.\nPublic schools are operated by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).\nSchools in Hollywood include:\nNotable places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAnnual events.\nThe Academy Awards, which honor the preceding year in film, have been held every year in late February/early March since 2004; prior to 2004, they were held in late March/early April. Since 2002, the Oscars have been held at the Dolby Theatre (formerly Kodak Theatre) at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, with the exception of 2020, when due to the COVID-19 pandemic they were held in Los Angeles Union Station.\nThe annual Hollywood Christmas Parade goes down Hollywood Boulevard and is broadcast in the Los Angeles area on KTLA and around the United States on Tribune-owned stations and the WGN superstation. The 75th edition of the parade was held in 2006.\nThe Hollywood Half Marathon began in 2012 and takes place every April. The event includes a Half Marathon, 10K, 5K, and Kids Fun Run along Hollywood Blvd., and is used to raise funds and awareness for local youth homeless shelters.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53855", "revid": "756128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53855", "title": "Benny Goodman", "text": "American jazz clarinetist and bandleader (1909\u20131986)\nBenjamin David Goodman (May 30, 1909 \u2013 June 13, 1986) was an American clarinetist and bandleader, known as the \"King of Swing\". His orchestra did well commercially.\nFrom 1936 until the mid-1940s, Goodman led one of the most popular swing big bands in the United States. His concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City on January 16, 1938, is described by critic Bruce Eder as \"the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz's 'coming out' party to the world of 'respectable' music.\"\nGoodman's bands started the careers of many jazz musicians. During an era of racial segregation, he led one of the first integrated jazz groups, his trio and quartet. He continued performing until the end of his life while pursuing an interest in classical music.\nEarly years.\nGoodman was the ninth of twelve children born to poor Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire. His father, David Goodman, came to the United States in 1892 from Warsaw in partitioned Poland and became a tailor. His mother, Dora Grisinsky, came from Kaunas. They met in Baltimore, Maryland and moved to Chicago before Goodman's birth. With little income and a large family, they moved to the Maxwell Street neighborhood, an overcrowded slum near railroad yards and factories that was populated by German, Irish, Italian, Polish, Scandinavian, and Jewish immigrants.\nGoodman grew up in poverty, where money was a constant problem for his family. On Sundays, his father took the children to free band concerts in Douglas Park; this was the first time Goodman experienced live professional performances. Hoping that music would offer his sons an escape from poverty and help keep them out of trouble, David Goodman enrolled ten-year-old Benny and two of his brothers in free music classes at the Kehelah Jacob Synagogue, starting in 1919. His older brothers were given a tuba and a trumpet, while Benny, the youngest, received a clarinet. Additionally, Benny took two years of clarinet lessons from Franz Schoepp, a classically trained clarinetist and member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The following year, Goodman joined the boys' club band at Hull House, where he received instruction from the band director, James Sylvester. By joining the band, he had the chance to spend two weeks at a summer camp near Chicago, which was his only opportunity to escape his tough neighborhood. At the age of 13, he obtained his first union card and performed on excursion boats on Lake Michigan. In 1923, he played at Guyon's Paradise, a local dance hall.\nIn the summer of 1923, he met the cornetist and composer Bix Beiderbecke. He attended the Lewis Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1924 as a high school sophomore and played clarinet in a dance hall band. When he was 17, his father was killed by a passing car after stepping off a streetcar, which Goodman called \"the saddest thing that ever happened in our family\".\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nHis early influences were New Orleans jazz clarinetists who worked in Chicago, such as Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, and Leon Roppolo. He learned quickly, becoming a strong player at an early age, and was soon playing in bands. He made his professional debut in 1921 at the Central Park Theater on the West Side of Chicago. He entered Harrison Technical High School in Chicago in 1922. At fourteen he became a member of the musicians' union and worked in a band featuring Bix Beiderbecke. Two years later, in 1926, he joined the Ben Pollack Orchestra and made his first recordings.\nFrom sideman to bandleader.\nGoodman moved to New York City and became a session musician for radio, Broadway musicals, and in studios. In addition to clarinet, he sometimes played alto saxophone and baritone saxophone. His first recording pressed to disc (Victor 20394) occurred on December 9, 1926, in Chicago. The session resulted in the song \"When I First Met Mary\", which also included Glenn Miller, Harry Goodman, and Ben Pollack. In a Victor recording session on March 21, 1928, he played alongside Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Joe Venuti in the All-Star Orchestra directed by Nathaniel Shilkret. He played with the bands of Red Nichols, Ben Selvin, Ted Lewis, and Isham Jones and recorded for Brunswick under the name Benny Goodman's Boys, a band that featured Glenn Miller. In 1928, Goodman and Miller wrote \"Room 1411\", Miller's first known composition, which was released as a Brunswick 78.\nHe reached the charts for the first time in January 1931 with \"He's Not Worth Your Tears\", featuring a vocal by Scrappy Lambert for Melotone. After signing with Columbia in 1934, he had top ten hits with \"Ain't Cha Glad?\" and \"I Ain't Lazy, I'm Just Dreamin'\" sung by Jack Teagarden, \"Ol' Pappy\" sung by Mildred Bailey, and \"Riffin' the Scotch\" sung by Billie Holiday. An invitation to play at the Billy Rose Music Hall led to his creation of an orchestra for the four-month engagement. The orchestra recorded \"Moonglow\", which became a number one hit and was followed by the Top Ten hits \"Take My Word\" and \"Bugle Call Rag\".\nNBC hired Goodman for the radio program \"Let's Dance\". John Hammond asked Fletcher Henderson if he wanted to write arrangements for Goodman, and Henderson agreed. During the Depression, Henderson disbanded his orchestra because he was in debt. Goodman hired Henderson's band members to teach his musicians how to play the music.\nGoodman's band was one of three to perform on \"Let's Dance\", playing arrangements by Henderson along with hits such as \"Get Happy\" and \"Limehouse Blues\" by Spud Murphy.\nGoodman's portion of the program was broadcast too late at night to attract a large audience on the east coast. He and his band remained on \"Let's Dance\" until May of that year when a strike by employees of the series' sponsor, Nabisco, forced the cancellation of the radio show. An engagement was booked at Manhattan's Roosevelt Grill filling in for Guy Lombardo, but the audience expected \"sweet\" music and Goodman's band was unsuccessful.\nGoodman spent six months performing on \"Let's Dance\", and during that time he recorded six more Top Ten hits for Columbia.\nCatalyst for the swing era.\nOn July 31, 1935, \"King Porter Stomp\" was released with \"Sometimes I'm Happy\" on the B-side, both arranged by Henderson and recorded on July 1. In Pittsburgh at the Stanley Theater some members of the audience danced in the aisles. But these arrangements had little impact on the tour until August 19 at McFadden's Ballroom in Oakland, California. Goodman and his band, which included trumpeter Bunny Berigan, drummer Gene Krupa, and singer Helen Ward were met by a large crowd of young dancers who cheered the music they had heard on \"Let's Dance\". Newspaper columnist Herb Caen wrote, \"from the first note, the place was in an uproar.\" One night later, at Pismo Beach, the show was a flop, and the band thought the overwhelming reception in Oakland had been a fluke.\nThe next night, August 21, 1935, at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles, Goodman and his band began a three-week engagement. On top of the \"Let's Dance\" airplay, Al Jarvis had been playing Goodman's records on KFWB radio. Goodman started the evening with stock arrangements, but after an indifferent response, he began the second set with arrangements by Fletcher Henderson and Spud Murphy. According to Willard Alexander, the band's booking agent, Krupa said, \"If we're gonna die, Benny, let's die playing our own thing.\" The crowd broke into cheers and applause. News reports spread word of the exciting music and enthusiastic dancing. The Palomar engagement was such a marked success that it is often described as the beginning of the swing era. According to Donald Clarke, \"It is clear in retrospect that the Swing Era had been waiting to happen, but it was Goodman and his band that touched it off.\"\nThe reception of American swing was less enthusiastic in Europe. British author J. C. Squire filed a complaint with BBC Radio to demand it stop playing Goodman's music, which he called \"an awful series of jungle noises which can hearten no man.\" Germany's Nazi party barred jazz from the radio, claiming it was part of a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the culture. Italy's fascist government banned the broadcast of any music composed or played by Jews which they said threatened \"the flower of our race, the youth.\"\nIn November 1935, Goodman accepted an invitation to play in Chicago at the Joseph Urban Room at the Congress Hotel. His stay there was extended to six months, and his popularity was cemented by nationwide radio broadcasts over NBC affiliate stations. While in Chicago, the band recorded \"If I Could Be with You (One Hour Tonight)\", \"Stompin' at the Savoy\", and \"Goody Goody\". Goodman also played three concerts produced by Chicago socialite and jazz aficionado Helen Oakley. These \"Rhythm Club\" concerts at the Congress Hotel included sets in which Goodman and Krupa sat in with Fletcher Henderson's band, perhaps the first racially integrated big band appearing before a paying audience in the United States. Goodman and Krupa played in a trio with Teddy Wilson on piano. Both combinations were well received, and Wilson remained.\nIn his 1935\u20131936 radio broadcasts from Chicago, Goodman was introduced as the \"Rajah of Rhythm\". Slingerland Drum Company had been calling Krupa the \"King of Swing\" as part of a sales campaign, but shortly after Goodman and his crew left Chicago in May 1936 to spend the summer filming \"The Big Broadcast of 1937\" in Hollywood, the title \"King of Swing\" was applied to Goodman by the media.\nAt the end of June 1936, Goodman went to Hollywood, where, on June 30, 1936, his band began CBS's \"Camel Caravan\", its third and (according to Connor and Hicks) its greatest sponsored radio show, co-starring Goodman and his former boss Nathaniel Shilkret. By spring 1936, Fletcher Henderson was writing arrangements for Goodman's band.\nCarnegie Hall concert.\nIn late 1937, Goodman's publicist Wynn Nathanson suggested that Goodman and his band play Carnegie Hall in New York City. The sold-out concert was held on the evening of January 16, 1938. It is regarded as one of the most significant concerts in jazz history. After years of work by musicians from all over the country, jazz had finally been accepted by mainstream audiences\u2014according to Stan Ayeroff, \"the concert helped jazz evolve from being strictly dance music to music worthy of a discerning listening audience. It was the start of jazz being recognized as an art form on a par with classical music.\"\nRecordings of the concert were made, but even by the technology of the day the equipment used was not of the finest quality. These recordings were made on acetate, and aluminum studio masters were cut. The idea of recording the concert came from Albert Marx, a friend of Goodman's, for the purposes of a gift for his wife Helen Ward, as well as gifting a second set to Goodman. Sometime in or before 1950, Goodman recovered the acetates from his sister-in-law's closet, who had informed him about them, and took them to the audio engineer William Savory. The pair took them to Columbia, with Goodman realising the recordings could be used as leverage to make a recording contract with Columbia (having been eager to end his contract with Capitol). A selection was then released as an LP entitled \"The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert\".\nCharlie Christian.\nIn 1939, pianist and arranger Mary Lou Williams suggested to John Hammond, who was responsible for finding new talent for Goodman, that he see guitarist Charlie Christian. Hammond had seen Christian perform in Oklahoma City on July 10, 1939, and recommended him to Goodman, but Goodman was uninterested in electric guitar and was put off by Christian's taste in gaudy clothing. Unbeknownst to Goodman, at an August 16 concert at the Victor Hugo Restaurant in Beverly Hills, Hammond inserted Christian onto the stage. Goodman started playing \"Rose Room\" on the assumption that Christian didn't know it, but his performance impressed the audience immensely. According to Hammond, \"before long the crowd was screaming with amazement. 'Rose Room' continued for more than three quarters of an hour and Goodman received an ovation unlike any even he had before. No one present will ever forget it, least of all Benny.\"\nChristian was a member of the Benny Goodman Sextet from 1939 to 1941, and during these two years he turned the electric guitar into a popular jazz instrument.\nDecline of swing.\nGoodman continued his success throughout the late 1930s with his big band, his trio and quartet, and the sextet formed in August 1939, the same month Goodman returned to Columbia Records after four years with RCA Victor. At Columbia, John Hammond, his future brother-in-law, produced most of his sessions. By the mid-1940s, however, big bands had lost much of their popularity. In 1941, ASCAP had a licensing war with music publishers. From 1942 to 1944, and again in 1948, the musicians' union went on strike against the major record labels in the United States, and singers acquired the popularity that the big bands had once enjoyed. During the 1942\u201344 strike, the War Department approached the union and requested the production of V-Discs, a set of records containing new recordings for soldiers, thereby boosting the rise of new artists. Also, by the late 1940s, swing was no longer the dominant style of jazz musicians.\nExploring bebop.\nBy the 1940s, some jazz musicians were borrowing from classical music, while others, such as Charlie Parker, were broadening the rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic vocabulary of swing to create bebop (or bop). The bebop recordings Goodman made for Capitol were praised by critics. For his bebop band he hired Buddy Greco, Zoot Sims, and Wardell Gray. He consulted his friend Mary Lou Williams for advice on how to approach the music of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Pianist Mel Powell was also an adviser in 1945. Goodman enjoyed bebop. When he heard Thelonious Monk, he said, \"I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I like the way he played it\u00a0... I think he's got a sense of humor and he's got some good things there.\" He also admired Swedish clarinetist Stan Hasselg\u00e5rd. But after playing with a bebop band for over a year, he returned to his swing band because he concluded that was what he knew best. In 1953, he said, \"Maybe bop has done more to set music back for years than anything\u00a0... Basically it's all wrong. It's not even knowing the scales\u00a0... Bop was mostly publicity and people figuring angles.\"\nClassical repertoire.\nIn 1949 he studied with clarinetist Reginald Kell, requiring a change in technique: \"instead of holding the mouthpiece between his front teeth and lower lip, as he had done since he first took a clarinet in hand 30 years earlier, Goodman learned to adjust his embouchure to the use of both lips and even to use new fingering techniques. He had his old finger calluses removed and started to learn how to play his clarinet again\u2014almost from scratch.\"\nGoodman commissioned compositions for clarinet and chamber ensembles or orchestra that have become standard pieces of classical repertoire. He premiered works by composers, such as \"Contrasts\" by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k; Clarinet Concerto No. 2, Op. 115 by Malcolm Arnold; \"Derivations for Clarinet and Band\" by Morton Gould; Sonata for Clarinet and Piano by Francis Poulenc, and Clarinet Concerto by Aaron Copland. \"Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs\" by Leonard Bernstein was commissioned for Woody Herman's big band, but it was premiered by Goodman. Herman was the dedicatee (1945) and first performer (1946) of Igor Stravinsky's \"Ebony Concerto;\" many years later, Stravinsky made another recording with Goodman as the soloist.\nHe made a recording of Mozart's Clarinet Quintet in July 1956 with the Boston Symphony String Quartet at the Berkshire Festival; on the same occasion he recorded Mozart's Clarinet Concerto in A major, K. 622, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Munch. He also recorded the clarinet concertos of Weber. In 1972, he was a soloist with the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series.\nAfter forays outside swing, Goodman started a new band in 1953. According to Donald Clarke, this was not a happy time for Goodman. He reunited the band to tour with Louis Armstrong. But he insulted Armstrong and \"was appalled at the vaudeville aspects of Louis's act...a contradiction of everything Goodman stood for\". Armstrong left Goodman hanging during a joint performance where Goodman called Armstrong back onstage to wrap up the show. Armstrong refused to perform alongside Goodman, which led essentially to the end of their friendship.\nGoodman's band appeared as a specialty act in the films \"The Big Broadcast of 1937\"; \"Hollywood Hotel\" (1938); \"Syncopation\" (1942); \"The Powers Girl\" (1942); \"Stage Door Canteen\" (1943); \"The Gang's All Here\" (1943); \"Sweet and Low-Down\" (1944), Goodman's only starring feature; \"Make Mine Music\" (1946) and \"A Song Is Born\" (1948).\nLater years.\nHe continued to play on records and in small groups. In the early 1970s he collaborated with George Benson after the two met taping a PBS tribute to John Hammond, recreating some of Goodman's duets with Charlie Christian. Benson appeared on Goodman's album \"Seven Come Eleven\". Goodman continued to play swing, but he practiced and performed classical pieces and commissioned them for clarinet. In 1960 he performed Mozart's Clarinet Concerto with conductor Alfredo Antonini at the Lewisohn Stadium in New York City. Despite health problems, he continued to perform, his last concert being six days before his death. Goodman died on June 13, 1986, of a heart attack while taking a nap at his apartment in Manhattan House.\nPersonal life.\nOne of Goodman's closest friends was Columbia producer John Hammond, who influenced Goodman's move from Victor to Columbia. Goodman married Hammond's sister, Alice Frances Hammond Duckworth (1905\u20131978), on March 20, 1942. The couple had two daughters: Rachel, a concert pianist, and Benji, a cellist; Goodman also raised Alice's three daughters from her first marriage to British politician Arthur Duckworth. Rachel Goodman performed piano concerts with her father, starting when she was sixteen.\nGoodman and Hammond had disagreements from the 1930s onwards. For the 1939 Spirituals to Swing concert Hammond had placed Charlie Christian into the Kansas City Six to play before Goodman's band, which had angered Goodman. They disagreed over the band's music until Goodman refused to listen to Hammond. Their arguments escalated, and in 1941 Hammond left Columbia. Goodman appeared on a 1975 PBS tribute to Hammond but remained at a distance. In the 1980s, after the death of Alice Goodman, Hammond and Goodman reconciled. On June 25, 1985, Goodman appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City for \"A Tribute to John Hammond\".\nGoodman was regarded by some as a demanding taskmaster, by others as an arrogant and eccentric martinet. Many musicians spoke of \"The Ray\", the glare that Goodman directed at a musician who failed to perform to his standards. After guitarist Allan Reuss incurred Goodman's displeasure, Goodman relegated him to the rear of the bandstand where his contribution would be drowned out by the other musicians. Vocalists Anita O'Day and Helen Forrest spoke bitterly of their experiences singing with Goodman: \"The twenty or so months I spent with Benny felt like twenty years,\" said Forrest. \"When I look back, they seem like a life sentence.\" He was generous and funded several college educations, though always secretly. When a friend asked him why, he said, \"Well, if they knew about it, everyone would come to me with their hand out.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"As far as I'm concerned, what he did in those days\u2014and they were hard days, in 1937\u2014made it possible for Negroes to have their chance in baseball and other fields.\"\nGoodman helped racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white musicians could not play together in most clubs and concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by Jim Crow laws. Goodman hired Teddy Wilson for his trio and added vibraphonist Lionel Hampton for his quartet. In 1939 he hired guitarist Charlie Christian. This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball's six-decade-long color line. According to \"Jazz\" (Episode 5) by Ken Burns, Lionel Hampton states that when someone asked Goodman why he \"played with that nigger\" (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, \"If you say that again to me, I'll take a clarinet and bust you across your head with it\".\nIn 1962, the Benny Goodman Orchestra toured the Soviet Union as part of a cultural exchange program between the two nations after the Cuban Missile Crisis and the end of that phase of the Cold War; both visits were part of efforts to normalize relations between the United States and the USSR. Members of the band included Jimmy Knepper, Jerry Dodgion, and Turk Van Lake (Vanig Hovsepian). Bassist Bill Crow published a very colorful view of the tour and Goodman's conduct during it under the title \"To Russia Without Love\".\nAwards and honors.\nGoodman was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\nAfter winning polls as best jazz clarinetist, Goodman was inducted into the \"DownBeat\" Jazz Hall of Fame in 1957.\nHe was a member of the radio division of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.\nHis papers were donated to Yale University after his death. He received honorary doctorates from Union College, the University of Illinois, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Bard College, Brandeis University, Columbia University, Harvard University, and Yale University.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53862", "revid": "49189014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53862", "title": "Darth Vader", "text": "Star Wars character\nDarth Vader () is a fictional character in the \"Star Wars\" franchise. He was first introduced in the original film trilogy as one of the major villains and leaders of the Galactic Empire. The prequel trilogy chronicles his transformation from the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into the Sith Lord Darth Vader. His metamorphosis begins when he is lured to the dark side of the Force by Chancellor Palpatine, who later becomes the Galactic Emperor. After a lightsaber battle with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader is severely injured and is transformed into a cyborg. He serves Palpatine for over two decades, hunting down the remaining Jedi and attempting to crush the Rebel Alliance. When Palpatine tries to kill Vader's son, Luke Skywalker, the Sith Lord turns against his master and destroys him. Vader is the husband of Padm\u00e9 Amidala, the father of Luke and his twin sister Leia Organa, and the grandfather of Ben Solo (later known as Kylo Ren).\nDavid Prowse physically portrays Vader in the original film trilogy, while James Earl Jones provides his voice in all of the films and in other media (despite Jones' retirement and death, his voice continues to be used as a template for Vader's voice). Sebastian Shaw portrays Anakin unmasked and as a ghost in \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), while Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen portray Anakin in the prequel trilogy, with Christensen reprising the role in the series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" (2022) and \"\" (2023). In the standalone film \"Rogue One\" (2016), Vader is portrayed by Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous. Vader also appears in novels, comics, and video games, and has become an iconic character in popular culture.\nCreation and development.\nDarth Vader.\nAs part of the development for the original \"Star Wars\" film\",\" George Lucas hired the artist Ralph McQuarrie to create conceptual images for the characters. For Vader, Lucas asked McQuarrie to depict a \"very tall, dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind.\" Because the script described Vader traveling between spaceships, McQuarrie suggested that he should wear a space suit. Lucas agreed, and McQuarrie created Vader's iconic mask by combining a full-face breathing mask with a samurai helmet. A 1975 by McQuarrie depicts Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller, who later became Luke Skywalker. Vader is shown wearing black armor, a flowing cape and a skull-like mask and helmet. This early design was similar to Vader's final appearance.\nWorking from McQuarrie's concepts, the costume designer John Mollo devised an outfit that combined clerical robes, a motorcycle suit, a German military helmet, and a military gas mask. The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armor. The sound of Vader's breathing was created by the film's sound designer, Ben Burtt, using modified recordings of a scuba breathing apparatus. The sound effect is trademarked at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. \nLucas has provided differing accounts of how the name \"Darth Vader\" originated. On one occasion, he said it was inspired by the phrase \"Dark Water\". It is also possible that \"Darth Vader\" originated from the name of Gary Vader, a boy who went to high school with Lucas. \u201cDarth\u201d is a title given to the Sith Lords of the Sith Order, such as Darth Sidious (Palpatine), Darth Tyranus (Count Dooku), and Darth Maul. It was widely believed for years that \"Darth Vader\" meant \"Dark Father\", even fueled by Lucas himself after the release of \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\", despite contradicting the fact that the \"father\" twist in that film hadn't been planned when Darth Vader was created.\nThe names of various \"Star Wars\" characters have been altered in countries outside the United States. In France, Vader's name was changed to () starting with the original film. Although the names of some other characters have been reverted to the English versions over the years, Vader is still referred to as \"Dark Vador\" in recent French-language \"Star Wars\" media. The title \"Darth\" has been replaced with \"Dark\" for other Sith Lords as well. In Italian-language editions of \"Star Wars\" films, Darth Vader was called () starting with the original trilogy. In 2004, the dubbing director for the Italian-language version of \"Revenge of the Sith\" (2005) asked Italian fans to decide which name to use in the film; the Italian name was chosen. However, the name was switched to \"Darth Vader\" for \"The Force Awakens\" (2015). In Iceland, Darth Vader's name is , which means \"black-head\".\nAnakin Skywalker.\nThe films \"Swiss Family Robinson\" (1960) and \"Battle of the Bulge\" (1965) influenced the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, but Lucas' publicist has denied that Anakin Skywalker was named after Ken Annakin, the director of those films. The original surname of Anakin and Luke was \"Starkiller\", and it remained in the script until a few months into filming \"Star Wars\". It was dropped due to what Lucas called \"unpleasant connotations\" with Charles Manson, who became a \"star killer\" in 1969 when he murdered actress Sharon Tate. Lucas replaced \"Starkiller\" with \"Skywalker\".\n\"The Phantom Menace\" introduced the possibility that Anakin could be the Chosen One of an ancient Jedi prophecy, who is destined to bring balance to the Force. Lucas stated in an interview that \"Anakin is the Chosen One. Even when Anakin turns into Darth Vader, he is still the Chosen One.\" Hayden Christensen said of Anakin: \"He believes that he's the Chosen One. He's not doing wrong things knowing that it's having a negative impact. So there's that sort of naivety to him...and it makes him more human in a lot of ways.\" Lucas later clarified that the plot element of Anakin's virgin birth was meant to align the character with heroes from mythology in general and not specifically Jesus.\nAfter completing principal photography for \"Revenge of the Sith\" in 2003, Lucas made changes to Anakin's character by rewriting his turn to the dark side. He accomplished this through editing the principal footage and filming new scenes during pickups in London in 2004. In previous versions of the script, Anakin had several reasons for turning to the dark side, including his sincere belief that the Jedi were plotting to seize control of the Republic. Although he retains this belief in the finished film, Lucas' changes emphasized his desire to rescue Padm\u00e9 from death. Thus, in the theatrical version of \"Revenge of the Sith\", Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padm\u00e9.\nAnakin's apprentice Ahsoka Tano was introduced in the 2008 animated film '. Giving Anakin responsibility for a Padawan was meant to place the character in a role that forced him to become more cautious and responsible. After just a short time together, though, Anakin realized they shared many qualities, and she could benefit from a mentor similar to herself. Ahsoka was eager, reckless, and undisciplined, much like Anakin. However, those traits are among the reasons that Anakin was such a good Jedi and master to Ahsoka. It was also meant to provide him with insight about his relationship with his own master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and show how their relationship matured. Anakin's relationship with Ahsoka was seen as an essential story arc spanning both the film and the 2008 television series '.\nPortrayals.\nDarth Vader.\nDavid Prowse, a bodybuilder and actor, portrays Vader in the original trilogy. Prowse was originally offered the role of Chewbacca, but turned it down, as he wanted to play the villain. Bob Anderson, a former Olympic fencer, portrays Vader during lightsaber fight scenes in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". Lucas chose to have a different actor provide Vader's voice, because he felt Prowse's West Country English accent was inappropriate for the character. The director originally considered Orson Welles for the role, but selected James Earl Jones instead after deciding that Welles' voice would be too recognizable to audiences. Jones initially felt his role was too small to warrant recognition, and he chose to be uncredited in \"Star Wars\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" He was finally credited in \"Return of the Jedi\" in 1983.\nWhen filming the scene in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" in which Vader confesses he is Luke's father, Prowse was given modified dialogue to read that did not exist in the script. He was known for repeatedly leaking information to the public, and the filmmakers wanted to keep Vader's revelation a secret until the film was released. Prowse was asked to read the line \"Obi-Wan killed your father\" instead of \"No, I am your father.\" Only the director, the producers, and Mark Hamill knew the actual line, which was dubbed in later by Jones. Prowse did not know the real line until he viewed the finished film.\nHayden Christensen portrays Vader in \"Revenge of the Sith\", while Brock Peters provides his voice in the \"Star Wars\" radio series. Scott Lawrence voices Vader in video games, including the 2019 virtual reality series \"\". Matt Sloan voices the Sith Lord in both video games and television productions. Both Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous portray Vader in \"Rogue One\", with Jones providing the voice. Jones also voices Vader in the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" (1978) and the animated series \"Star Wars Rebels\". In September 2022, it was confirmed that Jones would retire from voicing the character. His voice was digitally recreated by the company Respeecher for use in the series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\", and he later signed over the rights to his voice for future \"Star Wars\" productions.\nAnakin Skywalker.\nNear the end of \"Return of the Jedi\", Luke removes Vader's mask. Although Prowse had portrayed the Sith Lord throughout the trilogy, the filmmakers wanted a more experienced actor to play the unmasked Vader. Sebastian Shaw was selected for the role, which appears as \"Anakin Skywalker\" in the credits. Shaw's presence on set was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew, and Shaw was contractually obligated not to discuss any film secrets with anyone, even his family. In the final scene of the film, Shaw portrays Anakin's Force spirit. His likeness in this scene was replaced with that of Hayden Christensen in the 2004 DVD release.\nWhen \"The Phantom Menace\" was being developed, hundreds of actors were auditioned for the role of young Anakin before Jake Lloyd was cast.

When Vader attacks the fleet of the Phoenix Squadron, he discovers that Ahsoka is still alive and has joined the Rebel Alliance. She is overwhelmed when she recognizes Anakin under a \"layer of hate\". The Emperor then orders Vader to send another Inquisitor to capture her. Later in the season, Ahsoka has a vision in which Anakin blames her for his fall to the dark side. In the season finale, Ahsoka duels with Vader inside a Sith Temple. As the episode concludes, Vader emerges from the ruins of the temple, while Ahsoka's fate is left unknown.\n\"Forces of Destiny\".\nAnakin appears in multiple episodes of the animated web series \"Forces of Destiny\" (2017\u20132018).\n\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\".\nHayden Christensen portrays both Anakin and Vader in the 2022 miniseries \"Obi-Wan Kenobi,\" set a decade after \"Revenge of the Sith\" and nine years before \"A New Hope\".

While attempting to draw Obi-Wan out of hiding, the Imperial Inquisitor Reva Sevander tells him that Anakin is still alive. Vader begins hunting Obi-Wan, which eventually leads them to duel again. Although Vader initially overpowers his former master, Obi-Wan recovers his strength and wounds Vader multiple times. He slashes open Vader's helmet to partially reveal his face, then leaves him, weakened and wheezing.

A bird version of Vader appears as a playable character and a boss in \"Angry Birds Star Wars\" and its sequel.\nDarth Vader was added to \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" in 2022 as both a cosmetic outfit\u2014part of the Chapter 3, Season 3 Battle Pass\u2014and as a non-playable character (NPC). In May 2025, the Darth Vader NPC returned as part of the \"Star Wars: Galactic Battle\" season of \"Fortnite\", with the added feature of allowing players to converse with the character, accomplished via generative AI modeled on James Earl Jones' voice. Additionally, an Anakin Skywalker outfit was added in 2023, and a Samurai Darth Vader outfit was added in 2024. \nNovels.\n\"\" was one of four canon novels released between 2014 and 2015. In it, Vader and Palpatine find themselves hunted by revolutionaries on the planet Ryloth.\nComics.\nThe 25-issue Marvel comic series \"Darth Vader\" (2015\u20132016) focuses on the Sith Lord in the aftermath of the Death Star's destruction, as well as his life after learning about his son's existence. The series takes place parallel to the 2015 series \"Star Wars\", in which Vader and Luke meet; the two series have a crossover titled \"Vader Down\". A continuation series set between \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\" debuted in 2020. The first few issues focus on Vader exacting revenge on those who concealed Luke; he also visits Padm\u00e9's tomb on Naboo and encounters her handmaidens. A subsequent story arc depicts Vader being tested by the Emperor. The five-issue series \"Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin\" (2016) depicts the lives of the two Jedi between \"The Phantom Menace\" and \"Attack of the Clones\".\nBetween 2017 and 2018, Charles Soule wrote a prequel-era series, also called \"Darth Vader\" (sometimes subtitled \"Dark Lord of the Sith\"). It begins immediately after Vader wakes up in his armor at the end of \"Revenge of the Sith\" and explores his emotional transformation upon learning of Padm\u00e9's death, his adjustment to his mechanical suit, how he creates his red-bladed lightsaber, and his hunting of Jedi in the Inquisitor program. Its final arc, which depicts the construction of Vader's fortress on Mustafar, implies that Palpatine used the Force to conceive Anakin \"in utero\", as some had theorized that \"Revenge of the Sith\" indicates. A Lucasfilm story group member later clarified that \"This is all in Anakin's head\".\nA five-issue limited series titled \"Vader: Dark Visions\", was released in 2019. \"Vader Down\" writer Jason Aaron wrote part of the miniseries \"Darth Vader: Black, White &amp; Red\", an extension of a Marvel event highlighting fan-favorite characters.\n\"Star Wars Legends\".\nFollowing the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe material produced between 1977 and 2014 was rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise. The \"Legends\" works comprise a separate narrative universe.\nBooks.\nVader is featured prominently in novels set in the \"Star Wars\" universe. In the 1978 novel \"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\" by Alan Dean Foster, Vader meets Luke for the first time and engages him in a lightsaber duel that ends with Luke cutting off Vader's arm and Vader falling into a deep pit. \"\" (1996) reveals that Vader is conflicted about trying to turn his son to the dark side, and knows deep down that he still has good in him.\nVader's supposedly indestructible glove is the MacGuffin of the young-reader's book \"The Glove of Darth Vader\" (1992). Anakin Skywalker's redeemed spirit appears in \"The Truce at Bakura\" (1993), set a few days after the end of \"Return of the Jedi\". He appears to Leia, imploring her forgiveness. Leia condemns Anakin for his crimes and banishes him from her life. He promises that he will be there for her when she needs him, and disappears. In \"Tatooine Ghost\" (2003), Leia learns to forgive her father after learning about his childhood as a slave and his mother's traumatic death. In \"The Unifying Force\" (2003), Anakin tells his grandson Jacen Solo to \"stand firm\" in his battle with the Supreme Overlord of the Yuuzhan Vong.\nUpon the release of the prequel films, the Expanded Universe grew to include novels about Vader's former life as Anakin. Greg Bear's 2000 novel \"Rogue Planet\" and Jude Watson's \"Jedi Quest\" series chronicle Anakin's early missions with Obi-Wan, while James Luceno's 2005 novel \"Labyrinth of Evil\", set during the Clone Wars, depicts Anakin battling Separatist commander General Grievous. In Luceno's \"\" (2005), set a few months after the events of \"Revenge of the Sith\", Vader disavows his identity as Anakin as he hunts down surviving Jedi and cements his position in the Empire.\nIn the \"Dark Nest\" trilogy (2005), Luke and Leia uncover old recordings of their parents in R2-D2's memory drive; for the first time, they see their own birth and their mother's death, as well as their father's corruption to the dark side.

Among other missions, he fights a duel with Dooku's apprentice Asajj Ventress, helps Obi-Wan capture a Separatist-controlled fortress, and rescues the Jedi Master Saesee Tiin during a space battle. During the third season, Anakin frees a planet's indigenous species from Separatist control and sees a cryptic vision of his future as Darth Vader. In the series finale, Anakin and Obi-Wan embark on a mission to rescue Palpatine from General Grievous, which leads into the opening of \"Revenge of the Sith\". The series was removed from canon in 2014 and placed in the \"Legends\" universe.\nVideo games.\nVader plays a central role in the \"Legends\" game ' (2008), where he is playable in the first level and later appears as a boss. The game's main character, Galen Marek, or Starkiller, is Vader's secret apprentice.

The sequence is dubbed with new dialogue, performed by James Earl Jones. In the story, Vader colludes with Boba Fett to entrap the Rebels.\nThe character appears in various \"Lego Star Wars\" shorts, voiced by Matt Sloan as Vader and by Kirby Morrow as Anakin.\nDarth Vader features in the 1981 radio drama adaptation of \"Star Wars\", voiced by the actor Brock Peters. Vader makes his first appearance on the planet Ralltiir, where he treats Princess Leia with suspicion. In later extended scenes, he is heard interrogating and torturing Leia on board his Star Destroyer and aboard the Death Star.\nDarth Vader was voiced by Maurice LaMarche in the 2024 \"Simpsons\" shorts \"May the 12th Be with You\" and \"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\".\nAnalysis.\nThe French psychiatrist Eric Bui and his colleagues have considered Vader to be a useful example for explaining borderline personality disorder to medical students. Bui argued that Anakin met the criteria to be diagnosed with the disorder, citing his impulsivity, difficulty controlling his anger, and his alternation between idealization and derealization, extreme fear of abandonment, and disassociative episodes. Bui's findings were corroborated by several other studies of Vader's character in the field of psychopathology. However, Brazilian neurologist Felipe Filardi da Rocha noted that the environment and culture that Anakin was raised in must be taken into account before making a formal diagnosis, and argued that other mental disorders should be considered as well.\nAnakin's origin story in \"The Phantom Menace\" has been compared to signifiers of African American racial identity, particularly his being a slave, and his dissatisfaction with his life has been compared to that of Siddhartha Gautama before he became the Buddha.\nCultural impact.\nIn 2003, the American Film Institute listed Vader as the third greatest movie villain in cinema history on AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains, behind Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. In 2010, \"IGN\" ranked Darth Vader 25th in the \"Top 100 Videogame Villains\". His role as a tragic hero in the saga has also met with positive reviews. Contrarily, in 1977, a \"New Journal and Guide\" writer criticized the lack of racial diversity in the original \"Star Wars\" film, pointing out that \"the force of evil ... is dressed in all black and has the voice of a black man.\" George Lucas felt hurt at such accusations.\nVader is parodied as \"Dark Helmet\" (Rick Moranis) in the \"Star Wars\" parody \"Spaceballs\" (1987). One of the primary antagonists of \"Final Fantasy IV\" (1991), Golbez, was stated by game creator Takashi Tokita to be based on Vader. A Mexican church advised Christians against seeing \"The Phantom Menace\" because it portrays Anakin as a Christ figure.\nThe slime-mold beetle \"Agathidium vaderi\" is named after Vader, as is the louse \"Ricinus vaderi\". In 2022 researchers at the University of Hanoi thought they identified a new species of giant isopod, seeking confirmation they sent specimens to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum in Singapore who confirmed it was a previously unidentified species and named it \"Bathynomus vaderi\" as they found its head resembled Darth Vader's helmet. A grotesque of Darth Vader looms over the east face of the Washington National Cathedral's northwest tower.\nMany commentators and comedians have also evoked Vader's visage to satirize politicians and other public figures, and several American political figures have been unflatteringly compared to the character. In response to Ronald Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (dubbed \"Star Wars\" by his political opponents), German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" portrayed the president wearing Vader's helmet on its cover in 1984. In 2005, Al Gore referred to Tele-Communications Inc.'s John C. Malone as the \"Darth Vader of cable\", and political strategist Lee Atwater was known by his political enemies as \"the Darth Vader of the Republican Party\". Native American artist Bunky Echohawk portrayed General George Armstrong Custer as Vader in his painting \"Darth Custer\". In 2015, a statue of Vladimir Lenin in Odesa, Ukraine, was converted into one of Vader due to a law on decommunization. Former Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney has been compared to Darth Vader after he was quoted during a discussion on the war on terror saying, \"I suppose, sometimes, people look at my demeanor and say, 'Well, he's the Darth Vader of the administration.'\" This led to him being referred to as \"Darth Cheney\" by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. This comparison was followed by George Lucas stating that Cheney is more akin to Palpatine, and that a better stand-in for Vader would be George W. Bush.\nIn Ukraine, the Internet Party of Ukraine has had multiple people run for election under the name Darth Vader.\nThe Fedayeen Saddam, an Iraqi paramilitary organisation, was issued with fiber glass Darth Vader-style helmets from 1995, apparently at the instigation of their commander, Uday Hussein, who was said to have been an avid \"Star Wars\" fan. A number of them were brought to the United States and the United Kingdom as souvenirs following the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nIn 2019, an original Vader helmet from \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was sold for $900,000 in an online auction.\nIn 2014, Hot Wheels created a full-size Darth Vader-inspired car (dubbed the 'Darth Car') to coincide with their partnership with the \"Star Wars\" franchise. Built by Action Vehicle Engineering and designed by Bryan Benedict, the car was built on the Chevrolet Corvette C5 chassis and sports a small-block LS3 V8 engine. The car made its public debut at San Diego Comic-Con that year and is currently part of the Garage of Legends car collection.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53863", "revid": "49270145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53863", "title": "Visual binary", "text": "Type of stellar binary\nA visual binary is a gravitationally bound binary star system that can be resolved into two stars. These stars are estimated, via Kepler's third law, to have periods ranging from a few years to thousands of years. A visual binary consists of two stars, usually of a different brightness. Because of this, the brighter star is called the primary and the fainter one is called the companion. If the primary is too bright, relative to the companion, this can cause a glare making it difficult to resolve the two components. However, it is possible to resolve the system if observations of the brighter star show it to wobble about a centre of mass. In general, a visual binary can be resolved into two stars with a telescope if their centres are separated by a value greater than or equal to one arcsecond, but with modern professional telescopes, interferometry, or space-based equipment, stars can be resolved at closer distances.\nFor a visual binary system, measurements taken need to specify, in arc-seconds, the apparent angular separation on the sky and the position angle\u00a0\u2013 which is the angle measured eastward from North in degrees\u00a0\u2013 of the companion star relative to the primary star. Taken over a period of time, the apparent relative orbit of the visual binary system will appear on the celestial sphere. The study of visual binaries reveals useful stellar characteristics: masses, densities, surface temperatures, luminosity, and rotation rates.\nDistance.\nIn order to work out the masses of the components of a visual binary system, the distance to the system must first be determined, since from this astronomers can estimate the period of revolution and the separation between the two stars. The trigonometric parallax provides a direct method of calculating a star's mass. This will not apply to the visual binary systems, but it does form the basis of an indirect method called the dynamical parallax.\nTrigonometric parallax.\nIn order to use this method of calculating distance, two measurements are made of a star, one each at opposite sides of the Earth's orbit about the Sun. The star's position relative to the more distant background stars will appear displaced. The parallax value is considered to be the displacement in each direction from the mean position, equivalent to the angular displacement from observations one astronomical unit apart. The distance formula_1, in parsecs is found from the following equation,\nformula_2\nWhere formula_3 is the parallax, measured in units of arc-seconds.\nDynamical parallax.\nThis method is used solely for binary systems. The mass of the binary system is assumed to be twice that of the Sun. Kepler's Laws are then applied and the separation between the stars is determined. Once this distance is found, the distance away can be found via the arc subtended in the sky, providing a temporary distance measurement. From this measurement and the apparent magnitudes of both stars, the luminosities can be found, and by using the mass\u2013luminosity relationship, the masses of each star. These masses are used to re-calculate the separation distance, and the process is repeated a number of times, with accuracies as high as 5% being achieved. A more sophisticated calculation factors in a star's loss of mass over time.\nSpectroscopic parallax.\nSpectroscopic parallax is another commonly used method for determining the distance to a binary system. No parallax is measured, the word is simply used to place emphasis on the fact that the distance is being estimated. In this method, the luminosity of a star is estimated from its spectrum. It is important to note that the spectra from distant stars of a given type are assumed to be the same as the spectra of nearby stars of the same type. The star is then assigned a position on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram based on where it is in its life-cycle. The star's luminosity can be estimated by comparison of the spectrum of a nearby star. The distance is then determined via the following inverse square law:\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 is the apparent brightness and formula_6 is the luminosity.\nUsing the Sun as a reference we can write\nformula_7\nwhere the subscript formula_8 represents a parameter associated with the Sun.\nRearranging for formula_9 gives an estimate for the distance.\nformula_10\nKepler's laws.\nThe two stars orbiting each other, as well as their centre of mass, must obey Kepler's laws. \nThis means that the orbit is an ellipse with the centre of mass at one of the two foci (Kepler's 1st law) and the orbital motion satisfies the fact that a line joining the star to the centre of mass sweeps out equal areas over equal time intervals (Kepler's 2nd law). The orbital motion must also satisfy Kepler's 3rd law.\nKepler's 3rd Law can be stated as follows: \"The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.\" Mathematically, this translates as \nformula_11 \nwhere formula_12 is the orbital period of the planet and formula_13 is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\nNewton's generalisation.\nConsider a binary star system. This consists of two objects, of mass formula_14 and formula_15, orbiting around their centre of mass. formula_14 has position vector formula_17 and orbital velocity formula_18, and formula_15 has position vector formula_20 and orbital velocity formula_21 relative to the centre of mass. The separation between the two stars is denoted formula_22, and is assumed to be constant. Since the gravitational force acts along a line joining the centers of both stars, we can assume the stars have an equivalent time period around their center of mass, and therefore a constant separation between each other.\nTo arrive at Newton's version of Kepler's 3rd law we can start by considering Newton's 2nd law which states: \"The net force acting on an object is proportional to the objects mass and resultant acceleration.\" \nformula_23 \nwhere formula_24 is the net force acting on the object of mass formula_25, and formula_13 is the acceleration of the object.\nApplying the definition of centripetal acceleration to Newton's second law gives a force of \nformula_27 \nThen using the fact that the orbital velocity is given as \nformula_28 \nwe can state the force on each star as \nformula_29 and formula_30\nIf we apply Newton's 3rd law- \"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\"\nformula_31 \nWe can set the force on each star equal to each other.\nformula_32 \nThis reduces to \nformula_33 \nIf we assume that the masses are not equal, then this equation tells us that the smaller mass remains farther from the centre of mass than does the larger mass.\nThe separation formula_22 of the two objects is \nformula_35 \nSince formula_17 and formula_20 would form a line starting from opposite directions and joining at the centre of mass.\nNow we can substitute this expression into one of the equations describing the force on the stars and rearrange for formula_17 to find an expression relating the position of one star to the masses of both and the separation between them. Equally, this could have been solved for formula_20. We find that\nformula_40\nSubstituting this equation into the equation for the force on one of the stars, setting it equal to Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation (namely, formula_41, and solving for the period squared yields the required result.\nformula_42 \nThis is Newton's version of Kepler's 3rd Law. Unless formula_43 is in non-standard units, this will not work if mass is measured in solar masses, the orbital period is measured in years, and the orbital semi-major axis is measured in astronomical units (e.g., use the Earth's orbital parameters). It will work if SI units, for instance, are used throughout.\nDetermining stellar masses.\nBinary systems are particularly important here\u00a0\u2013 because they are orbiting each other, their gravitational interaction can be studied by observing parameters of their orbit around each other and the centre of mass. Before applying Kepler's 3rd Law, the inclination of the orbit of the visual binary must be taken into account. Relative to an observer on Earth, the orbital plane will usually be tilted. If it is at 0\u00b0 the planes will be seen to coincide and if at 90\u00b0 they will be seen edge on. Due to this inclination, the elliptical true orbit will project an elliptical apparent orbit onto the plane of the sky. Kepler's 3rd law still holds but with a constant of proportionality that changes with respect to the elliptical apparent orbit.\nThe inclination of the orbit can be determined by measuring the separation between the primary star and the apparent focus. Once this information is known the true eccentricity and the true semi-major axis can be calculated since the apparent orbit will be shorter than the true orbit, assuming an inclination greater than 0\u00b0, and this effect can be corrected for using simple geometry\nformula_44\nWhere formula_45 is the true semi-major axis and formula_46 is the parallax.\nOnce the true orbit is known, Kepler's 3rd law can be applied. We re-write it in terms of the observable quantities such that\nformula_47\nFrom this equation we obtain the sum of the masses involved in the binary system. Remembering a previous equation we derived,\nformula_33\nwhere\nformula_49\nwe can solve the ratio of the semi-major axis and therefore a ratio for the two masses since\nformula_50\nand\nformula_51\nThe individual masses of the stars follow from these ratios and knowing the separation between each star and the centre of mass of the system.\nMass\u2013luminosity relationship.\nIn order to find the luminosity of the stars, the rate of flow of radiant energy, otherwise known as radiant flux, must be observed. When the observed luminosities and masses are graphed, the mass\u2013luminosity relation is obtained. This relationship was found by Arthur Eddington in 1924.\nformula_52\nWhere L is the luminosity of the star and M is its mass. \"L\"\u2299 and \"M\"\u2299 are the luminosity and mass of the Sun. The value \"formula_53\"\u00a0=\u00a03.5 is commonly used for main-sequence stars. This equation and the usual value of a = 3.5 only applies to main-sequence stars with masses 2\"M\"\u2299\u00a0&lt;\u00a0\"M\"\u00a0&lt;\u00a020\"M\"\u2299 and does not apply to red giants or white dwarfs. For these stars, the equation applies with different constants, since these stars have different masses. For the different ranges of masses, an adequate form of the Mass\u2013Luminosity Relation is\nformula_54\nformula_55\nformula_56\nformula_57\nThe greater a star's luminosity, the greater its mass will be. The absolute magnitude or luminosity of a star can be found by knowing the distance to it and its apparent magnitude. The stars bolometric magnitude is plotted against its mass, in units of the Sun's mass. This is determined through observation and then the mass of the star is read of the plot. Giants and main sequence stars tend to agree with this, but super giants do not and neither do white dwarfs. The Mass\u2013Luminosity Relation is very useful because, due to the observation of binaries, particularly the visual binaries since the masses of many stars have been found this way, astronomers have gained insight into the evolution of stars, including how they are born.\nSpectral classification.\nGenerally speaking, there are three classes of binary systems. These can be determined by considering the colours of the two components.\n\"1. Systems consisting of a red or reddish primary star and a blueish secondary star, usually a magnitude or more fainter...\n2. Systems in which the differences in magnitude and colour are both small...\n3. Systems in which the fainter star is the redder of the two...\"\nThe luminosity of class 1. binaries is greater than that of class 3. binaries. There is a relationship between the colour difference of binaries and their reduced proper motions. In 1921, Frederick C. Leonard, at the Lick Observatory, wrote \"1. The spectrum of the secondary component of a dwarf star is generally redder than that of the primary, whereas the spectrum of the fainter component of a giant star is usually bluer than that of the brighter one. In both cases, the absolute difference in spectral class seems ordinarily to be related to the disparity between the components...2. With some exceptions, the spectra of the components of double stars are so related to each other that they conform to the Hertzsprung-Russell configuration of the stars...\"\nAn interesting case for visual binaries occurs when one or both components are located above or below the Main-Sequence. If a star is more luminous than a Main-Sequence star, it is either very young, and therefore contracting due to gravity, or is at the post Main-Sequence stage of its evolution. The study of binaries is useful here because, unlike with single stars, it is possible to determine which reason is the case. If the primary is gravitationally contracting, then the companion will be further away from the Main-Sequence than the primary since the more massive star becomes a Main-Sequence star much faster than the less massive star.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A citizen of the Sac and Fox Nation, he was the first Native American to win a gold medal for the United States in the Olympics. Considered one of the most versatile athletes of modern sports, Thorpe won two Olympic gold medals in the 1912 Summer Olympics (one in classic pentathlon and the other in decathlon).\nThorpe lost his Olympic titles after it was found he had been paid for playing two seasons of semi-professional baseball before competing in the Olympics, thus violating the contemporary amateurism rules. In 1983, 30 years after his death, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) restored Thorpe's Olympic medals with replicas, after ruling that the decision to strip him of his medals fell outside of the required 30 days. Official IOC records still listed Thorpe as co-champion in decathlon and pentathlon until 2022, when it was decided to restore him as the sole champion in both events.\nThorpe grew up in the Sac and Fox Nation in Indian Territory (what is now the U.S. state of Oklahoma). As a youth, he attended Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he was a three-time All-American for the school's football team under coach Pop Warner. After his Olympic success in 1912, which included a record score in the decathlon, Thorpe added a victory in the All-Around Championship of the Amateur Athletic Union. In 1913, Thorpe signed with the New York Giants, and played six seasons in Major League Baseball between 1913 and 1919. Thorpe joined the Canton Bulldogs American football team in 1915, helping them win three professional championships. He later played for six teams in the National Football League (NFL). Thorpe played as part of several all-American Indian teams throughout his career, and barnstormed as a professional basketball player with a team composed entirely of American Indians.\nFrom 1920 to 1921, Thorpe was nominally the first president of the American Professional Football Association, which became the NFL in 1922. He played professional sports until age\u00a041, the end of his sports career coinciding with the start of the Great Depression. Thorpe struggled to earn a living after that, working several odd jobs. He suffered from alcoholism and lived his last years in failing health and poverty. Thorpe was married thrice and had eight children, including Grace Thorpe, an environmentalist and Native rights activist, before suffering from heart failure and dying in 1953.\nThorpe has received numerous accolades for his athletic accomplishments. The Associated Press ranked him as the \"greatest athlete\" from the first 50 years of the 20th century, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame inducted Thorpe as part of its inaugural class in 1963. The town of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, was named in his honor. It has a monument site that contains his remains, which were the subject of legal action. Thorpe appeared in several films and was portrayed by Burt Lancaster in the 1951 film \"Jim Thorpe \u2013 All-American\".\nEarly life.\nInformation about Thorpe's birth, name, and ethnic background varies widely. He was baptized \"Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe\" in the Catholic Church. Thorpe was born in Indian Territory of the United States (later Oklahoma), but no birth certificate has been found. The Jim Thorpe Museum lists his birth date as May 28, 1887, but others have listed it as May 22, 1887, near the town of Prague. Thorpe said in a note to \"The Shawnee News-Star\" in 1943 that he was born May 28, 1888, \"near and south of Bellemont \u2013 Pottawatomie County \u2013 along the banks of the North Fork River\u00a0... hope this will clear up the inquiries as to my birthplace.\" May 22, 1887, is listed on his baptismal certificate. Thorpe referred to Shawnee as his birthplace in his 1943 note to the newspaper.\nThorpe's father, Hiram Thorpe (Sac and Fox), had an Irish father and a Sac and Fox mother. His mother, Charlotte Vieux, was the daughter of Citizen Potawatomi Nation members Elizabeth and Jacob Vieux, and was a descendant of Chief Louis Vieux.\nThorpe was raised in the Sauk, or Th\u00e2k\u00eewaki, culture, and his Sauk name was Wa-Tho-Huk, which translates as \"Bright path the lightning makes as it goes across the sky\", often shortened to \"Bright Path\". Thorpe's parents were both Roman Catholic, a faith which Thorpe observed throughout his adult life.\nThorpe attended the Sac and Fox Indian Agency School in Stroud, with his twin brother, Charlie. Charlie helped him through school until he died of pneumonia when they were nine years old. Thorpe ran away from school several times. His father sent him to the Haskell Institute, an Indian boarding school in Lawrence, Kansas, so that Thorpe would not run away again.\nWhen Thorpe's mother died of childbirth complications two years later, he became depressed. After several arguments with his father, Thorpe left home to work on a horse ranch.\nIn 1904, the 16-year-old Thorpe returned to his father and decided to attend Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. There his athletic ability was recognized and he was coached by Glenn Scobey \"Pop\" Warner, one of the most influential coaches of early American football history. Later that year he was orphaned when his father Hiram Thorpe died from gangrene poisoning, after being wounded in a hunting accident. The young Thorpe again dropped out of school. He resumed farm work for a few years before returning to Carlisle School.\nAmateur career.\nCollege career.\nThorpe began his athletic career at Carlisle in 1907 when he walked past the track and, still in street clothes, beat all the school's high jumpers with an impromptu 5-ft 9-in jump that broke the school record.\nHe also competed in football, baseball, lacrosse, tennis, boxing, handball, and ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship.\nThorpe made his college football debut for Carlisle on September 22, 1907, against Lebanon Valley, coming off the bench to score two touchdowns in a 40\u20130 victory. In his second collegiate game, on September 28, 1907, Thorpe again entered as a substitute during Carlisle\u2019s win over Villanova. He made his first career start the next game on October 2, 1907 versus Susquehanna, where he scored four touchdowns.\nPop Warner was hesitant to allow Thorpe, his best track and field athlete, to compete in such a physical game as football. Thorpe, however, convinced Warner to let him try some rushing plays in practice against the school team's defense; Warner assumed he would be tackled easily and give up the idea. Thorpe \"ran around past and through them not once, but twice\". He walked over to Warner and said, \"Nobody is going to tackle Jim\", while flipping him the ball.\nThorpe first gained nationwide notice in 1911 for his athletic ability. As a running back, defensive back, placekicker and punter, Thorpe scored all of his team's four field goals in an 18\u201315 upset of Harvard, a top-ranked team in the early days of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). He also rushed for 173 yards in the game, and afterwards Harvard did not lose again until 1915. Carlisle would go on to finish the 1911 season with an 11\u20131 record and were retroactively named national collegiate champions in a book titled \"Champions of College Football\", written by Bill Libby in 1975. In 1912, Thorpe led the nation with 29 touchdowns and 224 points scored during the season, according to the College Football Hall of Fame. Steve Boda, a researcher for the NCAA, credits Thorpe with 27 touchdowns and 224 points. Thorpe rushed 191 times for 1,869 yards, according to Boda; the figures do not include statistics from two of Carlisle's 14 games in 1912 because full records are not available.\nCarlisle's 1912 record included a 27\u20136 victory over the West Point Army team. In that game, Thorpe's 92-yard touchdown was nullified by a teammate's penalty, but on the next play Thorpe rushed for a 97-yard touchdown. Future President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who played against him in that game, recalled of Thorpe in a 1961 speech:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThorpe was a third-team All-American in 1908 and a first-team All-American in 1911 and 1912. Football was \u2013 and remained \u2013 Thorpe's favorite sport. He did not compete in track and field in 1910 or 1911, although this turned out to be the sport in which he gained his greatest fame.\nIn the spring of 1912, he started training for the Olympics. He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56\u00a0lb weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability stood out in all these events and so he earned a place on the team that went to Sweden.\nThe poet Marianne Moore, who taught Thorpe at Carlisle, recalled: He had a kind of ease in his gait that is hard to describe. Equilibrium with no stricture, but couched in the lineup of football he was the epitome of concentration, wary, with an effect of plenty in reserve.\nOlympic career.\nFor the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, two new multi-event disciplines were included, the pentathlon and the decathlon. A pentathlon, based on the ancient Greek event, had been introduced at the 1906 Intercalated Games. The 1912 version consisted of the long jump, javelin throw, 200-meter dash, discus throw, and 1500-meter run.\nThe decathlon was a relatively new event in modern athletics, although a similar competition known as the all-around championship had been part of American track meets since the 1880s. A men's version had been featured on the program of the 1904 St.\u00a0Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version.\nThorpe was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets. According to his obituary in \"The New York Times\", he could run the 100-yard dash in 10\u00a0seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8\u00a0seconds; the 440 in 51.8\u00a0seconds; the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15\u00a0seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24\u00a0seconds. He could long jump 23\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in and high-jump 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in. He could pole vault 11\u00a0feet; put the shot 47\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in; throw the javelin 163\u00a0feet; and throw the discus 136\u00a0feet.\nThorpe entered the U.S.\u00a0Olympic trials for both the pentathlon and the decathlon. He easily earned a place on the pentathlon team, winning three events. The decathlon trial was subsequently cancelled, and Thorpe was chosen to represent the U.S. in the event. The pentathlon and decathlon teams also included Avery Brundage, a future International Olympic Committee president.\nThorpe was extremely busy in the Olympics. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he competed in the long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon on July 7. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. Thorpe won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final, in which he finished in a tie for fourth. On July 12, Thorpe placed seventh in the long jump.\nThorpe's final event was the decathlon, his first (and as it turned out, his only) decathlon. Strong competition from local favorite Hugo Wieslander was expected. Thorpe, however, defeated Wieslander by 688 points. He placed in the top four in all ten events, and his Olympic record of 8,413 points stood for nearly two decades. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found a mismatched pair of replacements, including one from a trash can, and won the gold medal wearing them. Overall, Thorpe won eight of the 15 individual events comprising the pentathlon and decathlon.\nAs was the custom of the day, the medals were presented to the athletes during the closing ceremonies of the games. Along with the two gold medals, Thorpe also received two challenge prizes, which had been donated by King Gustav\u00a0V of Sweden for the decathlon and Czar Nicholas\u00a0II of Russia for the pentathlon. Several sources recount that, when awarding Thorpe his prize, King Gustav said, \"You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world\", to which Thorpe replied, \"Thanks, King\". While the compliment from King Gustav is confirmed in the September 1912 publication of \"The Red Man\", Thorpe biographer Kate Buford suggests that Thorpe's remark was embellished, as she believes that such a response \"would have been out of character for a man who was highly uncomfortable in public ceremonies and hated to stand out.\" The quoted reply did not appear in newspapers until 1948\u201336\u00a0years after his appearance in the Olympics\u2014 and surfaced in books by 1952.\nThorpe's successes were followed in the United States. On the Olympic team's return, Thorpe was the star attraction in a ticker-tape parade on Broadway. He remembered later, \"I heard people yelling my name, and I couldn't realize how one fellow could have so many friends.\"\nApart from his track and field appearances, Thorpe also played in one of two exhibition baseball games at the 1912\u00a0Olympics, which featured two teams composed mostly of U.S.\u00a0track and field athletes. Thorpe had previous experience in the sport, as the public soon learned.\nAll-Around champion.\nAfter his victories at the Olympic Games in Sweden, on September 2, 1912, Thorpe returned to Celtic Park, the home of the Irish American Athletic Club, in Queens, New York (where he had qualified four months earlier for the Olympic Games), to compete in the Amateur Athletic Union's All-Around Championship. Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American Athletic Club and John L. Bredemus of Princeton University, he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476\u00a0points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385\u00a0points set in 1909 (also at Celtic Park), by Martin Sheridan, the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club. Sheridan, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken. He approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying, \"Jim, my boy, you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete.\" He told a reporter from \"New York World\", \"Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived. He has me beaten fifty ways. Even when I was in my prime, I could not do what he did today.\"\nControversy.\nIn 1912, strict rules regarding amateurism were in effect for athletes participating in the Olympics. Athletes who received money prizes for competitions, were sports teachers, or had competed previously against professionals, were not considered amateurs. They were barred from competition.\nIn late January 1913, the \"Worcester Telegram\" reported that Thorpe had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics, and other U.S.\u00a0newspapers followed up the story. Thorpe had played semi-professional baseball in the Eastern Carolina League for Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in 1909 and 1910, receiving meager pay; reportedly as little as US$2 ($ in 2024) per game and as much as US$35 ($ in 2024) per week. College players, in fact, regularly spent summers playing professionally in order to earn some money, but most used aliases, unlike Thorpe. Although the public did not seem to care much about Thorpe's past, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and especially its secretary James Edward Sullivan, took the case very seriously.\nThorpe wrote a letter to Sullivan, in which he admitted playing professional baseball:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I hope I will be partly excused by the fact that I was simply an Indian schoolboy and did not know all about such things. In fact, I did not know that I was doing wrong, because I was doing what I knew several other college men had done, except that they did not use their own names\u00a0...\nHis letter did not help. The AAU decided to withdraw Thorpe's amateur status retroactively. Later that year, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) unanimously decided to strip Thorpe of his Olympic titles, medals and awards, and declare him a professional.\nAlthough Thorpe had played for money, the AAU and IOC did not follow their own rules for disqualification. The rulebook for the 1912\u00a0Olympics stated that protests had to be made \"within 30\u00a0days from the closing ceremonies of the games.\" The first newspaper reports did not appear until January 1913, about six months after the Stockholm Games had concluded. There is also some evidence that Thorpe was known to have played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics, but the AAU had ignored the issue until being confronted with it in 1913. The only positive aspect of this affair for Thorpe was that, as soon as the news was reported that he had been declared a professional, he received offers from professional sports clubs.\nProfessional career.\nBaseball.\nIn 1910, Thorpe had the unusual status of a sought-after free agent at the major league level during the era of the reserve clause, because the minor league team that last held his contract had disbanded that year, so he was free to choose which baseball team to play for. In January 1913, he turned down a starting position with the St. Louis Browns, then at the bottom of the American League. Thorpe signed with the New York Giants baseball club in 1913, the defending 1912\u00a0National League champion. With Thorpe playing in 19 of their 151\u00a0games, they repeated as the 1913\u00a0National League champions. Immediately following the Giants' October loss in the 1913 World Series, Thorpe and the Giants joined the Chicago White Sox for a world tour. Barnstorming across the United States and around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour.\nThorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance and gate receipts for the tour. He met with Pope Pius X and Abbas II Hilmi Bey (the last Khedive of Egypt), and played before 20,000 people in London including King George V. Thorpe was the last man to compete in both the Olympics (in a non-baseball sport) and Major League Baseball before Eddy Alvarez did the same in 2020.\nThorpe played sporadically with the Giants as an outfielder for three seasons. After playing in the minor leagues with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1916, he returned to the Giants in 1917. He was sold to the Cincinnati Reds early in the season. In the \"double no-hitter\" between Fred Toney of the Reds and Hippo Vaughn of the Chicago Cubs, Thorpe drove in the winning run in the 10th inning. Late in the season, he was sold back to the Giants. Again, he played sporadically for them in 1918 before being traded to the Boston Braves on May 21, 1919, for Pat Ragan. In his career, he amassed 91\u00a0runs scored, 82\u00a0runs batted in and a .252\u00a0batting average over 289\u00a0games. He continued to play minor league baseball until 1922, and once played for the minor league Toledo Mud Hens.\nFootball.\nThorpe had not abandoned football either. He first played professional football in 1913 as a member of the Indiana-based Pine Village Pros, a team that had a several-season winning streak against local teams during the 1910s. He signed with the Canton Bulldogs in 1915. They paid him $250 () a game, a tremendous wage at the time. Before signing him Canton was averaging 1,200\u00a0fans a game, but 8,000 showed up for Thorpe's debut against the Massillon Tigers. The team won titles in 1916, 1917, and 1919. Thorpe reportedly ended the 1919 championship game by kicking a wind-assisted 95-yard punt from his team's own 5-yard line, effectively putting the game out of reach.\nIn 1920, the Bulldogs were one of 14\u00a0teams to form the American Professional Football Association, which became the National Football League (NFL) two years later. Thorpe was nominally their first president, but spent most of the year playing for Canton; a year later, he was replaced as president by Joseph Carr. He continued to play for Canton, coaching the team as well. Between 1921 and 1923, he helped organize and played for the Oorang Indians (La Rue, Ohio), an all-Native American team. Although the team's record was 3\u20136 in 1922, and 1\u201310 in 1923, Thorpe played well and was selected for the \"Green Bay Press-Gazette\"'s first All-NFL team in 1923. This was later formally recognized in 1931 by the NFL as the league's official All-NFL team.\nThorpe never played for an NFL championship team. He retired from professional football at age\u00a041, having played 52\u00a0games for six teams from 1920 to 1928.\nBasketball.\nMost of Thorpe's biographers were unaware of his basketball career until a ticket that documented his time in professional basketball was discovered in an old book in 2005. By 1926, he was the main feature of the World Famous Indians of La Rue, Ohio, a traveling basketball team. The team barnstormed for at least two years (1927\u201328) in multiple states. Although stories about Thorpe's team were published in some local newspapers at the time, his basketball career is not well-documented.\nFor a brief time in 1913, he was considering going into professional hockey for the Tecumseh Hockey Club in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nHonors and achievements.\n\"You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.\" \u2014 King Gustav V of Sweden\nNational\nCollege.\nCollege Football\nTrack and Field\nBallroom Dancing\nMarriage and family.\nThorpe married three times and had a total of eight children. In 1913, Thorpe married Iva M. Miller, whom he had met at Carlisle. In 1917, Iva and Thorpe bought a house now known as the Jim Thorpe House in Yale, Oklahoma, and lived there until 1923. Their young son Jim Thorpe Jr. died in 1918. They had four other children: James F., Gale, Charlotte, and Grace Frances, an environmentalist and Native rights activist. Miller filed for divorce from Thorpe in 1925, claiming desertion.\nIn 1926, Thorpe married Freeda Verona Kirkpatrick (September 19, 1905 \u2013 March 2, 2007). She was working for the manager of the baseball team for which he was playing at the time. They had four sons: Phillip, William, Richard, and John Thorpe. Kirkpatrick divorced Thorpe in 1941, after they had been married for 15\u00a0years.\nLastly, Thorpe married Patricia Gladys Askew on June 2, 1945. She was with him when he died.\nLater life, film career, and death.\nAfter his athletic career, Thorpe struggled to provide for his family. He found it difficult to work a non-sports-related job and never held a job for an extended period of time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, among others as a movie actor, mostly as an extra, usually playing an American Indian in Westerns, starting with the 1931 serial \"Battling with Buffalo Bill\". In the 1932 comedy \"Always Kickin\"', Thorpe was prominently cast in a speaking part as himself, a kicking coach teaching young football players to drop-kick. He played the captain of the guard in 1935's \"She\", an umpire in the 1940 film \"Knute Rockne, All American\", and a member of the Navajo Nation in the 1950 film \"Wagon Master\". An \"American Indian Magazine\" article states Thorpe appeared in over 70 films.\nIn 1931, during the Great Depression, Thorpe sold the film rights to his life story to MGM for $1,500 (). Warner Bros. eventually acquired the rights and memorialized Thorpe in \"Jim Thorpe \u2013 All-American\" (1951), starring Burt Lancaster. The film was directed by Michael Curtiz. Although there were rumors that Thorpe received no money, he was paid $15,000 by Warner Bros. plus a $2,500 donation toward an annuity for him by the studio's head of publicity. The movie included archival footage of the 1912 and 1932 Olympics. Thorpe was seen in one scene as a coaching assistant. It was also distributed in the United Kingdom, where it was called \"Man of Bronze\".\nApart from his career in films, he worked as a construction worker, a doorman/bouncer, a security guard, and a ditchdigger. He briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945, during World War II. Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic during his later life. He ran out of money sometime in the early\u00a01950s. When hospitalized for lip cancer in 1950, Thorpe was admitted as a charity case. At a press conference announcing the procedure, his wife, Patricia, wept and pleaded for help, saying, \"We're broke\u00a0... Jim has nothing but his name and his memories. He has spent money on his own people and has given it away. He has often been exploited.\"\nIn early 1953, Thorpe went into heart failure for the third time while dining with Patricia in their home in Lomita, California. He was briefly revived by artificial respiration and spoke to those around him, but lost consciousness shortly afterward. He died on March 28 at the age of 65.\nVictim of racism.\nThorpe, whose parents were both mixed-race, was raised as a Native American. He accomplished his athletic feats despite the severe racial inequality of the United States. It has often been suggested that his Olympic medals were stripped by the athletic officials because of his ethnicity. While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view. At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.\u00a0citizens (the U.S.\u00a0government had frequently demanded that they make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition). Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.\nWhen Thorpe attended Carlisle, the students' ethnicity was used for marketing purposes. The football team was called the Indians. To create headlines, the school and journalists often portrayed sporting competitions as conflicts of Indians against whites. The first notice of Thorpe in \"The New York Times\" was headlined \"Indian Thorpe in Olympiad; Redskin from Carlisle Will Strive for Place on American Team.\" Throughout his life, Thorpe's accomplishments were described in a similar racial context by other newspapers and sportswriters, which reflected the era.\nLegacy.\nOlympic awards reinstated.\nOver the years, supporters of Thorpe attempted to have his Olympic titles reinstated. American Olympic officials, including former teammate and later president of the IOC Avery Brundage, rebuffed several attempts. Brundage once said, \"Ignorance is no excuse.\" Most persistent were the author Robert Wheeler and his wife, Florence Ridlon. They succeeded in having the AAU and United States Olympic Committee overturn its decision and restore Thorpe's amateur status before 1913.\nIn 1982, Wheeler and Ridlon established the Jim Thorpe Foundation and gained support from the U.S.\u00a0Congress. Armed with this support and evidence from 1912 proving that Thorpe's disqualification had occurred after the 30-day time period allowed by Olympics rules, they succeeded in making the case to the IOC. In October 1982, the IOC Executive Committee approved Thorpe's reinstatement. In an unusual ruling, they declared that Thorpe was co-champion with Ferdinand Bie and Hugo Wieslander, although both of these athletes had always said they considered Thorpe to be the only champion. In a ceremony on January 18, 1983, the IOC presented two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, with commemorative medals. Thorpe's original medals had been held in museums, but they were stolen and have never been recovered. The IOC listed Thorpe as a co-gold medalist.\nIn July 2020, a petition from Bright Path Strong began circulating that called upon the IOC to reinstate Thorpe as the sole winner in his events in the 1912 Olympics. It was backed by Pictureworks Entertainment, which is making a film about Thorpe. The petition was supported by Olympian Billy Mills, who won a gold medal in the 10,000\u00a0meters at the 1964 Tokyo Games. The IOC voted to reinstate Thorpe as the sole winner of both events on July 14, 2022, after the National Olympic Committees of Norway and Sweden, representing Bie and Wieslander, had given their approval.\nHonors.\nThorpe's tribe, the Sac and Fox Nation, added Olympic rings to their official flag to honor him.\nThorpe's monument, featuring the quote from Gustav\u00a0V (\"You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world.\"), still stands near the town named for him, Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. The grave rests on mounds of soil from Thorpe's native Oklahoma and from the stadium in which he won his Olympic medals.\nThorpe's achievements received great acclaim from sports journalists, both during his lifetime and since his death. In 1950, an Associated Press poll of almost 400\u00a0sportswriters and broadcasters voted Thorpe the \"greatest athlete\" of the first half of the 20th\u00a0century. That same year, the Associated Press ranked Thorpe as the \"greatest American football player\" of the first half of the century. Pro Football Hall of Fame voters selected him for the NFL 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1967. In 1999, the Associated Press placed him third on its list of the top athletes of the century, following Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan. ESPN ranked Thorpe seventh on their list of best North American athletes of the century.\nThorpe was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963, one of seventeen players in the charter class. Thorpe is memorialized in the Pro Football Hall of Fame rotunda with a larger-than-life statue. He was also inducted into halls of fame for college football, American Olympic teams, and the national track and field competition.\nIn 2018, Thorpe became one of the inductees in the first induction ceremony held by the National Native American Hall of Fame. The fitness center and a hall at Haskell Indian Nations University are named in honor of Thorpe.\nPresident Richard Nixon, as authorized by U.S.\u00a0Senate Joint Resolution\u00a073, proclaimed Monday, April 16, 1973, as \"Jim Thorpe Day\" to promote nationwide recognition of Thorpe's life. In 1986, the Jim Thorpe Association established an award with Thorpe's name. The Jim Thorpe Award is given annually to the best defensive back in college football. The annual Thorpe Cup athletics meeting is named in his honor. The United States Postal Service issued a 32\u00a2 stamp on February 3, 1998, as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series.\nIn a poll of sports fans published in 2000 by ABC\u00a0Sports, Thorpe was voted the Greatest Athlete of the Twentieth Century; the pool of 15 other top athletes included Muhammad Ali, Pel\u00e9, Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Wayne Gretzky, Jack Nicklaus, and Michael Jordan.\nIn 2018, Thorpe was honored with the AAU Gussie Crawford Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to amateur sports. That same year, he was also commemorated on the Native American dollar coin; proposed designs were released in 2015.\nIn 2024, President Joe Biden announced that Thorpe would be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor given in the United States.\nJim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.\nThorpe's body was initially intended to be buried in the Garden Grove Cemetery in Oklahoma. $2,500 was raised by a committee to have his body transported from California to Shawnee. On April 12, 1953, on a farm in Oklahoma, Sac and Fox Thunder clan members, along with indigenous members of Thorpe's family, met to carry out a traditional Sac burial ceremony. During this ceremony, Thorpe's third wife, Patricia, accompanied by law enforcement, interrupted it, and Thorpe's body was removed. Following this, a funeral for Thorpe was held at St. Benedict's Catholic Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Afterwards, his body lay in state at Fairview Cemetery. Shawnee residents began a fundraising effort to erect a memorial for Thorpe at the town's athletic park. Local officials had asked state legislators for funding, but a bill that included $25,000 for their proposal was vetoed by Governor Johnston Murray.\nMeanwhile, Thorpe's third wife, unbeknownst to the rest of his family, took Thorpe's body and had it shipped to Pennsylvania when she heard that the small Pennsylvania towns of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were seeking to attract business. She made a deal with officials which, according to Thorpe's son Jack, was made by the widowed Patricia for monetary considerations. This deal was made in May 1954, a year after Thorpe had passed. The towns \"bought\" Thorpe's remains, which were interred there in 1957, erected a monument to him at the grave, merged, and renamed the newly united town in his honor as Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. Thorpe had never been there. The monument site contains his tomb, two statues of him in athletic poses, and historical markers recounting his life story.\nIn June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed a federal lawsuit against the borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains returned to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), Jack was arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, to be buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, a mile from the place he was born. He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members, who want him buried in Native American land. Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.\nIn April 2013, U.S. District Judge Richard Caputo ruled that Jim Thorpe borough amounts to a museum under the NAGPRA and therefore is bound by that law. A lawyer for Bill and Richard Thorpe said the men would pursue the legal process to have their father's remains returned to Sac and Fox land in central Oklahoma. On October 23, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed Judge Caputo's ruling. The appeals court held that Jim Thorpe borough is not a \"museum\", as that term is used in NAGPRA, and that the plaintiffs therefore could not invoke that federal statute to seek reinterment of Thorpe's remains. In NAGPRA language, \"'museum' means any institution or State or local government agency (including any institution of higher learning) that receives Federal funds and has possession of, or control over, Native American cultural items.\" The Court of Appeals directed the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of the borough. The appeals court said Pennsylvania law allows the plaintiffs to ask a state court to order reburial of Thorpe's remains, but noted, \"once a body is interred there is great reluctance in permitting same to be moved, absent clear and compelling reasons for such a move.\" On October 5, 2015, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the matter, effectively ending the legal process.\nJim Thorpe Marathon.\nThe Jim Thorpe Area Running Festival is a series of races started in 2019 in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. It includes a marathon, a 26.2 mile footrace that features a steady elevation drop from start to finish.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nInline citations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53879", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53879", "title": "Orogeny", "text": "Formation of mountain ranges\nOrogeny () is a mountain-building process that takes place at a convergent plate margin when plate motion compresses the margin. An orogenic belt or orogen develops as the compressed plate crumples and is uplifted to form one or more mountain ranges. This involves a series of geological processes collectively called orogenesis. These include both structural deformation of existing continental crust and the creation of new continental crust through volcanism. Magma rising in the orogen carries less dense material upwards while leaving more dense material behind, resulting in compositional differentiation of Earth's lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle). A synorogenic (or synkinematic) process or event is one that occurs during an orogeny.\nThe word \"orogeny\" comes from grc \" ' ()\"\u00a0'mountain' and \" ' ()\"\u00a0'creation, origin'. Although it was used before him, the American geologist G. K. Gilbert used the term in 1890 to mean the process of mountain-building, as distinguished from epeirogeny.\nTectonics.\nOrogeny takes place on the convergent margins of continents. The convergence may take the form of subduction (where a continent rides forcefully over an oceanic plate to form a noncollisional orogeny) or continental collision (convergence of two or more continents to form a collisional orogeny).\nOrogeny typically produces \"orogenic belts\" or \"orogens\", which are elongated regions of deformation bordering continental cratons (the stable interiors of continents). Young orogenic belts, in which subduction is still taking place, are characterized by frequent volcanic activity and earthquakes. Older orogenic belts are typically deeply eroded to expose displaced and deformed strata. These are often highly metamorphosed and include vast bodies of intrusive igneous rock called batholiths.\nSubduction zones consume oceanic crust, thicken lithosphere, and produce earthquakes and volcanoes. Not all subduction zones produce orogenic belts; mountain building takes place only when the subduction produces compression in the overriding plate. Whether subduction produces compression depends on such factors as the rate of plate convergence and the degree of coupling between the two plates, while the degree of coupling may in turn rely on such factors as the angle of subduction and rate of sedimentation in the oceanic trench associated with the subduction zone. The Andes Mountains are an example of a noncollisional orogenic belt, and such belts are sometimes called \"Andean-type orogens\".\nAs subduction continues, island arcs, continental fragments, and oceanic material may gradually accrete onto the continental margin. This is one of the main mechanisms by which continents have grown. An orogen built of crustal fragments (\"terranes\") accreted over a long period of time, without any indication of a major continent-continent collision, is called an \"accretionary orogen.\" The North American Cordillera and the Lachlan Orogen of southeast Australia are examples of accretionary orogens.\nThe orogeny may culminate with continental crust from the opposite side of the subducting oceanic plate arriving at the subduction zone. This ends subduction and transforms the accretional orogen into a Himalayan-type collisional orogen. The collisional orogeny may produce extremely high mountains, as has been taking place in the Himalayas for the last 65 million years.\nThe processes of orogeny can take tens of millions of years and build mountains from what were once sedimentary basins. Activity along an orogenic belt can be extremely long-lived. For example, much of the basement underlying the United States belongs to the Transcontinental Proterozoic Provinces, which accreted to Laurentia (the ancient heart of North America) over the course of 200 million years in the Paleoproterozoic. The Yavapai and Mazatzal orogenies were peaks of orogenic activity during this time. These were part of an extended period of orogenic activity that included the Picuris orogeny and culminated in the Grenville orogeny, lasting at least 600 million years. A similar sequence of orogenies has taken place on the west coast of North America, beginning in the late Devonian (about 380 million years ago) with the Antler orogeny and continuing with the Sonoma orogeny and Sevier orogeny and culminating with the Laramide orogeny. The Laramide orogeny alone lasted 40 million years, from 75 million to 35 million years ago.\nIntraplate orogeny.\nStresses transmitted from plate boundaries can also lead to episodes of intracontinental transpressional orogeny. Examples in Australia include the Neoproterozoic Petermann Orogeny (630\u2013520 Ma), and the Sprigg Orogeny (Miocene \u2013 present).\nOrogens.\nOrogens show a great range of characteristics,\nbut they may be broadly divided into collisional orogens and noncollisional orogens (Andean-type orogens). Collisional orogens can be further divided by whether the collision is with a second continent or a continental fragment or island arc. Repeated collisions of the latter type, with no evidence of collision with a major continent or closure of an ocean basin, result in an accretionary orogen. Examples of orogens arising from collision of an island arc with a continent include Taiwan and the collision of Australia with the Banda arc. Orogens arising from continent-continent collisions can be divided into those involving ocean closure (Himalayan-type orogens) and those involving glancing collisions with no ocean basin closure (as is taking place today in the Southern Alps of New Zealand).\nOrogens have a characteristic structure, though this shows considerable variation. A \"foreland basin\" forms ahead of the orogen due mainly to loading and resulting flexure of the lithosphere by the developing mountain belt. A typical foreland basin is subdivided into a wedge-top basin above the active orogenic wedge, the foredeep immediately beyond the active front, a forebulge high of flexural origin and a back-bulge area beyond, although not all of these are present in all foreland-basin systems. The basin migrates with the orogenic front and early deposited foreland basin sediments become progressively involved in folding and thrusting. Sediments deposited in the foreland basin are mainly derived from the erosion of the actively uplifting rocks of the mountain range, although some sediments derive from the foreland. The fill of many such basins shows a change in time from deepwater marine (\"flysch\"-style) through shallow water to continental (\"molasse\"-style) sediments.\nWhile active orogens are found on the margins of present-day continents, older inactive orogenies, such as the Algoman, Penokean and Antler, are represented by deformed and metamorphosed rocks with sedimentary basins further inland.\nOrogenic cycle.\nLong before the acceptance of plate tectonics, geologists had found evidence within many orogens of repeated cycles of deposition, deformation, crustal thickening and mountain building, and crustal thinning to form new depositional basins. These were named \"orogenic cycles\", and various theories were proposed to explain them. Canadian geologist Tuzo Wilson first put forward a plate tectonic interpretation of orogenic cycles, now known as Wilson cycles. Wilson proposed that orogenic cycles represented the periodic opening and closing of an ocean basin, with each stage of the process leaving its characteristic record on the rocks of the orogen.\nContinental rifting.\nThe Wilson cycle begins when previously stable continental crust comes under tension from a shift in mantle convection. Continental rifting takes place, which thins the crust and creates basins in which sediments accumulate. As the basins deepen, the ocean invades the rift zone, and as the continental crust rifts completely apart, shallow marine sedimentation gives way to deep marine sedimentation on the thinned marginal crust of the two continents.\nSeafloor spreading.\nAs the two continents rift apart, seafloor spreading commences along the axis of a new ocean basin. Deep marine sediments continue to accumulate along the thinned continental margins, which are now passive margins.\nSubduction.\nAt some point, subduction is initiated along one or both of the continental margins of the ocean basin, producing a volcanic arc and possibly an Andean-type orogen along that continental margin. This produces deformation of the continental margins and possibly crustal thickening and mountain building.\nMountain building.\nMountain formation in orogens is largely a result of crustal thickening. The compressive forces produced by plate convergence result in pervasive deformation of the crust of the continental margin (thrust tectonics). This takes the form of folding of the ductile deeper crust and thrust faulting in the upper brittle crust.\nCrustal thickening raises mountains through the principle of isostasy. Isostacy is the balance of the downward gravitational force upon an upthrust mountain range (composed of light, continental crust material) and the buoyant upward forces exerted by the dense underlying mantle.\nPortions of orogens can also experience uplift as a result of delamination of the orogenic lithosphere, in which an unstable portion of cold lithospheric root drips down into the asthenospheric mantle, decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift. An example is the Sierra Nevada in California. This range of fault-block mountains experienced renewed uplift and abundant magmatism after a delamination of the orogenic root beneath them.\nMount Rundle on the Trans-Canada Highway between Banff and Canmore provides a classic example of a mountain cut in dipping-layered rocks. Millions of years ago a collision caused an orogeny, forcing horizontal layers of an ancient ocean crust to be thrust up at an angle of 50\u201360\u00b0. That left Rundle with one sweeping, tree-lined smooth face, and one sharp, steep face where the edge of the uplifted layers are exposed.\nAlthough mountain building mostly takes place in orogens, a number of secondary mechanisms are capable of producing substantial mountain ranges. Areas that are rifting apart, such as mid-ocean ridges and the East African Rift, have mountains due to thermal buoyancy related to the hot mantle underneath them; this thermal buoyancy is known as dynamic topography. In strike-slip orogens, such as the San Andreas Fault, restraining bends result in regions of localized crustal shortening and mountain building without a plate-margin-wide orogeny. Hotspot volcanism results in the formation of isolated mountains and mountain chains that look as if they are not necessarily on present tectonic-plate boundaries, but they are essentially the product of plate tectonism. Likewise, uplift and erosion related to epeirogenesis (large-scale vertical motions of portions of continents without much associated folding, metamorphism, or deformation) can create local topographic highs.\nClosure of the ocean basin.\nEventually, seafloor spreading in the ocean basin comes to a halt, and continued subduction begins to close the ocean basin.\nContinental collision and orogeny.\nThe closure of the ocean basin ends with a continental collision and the associated Himalayan-type orogen.\nErosion.\nErosion represents the final phase of the orogenic cycle. Erosion of overlying strata in orogenic belts, and isostatic adjustment to the removal of this overlying mass of rock, can bring deeply buried strata to the surface. The erosional process is called \"unroofing\". Erosion inevitably removes much of the mountains, exposing the core or \"mountain roots\" (metamorphic rocks brought to the surface from a depth of several kilometres). Isostatic movements may help such unroofing by balancing out the buoyancy of the evolving orogen. Scholars debate about the extent to which erosion modifies the patterns of tectonic deformation (see erosion and tectonics). Thus, the final form of the majority of old orogenic belts is a long arcuate strip of crystalline metamorphic rocks sequentially below younger sediments which are thrust atop them and which dip away from the orogenic core.\nAn orogen may be almost completely eroded away, and only recognizable by studying (old) rocks that bear traces of orogenesis. Orogens are usually long, thin, arcuate tracts of rock that have a pronounced linear structure resulting in terranes or blocks of deformed rocks, separated generally by suture zones or dipping thrust faults. These thrust faults carry relatively thin slices of rock (which are called nappes or thrust sheets, and differ from tectonic plates) from the core of the shortening orogen out toward the margins, and are intimately associated with folds and the development of metamorphism.\nHistory of the concept.\nBefore the development of geologic concepts during the 19th century, the presence of marine fossils in mountains was explained in Christian contexts as a result of the Biblical Deluge. This was an extension of Neoplatonic thought, which influenced early Christian writers.\nThe 13th-century Dominican scholar Albert the Great posited that, as erosion was known to occur, there must be some process whereby new mountains and other land-forms were thrust up, or else there would eventually be no land; he suggested that marine fossils in mountainsides must once have been at the sea-floor. Orogeny was used by Amanz Gressly (1840) and Jules Thurmann (1854) as \"orogenic\" in terms of the creation of mountain elevations, as the term \"mountain building\" was still used to describe the processes. Elie de Beaumont (1852) used the evocative \"Jaws of a Vise\" theory to explain orogeny, but was more concerned with the height rather than the implicit structures created by and contained in orogenic belts. His theory essentially held that mountains were created by the squeezing of certain rocks. Eduard Suess (1875) recognised the importance of horizontal movement of rocks. The concept of a \"precursor geosyncline\" or initial downward warping of the solid earth (Hall, 1859) prompted James Dwight Dana (1873) to include the concept of \"compression\" in the theories surrounding mountain-building. With hindsight, we can discount Dana's conjecture that this contraction was due to the cooling of the Earth (aka the cooling Earth theory). The cooling Earth theory was the chief paradigm for most geologists until the 1960s. It was, in the context of orogeny, fiercely contested by proponents of vertical movements in the crust, or convection within the asthenosphere or mantle.\nGustav Steinmann (1906) recognised different classes of orogenic belts, including the \"Alpine type orogenic belt\", typified by a flysch and molasse geometry to the sediments; ophiolite sequences, tholeiitic basalts, and a nappe style fold structure.\nIn terms of recognising orogeny as an \"event\", Leopold von Buch (1855) recognised that orogenies could be placed in time by bracketing between the youngest deformed rock and the oldest undeformed rock, a principle which is still in use today, though commonly investigated by geochronology using radiometric dating.\nBased on available observations from the metamorphic differences in orogenic belts of Europe and North America, H. J. Zwart (1967) proposed three types of orogens in relationship to tectonic setting and style: Cordillerotype, Alpinotype, and Hercynotype. His proposal was revised by W. S. Pitcher in 1979 in terms of the relationship to granite occurrences. Cawood et al. (2009) categorized orogenic belts into three types: accretionary, collisional, and intracratonic. Both accretionary and collisional orogens developed in converging plate margins. In contrast, Hercynotype orogens generally show similar features to intracratonic, intracontinental, extensional, and ultrahot orogens, all of which developed in continental detachment systems at converged plate margins.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The family has more influence over the island than anyone else. \nA Giuseppe Bertoleoni informed that during a hunting trip, Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, verbally appointed him \"king of Tavolara\" in 1836. According to Giuseppe Bertoleoni, Charles Albert also (verbally) sanctioned the use of the title Prince for the oldest male heir, and the titles \"Lord of the Islands\" (Signore delle Isole) and \"Lady of the Sea\" (Signora del Mare) for the younger children of the king. Evidence for this was a scroll written by the prince later that confirmed officiating him as king.\nThe present claimant to the throne is King Tonino, an Italian citizen who runs \"Da Tonino\", a restaurant on the island.\nGiuseppe (1836\u20131845).\nBorn December 20, 1778, on the nearby island of La Maddalena, Giuseppe Celestino Bertoleoni Poli was a shepherd and the only inhabitant of the island before Charles Albert, the King of Sardinia's visit. He claimed to have impressed him as an educated man and to have been made king of the island shortly thereafter. He brought his two families from other islands to live with him. The Italian government tried to prosecute him for bigamy, but failed because of his title. Passed kingdom to son Paolo in 1845; died 1849. Giuseppe's origins are a mystery. Because he claimed to be more highly educated than the average Sardinian shepherd, some have speculated on no ground that he was a fugitive member of the Carbonari, an exiled French aristocrat, or even the Lost Dauphin.\nPaolo I (1845\u20131886).\nSon of Giuseppe Bertoleoni and Laura Ornano, born 1815. In 1839 he visited King Charles Albert in Turin and obtained a royal charter to Tavolara. During this period, the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi was associated with the Bertoleoni family, often visiting Paolo's relatives on the islands of La Maddalena and Caprera.\nAfter the creation of the Italian Kingdom in 1861, Paolo pressed and obtained recognition for Tavolara from Victor Emmanuel II. After he fell ill in 1882, his wife Pasqua Favale acted as regent until his death on May 30, 1886. A number of newspapers published the report that on his deathbed he asked that the kingdom die with him, and that his family therefore established a republic. These reports, however, were erroneous.\nCarlo I (1886\u20131927).\nSon of Paolo I and Pasqua Favale, born 1845. In the summer of 1900 the British naval vessel HMS \"Vulcan\" visited Tavolara, and the officers took a photograph of King Carlo and his family to hang in Queen Victoria's collection of royal portraits in Buckingham Palace. By 1904, however, Carlo was king in name only, having no ambition to rule. He is reported to have said, \"I do not care to be a king. It is enough for me to make as fine lobster-pots as did my father.\" He was persuaded to reign, however, until his death, which was reported either Nov 6, 1927, at Olbia, or Jan 31, 1928, at Ventimiglia on the Italian Riviera.\nMariangela (1927\u20131929).\nDaughter of Paolo I and Pasqua Favale, born 1841, she took up the crown at the request of her nephew Paolo (Carlo's son and designated successor) during his absence from the island (he had left the island looking for a job). When Mariangela died April 6, 1934, it was reported that Italy would inherit the kingdom.\nPaolo II (1929\u20131962).\nSon of Carlo I and Maddalena Favale, born 1897. Married 1930 to Italia Murru and initiated a renaissance of the monarchy. Appointed his cousin Prince Ernesto Carlo Geremia as Lieutenant General of the Kingdom. After Paolo's death Dec 2, 1962, the widowed Queen Italia Murru retired to Porto San Paolo on Sardinia, wintering at Capo Testa, until her death in 2003 at age 95. Paolo II was the last to actively rule Tavolara (numbering then about 50 inhabitants). At the end of his reign, half the island was occupied by a NATO military installation.\nCarlo II (1962\u20131993).\nEldest son of Paolo II and Italia Murru, born 1931. Married, no issue. Died May 1993 at Capo Testa, Sardinia. During the 1960s and 70s, his cousins Maria Molinas Bertoleoni (1869\u20131974) and Laura Molinas Bertoleoni (d. 1979), both daughters of Mariangela and Bachisio Molinas, also laid claim to the vacant \"throne\".\nTonino (1993\u2013present).\nAntonio (Tonino) Bertoleoni, second son of Paolo II and Italia Murru, was born in 1933. He is the owner of \"Da Tonino\" restaurant; his sister Princess Maddalena owns \"La Corona\" restaurant nearby. Following the return of Vittorio Emanuele of Naples to his native Italy in 2002, Tonino vowed an appeal to him, as heir to the House of Savoy, for recognition of the Tavolaran kingdom. Tonino's children by Maria \"Pompea\" Romano (1932\u20132010) are Loredana, Paola, and Giuseppe (Tonino's heir and current \"Lord of the Isles\"). Not much is known about him, but what is known is that he runs a family restaurant on the island and they also sell souvenirs. Bertoleoni's everyday life consists of simple activities such as fishing, gardening, and taking long walks around Tavolara.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53888", "revid": "47937478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53888", "title": "Death Star", "text": "Fictional moon-sized space station and superweapon\nThe Death Star is a fictional space station and superweapon featured in the \"Star Wars\" space-opera franchise. Constructed by the autocratic Galactic Empire, the Death Star is capable of obliterating entire planets, and serves to enforce the Empire's reign of terror. Appearing in the original film \"Star Wars\" (1977), the Death Star serves as the central plot point and setting for the film, and is destroyed in an assault by the Rebel Alliance during the climax of the film, with the prequel film \"Rogue One\" (2016) and the television series \"Andor\" (2022\u20132025) exploring its construction. A larger second Death Star is being built in the events of the film \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), featuring substantially improved capabilities compared to its predecessor, before it is destroyed by the Rebel Alliance while under construction.\nSince its first appearance, the Death Star has become a cultural icon and a widely recognized element of the \"Star Wars\" franchise. It inspired numerous similar superweapons in fiction as well as in other \"Star Wars\" works. The film \"The Force Awakens\" (2015) introduces Starkiller Base, a planet (Ilum) converted by the First Order into a Death Star-like superweapon. While more powerful and technologically advanced than both Death Stars, it is also destroyed by the Resistance. The film \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (2019) introduces the Final Order, a massive fleet of \"Xyston\"-class Star Destroyers built by the Sith Eternal, individual warships each carrying \"planet-killing\" weapons; the film also features the remains of the second Death Star, on the ocean moon of Kef Bir.\nOrigin and design.\nAccording to franchise creator George Lucas, his initial outline for the \"Star Wars\" saga did not feature the Death Star in the portion that would be adapted as the first film. When he set to creating the first act of this outline as a feature, he borrowed the Death Star concept from the third act.\nAlthough details, such as the superlaser's location, shifted between different concept models during the production of \"Star Wars\" (1977), the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station over in diameter was consistent in all of them. George Lucas gave the original task of designing a \"Death Star\" to concept artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell, who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film \"\". In \"Empire of Dreams\", a documentary about the filming and production of \"Star Wars,\" Cantwell revealed that the \"Death Star\" was originally supposed to be a perfect sphere. The model was constructed in two separate pieces, however, and wasn't fitting together as planned. It was then decided that there could be a trench going around the equator of the space station. Lucas liked the idea, and the Death Star model was created by John Stears. The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the \"Flash Gordon\" serials. Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light &amp; Magic's modelmakers for \"Return of the Jedi\". Only the front side of the model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film. Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.\nSpecial effects.\nThe grid plan animation shown during the Rebel briefing before the Death Star attack in \"A New Hope\" was an actual computer-graphics simulation developed by Larry Cuba at the University of Illinois Chicago alongside computer graphics researcher Tom DeFanti. George Lucas had recruited Cuba for the project after becoming familiar with his and Gary Imhoff's work with CalArts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nAfter filming was complete, the original model, as well as one of the surface setpieces, were to be thrown out, but they were eventually salvaged.\nThe Death Star explosions featured in the Special Edition of \"A New Hope\" and in \"Return of the Jedi\" are rendered with a Praxis Effect, wherein a flat ring of matter erupts from the explosion.\nDepiction.\nThe original Death Star was introduced in the original \"Star Wars\" film, which later had elements of its backstory explored in the prequel films \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\", the animated series ', \"Rebels\" and ', the 2016 anthology film \"Rogue One\", and the series \"Andor\". The second Death Star appears in \"Return of the Jedi\", and a similar superweapon, Starkiller Base, appears in \"The Force Awakens\". Both the original and second Death Star were moon-sized and designed for massive power-projection capabilities, capable of destroying an entire planet with a 6.2\u00d71032 J/s power output blast from their superlasers.\nOriginal Death Star.\nThe original Death Star's completed form appears in the original \"Star Wars\" film, known as the \"DS-1\" Orbital Battle Station, or Project Stardust in \"Rogue One\"; before learning the true name of the weapon, the Rebel Alliance referred to it as the \"Planet Killer\". Commanded by Governor Tarkin, it is the Galactic Empire's \"ultimate weapon\", a huge spherical battle station in diameter capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its superlaser.\nThe film opens with Princess Leia transporting the station's schematics to the Rebel Alliance to aid them in destroying the Death Star. To mark the Death Star being fully operational, Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia's home world of Alderaan in an attempt to press her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel headquarters; she gives them the location of Dantooine, which housed a now-deserted Rebel base, but Tarkin has Alderaan destroyed anyway as a demonstration of the Empire's resolve. Later, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, and R2-D2 (who were intended to arrive at Alderaan on board the \"Millennium Falcon\") are pulled aboard the station by a tractor beam, where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia. As they make their escape, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself whilst dueling Darth Vader, enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns as part of a fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray-shielded particle exhaust vent leading straight from the surface directly into its reactor core, discovered previously from the stolen schematics. Luke is able to successfully launch his X-wing fighter's torpedoes into the vent, impacting the core and triggering a catastrophic explosion, which destroys the station before it can annihilate the Rebel base on Yavin 4.\nThe Death Star's schematics are visible in the scenes on Geonosis in \"\", evidently designed by Geonosians led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser, a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and is shown early in construction at the end of \"Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith\". \"The Clone Wars\" Legacy story reel from the unfinished \"Crystal Crisis on Utapau\" episodes reveals that General Grievous went to Utapau prior to \"Revenge of the Sith\" in order to acquire an enormous kyber crystal to power the Death Star's superlaser.\nAs depicted in \"Rogue One\" and \"\" (2016), the Death Star was worked on by a team of engineers sequestered on the rainswept world of Eadu, overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the film's protagonist) to complete the design. The Death Star scientists sought to fuse kyber crystal shards into larger structures and used those crystals to amplify energy into a stable beam powerful enough to destroy an entire planet. In the Disney+ series, \"Andor\", set after the novel but before the film, prisoners of the Imperial Prison Complex in Narkina 5, including Cassian Andor, who got sent to the prison during his time as Keef Girgo, worked on Imperial equipment during their shifts, which was revealed in the post-credits scene of the first season's final episode, \"Rix Road\", to be parts built for the superlaser.\nThe 2014 book \"\" details the life of Grand Moff Tarkin and prominently features the Death Star. \"Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel\" tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by Galen Erso and Krennic's deception of him. It also reveals how Poggle worked with Krennic on the project but then turned on him. In the animated series \"Star Wars Rebels\", the two-part episode \"Ghosts of Geonosis\" hints that the Geonosians were nearly wiped out to extinction out of the Empire's need for secrecy. Saw Gerrera, having been sent to Geonosis to investigate, deduces that the Empire possesses a superweapon and resolves to discover the Death Star as depicted in the two-part episode \"In the Name of the Rebellion\". Though it is a dead end, Saw learns that the weapon is powered by kyber crystals taken from the Jedha system.\n\"Rogue One\" focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the Death Star plans just prior to the events of \"A New Hope\". The Death Star is first used to destroy Jedha City, both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet and as a display of the Death Star's operational status. Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star's superlaser on the base, killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and her small band of rebels. \"Rogue One\" also reveals that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its destructive power depending on the target; both the attack on Jedha City and the Scarif base used a single reactor.\nAccording to \"Star Wars\" reference books, the population of the Death Star was 1.7 million military personnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians, associated contractors and catering staff.\nThe Death Star was defended by thousands of turbolasers, ion cannons and laser cannons, plus a complement of seven to nine thousand TIE fighters, along with tens of thousands of support craft. It also had several massive docking bays, including dry docks capable of accommodating Star Destroyers.\nA hologram of the original Death Star is briefly visible in a scene at the Resistance base in \"The Force Awakens\" and used as a means of comparison with one from the First Order's own superweapon, Starkiller Base.\nSecond Death Star.\nThe 1983 film \"Return of the Jedi\" features the DS-2 Orbital Battle Station under construction as it orbits the forest moon Endor, which houses a shield generator protecting the station. The second Death Star is substantially more advanced and more powerful than its predecessor, and the critical weakness found in the first Death Star has been removed\u2014the Rebel Alliance's only hope is to destroy it prior to its completion. The Emperor and Darth Vader send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons systems are not yet complete in order to lure the Alliance fleet into a trap, resulting in the decisive Battle of Endor. In fact, the station's superlaser is fully operational, and it begins firing on and destroying Rebel capital ships during the battle.\nA ground assault team led by Han Solo with the help of the Endor-native Ewoks successfully manages to disable the shield generator, allowing Rebel pilots Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian to fly into the station (using Han's \"Millennium Falcon\") and fire on its reactor, destroying the station in another catastrophic explosion.\nAn early draft of \"Return of the Jedi\" features two Death Stars at various stages of completion. According to the \"Star Wars Encyclopedia\", the second Death Star had at its \"north pole ... a heavily armored 100-story tower topped by the Emperor's private observation chamber.\" The size of the second Death Star has not remained consistent among the various writers for the \"Star Wars\" franchise, with some stating it shared the first Death Star's radius and others claiming it was much more massive with a radius. The most recent figure established in 2017 by Ryder Windham gives the second Death Star a radius of .\nThe second Death Star is featured on the cover of the book ' (2015), which also features many flashbacks to the destruction of the second Death Star, as well as the events directly after its destruction. One of the main characters in the story personally escaped the explosion of the Death Star. The destruction of the second Death Star was also shown in holograms in the book. The 2015 comic book ' also explores the days following the destruction of the second Death Star from the perspective of Poe Dameron's parents, who were pilots during the event. The video game \"\" also takes place during the aftermath of the second Death Star's destruction, and features a hologram of its description on multiple occasions in and out of cutscenes.\nPart of the wreckage of the second Death Star appears in \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (2019), on the ocean moon Kef\u00a0Bir. Rey visits the wreckage to obtain the Emperor's wayfinder, a device that points the way to his hidden lair on Exegol.\nSimilar superweapons.\nThe 2019 comic \"Star Wars\" #68 reveals that the Rebels considered creating their own version of a Death Star by luring Star Destroyers to a tectonically unstable planet and setting it off with proton detonators.\nStarkiller Base.\n' features Starkiller Base, a Death Star-like superweapon built by the First Order, an autocratic regime considered to be the successor of the Empire. Significantly larger than both previous Death Stars, the superweapon was constructed out of an existing planet called Ilum instead of being assembled in deep space. The base draws its raw firepower by harnessing energy directly from a nearby star. Unlike its predecessors, Starkiller Base is capable of firing on and destroying multiple planets at once from extreme range\u2014in the film, the First Order obliterates the five planets in the Hosnian Prime system, at that time the capital of the New Republic. Starkiller Base is protected by a defensive shield that blocks all objects traveling at slower-than-light speeds; Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Finn exploit a vulnerability by bypassing the shield at faster-than-light speeds, successfully infiltrating the base and sabotaging its shields. Subsequently, an X-wing assault led by Poe Dameron and Nien Nunb destroys the superweapon by damaging the base's thermal oscillator and fuel cells, resulting in a catastrophic release of energy from the planet's core. As Resistance forces flee, the planet implodes and forms a star.\nThe name Starkiller Base pays homage to the early drafts of the original \"Star Wars\" film, referring to Luke Skywalker's original surname. Coincidentally, the name \"Starkiller\" is an alias given to Galen Marek by Darth Vader in the 2008 game, \"\". During early concept development, artist Doug Chiang envisioned the superweapon's gun as set inside a volcano, which X-wings would have to enter in a maneuver similar to the trench run on the Death Star in the original film.\nSith Star Destroyers.\nIn \"The Rise of Skywalker\", the ninth installment in the series, the resurrected Darth Sidious is revealed to have constructed the Sith Eternal's fleet of \"Xyston\"-class Star Destroyers, the Final Order, over the Sith planet Exegol. Each warship is armed with an axial superlaser capable of destroying planets; Sidious uses one of the Star Destroyers to destroy the planet Kijimi as a show of force. At the end of the film, the Resistance launches an offensive against the Sith Eternal forces, including the Sith fleet. Aided by reinforcements from across the galaxy, the Resistance defeats the remaining Sith forces by destroying the onboard superlasers, which ignited the ships reactors and destroyed them one by one. The Resistance also destroyed the \"Resurgent-\"class Star Destroyer \"Steadfast\" and the navigation signal that the fleet needed to exit the planet due to the unstable nature of the atmosphere.\nExpanded Universe.\nBoth Death Stars and similar superweapons appear throughout the non-canonical \"Star Wars\" Legends continuity.\nNational Public Radio's \"Star Wars\" adaptation (1981) portrays Leia (Ann Sachs) and Bail Organa's (Stephen Elliott) discovery of the Death Star's existence and how Leia obtained its schematics. The 1983 \"Star Wars\" arcade game and numerous LucasArts titles recreate the films' attacks on the Death Stars.\nKevin J. Anderson's \"Jedi Academy\" trilogy (1994) introduces the Maw Cluster of black holes that protect a laboratory where the DS-X Prototype Battle Station was built (consisting of the superstructure, power core, and superlaser). The first level of LucasArts' \"Dark Forces\" (1995) gives mercenary Kyle Katarn the role of stealing the plans that are subsequently given to Leia. Steve Perry's novel \"Shadows of the Empire\" (1996) describes a mission that leads to the Rebels learning of the second Death Star's existence, and that mission is playable in LucasArts' \"X-Wing Alliance\" space flight simulator (1999). The Death Star itself is a controllable weapon for the Empire in the ' (1998) and \"Empire at War\" (2006) strategy game. In ' (2005), the player participates in a mission to secure crystals used in the Death Star's superlaser. Another mission in the game tasks the player with acting as a stormtrooper or Darth Vader in an attempt to recover the plans and capture Leia. The first Death Star under construction acts as the final stage in the video game \"The Force Unleashed\" (2008).\nThe first Death Star's construction is the subject of Michael Reaves and Steve Perry's novel \"Death Star\" (2007), which depicts the many politics and hidden agendas behind the massive project, from its construction up until its final destruction.\nThe first Death Star's hangars contain assault shuttles, blastboats, Strike cruisers, land vehicles, support ships, and 7,293 TIE fighters. It is also protected by 10,000 turbolaser batteries, 2,600 ion cannons, and at least 768 tractor beam projectors. Various sources state that the first Death Star has a diameter of between 140 and 160 kilometers. There is a broader range of figures for the second Death Star's diameter, ranging from 160 to 900 kilometers.\nDS-X Prototype Battle Station.\nIn the \"Legends\" works \"Death Star\" (2007), \"Dark Empire II\", \"Jedi Search\" and \"Champions of the Force\", an experimental Death Star prototype, DS-X (a durasteel frame surrounding a reactor core, superlaser, engines and a control room) was conceived by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin as a test bed for the first Death Star. It was constructed by Bevel Lemelisk and his engineers at the Empire's secret Maw Installation. The prototype measured 120 kilometers in diameter. Its superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a planet's core, rendering it an uninhabitable \"dead planet\". The targeting system on the prototype was never calibrated and the superlaser was inefficient, leaving the weapon's batteries drained - Engineers in the control room claimed it would take 10\u201315 minutes to recharge batteries after the first shot was fired. The prototype had no interior except a slave-linked control room, hyperdrive engines and other components; the station operated with skeleton-crew of 75 personnel. The prototype was later destroyed when it was drawn into the black holes surrounding the Maw cluster itself.\nDeath Star III.\nIn the Disney attraction \"Star Tours \u2013 The Adventures Continue\", guests can travel inside an incomplete Death Star during one of the randomized ride sequences. In the original Star Tours, a Death Star III is seen and destroyed during the ride sequence by the New Republic. Leland Chee originally created the third Death Star to explain why a Death Star is present on the \"Star Tours\" ride when both of the stations in the film were destroyed. The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second Death Star before. It is similar to an original concept for \"Return of the Jedi\", where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The \"Habitation\" spheres, based on the Imperials' spurious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the Death Star III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series \"The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire\". In the Expanded Universe game \"\", a random HoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the Death Star is simply staying there until he can afford to stay at the third Death Star.\nOther superweapons.\nIn the original Marvel \"Star Wars\" comic series (1977\u20131986), a superweapon called \"The Tarkin\" is built. It is described as being similar to the Death Star but with more energy. Darth Vader commands it and Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 sabotage it with Lando's help. It is finally destroyed by an Imperial officer attempting to use an ionic weapon to both attack the escaping Rebels and assassinate Vader. Later in the series, a nihilistic group attempts to use a weapon to dislodge a planet from its orbit and cause others to do the same in a chain reaction, thereby destroying the entire universe.\nIn the \"Dark Empire\" comic series (1991\u201395), the reborn Emperor Palpatine's flagships \"Eclipse\" and \"Eclipse II\" Super Star Destroyers (Star Dreadnoughts) have a miniaturized version of the Death Star superlaser. The first \"Eclipse\" was under construction at the time of the Emperor's death at Endor; shortly thereafter, the incomplete \"Eclipse\" was briefly captured by the Zann Consortium, who used it during a three-way battle against the Empire and Rebels and emerged victorious; it was quickly abandoned following the battle as it was too large a target for the Rebels to ignore. The vessel was retrieved by remnants of the Empire and completed, and later served as the flagship of the resurrected Palpatine. It was destroyed by a Force storm enhanced by Luke and Leia, who had been brought aboard by the Emperor in hopes that they could be converted to the dark side. The \"Eclipse II\" was mostly identical to its predecessor save for a handful of visual changes, and fulfilled the same purpose. It was later destroyed when an errant projectile from the destroyed Galaxy Gun, another superweapon developed under the returned Palpatine, fell onto the ship and caused a massive explosion that destroyed not only the ship and its accompanying fleet, but also the nearby Imperial citadel of Byss.\nIn Kevin J. Anderson's novel \"Darksaber\" (1995), Death Star designer Bevel Lemelisk is recruited by the Hutts to build a superlaser weapon. Due to their refusal to sufficiently fund and supply the project, the resultant 'superweapon' is quickly destroyed by a combination of the tumultuous Hoth asteroid field in which it was built and the efforts of the New Republic. Lemelisk is captured and incarcerated by the Republic, and is later executed for his hand in the design and construction of Imperial superweapons.\nThe novel \"Children of the Jedi\" (1995) involves the return of \"Eye of Palpatine\", a \"colossal, asteroid-shaped\" super dreadnaught constructed at the behest of Emperor Palpatine during the second year of the Galactic Civil War. The Imperials lose control of the \"Eye\" when a Jedi uses the Force to hijack the main computer with their spirits.\nCultural influence.\nThe Death Star placed ninth in a 2008 20th Century Fox poll of the most popular film weapons.\nIt has been referred to outside of the \"Star Wars\" context in such examples as:\nAstronomy.\nIn 1981, following the \"Voyager\" spacecraft's flight past Saturn, scientists noticed a resemblance between one of the planet's moons, Mimas, and the Death Star. Additionally, some media outlets used the term \"Death Star\" to describe Nemesis, a hypothetical star postulated in 1984 to be responsible for gravitationally forcing comets and asteroids from the Oort cloud toward the inner Solar System.\nMerchandise.\nKenner and AMT created a playset and a model, respectively, of the first Death Star. In 2005 and 2008, Lego released models of and , respectively.\nIn 1979, Palitoy created a heavy card version of the Death Star as a playset for the vintage range of action figures in the UK, Australia and Canada. Both Death Stars are part of different Micro Machines three-packs. The Death Stars and locations in them are cards in Decipher, Inc.'s and Wizards of the Coast's \"Star Wars Customizable Card Game\" and \"Star Wars Trading Card Game\", respectively. Hasbro released a Death Star model that transforms into a Darth Vader mech. Estes Industries released a flying model rocket version.\nA Death Star trinket box was also released by Royal Selangor in 2015, in conjunction with the December screening of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" that year, and in 2016, Plox released the official levitating Death Star Speaker in anticipation of that year's screening of \"Rogue One\".\n\"Lego\" released a gift with purchase for \"Star Wars Day\" 2023 of a mini Death Star II.\n\"Lego\" released the Ultimate Collector Series Death Star in October 2025, also said to be the most expensive set at $1,000.\nPolitical campaigns.\nIn 2012\u201313, a (satirical) proposal on the White House's website urging the United States government to build a real Death Star as an economic stimulus and job creation measure gained more than 30,000 signatures, enough to qualify for an official response. The official (tongue-in-cheek) response was released in January 2013: the cost of building a real Death Star has been estimated in 2012 by a Centives economics blog of Lehigh University to $850 quadrillion, or about 13,000 times the worldwide gross domestic product, as well as at current rates of steel production, the Death Star would not be ready for more than 833,000 years. The White House response also stated that \"the Administration does not support blowing up planets,\" and questioned funding a weapon \"with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship\" as reasons for denying the petition.\nThe Luxembourgish magician Christian Lavey (born as Christian Kies) submitted a petition for the construction of a Death Star to the Luxembourgish parliament. In an interview with a local radio station, however Lavey admitted that this petition was just a joke and some kind of protest against the space plans of the government.\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was designed in the style of high-tech architecture by the architectural team of Richard Rogers, Su Rogers and Renzo Piano, along with Gianfranco Franchini. It is named after Georges Pompidou, the President of France from 1969 to 1974 who commissioned the building, and was officially opened on 31 January 1977 by President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing.\nCentre Pompidou is located in the Beaubourg area of the 4th arrondissement of Paris. It houses the (BPI; Public Information Library), a vast public library, and the , the largest museum for modern art in Europe. The Place Georges Pompidou is an open plaza in front of the museum.\nThe Centre Pompidou will be closed for renovation from September 2025 until 2030. The BPI will be temporarily relocated to its Lumi\u00e8re building.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe idea for a multicultural complex, bringing together different forms of art and literature in one place, developed, in part, from the ideas of France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, a proponent of the decentralisation of art and culture by impulse of the political power. In the 1960s, city planners decided to move the food markets of Les Halles, historically significant structures long prized by Parisians, with the idea that some of the cultural institutes be built in the former market area. Hoping to renew the idea of Paris as a leading city of culture and art, it was proposed to move the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne to this new location. Paris also needed a large, free public library, as one did not exist at this time. At first the debate concerned Les Halles, but as the controversy settled, in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle announced the Plateau Beaubourg as the new site for the library. \nIn 1969, Georges Pompidou, the new president, adopted the Beaubourg project and decided it to be the location of both the new library and a centre for the contemporary arts. In the process of developing the project, the IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique) was also housed in the complex.\nDesign selection.\nThe Rogers and Piano design was chosen among 681 competition entries. World-renowned architects Oscar Niemeyer, Jean Prouv\u00e9, and Philip Johnson made up the jury. It was the first time in France that international architects were allowed to participate. The selection was announced in 1971 at a press conference, where the contrast between the sharply-dressed Pompidou and \"hairy young crew\" of architects represented a \"grand bargain between radical architecture and establishment politics.\"\n2025\u20132030 closure and international expansion.\nA major renovation is due to take place between 2025 and 2030. The Centre Pompidou is closed from 2 March 2025 until 2030. The BPI is temporarily relocated to its Lumi\u00e8re building at 40 avenue des Terroirs de France on 25 August 2025.\nOn 22 September 2025, the Centre Pompidou announced its full closure for a major renovation project scheduled to last until 2030. Although preparatory closures had begun earlier in the year, with the suspension of access to parts of the collection and the relocation of the Biblioth\u00e8que publique d\u2019information (BPI), the complete shutdown marked the start of the modernization phase. The renovation aims to remove asbestos, upgrade technical systems, improve accessibility, and enhance the building\u2019s energy efficiency while preserving its architectural identity. The project is being led by the architectural firm Moreau Kusunoki, in collaboration with Frida Escobedo.\nWhile the renovation is underway, Centre Pompidou will internationally expand, opening its first South American space in 2027. The new $240 million satellite is schedule to launch in November 2027 and will be located in Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Brazil. Centre Pompidou plans to continue its satellite expansion in other locations, such as Shanghai and M\u00e1laga.\nAt the same time, the Centre Pompidou launched the program \u201cConstellation\u201d, designed to display its national collection across France and internationally. Early Constellation projects included exhibitions in Lille, Metz, and Monaco.\nArchitecture.\nDesign.\nRichard Rogers and Renzo Piano, two emerging architects in their thirties, designed the first major example of an \"inside-out\" building with its structural system, mechanical systems, and circulation exposed on the exterior of the building, reflecting their belief that they had no chance of winning the commission. Gianfranco Franchini was also involved in the design.\nExplaining the ideas that informed the Centre Pompidou's design, Piano said, \"Our idea was a museum that would inspire curiosity, not intimidate people, and that would open up culture to all... Our credo was a place for all people \u2013 for the poor and rich, the young and old\".\nThe daring design increased the efficiency of interior space utilization. Initially, all of the functional structural elements of the building were colour-coded: green pipes are plumbing, blue ducts are for climate control, electrical wires are encased in yellow, and circulation elements and devices for safety (e.g., fire extinguishers) are red. According to Piano, the design was meant to be \"not a building but a town where you find everything \u2013 lunch, great art, a library, great music\".\nThe Centre Pompidou, initially met with dismay akin to the Eiffel Tower's reception in its time, is now widely regarded as an artwork in its own merit. \"National Geographic\" described the reaction to the design as \"love at second sight.\" An article in \"Le Figaro\" declared: \"Paris has its own monster, just like the one in Loch Ness.\" But two decades later, while reporting on Rogers' winning the Pritzker Prize in 2007, \"The New York Times\" noted that the design of the Centre \"turned the architecture world upside down\" and that \"Mr. Rogers earned a reputation as a high-tech iconoclast with the completion of the 1977 Pompidou Centre, with its exposed skeleton of brightly coloured tubes for mechanical systems\". The Pritzker jury said the Pompidou \"revolutionised museums, transforming what had once been elite monuments into popular places of social and cultural exchange, woven into the heart of the city.\"\nConstruction.\nThe centre was built by GTM and completed in 1977. The building cost 993 million French francs. Renovation work conducted from October 1996 to January 2000 was completed on a budget of 576 million francs. The principal engineer was the renowned Peter Rice, responsible for, amongst other things, the Gerberette. During the renovation, the centre was closed to the public for 27 months, re-opening on 1 January 2000.\nIn September 2020, it was announced that the Centre Pompidou would begin renovations in 2023, which will require either a partial closure for seven years or a full closure for three years. The projected cost for the upcoming renovations is $235 million. In January 2021 Roselyne Bachelot, France's culture minister, announced that the centre would close completely in 2023 for four years.\nDescription and components.\nBecause of its location (in the Beaubourg area of the 4th arrondissement of Paris, near Les Halles, rue Montorgueil, and the Marais), the centre is known locally as Beaubourg ()\nIndoors.\nCentre Pompidou houses three major institutions:\nThe BPI holds around 367,000 books, as well as specialist periodicals, audio-visual materials, photographs, and a wealth of other material. The collections are open to the public, but it is not a lending library. It also hosts cultural events and screens documentary films, as well as hosting the Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el documentary film festival.\nDuring the major renovation of the Centre Pompidou from March 2025 until 2030, the BPI will be temporarily relocated to its Lumi\u00e8re building at 40 Avenue des Terroirs de France on 25 August 2025.\nOutdoors.\nThe sculpture \"Horizontal\" by Alexander Calder, a free-standing mobile that is tall, was placed in front of the Centre Pompidou in 2012.\nStravinsky Fountain.\nThe nearby Stravinsky Fountain (also called the \"Fontaine des automates\"), on Place Stravinsky, features 16 whimsical moving and water-spraying sculptures by Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint-Phalle, which represent themes and works by composer Igor Stravinsky. The black-painted mechanical sculptures are by Tinguely, the coloured works by de Saint-Phalle. The fountain opened in 1983.\nPlace Georges Pompidou.\nThe Place Georges Pompidou in front of the museum is noted for the presence of street performers, such as mimes and jugglers. In the spring, miniature carnivals are installed temporarily into the place in front with a wide variety of attractions: bands, caricature and sketch artists, tables set up for evening dining, and even skateboarding competitions.\nIn 2021 the artists Arotin &amp; Serghei realised for the re-inauguration of the Place Georges Pompidou after years of works, and in the context of IRCAM's festival \"Manifeste\" the intermedial large-scale installation \"Infinite Light Columns / Constellations of The Future\" 1\u20134, \"Tribute to Constantin Brancusi\", installed along Piano's IRCAM Tower, on the opposite site of Brancusi's studio, visible from both, the Place Igor Stravinsky and Place Georges Pompidou. Then president of the Centre Pompidou, Serge Lasvignes, said in his 2015 inauguration speech: \"The installation symbolises what the Centre Pompidou wants to be... a multidisciplinary ensemble... it is the resurrection of the initial spirit of the Centre Pompidou with the Piazza, the living heart of creation\".\nAttendance.\nBy the mid-1980s, the Centre Pompidou was becoming the victim of its huge and unexpected popularity, its many activities, and a complex administrative structure. When Dominique Bozo returned to the Centre in 1981 as Director of the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, he re-installed the museum, bringing out the full range of its collections and displaying the many major acquisitions that had been made. \nBy 1992, the Centre de Cr\u00e9ation Industrielle was incorporated into the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, henceforth called \"MNAM/CCI\". The CCI, as an organisation with its own design-oriented programme, ceased to exist, while the MNAM started to develop a design and architecture collection in addition to its modern and contemporary art collection.\nThe Centre Pompidou was intended to handle 8,000 visitors a day. In its first two decades it attracted more than 145 million visitors, more than five times the number first predicted. As of 2006[ [update]], more than 180 million people have visited the centre since its opening in 1977. However, until the 1997\u20132000 renovation, 20 percent of the centre's eight million annual visitors\u2014predominantly foreign tourists\u2014rode the escalators up the outside of the building to the platform for the sights.\nDuring a three-year renovation ending in its 2000 reopening, the Centre Pompidou improved accessibility for visitors\nBetween 1977 and 2006, the centre had 180 million visitors. Since 2006, the global attendance of the centre is no longer calculated at the main entrance, but only those of the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne and of the public library (5,209,678 visitors for both in 2013), but without the other visitors of the building (929,431 in 2004 or 928,380 in 2006, for only the \"panorama\" tickets or cinemas, festivals, lectures, bookshops, workshops, restaurants, etc.). In 2017, the museum had 3.37 million visitors. The public library had 1.37 million.\nThe Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne saw an increase in attendance from 3.1 million (2010) to 3.6 million visitors in 2011, and 3.75 million in 2013. The 2013 retrospective \"Dal\u00ed\" broke the museum's daily attendance record: 7,364 people a day went to see the artist's work (790,000 in total). \nVisitors to the centre totalled more than 5,209,678 in 2013, including 3,746,899 for the museum.\nThe centre had 3.1 million visitors in 2022, a large increase from 2021 but still below 2019 levels, due to closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in France. \nExpansion.\nRegional branches.\nIn 2010, the Centre Georges Pompidou opened a regional branch, the Centre Pompidou-Metz, in Metz, a city 250 kilometres east of Paris. The new museum is part of an effort to expand the display of contemporary arts beyond Paris's large museums. The new museum's building was designed by the architect Shigeru Ban with a curving and asymmetrical pagoda-like roof topped by a spire and punctured by upper galleries. The 77-metre central spire is a nod to the year the Centre Georges Pompidou of Paris was built \u2013 1977. The Centre Pompidou-Metz displays unique, temporary exhibitions from the collection of the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, which is not on display at the main Parisian museum.\nSince its inauguration, the institution has become the most visited cultural venue in France outside Paris, accommodating 550,000 visitors/year.\nLaunched in 2011 in Chaumont, the museum for the first time went on the road to the French regions with a selection of works from the permanent collection. To do this, it designed and constructed a mobile gallery, which, in the spirit of a circus, will make camp for a few months at a time in towns throughout the country. However, in 2013, the Centre Pompidou halted its mobile-museum project because of the cost.\nIn 2014, plans were released for a temporary satellite of the Centre Pompidou in the northern French town of Maubeuge close to the Belgian border. The 3,000-square-metre outpost, to be designed by the architects Pierre Hebbelinck and Pierre de Wit, is said to be located at the 17th-century Maubeuge Arsenal for four years. The cost of the project is \u20ac5.8 million.\nIn 2015, the city authorities in Libourne, a town in south-western France, proposed a Pompidou branch housed in a former military base called Esog.\nIn 2019, the Centre Pompidou announced plans to open a conservation, exhibition and storage space in Massy (Essonne) by 2025. Project backers include the R\u00e9gion Ile-de-France and the French state.\nInternational expansion.\nEurope.\nM\u00e1laga.\nIn 2015, approximately 70 works from the Centre Pompidou's collection went on show in a subterranean glass-and-steel structure called \"The Cube\" (\"El Cubo\") in M\u00e1laga. According to the Spanish newspaper \"El Pa\u00eds\", the annual \u20ac1 million cost of the five-year project were funded by the city council. The partnership with M\u00e1laga was announced by the city's mayor but was not confirmed by Pompidou Centre president Alain Seban until 24 April 2014.\nUnder the agreement, approximately 100 works from the Pompidou's 20th and 21st century collection were put on display, while a smaller area is being used for temporary exhibitions. Portraiture and the influence of Picasso will be among the subjects explored in the permanent display, organised by the Pompidou's deputy director Brigitte Leal. Highlights will include works by Alberto Giacometti, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Alexander Calder and Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, and contemporary works by Sophie Calle, Bruce Nauman and Orlan. The city of M\u00e1laga also commissioned Daniel Buren to create a large-scale installation within \"El Cubo\".\nFollowing the original five-year agreement that was signed in September 2014, the terms were renewed early 2018 and again in 2024. Under the most recent renewal, M\u00e1laga city council agreed to pay the Centre Pompidou an annual fee of \u20ac2.7 million over five years (2025\u201329), rising to \u20ac3.1 million in the latter period (2030\u201334).\nBrussels.\nIn March 2018, the Centre Pompidou announced plans to open an offshoot branch in Brussels, under the name KANAL - Centre Pompidou. Housed in a former Citro\u00ebn garage which was transformed by a team comprising ces noAarchitecten (Brussels), EM2N (Zurich) and Sergison Bates architects (London), the new centre brings together the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, an architecture centre (CIVA Foundation) and public spaces devoted to culture, education and leisure. The Brussels-Capital region \u2014 which acquired the Art Deco-style building in October 2015 \u2014 is the main funder project, with the conversion costing \u20ac122 million.\nAsia.\nIn a joint proposal with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum presented in 2005, the Centre Pompidou planned to build a museum of modern and contemporary art, design and the media arts in Hong Kong's West Kowloon Cultural District.\nIn 2007, the then president Bruno Racine announced plans to open a museum carrying the Pompidou's name in Shanghai, with its programming to be determined by the Pompidou. The location chosen for the new museum was a former fire station in the Luwan district's Huaihai Park. However, the scheme did not materialize for several years, reportedly due to the lack of a legal framework for a non-profit foreign institution to operate in China. In 2019, the Centre Pompidou x West Bund Museum opened to the public, based in a wing of the West Bund Art Museum designed by David Chipperfield. The inaugural exhibitions \"The Shape of Time, Highlights of the Centre Pompidou Collection\" and \"Observations, Highlights of the New Media Collection\" were curated by Marcella Lista.\nOther projects include the Pompidou's joint venture with the King Abdulaziz Centre for World Culture, an arts complex incorporating a museum in Dhahran, the building of which has stalled.\nNorth America.\nIn April 2014, Pompidou president Alain Seban confirmed that after Malaga (Spain), Mexico will be the next site for a pop-up Pompidou Centre. A 58,000-square-foot satellite museum Centre Pompidou x Jersey City in Jersey City, New Jersey, was scheduled to open in 2024, which would have made it the Pompidou's first satellite museum in North America; however, in 2024, city and state funding for the museum was withdrawn. The Jersey City City Council voted in September 2024 to approve a tax abatement, allowing Centre Pompidou x Jersey City to open at an alternative location.\nSouth America.\nThere have been rumours of a pop-up Pompidou satellite museum in Brazil since Alain Seban announced the plan for these temporary locations back in 2012. At a talk on satellite museums at the Guggenheim on 24 April 2014, Alain Seban suggested that Brazil may be the third country to host a temporary satellite museum, after Spain and Mexico.\nManagement.\nFunding.\nAs a national museum, the Centre Pompidou is government-owned and subsidised by the Ministry of Culture (64.2% of its budget in 2012 : 82.8 on 129 million \u20ac), essentially for its staff. The Culture Ministry appoints its directors and controls its gestion, which is nevertheless independent, as \"Etablissement public \u00e0 caract\u00e8re administratif\" since its creation. In 2011, the museum earned $1.9 million from travelling exhibitionshttps://\nEstablished in 1977 as the institution's US philanthropic arm, the Georges Pompidou Art and Culture Foundation acquires and encourages major gifts of art and design for exhibition at the museum. Since 2006, the non-profit support group has brought in donations of 28 works, collectively valued at more than $14 million, and purchased many others. In 2013, New York-based art collectors Thea Westreich Wagner and Ethan Wagner announced their intention to donate about 300 works by 27 European and international artists to the Centre Pompidou, thereby making one of the largest gifts in the institution's history.\nNazi-looted art.\nIn 1999, the heirs of Alphonse Kann requested the return of Georges Braque's \"The Guitar Player\", which the Centre Pompidou had acquired from Heinz Berggruen in 1981.\nIn 2011, Centre Pompidou admitted that it held three paintings, \"Les Peupliers (Poplars)\", \"Arbres (Trees)\", and \"Composition\" by the artist F\u00e9dor L\u00f6wenstein that had been looted during the Nazi occupation of France.\nIn 2021, after the French government restituted a looted Max Pechtstein painting to the heirs of Hugo Simon, the Centre Pompidou held an exhibition in a tribute to the persecuted art collector.\nExhibitions.\nSeveral major exhibitions are organised each year on either the first or sixth floors, including both monographs and group exhibitions.\nGroup exhibitions have included:\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53891", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53891", "title": "Noir (TV series)", "text": "2001 Japanese anime television series\n is a 26-episode Japanese anime television series created and written by Ry\u014de Tsukimura and produced by Victor Entertainment and Bee Train. The series was directed by K\u014dichi Mashimo, with Yoko Kikuchi, Minako Shiba and Satoko Miyachi in charge of character designs, Kenji Teraoka in charge of mechanical design, and Yuki Kajiura composing the music. \n\"Noir\" was followed by two spiritual successors, \"Madlax\" and \"El Cazador de la Bruja\". Together, these series constitute a trilogy exploring the \"girls-with-guns\" genre.\nOutside of Japan, \"Noir\" has been released on DVD by ADV Films in North America and the United Kingdom and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand. After ADV closed, Funimation Entertainment acquired the North American rights to the series in 2010.\nPlot.\nOpening introduction, Kirika's (later with Mireille) voice-over towards the audience:\nThe series follows the story of two young female assassins, the Corsican Mireille Bouquet and the Japanese amnesiac Kirika Yuumura, who embark together on a personal journey to seek answers about mysteries concerning their past. At first, they seem to be only vaguely related to each other, but there are clues and hints given throughout the series that there is more going on behind the scenes than at first glance.\nIn their journey to learn more about Kirika's lost memories and her connection to Mireille, the two form an alliance and begin performing assassinations under the code name \"Noir.\" During the course of the series, they are lured into more and more traps by a secret organization named \"Les Soldats\" (\"The Soldiers\" in French). Les Soldats are a secret organization that has been a part, yet separate group of humanity. It is this hidden group that created and once completely controlled the deadly duo \"Noir\". Each time that Les Soldats soldiers are sent to kill Mireille and Kirika, it is considered a test as to whether or not the young women are suitable to carry the title \"Noir\".\n Voiced by: H\u014dko Kuwashima (Japanese); Monica Rial (English)\n Kirika is a teenage high school girl with amnesia who lives in Japan, however during her journey she goes to stay with Mireille in her apartment which resides in Paris; the only things she remembers are the word \"Noir\" and her instinctual killing abilities. When creating the characters for \"Noir\", producer Shigeru Kitayama wanted the image of Kirika to be \"sweet and fragile\".\n Voiced by: Kotono Mitsuishi (Japanese); Shelley Calene-Black (English)\n Mireille is a Corsican woman born into a powerful crime family. Mireille and her uncle are the sole survivors of a brutal attack on her family, whereafter he trained her to become an assassin.ep. 14 When creating the character for \"Noir\", Shigeru Kitayama imagined Mireille as \"a lithe female panther\". Mitsuishi, the Japanese voice of Mireille, previously worked with Kitayama on \"Excel Saga\", where she voiced the protagonist Excel; the first thing she was told was that Excel and Mireille are completely opposite characters. In the English dub, ADV Films decided against giving Mireille a Corsican accent so as to avoid confusion among viewers unfamiliar with the language.\n Voiced by: Aya Hisakawa (Japanese); Hilary Haag (English)\n Chloe is a skilled assassin who uses throwing and handheld knives instead of guns. Like Kirika and Mireille, Chloe is a candidate to become Noir. Chloe idolizes Kirika for her exceptional killing skills, and she believes that she and Kirika are destined to become Noir together. She is the personal favorite character of \"Noir\"'s composer Yuki Kajiura.\n Voiced by: Tarako (Japanese); Tiffany Grant (English)\n Altena is the high priestess of the Soldats. She believes that the Soldats have been corrupted by power and greed, and she attempts to return the Soldats to its \"original state\" by reviving Noir. She lives a medieval lifestyle in a place the Soldats consider as their holy site called \"The Manor\", located somewhere on the border between France and Spain, where she raised and trained Chloe.\nSetting.\nUnlike its spiritual successors \"Madlax\" and \"El Cazador de la Bruja\", \"Noir\" is mainly about reality's criminal underworld while the later two are about supernatural events. Mireille and Kirika, in episode four, check the profile of a fifteen-year-old student named Rosaly Hammond, discovering that she was born on August 2, 1994. As Rosaly would be turning sixteen, Noir thus takes place approximately between 2010 and 2011.\nLes Soldats.\n (\"The Soldiers\" in French) is a mysterious organization in \"Noir\". According to Altena, a thousand years ago, a group of people who had survived a bloody war that cost numerous lives, formed a group called \"Les Soldats\" to protect the weak and take revenge on the world. When Kirika travels to a Soldats' village, she finds out that during the late tenth century, \"Les Soldats\" has taken place in every social part of humankind. For example, Soldats were witnessed at the birth of the Greone's mafia family, which was created 200 years ago from the time the series began. Near the end of the series, Altena states that \"Les Soldats\" have been consumed by the very greed they once swore to undo, and thus had become like the world itself.\nAlthough the Soldats were founded by a united group, in \"Noir\" its members were separated into two groups: Altena's followers and her opposers, the Soldats' Council members. For easy identification, Altena's most loyal followers are include people who dress up as nuns and common villagers who are skilled at fighting These nuns and priestesses often appear to be ordinary, petite women, they are capable of using guns and other lethal weapons. Altena lives in a manor not located on any map but is near the border of France and Spain. It is known by name \"the place which has been forgotten by time\". The manor's structure is similar to those of Ancient Greece and Rome. Separated from the manor by mountains, there is a village which belongs to Altena, and their ancient task is to guard her manor.\nThe Soldats' Council are the people who disagreed with Altena's decision to bring back the True Noir by means of a ritual called the Grand Retour. The Council contains five members, and one of them, Remy Brefford, invites Mireille to join their ranks, and he has an office in a building in Paris.\nMen in black suits are often sent by the Soldats to try to kill the Noir candidates, but the faction affiliate of these men is unclear. Altena successfully manipulates everyone in the group, and she particularly targets the three Noir candidates Chloe, Kirika, and Mireille. She hides her true agenda from the Soldats, even her most trusted advisers, until the end. Altena led the Soldats to believe that she wanted Chloe and Kirika to be the True Noir, to enforce the will of the Soldats. However, she believed that Mireille and Kirika would enact her true plan, to destroy the Soldats. Altena's plan was not fully successful because Mireille did not target the Council at the end of the series.\nNoir.\n\"Noir\" is the French word for \"black\". In \"Noir\", it is known as the name of the two maidens who govern death. Pictures and sculptures of the two maidens can be seen on Mireille's father's watch and on Soldats' churches. To the underworld, it is known as the \"One Thousand Year\" darkness of Europe. According to Altena's story, when the Soldats went under, two hands were left on the surface, so their ancient task is to retrieve the two maidens known as \"Noir\". The ritual to become Noir takes place under Altena's manor, an underground temple in the style of ancient Greek ruins.\nThroughout the series, the only three candidates for \"Noir\" are Mireille Bouquet, Kirika Yuumura and Chloe. Of all the three, Mireille was the only who was predicted to be neglected, and Kirika probably is the only who can turn into \"True Noir\". When one has fallen, the remaining two shall become Noir.\nProduction.\nAccording to the director K\u014dichi Mashimo, he envisioned \"Noir\" and \"Madlax\" as part of a trilogy exploring the girls-with-guns genre, and soon after the release of the latter, he confirmed having plans to produce the third installment, which would later become \"El Cazador de la Bruja\".\nFor Mireille's personal sidearm, Mashimo wanted a gun with \"a more modern image\", therefore the production staff decided on the Walther P99. After considering several compact pistols, including the Walther PPK and the Glock 26, for Kirika's personal sidearm, the Beretta M1934 became the weapon of choice, because of its \"classic, European feel\" that suited the premise of the series' story. Because of the organization's premise, European guns were chosen for the members of Les Soldats. The assassins in black suits that are sent after the protagonists throughout the series all carry the SIG Pro 2340, which at the time of production was the newest model of its line, while other members were given increasingly older weapons, depending on the member's rank.\nAccording to producer Shigeru Kitayama, Kotono Mitsuishi's voicing of Mireille was a continuation of the working relationship they had from creating \"Excel Saga\", where Mitsuishi voiced the protagonist Excel.\nMedia.\nTV airings and home video.\nThe 26 episodes of the \"Noir\" anime series initially ran from April 6 through September 28, 2001 on TV Tokyo in Japan and was released on DVD and VHS in 13 compilations, each containing two episodes, by Victor Entertainment between July 25, 2001 and March 21, 2002. \nVictor Entertainment has remastered the series from its original 35mm elements and released a Blu-ray Disc version on February 19, 2014 in Japan. \nSoundtrack.\nLike many of studio Bee Train's other works, the \"Noir\" soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura, accompanied by primary vocalist Yuriko Kaida, secondary vocalist Yuri Kasahara, and Kajiura's band See-Saw.\nThe series makes use of two pieces of theme music. by Ali Project is used as opening theme, while by Akino Arai serves as ending theme.\nVictor Entertainment published a single and three original soundtrack albums for the series. \"Coppelia no Hitsugi\" was released as a single on May 23, 2001. The first and second soundtracks, called \"Noir: Original Soundtrack I\" and \"Noir: Original Soundtrack II\", were released on June 21 and October 3, 2001, respectively. The third soundtrack, called , was released on November 7, 2001.\nInternational release and distribution.\nAfter giving hints, announcements, and retractions for almost a year, ADV Films released the series in English in seven DVD compilations, the first containing five episodes, the others containing three or four episodes, between February 18 and October 28, 2003. Prior to that, the first episode was included on the DVD insert of the January 2003 issue of \"Newtype USA\". \nFollowing the closure and restructuring of ADV Films in 2009, the series is now licensed by Funimation Entertainment, which is currently known as Crunchyroll, LLC in North America, and re-released the series as a part of their Anime Classics line on August 9, 2011 along with the Blu-ray release on April 15, 2015. The series is also available for video streaming on both FunimationNOW and Crunchyroll.\nPotential live-action remake.\nA possible live action feature based on the anime series has been planned for development by the cable television network Starz. Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert (', ', \"Legend of the Seeker\") are the executive producers for the project. Stephen Lightfoot was serving as executive producer and writer but was replaced by Sean Jablonski.\nIn March 2012, Starz CEO Chris Albrecht commented that production has been put on hiatus as he states in an interview, \"We're in a bit of holding pattern with \"Noir\".\" Then in December of that year, two new writers, Cyrus Voris and Ethan Reiff, were announced to have joined the project and were undertaking re-writes of Jablonski's scripts. By January 2013, Starz CEO Chris Albrecht announced that the project remained at a standstill citing difficulty to get the project creatively to a good place.\nReception.\nCritical reception of \"Noir\" has been positive. \"Newtype\" ranked \"Noir\" second in its top 10 list of anime of the year 2001. \"Noir\" also made a top three place in the top 20 anime in Japan chart by \"Anihabara!\" in October 2001. In the June 2002 issue of \"Animage\", \"Noir\" was voted by the magazine's readers onto a shared 10th place in the best 20 new anime of 2001 in Japan. Josh Mohs of Active Anime commented that \"\"Noir\" doesn't fail to deliver mystery, action, and drama.\" Though he lamented \"some pacing problems, especially towards the beginning of the series,\" he lauded the character interactions as well as the series' \"job of tying together all its inherent sub-plots\" and the director's \"bold move\" in leaving \"the ending open to viewer interpretation.\" In a review of the first DVD compilation by ADV Films, Jeremy Conrad of IGN lauded the series for being \"stylistic\", stating that \"It oozes style\", and for its \"extremely cool\" fight choreography and \"great\" shootouts, saying that \"What \"Noir\" does right is its action.\" He also noted the series' character design as being \"solid\" and the series' soundtrack as being \"excellent\", reminiscent of \"\u00c9ric Serra's stuff in movies such as \"La Femme Nikita\"\", but lamented about the slowed pace at the end of the volume, stating that \"some of the story stuff they were trying to do [in the fourth and fifth episodes] was snooze inducing.\" Josh Mohs of Active Anime commentEd that \"Noir\"'s \"strong character interactions are usually enough to pull you through\" the pacing problems he saw with the series and further states that, along with the series' \"unique twists\", the \"intriguing character dynamic definitely elevate[s] it above the rest of the competition.\" Kirika had been voted with Mireille as two of the top ten female anime characters by \"Newtype\" in 2001.\nAnime News Network's Theron Martin, ten years after the show's original run, gave the series a rating of B+, and commented that \"Noir\" \"was at least to some degree an influential title\" and \"is still recognized as one of the preeminent titles of its type because it redefined what a 'girls with guns' title could be.\" He went on to praise the show for its \"sleek, elegant story\" and called it \"anime's most pronounced homage to classic film noir\". He named Mireille and Kirika \"one of anime's most iconic female teams\" along with the Dirty Pair and credited Kirika as \"a precursor of the moe craze that came along later in the decade.\" He named \"The Lost Kitten\" as the series' episode with the best story content, and the double episode \"The Intoccabile\" as having the worst, noting its \"hackneyed look into the Cosa Nostra\". He lamented repetitiveness in action sequences and excessive reuse of scenes especially in early episodes as well as the absence of blood in light of the show's high body count. He showed himself unimpressed with the animation quality, but lauded the show's good looks, in particular those of the environments. He named the \"tendency for repetitiveness\" of its first half as the soundtrack's \"only real flaw\" and praised the pieces \"Salva Nos\" and \"Canta Per Me\" as \"stand[ing] among the all-time great anime themes\". About the English version, he commented that the \"casting choices fit and match up well against the original performances\" and that the \"script stays tight enough to avoid garnering any accuracy complaints\". In conclusion, he said \"the series works in the ways that it is supposed to work and should keep viewers thoroughly involved through to the end.\"\nDiane Tiu of THEM Anime Reviews gave \"Noir\" a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, praising the story, characters, soundtrack, and the relationship between Mireille and Kirika, but questioned the lack of blood and how the main characters always seem to take out their opposition single-handedly. Overall, Tiu concludes that \"Noir oozes style. It is an original anime that stands out - the perfect anime if you've had too much fluff.\" Enoch Lau, also of THEM Anime Reviews, also gave the series a 4 out of 5 star rating, handing out praise to the animation, visuals, story, soundtrack, action scenes, and the chemistry between Mireille and Kirika. Lau's only criticisms was the lack of blood, as well as the slow pacing of the series, but concluded overall that \"The cream of action-drama anime has just gotten sweeter and creamier with Noir. The slow pace and sombre mood of the plot might turn off some people, but those who stick with it will be rewarded with brilliant action scenes and awesome chicks with guns.\"\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Created in 1938, the OKW replaced the Reich Ministry of War and had nominal oversight over the individual high commands of the country's armed forces: the army (), navy () and air force (). With the start of World War II, tactical control of the Waffen-SS was also exercised by it. There was no direct chain of command between the OKW and the other High Commands.\nRivalry with the different services' commands, mainly with the Army High Command (OKH), prevented the OKW from becoming a unified German General Staff in an effective chain of command, though it did help coordinate operations among the three services. During the war, the OKW acquired more and more operational powers. By 1942, the OKW had responsibility for all theatres except for the Eastern Front. However, Hitler manipulated the system in order to prevent any one command from taking a dominant role in decision making. This \"divide and conquer\" method helped put most military decisions in Hitler's own hands, which at times included even those affecting engagements at the battalion level, a practice which, due to bureaucratic delays and Hitler's worsening indecision as the war progressed, would eventually contribute to Germany's defeat.\nGenesis.\nThe OKW was established by executive decree on 4 February 1938, in the aftermath of the Blomberg-Fritsch affair, which had led to the dismissal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and head of the Reich Ministry of War, Werner von Blomberg, as well as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Werner von Fritsch.\nAdolf Hitler, who had been waiting for an opportunity to gain personal control over the German military, quickly took advantage of the scandal, using the powers granted to him by the Enabling Act to do so. The decree dissolved the ministry and replaced it with the OKW. The OKW was directly subordinate to Hitler in his position as (Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces), to the detriment of the existing military structure.\nThe OKW was led by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel as Chief of the OKW with the rank of a Reich Minister, which essentially made him the second most powerful person in the armed forces' hierarchy after Hitler. The next officer after Keitel was Lieutenant General Alfred Jodl, who served as the OKW's Chief of Operations Staff. However, despite this seemingly powerful hierarchy, the German military's officers mostly disregarded Keitel's position, deeming him nothing more than Hitler's lackey. Other officers often had direct access to the \"F\u00fchrer\", such as officers with the rank of field marshal, while other officers even outranked Keitel, an example being the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Hermann G\u00f6ring. In theory this position meant G\u00f6ring was subordinate to Keitel, but his alternate rank of made him the second most powerful person in Germany after Hitler, and he used this alternate power to circumvent Keitel and access Hitler directly whenever he wished.\nBy June 1938, the OKW comprised four departments:\nThe WFA replaced the (Armed Forces Office) which had existed between 1935 and 1938 within the Reich War Ministry, headed by Keitel. Hitler promoted Keitel to Chief of the OKW (), i.e. Chief of the Armed Forces High Command. As head of the WFA, Keitel appointed Max von Viebahn although after two months he was removed from command, and this post was not refilled until the promotion of Alfred Jodl. To replace Jodl at the (WFA/L), Walther Warlimont was appointed. In December 1941 further changes took place with the (WFA/L) being merged into the and losing its role as a subordinate organization. These changes were largely cosmetic however as key staff remained in post and continued to fulfill the same duties.\nList of commanders.\nChief of the OKW\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| No.\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Portrait\n!

Ref.\nOperations.\nOfficially, the OKW served as the military general staff for the Third Reich, coordinating the efforts of the army, navy, and air force. With the start of World War II, tactical control of the Waffen-SS was exercised by the \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\". In practice, however, Hitler used OKW as his personal military staff, translating his ideas into military orders, such as the \"F\u00fchrer\" Directives, and issuing them to the three services while having little control over them. However, as the war progressed, the OKW found itself exercising increasing amounts of direct command authority over military units, particularly in the west. This created a situation such that by 1942, the OKW held the \"de facto\" command of western forces while the Army High Command directly controlled the Eastern Front. It was not until 28 April 1945 (two days before his suicide) that Hitler placed the OKH directly under the OKW, finally giving the latter full command of Germany's armed forces.\nTrue to his strategy of setting different parts of the Nazi bureaucracy to compete for his favor in areas where their administration overlapped, Hitler ensured there was a rivalry between the OKW and the OKH. Since most German operations during World War II were army-controlled (with support), the OKH demanded control over German military forces. Nevertheless, Hitler decided against the OKH in favor of the OKW overseeing operations in many land theaters, despite being the head of the OKH. As the war progressed, more and more influence moved from the OKH to the OKW, with Norway being the first \"OKW war theater\". More and more areas came under complete control of the OKW. Finally, only the Eastern Front remained the domain of the OKH. However, as the Eastern Front was by far the primary battlefield of the German military, the OKH was still influential.\nThe OKW ran military operations on the Western front, in North Africa, and in Italy. In the west, operations were further split between the OKW and (OBW, Commander in Chief West), who was Gerd von Rundstedt (succeeded by Field Marshal G\u00fcnther von Kluge).\nThere was even more fragmentation since the and operations had their own commands (the (OKM) and the (OKL)) which, while theoretically subordinate, were largely independent from the OKW or the OBW. Further complications in OKW operations also arose in circumstances such as when, on 19 December 1941, Hitler dismissed Walther von Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, after the failure of the Battle of Moscow, and assumed von Brauchitsch's former position, in essence reporting directly to himself, since the Commander-in-Chief of the Army reported to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.\nIn Berlin and K\u00f6nigsberg, the German Army had large \"Fernschreibstelle\" (teleprinter offices) which collected morning messages each day from regional or local centres. They also had a \"Geheimschreibstube\" or cipher room where plaintext messages could be encrypted on Lorenz SZ40/42 machines. If sent by radio rather than landline they were intercepted and decrypted at Bletchley Park in England, where they were known as Fish. Some messages were daily returns, and some were between Hitler and his generals; both were valuable to Allied intelligence.\nInternational Military Tribunal.\nDuring the Nuremberg trials, the OKW was indicted but acquitted of being a criminal organization because of Article 9 of the charter of the International Military Tribunal.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal, the General Staff and High Command is neither an \"organisation\" nor a \"group\"\nAlthough the Tribunal is of the opinion that the term \"group\" in Article 9 must mean something more than this collection of military officers, it has heard much evidence as to the participation of these officers in planning and waging aggressive war, and in committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. This evidence is, as to many of them, clear and convincing.\nThey have been responsible, in large measure, for the miseries and suffering that have fallen on millions of men, women and children. They have been a disgrace to the honourable profession of arms. Without their military guidance, the aggressive ambitions of Hitler and his fellow Nazis would have been academic and sterile. Although they were not a group falling within the words of the Charter, they were certainly a ruthless military caste. The contemporary German militarism flourished briefly with its recent ally, National Socialism, as well as or better than it had in the generations of the past.\nMany of these men have made a mockery of the soldier's oath of obedience to military orders. When it suits their defence they say they had to obey; when confronted with Hitler's brutal crimes, which are shown to have been within their general knowledge, they say they disobeyed. The truth is, they actively participated in all these crimes, or sat silent and acquiescent, witnessing the commission of crimes on a scale larger and more shocking than the world has ever had the misfortune to know. This must be said.\nDespite this, both Keitel and Jodl were convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death by hanging.\nDuring the subsequent High Command Trial in 1947\u201348, fourteen \"Wehrmacht\" officers were charged with war crimes, especially for the Commissar Order to execute Soviet political commissars in occupied territories in the east, the killing of POWs, and participation in the Holocaust. Eleven defendants received prison sentences ranging from three years, including time served, to lifetime imprisonment; two were acquitted on all counts and one committed suicide during the trial.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGlobalSecurity.org(n.d.)

Slovenes living within the former borders of the region still tend to identify with its traditional parts Upper Carniola, Lower Carniola (with the sub-part of White Carniola), and to a lesser degree with Inner Carniola. In 1991, 47% of the population of Slovenia lived within the borders of the former Duchy of Carniola.\nOverview.\nThe March of Carniola was a state of the Holy Roman Empire, established as an immediate territory in the 11th century. From the second half of the 13th century it was ruled by the Habsburgs and its capital was Ljubljana (Laibach); previous overlords had their seats in Kranj (Krainburg) and Kamnik (Stein), which are therefore sometimes referred to as its earlier capitals. In the 14th century the Duchy of Carniola was declared, a status which was formally recognised in the 16th century. As a hereditary possession of the Habsburgs (one of the so-called ), Carniola was part of the Austrian Circle of the Empire from the early 16th century. Informally it was part of Inner Austria. It was subdivided into Upper, Lower, and Inner Carniola.\nIn 1804 it became part of the newly established Austrian Empire and in 1806 the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved. In 1809 it was ceded to the First French Empire, becoming part of the Illyrian Provinces; it was returned to Austria in 1815, forming part of the Kingdom of Illyria. In 1849 Illyria was dissolved and Carniola became a crown land in its own right; the three traditional subdivisions were also abolished. In 1867 it became part of Cisleithania, the Austrian part of Austria-Hungary. It remained so until 1918, when it seceded as part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, becoming part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia); it ceased to exist \"de jure\" with the passing of the Vidovdan Constitution in 1921.\nNowadays, its territory (in the extent at its dissolution) is almost entirely located in Slovenia, except for a small part in Italy, around Fusine in Valromana. Carniola in its final form, established in 1815, encompassed . In 1914, before the beginning of World War I, it had a population of slightly under 530,000, of whom 95% were Slovenes.\nGeography.\nThe region is crossed by the Julian Alps and the Karawanks. The highest mountain peaks are Nanos, ; Vrem\u0161\u010dica, ; Sne\u017enik, ; and Triglav, . The main rivers are the Sava, Tr\u017ei\u010d Bistrica, Kokra, Kamnik Bistrica, Sora, Ljubljanica, Mirna, Krka, and Kolpa rivers. Notable lakes include Black Lake (), Lake Bohinj, Lake Bled, and Lake Cerknica. Nearby is the Ljubljana Marsh, and a series of hot and mineral springs which can be found at Dolenjske Toplice, \u0160marje\u0161ke Toplice, and Izlake.\nAgriculture thrived more in Upper Carniola than in Lower Carniola. The Vipava Valley was especially famous for its wine and vegetables, and for its mild climate. The average temperature was in spring, in summer, in autumn, and in winter.&lt;br&gt;\nIn 1910 the main railroads were the Southern, Prince Rudolf, Bohinj, Kamnik, Lower Carniola, and Vrhnika railroads. The principal cities and towns in the region were Kamnik, Kranj, Tr\u017ei\u010d, Vrhnika, Vipava, Idrija, Turjak, Ribnica, Metlika, Novo Mesto, and Va\u010de.\nHistory.\nOverview.\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, Lombards settled in Carniola, followed by Slavs around the sixth century AD. As a part of the Holy Roman Empire, the area was successively ruled by Bavarian, Frankish and local nobility, and eventually by the Austrian Habsburgs almost continuously from 1335 to 1918, though beset by many raids from the Ottomans and rebellions by local residents against Habsburg rule from the 15th to the 17th centuries. From about 900 AD until the 20th century, Carniola's ruling classes and urban areas spoke German, while the peasantry spoke Slovene.\nThe capital of Carniola, originally located at Kranj (), was briefly moved to Kamnik () and finally to the current capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana ().\nAntiquity and Middle Ages.\nBefore the coming of the Romans (c.\u2009200 BC), the Taurisci dwelt in the north of Carniola, the Pannonians in the southeast, the Iapodes or Carni, a Celtic tribe, in the southwest.\nCarniola formed part of the Roman province of Pannonia; the northern part was joined to Noricum, the south-western and south-eastern parts and the city of Aemona to Venice and Istria. In the time of Augustus all the region from Aemona to the Kolpa River (Culpa) belonged to the province of Savia.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476), Carniola was incorporated into Odoacer's Kingdom of Italy, and then in 493, under Theodoric, it formed part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom. Between the upper Sava and the So\u010da rivers lived the Carni, and towards the end of the sixth century Slavs settled the region called by Latin writers \"Carnia\", or \"Carniola\" meaning 'little Carnia'; i.e., part of greater Carnia. The Latin name was later borrowed into Slavic, becoming \"Kranjska\", and into German as \"Chrainmark, Krain\".\nThe new inhabitants, to whom modern historiography frequently refers to as Alpine Slavs, were subjected to the Avars, but around 623 they joined the Slavic tribal union of Samo. After Samo's death in AD 658, they fell again under the Avar rule, but most probably enjoyed partial autonomy.\nMarch of Carniola.\nCarniola was governed by the Franks about the year 788, and was Christianized by missionaries from the Patriarchate of Aquileia and others. When Charlemagne established the margraviate of Friuli, he added to it a part of Carniola. After the division of Friuli, it became an independent margraviate, having its own Slavic margrave residing at Kranj, subject to the governor of Bavaria at first, and after 976 to the Dukes of Carinthia. Henry IV gave it to the Patriarch of Aquileia (1071) and it formed part of the Patriarchal State of Friuli.\nSeveral sources from the High Middle Ages suggest that there was a common Carantanian (that is, Carinthian) identity that slowly vanished after the 14th century and was replaced by a regional Carniolan identity.\nIn the Middle Ages the Church held much property in Carniola, and thus in 974 in Upper and Lower Carniola the Bishop of Freising became in 974 a feudal lord of the town of \u0160kofja Loka, the Bishop of Brixen held Bled and possessions in the Bohinj Valley, and the Bishop of Lavant received Mokronog.\nAmong secular potentates, the Dukes of Meran, Gorizia, Babenberg, and Zilli held possessions given to them in fief by the patriarchs of Aquileia. The dukes governed the province for nearly half a century.\nFinally Carniola was given in fief with the consent of the patriarch to Frederick II of Austria, who obtained the title of duke in 1245. Frederick was succeeded by Ulrich III, Duke of Carinthia, who married Agnes of Andechs, a relative of the patriarch, and he endowed the churches and monasteries, established the government mint at the town of Kostanjevica, and finally (in 1268) willed to Ottokar II, King of Bohemia, all his possessions and the government of Carinthia and Carniola.\nDuchy of Carniola.\nOttokar was defeated by Rudolph I of Germany, and at the meeting at Augsburg in 1282, he gave in fief to his sons Albrecht and Rudolf the province of Carniola, but it was leased to Meinhard, count of Gorizia-Tirol. Duke Henry of Carinthia claimed Carniola; and the Dukes of Austria asserted their claim as successors to the Bohemian kingdom. When Henry died in 1335, King John of Bohemia renounced his claims, and Albrecht, Duke of Austria, received Carniola; it was proclaimed a duchy by Rudolf IV, in 1364. Emperor Frederick III united Upper, Lower, and Central Carniola as Metlika and Pivka into one duchy. The union of the dismembered parts was completed by 1607.\nFrench Intermezzo.\nFrench revolutionary troops occupied Carniola in 1797, and from 1805 to 1806. Under the Treaty of Vienna, Carniola became part of the Illyrian provinces of France (1809\u20131814), with Ljubljana as its capital, and Carniola formed a part of the new territory from 1809 to 1813.\nThe defeat of Napoleon restored Carniola to Austrian Emperor Francis I, with larger boundaries, but at the extinction of the Illyrian Kingdom Carniola was confined to the limits outlined at the Congress of Vienna, 1815. From 1816 to 1849 Carniola was part of the Austrian Kingdom of Illyria with capital in Ljubljana.\nEcclesiastical history.\nIn early Christian times the duchy was under the jurisdiction of the metropolitans of Aquileia (who became Patriarchs), Syrmium, and Salona. In consequence of the immigration of the pagan Slovenes, this arrangement was not a lasting one. After they had embraced Christianity in the seventh and eighth centuries Charlemagne conferred the major part of Carniola on the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and the remainder on the Diocese of Trieste. In 1100 that patriarchate was divided into five archdeaconries, of which Krain was one.\nThe diocese of Ljubljana or Laibach was established by Emperor Frederick III on 6 December 1461. It was directly subject to the pope. This was confirmed by a Bull of Pope Pius II, 10 September 1462. The new diocese consisted of part of Upper Carniola, two parishes in Lower Carniola, and a portion of Lower Styria and Carinthia; the remaining portion of Carniola was attached to Aquileia, later on to Gorizia and Trieste. At the redistribution of dioceses (1787 to 1791) not all the parishes in Carniola were included in the Diocese of Ljubljana, but this was accomplished in 1833, by taking two deaneries from the Diocese of Trieste, one from Gorizia, and one parish from the Diocese of Lavant, so as to include all the territory within the political boundaries of the crownland.\nAustrian administration.\nThe Austrian Empire reorganized the territory in 1849 as a duchy and a Cisleithanian crownland in Austria-Hungary known as the Duchy of Carniola. It was bounded on the north by Carinthia, on the north-east by Styria, on the south-east and south by Croatia, and on the west by Trieste, Goritza, and Istria; with area of and population of 510,000. The capital, Ljubljana, was the see of a prince-bishop, population, 40,000; it was known to the Romans as Aemona, and was destroyed by Obri in the sixth century. Carniola was divided into Upper Carniola (Slovenian name: Gorenjska), Lower Carniola (Slovenian: Dolenjska), and Inner Carniola (Slovenian: Notranjska). Politically the province was divided into eleven districts consisting of 359 municipalities; the provincial capital was the residence of the imperial governor. The districts were: Kamnik, Kranj, Radovljica, the neighbourhood of Ljubljana, Logatec, Postojna, Litija, Krsko, Novo Mesto, Crnomelj, and Gotschee or Kocevje. There were 31 judicial circuits.\nThe duchy was constituted by rescript of 20 December 1860, and by imperial patent of 26 February 1861, modified by legislation of 21 December 1867, granting power to the home parliament to enact all laws not reserved to the imperial diet, at which it was represented by eleven delegates, of whom two elected by the landowners, three by the cities, towns, commercial and industrial boards, five by the village communes, and one by a fifth curia by secret ballot, every duly registered male twenty-four years of age has the right to vote. The home legislature consisted of a single chamber of thirty-seven members, among whom the prince-bishop sits ex-officio. The emperor convened the legislature, and it is presided over by the governor. The landed interests elected ten members, the cities and towns eight, the commercial and industrial boards two, the village communes sixteen. In 1907, instead of these rules, universal and equal suffrage for all men was introduced. The business of the chamber was restricted to legislating on agriculture, public and charitable institutions, administration of communes, church and school affairs, the transportation and housing of soldiers in war and during manoeuvres, and other local matters. The land budget of 1901 amounted to 3,573,280 crowns ($714,656).\nModern era.\nIn 1918, the duchy ceased to exist and its territory became part of the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and subsequently part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). The western part of the duchy, with the towns of Postojna, Ilirska Bistrica, Idrija, and \u0160turje, was annexed to Italy in 1920, but was subsequently also included in Yugoslavia in 1947. Since 1991, the region has been part of an independent Slovenia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53897", "revid": "1398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53897", "title": "Doric order", "text": "Order of classical architecture\nThe Doric order is one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian. The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of the columns. Originating in the western Doric region of Greece, it is the earliest and, in its essence, the simplest of the orders, though still with complex details in the entablature above.\nThe Greek Doric column was fluted, and had no base, dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood. The capital was a simple circular form, with some mouldings, under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions, but later more restrained. Above a plain architrave, the complexity comes in the frieze, where the two features originally unique to the Doric, the triglyph and gutta, are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples. In stone they are purely ornamental.\nThe relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these, and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament, as well as often using plain columns. More often they used versions of the Tuscan order, elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers, which is in effect a simplified Doric, with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae. The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards; often earlier Greek versions were used, with wider columns and no bases to them.\nThe ancient architect and architectural historian Vitruvius associates the Doric with masculine proportions (the Ionic representing the feminine). It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use. When the three orders are superposed, it is usual for the Doric to be at the bottom, with the Ionic and then the Corinthian above, and the Doric, as \"strongest\", is often used on the ground floor below another order in the storey above.\nHistory.\nGreek.\nIn their original Greek version, Doric columns stood directly on the flat pavement (the \"stylobate\") of a temple without a base. With a height only four to eight times their diameter, the columns were the most squat of all the classical orders; their vertical shafts were fluted with 20\u00a0parallel concave grooves, each rising to a sharp edge called an arris. They were topped by a smooth capital that flared from the column to meet a square abacus at the intersection with the horizontal beam (architrave) that they carried.\nThe Parthenon is in the Doric order, and in antiquity and subsequently has been recognized as the most perfect example of the evolved order. It was most popular in the Archaic Period (750\u2013480 BC) in mainland Greece, and also found in Magna Graecia (southern Italy), as in the three temples at Paestum. These are in Archaic Doric, where the capitals spread wide from the column compared to later Classical forms, as exemplified in the Parthenon.\nPronounced features of both Greek and Roman versions of the Doric order are the alternating triglyphs and metopes. The triglyphs are decoratively grooved with two vertical grooves (\"tri-glyph\") and represent the original wooden end-beams, which rest on the plain architrave that occupies the lower half of the entablature. Under each triglyph are peglike \"stagons\" or \"guttae\" (literally: drops) that appear as if they were hammered in from below to stabilize the post-and-beam (trabeated) construction. They also served to \"organize\" rainwater runoff from above. The spaces between the triglyphs are the \"metopes\". They may be left plain, or they may be carved in low relief.\nSpacing the triglyphs.\nThe spacing of the triglyphs caused problems which took some time to resolve. A triglyph is centered above every column, with another (or sometimes two) between columns, though the Greeks felt that the corner triglyph should form the corner of the entablature, creating an inharmonious mismatch with the supporting column.\nThe architecture followed rules of harmony. Since the original design probably came from wooden temples and the triglyphs were real heads of wooden beams, every column had to bear a beam which lay across the centre of the column. Triglyphs were arranged regularly; the last triglyph was centred upon the last column (\"illustration, right: I.\"). This was regarded as the ideal solution which had to be reached.\nChanging to stone cubes instead of wooden beams required full support of the architrave load at the last column. At the first temples the final triglyph was moved (\"illustration, right: II.), still terminating the sequence, but leaving a gap disturbing the regular order. Even worse, the last triglyph was not centered with the corresponding column. That \"archaic\" manner was not regarded as a harmonious design. The resulting problem is called the doric corner conflict. Another approach was to apply a broader corner triglyph\u00a0(III.\") but was not really satisfying.\nBecause the metopes are somewhat flexible in their proportions, the modular space between columns (\"intercolumniation\") can be adjusted by the architect. Often the last two columns were set slightly closer together (\"corner contraction\"), to give a subtle visual strengthening to the corners. That is called the \"classic\" solution of the corner conflict\u00a0(IV.). Triglyphs could be arranged in a harmonic manner again, and the corner was terminated with a triglyph, though the final triglyph and column were often not centered. Roman aesthetics did not demand that a triglyph form the corner, and filled it with a half (\"demi\"-) metope, allowing triglyphs centered over columns (\"illustration, right, V.\").\nTemples.\nThere are many theories as to the origins of the Doric order in temples. The term Doric is believed to have originated from the Greek-speaking Dorian tribes. One belief is that the Doric order is the result of early wood prototypes of previous temples. With no hard proof and the sudden appearance of stone temples from one period after the other, this becomes mostly speculation. Another belief is that the Doric was inspired by the architecture of Egypt. With the Greeks being present in Ancient Egypt as soon the 7th-century BC, it is possible that Greek traders were inspired by the structures they saw in what they would consider foreign land. Finally, another theory states that the inspiration for the Doric came from Mycenae. At the ruins of this civilization lies architecture very similar to the Doric order. It is also in Greece, which would make it very accessible.\nSome of the earliest examples of the Doric order come from the 7th-century BC. These examples include the Temple of Apollo at Corinth and the Temple of Zeus at Nemea. Other examples of the Doric order include the three 6th-century BC temples at Paestum in southern Italy, a region called Magna Graecia, which was settled by Greek colonists. Compared to later versions, the columns are much more massive, with a strong entasis or swelling, and wider capitals.\nThe Temple of the Delians is a \"peripteral\" Doric order temple, the largest of three dedicated to Apollo on the island of Delos. It was begun in 478 BC and never completely finished. During their period of independence from Athens, the Delians reassigned the temple to the island of Poros. It is \"hexastyle\", with six columns across the pedimented end and thirteen along each long face. All the columns are centered under a triglyph in the frieze, except for the corner columns. The plain, unfluted shafts on the columns stand directly on the platform (the \"stylobate\"), without bases. The recessed \"necking\" in the nature of fluting at the top of the shafts and the wide cushionlike echinus may be interpreted as slightly self-conscious archaising features, for Delos is Apollo's ancient birthplace. However, the similar fluting at the base of the shafts might indicate an intention for the plain shafts to be capable of wrapping in drapery.\nA classic statement of the Greek Doric order is the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, built about 447 BC. The contemporary Parthenon, the largest temple in classical Athens, is also in the Doric order, although the sculptural enrichment is more familiar in the Ionic order: the Greeks were never as doctrinaire in the use of the Classical vocabulary as Renaissance theorists or Neoclassical architects. The detail, part of the basic vocabulary of trained architects from the later 18th century onwards, shows how the width of the metopes was flexible: here they bear the famous sculptures including the battle of Lapiths and Centaurs.\nRoman.\nIn the Roman Doric version, the height of the entablature has been reduced. The endmost triglyph is centered over the column rather than occupying the corner of the architrave. The columns are slightly less robust in their proportions. Below their caps, an astragal molding encircles the column like a ring. Crown moldings soften transitions between frieze and cornice and emphasize the upper edge of the abacus, which is the upper part of the capital.\nRoman Doric columns also have moldings at their bases and stand on low square pads or are even raised on plinths. In the Roman Doric mode, columns are not usually fluted; indeed, fluting is rare. Since the Romans did not insist on a triglyph covered corner, now both columns and triglyphs could be arranged equidistantly again and centered together. The architrave corner needed to be left \"blank\", which is sometimes referred to as a half, or \"demi-\", metope (\"illustration, V., in Spacing the Columns above\").\nThe Roman architect Vitruvius, following contemporary practice, outlined in his treatise the procedure for laying out constructions based on a module, which he took to be one half a column's diameter, taken at the base. An illustration of Andrea Palladio's Doric order, as it was laid out, with modules identified, by Isaac Ware, in \"The Four Books of Palladio's Architecture\" (London, 1738) is illustrated at Vitruvian module.\nAccording to Vitruvius, the height of Doric columns is six or seven times the diameter at the base. This gives the Doric columns a shorter, thicker look than Ionic columns, which have 8:1 proportions. It is suggested that these proportions give the Doric columns a masculine appearance, whereas the more slender Ionic columns appear to represent a more feminine look. This sense of masculinity and femininity was often used to determine which type of column would be used for a particular structure.\nLater periods reviving classical architecture used the Roman Doric until Neoclassical architecture arrived in the later 18th century. This followed the first good illustrations and measured descriptions of Greek Doric buildings. The most influential, and perhaps the earliest, use of the Doric in Renaissance architecture was in the circular \"Tempietto\" by Donato Bramante (1502 or later), in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio, Rome.\nModern.\nBefore Greek Revival architecture grew, initially in England, in the 18th century, the Greek or elaborated Roman Doric order had not been very widely used, though \"Tuscan\" types of round capitals were always popular, especially in less formal buildings. It was sometimes used in military contexts, for example the Royal Hospital Chelsea (1682 onwards, by Christopher Wren). The first engraved illustrations of the Greek Doric order dated to the mid-18th century. Its appearance in the new phase of Classicism brought with it new connotations of high-minded primitive simplicity, seriousness of purpose, noble sobriety.\nIn Germany it suggested a contrast with the French, and in the United States republican virtues. In a customs house, Greek Doric suggested incorruptibility; in a Protestant church a Greek Doric porch promised a return to an untainted early church; it was equally appropriate for a library, a bank or a trustworthy public utility. The revived Doric did not return to Sicily until 1789, when a French architect researching the ancient Greek temples designed an entrance to the Botanical Gardens in Palermo.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the Olympic Games, first held in modern times in 1896 in Athens, Greece, and inspired by the Ancient Olympic Games, one of a number of such events held in antiquity. Most modern multi-sport events have the same basic structure. Games are held over the \ncourse of several days in and around a \"host city\", which changes for each competition. Countries send national teams to each competition, consisting of individual athletes and teams that compete in a wide variety of sports. Athletes or teams are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for first, second and third place respectively. Each game is generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.\nHistory.\nThe Ancient Olympic Games, first held in 776 BC, was the precursor to the Modern Olympic Games, although its first edition only featured a footrace and the number of sporting competitions expanded at later editions.\nThere were several other \"games\" held in Europe in the classical era:\nOther multi-sport festivals emerged in the Middle Ages in Europe, including the Cotswold Olimpick Games in England in the 1600s, the Highland Games in Scotland, and the Olympiade de la R\u00e9publique in France in the 1800s.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, athletes at multi-sport events were almost exclusively male. As international women's sport began to develop, events such as the Women's World Games and Olympics of Grace were held to allow women to engage in sport on the international stage. Though short-lived, events such as these led to greater inclusion of women at multi-sport events over the course of the 20th century.\nAlthough the modern tradition commemorates the 1921 revolution, the Naadam festival in Mongolia is a continuation of ancient sporting practises amongst Mongolians. The three events of wrestling, horse racing and archery are thought to date back centuries and represent the three most important pursuits of a strong man in nomadic society. Alongside these sporting events there are other cultural activities such as dances and parades.\nAudience.\nSince the establishment of the Olympics, most serial multi-sport events have been organized for specific audiences and participating countries or communities. These affiliations include:\nHistoric events.\nOlympic Games.\nThe first modern multi-sport event organised were the Olympic Games, organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) (est. 1894) for the first time in 1896 in Athens, Greece. After some celebrations (1900, 1904), the Olympics became very popular nowadays. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.\nParalympic Games.\nThe Paralympic Games is the largest multi-sport event involving athletes with physical disabilities and is organized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Arranged for the first time in 1960 in Rome, Italy. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.\nSpecial Olympics.\nThe first Special Olympics International Summer Games were held in Chicago, Illinois, in 1968. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games in Schladming, Austria involved 25 sports and approximately 2,277 athletes from 133 countries. \nOthers.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, another multi-sport event, the Nordic Games were first held. These Games were held in Scandinavia, and the sports conducted were winter sports such as cross-country skiing and speed skating. The Nordic Games were last held in 1926, after which the 1924 Winter Sports Week in Chamonix was declared the first Olympic Winter Games.\nIn the 1920s, all kinds of other multi-sport events were set up. These were usually directed for a selected group of athletes, rather than everybody, which was the case with the Olympic Games. The Soviets organized the first Spartakiad in 1920, a communist alternative to the 'bourgeois' Olympic Games, and in 1922 the University Olympia was organizedor in Italy, the forerunner of the World University Games, meant for students only.\nRegional games were another kind of multi-sport event that was established, such as the Far Eastern Championship Games (1913), the Central American and Caribbean Games (1926) or the Pan American Games (1951).\nList of international multi-sport competitions.\nThe Olympic Games are still the largest multi-sport event in the world in terms of worldwide interest and importance (though no longer in participation), but several others also have significance.\nDisability.\nOther Games are intended for handicapped or disabled athletes. The International Silent Games, first held in Paris in 1924, were the first Games for deaf athletes. The Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games, incepted in 1948 in England, were the first Games for wheelchair athletes. In 1960, the first Paralympic Games were held, connected with the Olympic Games. The Special Olympics World Games, for athletes with intellectual disabilities, were first held in 1968.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Chancellor Adolf Hitler, urged on by Hermann G\u00f6ring and Heinrich Himmler, ordered a series of extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate his power and alleviate the German military's concerns about the role of Ernst R\u00f6hm and the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA), the Nazis' paramilitary organization, known colloquially as \"Brownshirts\". Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent coup by the SA under R\u00f6hm\u2014the so-called \"R\u00f6hm Putsch\".\nThe primary instruments of Hitler's action were the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) paramilitary force under Himmler and its Security Service (SD), and the Gestapo (secret police) under Reinhard Heydrich, which between them carried out most of the killings. G\u00f6ring's personal police battalion also took part. Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA, the best-known being R\u00f6hm himself, the SA's chief of staff and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party, including its leader Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had helped suppress Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public increasingly critical of thuggish SA tactics.\nHitler saw the SA's independence and its members' penchant for street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power. He also wanted to appease leaders of the \"Reichswehr\", the German military, who feared and despised the SA as a potential rival, in particular because of R\u00f6hm's ambition to merge the army and the SA under his leadership. Additionally, Hitler was uncomfortable with R\u00f6hm's outspoken support for a \"second revolution\" to redistribute wealth. In R\u00f6hm's view, President Paul von Hindenburg's appointment of Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933 had brought the Nazi Party to power but had left the party's larger goals unfulfilled. Finally, Hitler used the purge to attack or eliminate German critics of his new regime, especially those loyal to Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, and to settle scores with enemies.\nAt least 85 people died during the purge, although the final death toll may have been higher, with some estimates running from 700 to 1,000. More than 1,000 perceived opponents were arrested. The purge strengthened and consolidated the military's support for Hitler. It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazis, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extrajudicial killings to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. The Night of the Long Knives marked Hitler's absolute consolidation of judicial power and was a turning point in the establishment of Nazi Germany. Hitler went on to call himself \"the administrator of justice of the German people\" in his speech to the Reichstag on July 13, 1934.\nHitler and the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA).\nPresident Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933. Over the following few months, during the so-called \"Gleichschaltung\", Hitler dispensed with the need for the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic as a legislative body and eliminated all rival political parties in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a one-party state under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected veteran field marshal. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to conscription, and a more aggressive foreign policy, the army continued to guard its traditions of independence during the early years of the Nazi regime.\nTo a lesser extent, the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA), a Nazi paramilitary organization, remained somewhat autonomous within the party. The SA evolved out of the remnants of the \"Freikorps\" movement of the post-World War I years. The \"Freikorps\" were nationalistic organizations primarily composed of disaffected, disenchanted, and angry German combat veterans utilized by the government in January 1919 to deal with the threat of a Communist revolution when it appeared that there was a lack of loyal troops. A very large number of the \"Freikorps\" believed that the November Revolution had betrayed them when Germany was alleged to be on the verge of victory in 1918. Hence, the \"Freikorps\" were in opposition to the new Weimar Republic, which was born as a result of the November Revolution, and whose founders were contemptuously called \"November criminals\". Captain Ernst R\u00f6hm of the \"Reichswehr\" served as the liaison with the Bavarian Freikorps. R\u00f6hm was given the nickname \"The Machine Gun King of Bavaria\" in the early 1920s, since he was responsible for storing and issuing illegal machine guns to the Bavarian Freikorps units. R\u00f6hm left the \"Reichswehr\" in 1923 and later became commander of the SA. During the 1920s and 1930s, the SA functioned as a private militia used by Hitler to intimidate rivals and disrupt the meetings of competing political parties, especially those of the Social Democrats and the Communists. Also known as the \"brownshirts\" or \"stormtroopers\", the SA became notorious for their street battles with the Communists. The violent confrontations between the two contributed to the destabilization of the Weimar Republic. In June 1932, one of the worst months of political violence, there were more than 400 street battles, resulting in 82 deaths.\nHitler's appointment as chancellor, followed by the suppression of all political parties except the Nazis, did not end the violence of the stormtroopers. Deprived of Communist party meetings to disrupt, the stormtroopers would sometimes run riot in the streets after a night of drinking; they would attack passers-by and then attack the police who were called to stop them. Complaints of \"overbearing and loutish\" behaviour by stormtroopers became common by the middle of 1933. The Foreign Office even complained of instances where brownshirts manhandled foreign diplomats\nOn 6 July 1933, at a gathering of high-ranking Nazi officials, Hitler declared the success of the National Socialist, or Nazi, seizure of power. Now that the Nazi Party had seized the reins of power in Germany, he said, it was time to consolidate its control. Hitler told the gathered officials, \"The stream of revolution has been undammed, but it must be channelled into the secure bed of evolution.\"\nHitler's speech signalled his intention to rein in the SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. Hitler's task would not be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively\u00a0\u2013 or even primarily\u00a0\u2013 a working-class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.\nThe action Hitler took would not only defang R\u00f6hm and the SA as a potential threat to Hitler's personal control of the Nazi Party, but would also serve to strengthen his relationship with the Wehrmacht \u2013 the German armed forces \u2013 which had long considered the SA to be their primary rival, the SA at times outnumbering the military in manpower.\nThe supporters of Ernst R\u00f6hm (R\u00f6hm-cult), like the Strasserists, formed one of the ideological factions of the Nazi Party at that time.\nConflict between the army and the SA.\nNo one in the SA spoke more loudly for \"a continuation of the German revolution\" (as one prominent stormtrooper, Edmund Heines, put it) than R\u00f6hm himself. R\u00f6hm, as one of the earliest members of the Nazi Party, had participated in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt by Hitler to seize power by force in 1923. A combat veteran of World War I, R\u00f6hm had recently boasted that he would execute 12 men in retaliation for the killing of any stormtrooper.\nNot content solely with the leadership of the SA, R\u00f6hm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by the conservative General Werner von Blomberg. Although nicknamed the \"Rubber Lion\" by some of his critics in the army for his devotion to Hitler, Blomberg was not a Nazi, and therefore represented a bridge between the army and the party. Blomberg and many of his fellow officers were recruited from the Prussian nobility and regarded the SA as a plebeian rabble that threatened the army's traditional high status in German society.\nIf the regular army showed contempt for the masses belonging to the SA, many stormtroopers returned the feeling, seeing the army as insufficiently committed to the National Socialist dictatorship. Max Heydebreck, an SA leader in Rummelsburg, denounced the army to his fellow brownshirts, telling them, \"Some of the officers of the army are swine. Most officers are too old and have to be replaced by young ones. We want to wait till Papa Hindenburg is dead, and then the SA will march against the army.\"\nDespite such hostility between the brownshirts and the regular army, Blomberg and others in the military saw the SA as a source of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalized army. R\u00f6hm, however, wanted to eliminate the generalship of the Prussian aristocracy altogether, using the SA to become the core of a new German military. With the army limited by the Treaty of Versailles to one hundred thousand soldiers, its leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934. In January 1934, R\u00f6hm presented Blomberg with a memorandum demanding that the SA replace the regular army as the nation's ground forces, and that the Reichswehr become a training adjunct to the SA.\nIn response, Hitler met Blomberg and the leadership of the SA and SS on 28 February 1934. Under pressure from Hitler, R\u00f6hm reluctantly signed a pledge stating that he recognised the supremacy of the Reichswehr over the SA. Hitler announced to those present that the SA would act as an auxiliary to the Reichswehr, not the other way around. After Hitler and most of the army officers had left, however, R\u00f6hm declared that he would not take instructions from \"the ridiculous corporal\"\u00a0\u2013 a demeaning reference to Hitler. While Hitler did not take immediate action against R\u00f6hm for his intemperate outburst, it nonetheless deepened the rift between them.\nGrowing pressure against the SA.\nDespite his earlier agreement with Hitler, R\u00f6hm still clung to his vision of a new German army with the SA at its core. By early 1934, this vision directly conflicted with Hitler's plan to consolidate power and expand the Reichswehr. Because their plans for the army conflicted, R\u00f6hm's success could come only at Hitler's expense. Moreover, it was not just the Reichswehr that viewed the SA as a threat. Several of Hitler's lieutenants feared R\u00f6hm's growing power and restlessness, as did Hitler. As a result, a political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including Prussian premier Hermann G\u00f6ring, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler, and Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess, positioning themselves against R\u00f6hm. While all of these men were veterans of the Nazi movement, only R\u00f6hm continued to demonstrate his independence from, rather than his loyalty to, Adolf Hitler. R\u00f6hm's contempt for the party's bureaucracy angered Hess. SA violence in Prussia gravely concerned G\u00f6ring.\nFinally, in early 1934, the growing rift between R\u00f6hm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state led former chancellor General Kurt von Schleicher to start playing politics again. Schleicher criticized the current Hitler cabinet, while some of Schleicher's followers such as General Ferdinand von Bredow and Werner von Alvensleben started passing along lists of a new Hitler cabinet in which Schleicher would become vice-chancellor, R\u00f6hm minister of defence, Heinrich Br\u00fcning foreign minister and Gregor Strasser minister of national economy. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a \"lack of discretion\" that was \"terrifying\" as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested. Although Schleicher was in fact unimportant by 1934, increasingly wild rumours that he was scheming with R\u00f6hm to re-enter the corridors of power helped stoke the sense of crisis.\nAs a means of isolating R\u00f6hm, on 20 April 1934, G\u00f6ring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who, G\u00f6ring believed, could be counted on to move against R\u00f6hm. Himmler named his deputy Reinhard Heydrich to head the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Himmler envied the independence and power of the SA, although by this time he and Heydrich had already begun restructuring the SS from a bodyguard formation for Nazi leaders (and a subset of the SA) into its own independent elite corps, one loyal to both himself and Hitler. The loyalty of the SS men would prove useful to both when Hitler finally chose to move against R\u00f6hm and the SA. By May, lists of those to be \"liquidated\" started to circulate amongst G\u00f6ring and Himmler's people, who engaged in a trade, adding enemies of one in exchange for sparing friends of the other. At the end of May, Br\u00fcning and Schleicher, two former chancellors, received warnings from friends in the \"Reichswehr\" that their lives were in danger and they should leave Germany at once. Br\u00fcning fled to the Netherlands while Schleicher dismissed the tip-off as a bad practical joke. By the beginning of June everything was set and all that was needed was permission from Hitler.\nDemands for Hitler to constrain the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure to reduce the influence of the SA and to move against R\u00f6hm. While R\u00f6hm's homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on 15 June. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Mei\u00dfner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell\u00a0\u2013 without Hitler's knowledge\u00a0\u2013 to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the June 1924 kidnapping and murder of Italian socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti as an example of the kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.\nOn 17 June 1934, conservative demands for Hitler to act came to a head when Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, confidant of the ailing Hindenburg, gave a speech at Marburg University warning of the threat of a \"second revolution\". According to his memoirs, von Papen, a Catholic aristocrat with ties to army and industry, privately threatened to resign if Hitler did not act. While von Papen's resignation as vice-chancellor would not have threatened Hitler's position, it would have nonetheless been an embarrassing display of independence from a leading conservative.\nHeydrich and Himmler.\nIn response to conservative pressure to constrain R\u00f6hm, Hitler left for Neudeck to meet with Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the president, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against R\u00f6hm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the \"Reichswehr\" if Hitler did not take immediate steps against R\u00f6hm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against R\u00f6hm, in part due to R\u00f6hm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. The threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying R\u00f6hm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and G\u00f6ring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by R\u00f6hm's downfall\u00a0\u2013 the independence of the SS for Himmler and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for G\u00f6ring.\nIn preparation for the purge, both Himmler and Heydrich assembled a dossier of manufactured evidence to suggest that R\u00f6hm had been paid 12 million\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 (EUR in 2021) by France to overthrow Hitler. Leading officers in the SS were shown falsified evidence on 24 June that R\u00f6hm planned to use the SA to launch a plot against the government (). R\u00f6hm's homosexuality was used against him. In addition, R\u00f6hm and other SA leaders were accused of debauchery and acts of drunkenness. At Hitler's direction, G\u00f6ring, Himmler, Heydrich, and Victor Lutze drew up lists of people in and outside the SA to be killed. One of the men G\u00f6ring recruited to assist him was Willi Lehmann, a Gestapo official and NKVD spy. On 25 June, General Werner von Fritsch placed the \"Reichswehr\" on the highest level of alert. On 27 June, Hitler moved to secure the army's cooperation. Blomberg and General Walther von Reichenau, the army's liaison to the party, gave it to him by expelling R\u00f6hm from the German Officers' League. On 28 June Hitler went to Essen to attend the wedding celebration and reception of Josef Terboven; from there he called R\u00f6hm's adjutant at Bad Wiessee and ordered SA leaders to meet with him on 30 June at 11:00. On 29 June, a signed article in \"V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter\" by Blomberg appeared in which Blomberg stated with great fervour that the \"Reichswehr\" stood behind Hitler.\nPurge.\nAt about 04:30 on 30 June 1934, Hitler and his entourage flew to Munich. From the airport they drove to the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they assembled the leaders of an SA rampage that had taken place in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of SA-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\" August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst R\u00f6hm and his followers were staying.\nWith Hitler's arrival in Bad Wiessee between 06:00 and 07:00, the SA leadership, still in bed, were taken by surprise. SS men stormed the hotel, and Hitler personally placed R\u00f6hm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest.\nThe SS found Breslau SA leader Edmund Heines in bed with an unidentified eighteen-year-old male SA senior troop leader. Hitler ordered both Heines and his partner taken outside the hotel and shot. Goebbels emphasised this aspect in subsequent propaganda justifying the purge as a crackdown on moral turpitude. Meanwhile, the SS arrested the other SA leaders as they left their train for the planned meeting with R\u00f6hm and Hitler.\nAlthough Hitler presented no evidence of a plot by R\u00f6hm to overthrow the regime, he nevertheless denounced the leadership of the SA. Arriving back at party headquarters in Munich, Hitler addressed the assembled crowd. Consumed with rage, Hitler denounced \"the worst treachery in world history\". Hitler told the crowd that \"undisciplined and disobedient characters and asocial or diseased elements\" would be annihilated. The crowd, which included party members and many SA members fortunate enough to escape arrest, shouted its approval. Hess, present among the assembled, even volunteered to shoot the \"traitors\". Joseph Goebbels, who had been with Hitler at Bad Wiessee, set the final phase of the plan in motion. Upon returning to Berlin, Goebbels telephoned G\u00f6ring at 10:00 with the codeword to let loose the execution squads on the rest of their unsuspecting victims. Sepp Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the \"Leibstandarte\" to form an \"execution squad\" and go to Stadelheim Prison where certain SA leaders were being held. There in the prison courtyard, the \"Leibstandarte\" firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel. Those not immediately executed were taken back to the \"Leibstandarte\" barracks at Lichterfelde, given one-minute \"trials\", and shot by a firing squad.\nAgainst conservatives and old enemies.\nThe regime did not limit itself to a purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled prominent Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on G\u00f6ring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen's Marburg speech, and disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch. The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests that he could not be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticize the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.\nHitler and Himmler unleashed the Gestapo against old enemies as well. Both Kurt von Schleicher, Hitler's predecessor as Chancellor, and his wife were murdered at their home. Others killed included Gregor Strasser, a former Nazi who had angered Hitler by resigning from the party in 1932, and Gustav Ritter von Kahr, the former Bavarian state commissioner who had helped crush the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The murdered included at least one accidental victim: Willi Schmid, the music critic of the newspaper, whose name was confused with one of the Gestapo's intended targets. As Himmler's adjutant Karl Wolff later explained, friendship and personal loyalty were not allowed to stand in the way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Among others, a charming fellow [named] Karl von Spreti, R\u00f6hm's personal adjutant. He held the same position with R\u00f6hm as I held with Himmler. [He] died with words \"Heil Hitler\" on his lips. We were close personal friends; we often dined together in Berlin. He lifted his arm in the Nazi salute and called out \"Heil Hitler, I love Germany.\"\nSome SA members died saying \"Heil Hitler\" because they believed that an anti-Hitler SS plot had led to their execution. Several leaders of the disbanded Catholic Centre Party were also murdered in the purge. The Party had generally been aligned with the Social Democrats and Catholic Church during the rise of Nazism, being critical of Nazi ideology, but voting nonetheless for the Enabling Act of 1933 which granted Hitler dictatorial authority.\nKurt L\u00fcdecke, a party associate of R\u00f6hm, was imprisoned but escaped after eight months in a concentration camp. He later wrote \"I Knew Hitler: The Story of a Nazi Who Escaped the Blood-Purge,\" published in 1937 by Scribners of New York, United States.\nR\u00f6hm's fate.\nR\u00f6hm was held briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler considered his future. On 1 July, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michael Lippert visited R\u00f6hm. Once inside R\u00f6hm's cell, they handed him a Browning pistol loaded with a single cartridge and told him he had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. R\u00f6hm demurred, telling them, \"If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself.\" Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to R\u00f6hm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot R\u00f6hm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for R\u00f6hm's murder. Until then, Lippert had been one of the few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.\nAftermath.\nGiven that the purge claimed the lives of so many prominent Germans, it could hardly be kept secret. At first, its architects seemed split on how to handle the event. G\u00f6ring instructed police stations to burn \"all documents concerning the action of the past two days\". Meanwhile, Goebbels tried to prevent newspapers from publishing lists of the dead, but at the same time used a 2 July radio address to describe how Hitler had narrowly prevented R\u00f6hm from overthrowing the government and throwing the country into turmoil. Then, on 13 July 1934, Hitler justified the purge in a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If anyone reproaches me and asks why I did not resort to the regular courts of justice, then all I can say is this. In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German people, and thereby I became the supreme judge of the German people. I gave the order to shoot the ringleaders in this treason, and I further gave the order to cauterise down to the raw flesh the ulcers of this poisoning of the wells in our domestic life. Let the nation know that its existence\u00a0\u2013 which depends on its internal order and security\u00a0\u2013 cannot be threatened with impunity by anyone! And let it be known for all time to come that if anyone raises his hand to strike the State, then certain death is his lot.\nWanting to present the massacre as legally sanctioned, Hitler had the cabinet approve a measure on 3 July that declared, \"The measures taken on June 30, July 1 and 2 to suppress treasonous assaults are legal as acts of self-defence by the State.\" Reich Justice Minister Franz G\u00fcrtner, a conservative who had been Bavarian Justice Minister in the years of the Weimar Republic, demonstrated his loyalty to the new regime by drafting the statute, which added a legal veneer to the purge. Signed into law by Hitler, G\u00fcrtner, and Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, the \"Law Regarding Measures of State Self-Defence\" retroactively legalized the murders committed during the purge. Germany's legal establishment further capitulated to the regime when the country's leading legal scholar, Carl Schmitt, wrote an article defending Hitler's 13 July speech. It was named \"Der F\u00fchrer sch\u00fctzt das Recht\" (\"The F\u00fchrer Upholds the Law\").\nA special fund administered by SS General Franz Breithaupt was set up for the relatives of the murdered, from which they were cared for at the expense of the state. The widows of the murdered SA leaders received between 1,000 and 1,600 marks a month, depending on the rank of the murdered person. Kurt von Schleicher's stepdaughter received 250 marks per month up to the age of 21, and the son of General von Bredow received a monthly allowance of 150 marks.\nReaction.\nThe army almost unanimously applauded the Night of the Long Knives, even though the generals Kurt von Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow were among the victims. A telegram purportedly from the ailing Hindenburg, Germany's highly revered military hero, expressed his \"profoundly felt gratitude\", and congratulated Hitler for \"nipping treason in the bud\", although Hermann G\u00f6ring later admitted during the Nuremberg trials that the telegram was never seen by Hindenburg, and was actually written by the Nazis. General von Reichenau went so far as to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on 13 July justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with R\u00f6hm to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France. Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet, and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it; nevertheless Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet was not declared \"persona non grata\" as would have been usual if an ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government.\nThe army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army, but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime. One retired captain, Erwin Planck, seemed to realize this: \"If you look on without lifting a finger\", he said to his friend, General Werner von Fritsch, \"you will meet the same fate sooner or later.\" Another rare exception was Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.\nRumours about the Night of the Long Knives rapidly spread. Although many Germans approached the official news of the events as described by Joseph Goebbels with a great deal of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos. Luise Solmitz, a Hamburg schoolteacher, echoed the sentiments of many Germans when she cited Hitler's \"personal courage, decisiveness and effectiveness\" in her private diary. She even compared him to Frederick the Great, the 18th-century king of Prussia.\nOthers were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow Germans. \"A very calm and easy going mailman,\" the diarist Victor Klemperer wrote, \"who is not at all National Socialist, said, 'Well, he simply \"sentenced\" them.'\" It did not escape Klemperer's notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power. \"A chancellor\", he wrote, \"sentences and shoots members of his own private army!\" The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo, however, meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it.\nAmong the few exceptions were General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord and Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler. Hammerstein, who was a close friend of Schleicher, had been much offended at Schleicher's funeral when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated the wreaths that the mourners had brought. Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow, Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on 18 July setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped. The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible, and criticized Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow. Finally, Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganize the government by firing Baron Konstantin von Neurath, Robert Ley, Hermann G\u00f6ring, Werner von Blomberg, Joseph Goebbels and Richard Walther Darr\u00e9 from the Cabinet. The memo asked that Hindenburg instead create a directorate to rule Germany, comprising the Chancellor (who was not named), General Werner von Fritsch as Vice-Chancellor, Hammerstein as Minister of Defense, the Minister for National Economy (also unnamed), and Rudolf Nadolny as Foreign Minister. The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny, the former Ambassador to the USSR, who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler's anti-Soviet foreign policy, indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the \"distant friendliness\" towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933. Mackensen and Hammerstein ended their memo with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Excellency, the gravity of the moment has compelled us to appeal to you as our Supreme Commander. The destiny of our country is at stake. Your Excellency has thrice before saved Germany from foundering, at Tannenberg, at the end of the War and at the moment of your election as \"Reich\" President. Excellency, save Germany for the fourth time! The undersigned Generals and senior officers swear to preserve to the last breath their loyalty to you and the Fatherland.\nHindenburg never responded to the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Mei\u00dfner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is noteworthy that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom they wanted to see continue as Chancellor; they at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.\nIn late 1934\u2013early 1935, Werner von Fritsch and Werner von Blomberg, who had been shamed into joining Hammerstein and Mackensen's rehabilitation campaign, successfully pressured Hitler into rehabilitating Generals von Schleicher and von Bredow. Fritsch and Blomberg suddenly now claimed at the end of 1934 that as army officers they could not stand the exceedingly violent press attacks on Schleicher and Bredow that had been going on since July, which portrayed them as the vilest traitors, working against the Fatherland in the pay of France. In a speech given on 3 January 1935, at the Berlin State Opera, Hitler stated that Schleicher and Bredow had been shot \"in error\" on the basis of false information, and that their names were to be restored to the honour rolls of their regiments at once. Hitler's speech was not reported in the German press, but the army was appeased by the speech. However, despite the rehabilitation of the two murdered officers, the Nazis continued in private to accuse Schleicher of high treason. During a trip to Warsaw in January 1935, G\u00f6ring told Jan Szembek that Schleicher had urged Hitler in January 1933 to reach an understanding with France and the Soviet Union, and partition Poland with the latter, and Hitler had Schleicher killed out of disgust with the alleged advice. During a meeting with Polish Ambassador J\u00f3zef Lipski on 22 May 1935, Hitler told Lipski that Schleicher was \"rightfully murdered, if only because he had sought to maintain the Rapallo Treaty.\" The statements that Schleicher had been killed because he wanted to partition Poland with the Soviet Union were later published in the Polish White Book of 1939, which was a collection of diplomatic documents detailing German\u2013Polish relations up to the outbreak of the war.\nFormer Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was in exile in Doorn, Netherlands, was horrified by the purge. He asked, \"What would people have said if I had done such a thing?\" Hearing of the murder of former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and his wife, he also commented, \"We have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!\"\nSA leadership.\nHitler named Viktor Lutze to replace R\u00f6hm as head of the SA. Hitler ordered him, as one prominent historian described it, to put an end to \"homosexuality, debauchery, drunkenness, and high living\" in the SA. Hitler expressly told him to stop SA funds from being spent on limousines and banquets, which he considered evidence of SA extravagance. Lutze did little to assert the SA's independence in the coming years, and the organization lost its power in Germany. Its membership plummeted from 2.9 million in August 1934 to 1.2 million in April 1938.\nAccording to Albert Speer, \"the Right, represented by the President, the Minister of Justice, and the generals, lined up behind Hitler\u00a0... the strong left wing of the party, represented chiefly by the SA, was eliminated.\"\nR\u00f6hm was purged from all Nazi propaganda, such as \"The Victory of Faith\", the Leni Riefenstahl film about the 1933 Nuremberg rally, which showed R\u00f6hm frequently alongside Hitler. A copy of the original film, before R\u00f6hm was edited out, was found in the 1980s in the German Democratic Republic's film archives.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"long knives\" as a metonym for treachery and violence had been used to describe the Treason of the Long Knives since this incident was recorded in the 9th century Historia Brittonum. This event reputedly occurred during the fifth century Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, when Vortigern and the British leaders were invited to discuss peace and the Saxon leader Hengist commanded his men to draw their Seax (the infamous long knives) and massacre the unarmed Britons. It would become known in Welsh as \"twyll y cyllyll hirion\" () (first recorded around 1587) and in English as the \"Treachery/Plot/Treason of the long knives\" (recorded around 1604). This story would be popularized across western Europe in the 12th century as part of the \"History of the Britons\" by Geoffrey of Monmouth, which introduced many of the Arthurian legends to Germany.\nIn the years preceding the purge, the term \"long knives\" had become a popular description of treachery in Germany and was used as a criticism of Nazi actions and deceitfulness.\nHowever, the term was soon adopted by the Nazis themselves to invoke what they saw as justifiable and necessary measures taken by Germanic peoples against an enemy. In 1928, the popular Nazi song \"Wetzt die langen Messer\" () encourages the mass murder of Jews and the desecration of synagogues. The Nazi adoption of the phrase for an upcoming violent event was well known even to the foreign press, with the 2 August 1932 issue of \"The Times\" reporting that:\nProminent Nazi leaders have played upon the imaginations of their followers..with such phrases as 'the night of the long knives' and 'a vengeance for every Nazi killed'.\nAlso in 1932, the Nazi critic Carl von Ossietzky would use the term to describe the then-unrealised plans for a violent uprising:\nAt the beginning of 1932 the Nazis seemed on the verge of a dictatorship, and the air was full of the stench of blood. By the end of it, Hitler's party had been shaken by a major crisis, and the long knives were put quietly back in their box while all the F\u00fchrer kept out was a wary ear.\nBefore its execution, the purge's instigators referred to the plans under the codename \"Hummingbird\" (German: ), the word used to command execution squads into action on 30 June. However, soon after the purge Hitler himself named the events the \"Night of the long knives\" in his public speech on 13 July 1934 defending the actions (despite the violence taking place over several days).\nLegacy.\nThe Night of the Long Knives represented a triumph for Hitler, and a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as \"the supreme leader of the German people\", as he put it in his 13 July speech to the Reichstag. Hitler formally adopted this title in April 1942, thus placing himself above the reach of the law \"de jure\" and \"de facto\". Centuries of jurisprudence proscribing extrajudicial killings were swept aside. Despite some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders, which the regime rapidly quashed, it appeared that no law would constrain Hitler in his use of power.\nYears later, in November 1945, while being interviewed by psychologist Gustave Gilbert in his cell during the Nuremberg trials, G\u00f6ring angrily justified the killings to Gilbert, \"It's a damn good thing I wiped them out, or they would have wiped us out!\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"giant\" is first attested in 1297 from Robert of Gloucester's chronicle. It is derived from the \"Gigantes\" () of Greek mythology. \nFairy tales such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\" have formed the modern perception of giants as dimwitted and violent ogres, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat livestock. In more recent portrayals, like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly.\nLiterary and cultural analysis.\nGiants appear many times in folklore and myths. Representing the human body enlarged to the point of being monstrous, giants evoke terror and remind humans of their body's frailty and mortality. They are often portrayed as monsters and antagonists, but there are exceptions. Some giants intermingle with humans in a friendly way and can even be part of human families, their offspring portrayed as regular humans often referred to as half-giants.\nFolklorists and historians examine the role giants are assigned in regional geomythologies. For example, Fionn mac Cumhaill is said to have built the Giant's Causeway on the island of Ireland. Per a 1965 examination in an American studies journal, \"It is generally admitted today that Paul Bunyan was a synthetic figure conceived by advertising men rather than the spontaneous product of the folk mind, yet he has been adopted by the American people with enthusiasm...Paul and his blue ox Babe are supposed to have altered the appearance of the American continent; the animal's hoof prints became the lake beds of the Northwest and from its drinking trough spilled the Mississippi River.\" Fossilized remains of ancient mammals and reptiles common to the Sivalik Hills of India may have influenced aspects of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata that tell of battles in which \"hundreds of mighty, and sometimes gigantic, heroes, horses, and war elephants are said to have died.\"\nArcheology and paleontology.\nClaudine Cohen, in her 2002 book \"The Fate of the Mammoth\", argued that the history of human interaction with fossil bones of prehistoric megafauna was heavily influenced by giant lore. Per Cohen, the proto-scientific study of giants appears in several phases of human history: Herodotus reported that the remains of Orestes were found in Tegea; Pliny described a giant's skeleton found in Crete after an earthquake, and seemed to refer to evolution as the process by which giants become human-size over time; and Saint Augustine mentions what is believed to have been the fossilized molar of an ancient Elephantidae in his \"City of God\", in a passage reflecting on the nature and meaning of the Noahacian deluge. The academic consideration of giants continued through the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and even the early modern period. Boccaccio devoted a passage of his \"Genealogies of the Pagan Gods\" to purported archeological discoveries in Sicily that he thought might be evidence of the historicity of \"The Odyssey\"'s Polyphemus. Rabelais created a wholly \"fabricated giantology\" for his 16th-century \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\". Massive bones found in 1613 in France were initially assigned to Teutobochus but the examinations of them by various physicians and their publication of diverging conclusions about the bones kicked off a \"pamphlet war\" between anatomists and surgeons of the day. The discovery of the so-called Claverack Giant in colonial New York triggered giantological investigations by two important early American intellectuals, Cotton Mather and Edward Taylor.\nReligion and mythology.\nAbrahamic.\nGenesis tells of the Nephilim before and after Noah's Flood. The word \"Nephilim\" is loosely translated as \"giants\" in some translations of the Hebrew Bible, but left untranslated in others. According to , the Nephilim were destroyed in the Flood, but Nephilim are reported after the Flood, including:\nThe Book of Numbers includes the discouraging report by the spies sent by Moses into Canaan: \"We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are. (...) All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.\" The Book of Joshua, describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation, makes reference to such people living there in (Joshua 14:12\u201315 and Joshua 15:13\u201314).\nThe Bible also tells of Gog and Magog, who later entered European folklore, and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine Goliath. While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retellings of the Biblical narrative, he appears to be significantly smaller than other giants, biblical or otherwise. The Masoretic Text version of the Book of Samuel gives his height as six cubits and one span (possibly ), while the Septuagint, the 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus and the 2nd\u20131st-centuries BCE Dead Sea Scrolls give Goliath's height as four cubits and one span (possibly ). For comparison, the Anakites are described as making the Israelites seem like grasshoppers. See also Gibborim.\nJosephus also described the Amorites as giants in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\", circa 93CE, indicating that some sort of fossils may have been on display at that time: \"For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron; and when they had taken it, they slew all the inhabitants. There were till then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight, and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men.\"\nThe Book of Enoch describes giants as the offspring of Watchers and women in 7:2.\nArmenian.\nHayk was known as the founder of the Armenian state. Hayk was part of a race of giants who helped construct the Tower of Babel. Ancient historian Movses Khorenatsi wrote, \"Hayk was handsome and personable, with curly hair, sparkling eyes and strong arms. Among the giants he was the bravest and most famous, opponent of all who raised their hand to become absolute ruler over the giants and heroes.\"\nMount Nemrut is known to have received its name from an Armenian tradition in which Nimrod was killed by an arrow shot by Hayk during a massive battle between two rival armies of giants to the south-east of Lake Van.\nAztec.\nAztec mythology features the Quinametzin, a race of giant men created in one of the previous solar eras. They are credited with the construction of Teotihuacan.\nBasque.\nGiants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living in the hills of the Basque Country. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old lifestyle and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of San Martin Txiki, while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures (dolmens, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots.\nHowever, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as jentilak and mairuak, while as individuals they can be represented as Basajaun (\"the lord of the forests\"), Sanson (variation of the biblical Samson), Errolan (based on the Frankish army general Roland who fell dead at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass) or even Tartalo (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek Cyclops Polyphemus).\nBulgarian.\nIn Bulgarian mythology, giants called ispolini inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains, fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons. Ispolini were afraid of blackberries which posed a danger of making the giants trip and die, so they offered sacrifices to that plant.\nChilean.\nThere are tales of giants in the northern Chilean port town of Caldera telling of giants who play with ships moving them from one port to another. Tales of the same area also tells of giants who are able to crush humans with their feet and when laying down to sleep being so long as to reach from the mountains to the sea. In some stories the giants are black humanoids or black bulls. In southern Chile there are stories of giants said to belong to certain volcanoes such as Calbuco and Osorno.\nThe mythical city of Tololo Pampa in northern Chile is said to be guarded by a giant known by various names including; \"Pata Larga\", \"Gigante Minero\" and \"Minero Gigante\". The giant enters to the mountains to obtain riches to the princess of Tololo Pampa. If a person manages to watch the giant while he works folklore says the person will be blessed with good luck for the rest of their life.\nGreek.\nIn Greek mythology, the \"Gigantes\" (\u03b3\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) were (according to the poet Hesiod) the children of Uranus (\u039f\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2) and Gaia (\u0393\u03b1\u03af\u03b1) (spirits of the sky and the earth) where some depictions had them with snake-like legs. They were involved in a conflict with the Olympian gods called the \"Gigantomachy\" (\u0393\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) when Gaia had them attack Mount Olympus. This battle was eventually settled when the hero Heracles decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like Enceladus, to lie buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\nHerodotus in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in Tegea the body of Orestes, which was seven cubits long\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u200aapproximately 3.73m, or about 12feet 3inches. In his book \"The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus\", Plutarch describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of Theseus, which was \"of more than ordinary size.\" The kneecaps of Ajax were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote Pausanias. A boy's discus was about in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around , suggesting Ajax may have been nearly 14feet (over 4m) tall.\nThe Cyclopes are also compared to giants due to their huge size (e.g.Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa and nemesis of Odysseus in Homer's \"The Odyssey\"). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus, and later made Zeus' \"master thunderbolt\", Poseidon's trident, and Hades' \"helm of darkness\", during the Titanomachy.\nThe Hecatoncheires are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.\nOther known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed Gegeines, the northern Hyperboreans, and the cannibalistic Laestrygonians.\nHindu.\nThere are accounts stating humans grew to the size of giants during the Satya Yuga, the first of the four cyclical ages (yugas) in the Hindu reckoning of time.\nJain.\nAccording to Jainism, there was a time when giants walked upon this earth. Jain cosmology divides the worldly cycle of time into two parts or half-cycles, \"avasarpani\" (age of descending purity) and ascending (\"utsarpani\").\nAccording to Jain texts, the height of Rishabhanatha, first \"tirthankara\" of the present half-cycle of time (\"avasarpani\") was 500 \"dhanusa\" (longbow).\nIn \"avasarpani\", as the cycle moves ahead, height of all humans and animals decreases. The following table depicts the six \"aras\" of \"avasarpini\"\u2013\nNorse.\nIn Norse mythology, the (cognate with and ) are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as \"giants\", most are described as being roughly human-sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as some frost giants (\"hr\u00edm\u00feursar\"), fire giants (\"eldj\u00f6tnar\"), and mountain giants (\"bergrisar\"). The are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the Fenrisulfr) and in the eventual battle of Ragnar\u00f6k, the giants will storm Asgard and fight the gods until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the by many marriages and descent; there are also such as \u00c6gir who have good relationships with the gods and bear little difference in status to them. Odin, often regarded as the chief god, is the great-grandson of the Ymir. Norse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions whose name is considered by some scholars to share a root with Yama of Indo-Iranian mythology.\nTrolls are beings that are sometimes very large. The name \"troll\" is applied to .\nAn old Icelandic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near Drangey Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means \"old hag\") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago.\nA \"bergrisi\" \u2013 the traditional protector of southwestern Iceland \u2013 appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Iceland.\nPaiute.\nAccording to Northern Paiute oral history, the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants, the remains of which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada's Lovelock Cave. Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of \"beautiful giants\" who once lived between the Sierra Nevadas and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.\nRoman.\nSeveral Jupiter-Giant-Columns have been found in Germania Superior. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura, and Alsace.\nOther European.\nIn folklore from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations. The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus thought giants had a hand in the creation of megalithic monuments. Similarly, the Old English poem \"The Seafarer\" speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants. Natural geologic features such as the massive basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway on the coast of Northern Ireland were attributed to construction by giants.\nIn the Netherlands, giants are often associated with creating or forming the landscape. For instance, two giants are said to have dug a channel, until they reached the village of Akkrum, where they had an argument and each went his own way, thus splitting the channel into two separate waterways. Others threw up hills, or became hills themselves when they died on the spot. In several legends, giants were evil beings that threatened, robbed and killed travellers or locals; such as Ellert and Brammert, in the province of Drenthe.\nMedieval chivalry romances such as the Spanish \"Amad\u00eds de Gaula\" feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' \"Don Quixote\", when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase tilting at windmills.\nTales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of the British Isles. Celtic giants also figure in Breton and Arthurian romances. In Kinloch Rannoch, a local myth has a local hill resembling a giant named as \"The Sleeping Giant\". Folklore says the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Giants are also prominent in Welsh folklore.\nMany giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity. A giant who had quarrelled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel. Other English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other, which was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.\nGiants figure in folklore and fairy tales, such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\", \"The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body\", \"Nix Nought Nothing\", \"Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon\", \"Young Ronald\", and Paul Bunyan. Ogres are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore.\nR\u00fcbezahl, is a kind giant from German folklore who lived in the Giant Mountains, along with the Bergm\u00f6nch, a giant mountain spirit.\nAntero Vipunen is a giant shaman that appears in the \"Kalevala\", meeting the epic hero V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen to teach him creation spells.\nNames.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHalf-giant.\nHalf-giants are fictional beings that have one parent that is a giant and another parent that is a different species. In most cases, a half-giant is the result of a union between a human and a giant. Often, half-giants are of normal size or slightly larger than a human. They either have abnormal or supernatural abilities, or are unusually strong and hearty.\nOne notable half-giant is Antaeus of Greek mythology, who is the son of the god Poseidon and the primordial entity Gaia. In Arthurian legend, Galehaut and Guinevere were also considered half-giants.\nIn fantasy role-playing games, they often are a playable race (for example, Half-Giants in the Dark Sun setting for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and another race of half-giants in the MMORPG \"\"). In the game \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", half-giants are a race of enormous demi-humans who have adapted to a variety of lifestyles in the harsh terrains of Athas. The origins of the race are unclear.\nHalf-giants are also known from the \"Harry Potter\" series by J. K. Rowling. Rubeus Hagrid and Olympe Maxime the headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic are examples.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Forestry is practiced in plantations and natural stands. The science of forestry has elements that belong to the biological, physical, social, political and managerial sciences. Forest management plays an essential role in the creation and modification of habitats and affects ecosystem services provisioning. A practitioner of forestry is known as a \"forester\". \nModern forestry generally embraces a broad range of concerns, in what is known as multiple-use management, including: the provision of timber, fuel wood, wildlife habitat, natural water quality management, recreation, landscape and community protection, employment, aesthetically appealing landscapes, biodiversity management, watershed management, erosion control, and preserving forests as \"sinks\" for atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nForest ecosystems have come to be seen as the most important component of the biosphere, and forestry has emerged as a vital applied science, craft, and technology. The control of forests for timber production is known as \"silviculture\", as practiced by \"silviculturists\". Although forestry is a broader concept, the two terms are often used synonymously.\nAll people depend upon forests and their biodiversity, some more than others. Forestry is an important economic segment in various industrial countries, as forests provide more than 86 million green jobs and support the livelihoods of many more people. For example, in Germany, forests cover nearly a third of the land area, wood is the most important renewable resource, and forestry supports more than a million jobs and about \u20ac181 billion of value to the German economy each year.\nWorldwide, an estimated 880 million people spend part of their time collecting fuelwood or producing charcoal, many of them women.\u00a0Human populations tend to be low in areas of low-income countries with high forest cover and high forest biodiversity, but poverty rates in these areas tend to be high. Some 252 million people living in forests and savannahs have incomes of less than US$1.25 per day.\nScience.\nForestry as a science.\nOver the past centuries, forestry was regarded as a separate science. With the rise of ecology and environmental science, there has been a reordering in the applied sciences. In line with this view, forestry is a primary land-use science comparable with agriculture. Under these headings, the fundamentals behind the management of natural forests comes by way of natural ecology. Forests or tree plantations, those whose primary purpose is the extraction of forest products, are planned and managed to utilize a mix of ecological and agroecological principles. In many regions of the world there is considerable conflict between forest practices and other societal priorities such as water quality, watershed preservation, sustainable fishing, conservation, and species preservation.\nDendrology and silviculture.\nDendrology is a subset of botany; it is the scientific discipline that studies woody plants (trees, shrubs, and lianas), specifically, their taxonomic classifications.\nSilviculture on the other hand is the commercial practice of forest management , primarily for the production of timber.\nGenetic diversity in forestry.\nThe provenance of forest reproductive material used to plant forests has a great influence on how the trees develop, hence why it is important to use forest reproductive material of good quality and of high genetic diversity.\n&lt;dfn &gt;Genetic diversity&lt;/dfn&gt; is the differences in DNA sequence between individuals as distinct from variation caused by environmental influences. The unique genetic composition of an individual (its genotype) will determine its performance (its phenotype) at a particular site. Genetic diversity is needed to maintain the vitality of forests and to provide resilience to pests and diseases. Genetic diversity also ensures that forest trees can survive, adapt and evolve under changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, genetic diversity is the foundation of biological diversity at species and ecosystem levels. Forest genetic resources are therefore important in forest management.\nGenetic diversity in forests is threatened by forest fires, pests and diseases, habitat fragmentation, poor silvicultural practices and inappropriate use of forest reproductive material. About 98 million hectares of forest were affected by fire in 2015; this was mainly in the tropical domain, where fire burned about 4 percent of the total forest area in that year. More than two-thirds of the total forest area affected was in Africa and South America. Insects, diseases and severe weather events damaged about 40 million hectares of forests in 2015, mainly in the temperate and boreal domains. The marginal populations of many tree species are facing new threats due to the effects of climate change. Most countries in Europe have recommendations or guidelines for selecting species and provenances that can be used in a given site or zone.\nForest management.\nForest management is the branch of forestry concerned with the administration and running of commercial forests. It addresses silviculture, forest protection, and regulation. Its goals include management for timber, aesthetics, recreation, urban values, watershed management, wildlife, inland and nearshore fisheries, wood products, plant genetic resources, and other forest resource values.\nUrban forestry.\nUrban forestry is the care and management of single trees and tree populations in urban settings for the purpose of improving the urban environment. Urban forestry involves both planning and management, including the programming of care and maintenance operations of the urban forest.\nForestry education.\nForestry education includes training in general biology, ecology, botany, genetics, soil science, climatology, hydrology, economics and forest management. Education in the basics of sociology and political science is often considered an advantage. Professional skills in conflict resolution and communication are also important in training programs. In the United States, postsecondary forestry education leading to a Bachelor's degree or Master's degree is accredited by the Society of American Foresters. In Canada the Canadian Institute of Forestry awards silver rings to graduates from accredited university BSc programs, as well as college and technical programs. The International Union of Forest Research Organizations is the international organization that coordinates forest science efforts worldwide.\nHistory.\nThe first major works about forestry in the English language included Roger Taverner's \"Booke of Survey\" (1565), John Manwood's \"A Brefe Collection of the Lawes of the Forrest\" (1592) and John Evelyn's \"Sylva\" (1662).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a free content work.

Selective herbicides control specific weed species while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed, while non-selective herbicides (sometimes called \"total weed killers\") kill plants indiscriminately. The combined effects of herbicides, nitrogen fertilizer, and improved cultivars has increased yields (per acre) of major crops by three to six times from 1900 to 2000.\nIn the United States in 2012, about 91% of all herbicide usage was, determined by weight, applied in agriculture. In 2012, world pesticide expenditures totaled nearly US$24.7 billion; herbicides were about 44% of those sales and constituted the biggest portion, followed by insecticides, fungicides, and fumigants. Herbicide is also used in forestry, where certain formulations have been found to suppress hardwood varieties in favor of conifers after clearcutting, as well as pasture systems.\nHistory.\nPrior to the widespread use of herbicides, cultural controls, such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to control weeds. Mechanical control including tillage and flooding were also used to control weeds. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, inorganic chemicals such as sulfuric acid, arsenic, copper salts, kerosene and sodium chlorate were used to control weeds, but these chemicals were either toxic, flammable or corrosive and were expensive and ineffective at controlling weeds. \nFirst herbicides.\nThe major breakthroughs occurred during the Second World War as the result of research conducted independently in the United Kingdom and the United States into the potential use of herbicides in war. The compound 2,4-D was first synthesized by W. G. Templeman at Imperial Chemical Industries. In 1940, his work with indoleacetic acid and naphthaleneacetic acid indicated that \"growth substances applied appropriately would kill certain broad-leaved weeds in cereals without harming the crops,\" though these substances were too expensive and too short-lived in soil due to degradation by microorganisms to be of practical agricultural use; by 1941, his team succeeded in synthesizing a wide range of chemicals to achieve the same effect at lower cost and better efficacy, including 2,4-D. In the same year, R. Pokorny in the US achieved this as well. Independently, a team under Juda Hirsch Quastel, working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station made the same discovery. Quastel was tasked by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) to discover methods for improving crop yield. By analyzing soil as a dynamic system, rather than an inert substance, he was able to apply techniques such as perfusion. Quastel was able to quantify the influence of various plant hormones, inhibitors, and other chemicals on the activity of microorganisms in the soil and assess their direct impact on plant growth. While the full work of the unit remained secret, certain discoveries were developed for commercial use after the war, including the 2,4-D compound.\nWhen 2,4-D was commercially released in 1946, it became the first successful selective herbicide, triggering a worldwide revolution in agricultural output. It allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in wheat, maize (corn), rice, and similar cereal grass crops, because it kills dicots (broadleaf plants), but not most monocots (grasses). The low cost of 2,4-D has led to continued usage today, and it remains one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. Like other acid herbicides, current formulations use either an amine salt (often trimethylamine) or one of many esters of the parent compound.\nFurther discoveries.\nThe triazine family of herbicides, which includes atrazine, was introduced in the 1950s; they have the current distinction of being the herbicide family of greatest concern regarding groundwater contamination. Atrazine does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied to soils of above-neutral pH. Under alkaline soil conditions, atrazine may be carried into the soil profile as far as the water table by soil water following rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination. Atrazine is thus said to have \"carryover\", a generally undesirable property for herbicides.\nGlyphosate had been first prepared in the 1950s but its herbicidal activity was only recognized in the 1960s. It was marketed as Roundup in 1971. The development of glyphosate-resistant crop plants, it is now used very extensively for selective weed control in growing crops. The pairing of the herbicide with the resistant seed contributed to the consolidation of the seed and chemistry industry in the late 1990s.\nMany modern herbicides used in agriculture and gardening are specifically formulated to degrade within a short period after application.\nTerminology.\nHerbicides can be classified/grouped in various ways; for example, according to their activity, the timing of application, method of application, mechanism of their action, and their chemical structures.\nSelectivity.\nChemical structure of the herbicide is of primary affecting efficacy. 2,4-D, mecoprop, and dicamba control many broadleaf weeds but remain ineffective against turf grasses.\nChemical additives influence selectivity. Surfactants alter the physical properties of the spray solution and the overall phytotoxicity of the herbicide, increasing translocation. Herbicide safeners enhance the selectivity by boosting herbicide resistance by the crop but allowing the herbicide to damage the weed.\nSelectivity is determined by the circumstances and technique of application. Climatic factors affect absorption including humidity, light, precipitation, and temperature. Foliage-applied herbicides will enter the leaf more readily at high humidity by lengthening the drying time of the spray droplet and increasing cuticle hydration. Light of high intensity may break down some herbicides and cause the leaf cuticle to thicken, which can interfere with absorption. Precipitation may wash away or remove some foliage-applied herbicides, but it will increase root absorption of soil-applied herbicides. Drought-stressed plants are less likely to translocate herbicides. As temperature increases, herbicides' performance may decrease. Absorption and translocation may be reduced in very cold weather.\nNon-selective herbicides.\nNon-selective herbicides, generally known as defoliants, are used to clear industrial sites, waste grounds, railways, and railway embankments. Paraquat, glufosinate, and glyphosate are non-selective herbicides.\nPersistence.\nAn herbicide is described as having low residual activity if it is neutralized within a short time of application (within a few weeks or months) \u2013 typically this is due to rainfall, or reactions in the soil. A herbicide described as having high residual activity will remain potent for the long term in the soil. For some compounds, the residual activity can leave the ground almost permanently barren.\nMechanism of action.\nHerbicides interfere with the biochemical machinery that supports plant growth. Herbicides often mimic natural plant hormones, enzyme substrates, and cofactors. They interfere with the metabolism in the target plants. Herbicides are often classified according to their site of action because as a general rule, herbicides within the same site of action class produce similar symptoms on susceptible plants. Classification based on the site of action of the herbicide is preferable as herbicide resistance management can be handled more effectively. Classification by mechanism of action (MOA) indicates the first enzyme, protein, or biochemical step affected in the plant following application:\nComplementary to mechanism-based classifications, herbicides are often classified according to their chemical structures or motifs. Similar structural types work in similar ways. For example, aryloxyphenoxypropionates herbicides (diclofop chlorazifop, fluazifop) appear to all act as ACCase inhibitors. The so-called cyclohexanedione herbicides, which are used against grasses, include the following commercial products cycloxydim, clethodim, tralkoxydim, butroxydim, sethoxydim, profoxydim, and mesotrione. Knowing about herbicide chemical family grouping serves as a short-term strategy for managing resistance to site of action.&lt;ref name=\"10.4141/P05-193\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The phenoxyacetic acid mimic the natural auxin indoleacetic acid (IAA). This family includes MCPA, 2,4-D, and 2,4,5-T, picloram, dicamba, clopyralid, and triclopyr.\nWSSA and HRAC classification.\nUsing the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) and herbicide Resistance and World Grains (HRAC) systems, herbicides are classified by mode of action. Eventually the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (HRAC) and the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) developed a classification system. Groups in the WSSA and the HRAC systems are designated by numbers and letters, inform users awareness of herbicide mode of action and provide more accurate recommendations for resistance management.\nUse and application.\nMost herbicides are applied as water-based sprays using ground equipment. Ground equipment varies in design, but large areas can be sprayed using self-propelled sprayers equipped with long booms, of with spray nozzles spaced every apart. Towed, handheld, and even horse-drawn sprayers are also used. On large areas, herbicides may also at times be applied aerially using helicopters or airplanes, or through irrigation systems (known as chemigation).\nWeed-wiping may also be used, where a wick wetted with herbicide is suspended from a boom and dragged or rolled across the tops of the taller weed plants. This allows treatment of taller grassland weeds by direct contact without affecting related but desirable shorter plants in the grassland sward beneath. The method has the benefit of avoiding spray drift. In Wales, a scheme offering free weed-wiper hire was launched in 2015 in an effort to reduce the levels of MCPA in water courses.\nThere is little difference in forestry in the early growth stages, when the height similarities between growing trees and growing annual crops yields a similar problem with weed competition. Unlike with annuals however, application is mostly unnecessary thereafter and is thus mostly used to decrease the delay between productive economic cycles of lumber crops.\nMisuse and misapplication.\nHerbicide volatilisation or spray drift may result in herbicide affecting neighboring fields or plants, particularly in windy conditions. Sometimes, the wrong field or plants may be sprayed due to error.\nUse politically, militarily, and in conflict.\nAlthough herbicidal warfare uses chemical substances, its main purpose is to disrupt agricultural food production or to destroy plants which provide cover or concealment to the enemy. During the Malayan Emergency, British Commonwealth forces deployed herbicides and defoliants in the Malaysian countryside in order to deprive Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) insurgents of cover, potential sources of food and to flush them out of the jungle. Deployment of herbicides and defoliants served the dual purpose of thinning jungle trails to prevent ambushes and destroying crop fields in regions where the MNLA was active to deprive them of potential sources of food. As part of this process, herbicides and defoliants were also sprayed from Royal Air Force aircraft. \nThe use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War has left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people and U.S soldiers that handled the chemicals. More than 20% of South Vietnam's forests and 3.2% of its cultivated land were sprayed at least once between during the war. The government of Vietnam says that up to four million people in Vietnam were exposed to the defoliant, and as many as three million people have suffered illness because of Agent Orange, while the Viet Nam Red Cross Society estimates that up to one million people were disabled or have health problems as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. The United States government has described these figures as unreliable.\nHealth and environmental effects.\nHuman health.\nMany questions exist about herbicides' health and environmental effects, because of the many kinds of herbicide and the myriad potential targets, mostly unintended. For example, a 1995 panel of 13 scientists reviewing studies on the carcinogenicity of 2,4-D had divided opinions on the likelihood 2,4-D causes cancer in humans. As of 1992[ [update]], studies on phenoxy herbicides were too few to accurately assess the risk of many types of cancer from these herbicides, even although evidence was stronger that exposure to these herbicides is associated with increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nToxicity\nHerbicides have widely variable toxicity. Acute toxicity, short term exposure effects, and chronic toxicity, from long term environmental or occupational exposure. Much public suspicion of herbicides confuses valid statements of \"acute\" toxicity with equally valid statements of lack of \"chronic\" toxicity at the recommended levels of usage. For instance, while glyphosate formulations with tallowamine \"adjuvants\" are acutely toxic, their use was found to be uncorrelated with any health issues like cancer in a massive US Department of Health study on 90,000 members of farmer families for over a period of 23 years. That is, the study shows lack of chronic toxicity, but cannot question the herbicide's acute toxicity.\nHealth effects\nSome herbicides cause a range of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death. The pathway of attack can arise from intentional or unintentional direct consumption, improper application resulting in the herbicide coming into direct contact with people or wildlife, inhalation of aerial sprays, or food consumption prior to the labelled preharvest interval. Under some conditions, certain herbicides can be transported via leaching or surface runoff to contaminate groundwater or distant surface water sources. Generally, the conditions that promote herbicide transport include intense storm events (particularly shortly after application) and soils with limited capacity to adsorb or retain the herbicides. Herbicide properties that increase likelihood of transport include persistence (resistance to degradation) and high water solubility.\nContamination\nCases have been reported where Phenoxy herbicides are contaminated with dioxins such as TCDD; research has suggested such contamination results in a small rise in cancer risk after occupational exposure to these herbicides. Triazine exposure has been implicated in a likely relationship to increased risk of breast cancer, although a causal relationship remains unclear.\nFalse claims\nHerbicide manufacturers have at times made false or misleading claims about the safety of their products. Chemical manufacturer Monsanto Company agreed to change its advertising after pressure from New York attorney general Dennis Vacco; Vacco complained about misleading claims that its spray-on glyphosate-based herbicides, including Roundup, were safer than table salt and \"practically non-toxic\" to mammals, birds, and fish (though proof that this was ever said is hard to find). Roundup is toxic and has resulted in death after being ingested in quantities ranging from 85 to 200 ml, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms. The manufacturer of Tordon 101 (Dow AgroSciences, owned by the Dow Chemical Company) has claimed Tordon 101 has no effects on animals and insects, in spite of evidence of strong carcinogenic activity of the active ingredient, picloram, in studies on rats.\nEcological effects.\nHerbicide use generally has negative impacts on many aspects of the environment. Insects, non-targeted plants, animals, and aquatic systems subject to serious damage from herbicides. Impacts are highly variable.\nBioaccumulation is a concern, both in terrestrial and aquatic environments, and is heavily dependent on both the kind of herbicide and the conditions. For example, fish in dark aquariums bioaccumulated 14 times more trifluralin than fish kept in well lit aquariums in a 1977 study.\nAquatic life.\nAtrazine and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid have often been blamed for affecting reproductive behavior of aquatic life. A review in 2008 found that the data do not support this assertion in regards to atrazine, but later works find these herbicides as having a detrimental effect on aquatic plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate life, as well as disrupting microbial communities in soil.\nBird populations.\nBird populations are one of many indicators of herbicide damage. Most observed effects are due not to toxicity, but to habitat changes and the decreases in abundance of species on which birds rely for food or shelter. Herbicide use in silviculture, used to favor certain types of growth following clearcutting, can cause significant drops in bird populations. Even when herbicides which have low toxicity to birds are used, they decrease the abundance of many types of vegetation on which the birds rely. Herbicide use in agriculture in the UK has been linked to a decline in seed-eating bird species which rely on the weeds killed by the herbicides. Heavy use of herbicides in neotropical agricultural areas has been one of many factors implicated in limiting the usefulness of such agricultural land for wintering migratory birds.\nResistance.\nOne major complication to the use of herbicides for weed control is the ability of plants to evolve herbicide resistance, rendering the herbicides ineffective against target plants. Out of 31 known herbicide modes of action, weeds have evolved resistance to 21. 268 plant species are known to have evolved herbicide resistance at least once. Herbicide resistance was first observed in 1957, and since has evolved repeatedly in weed species from 30 families across the globe. Weed resistance to herbicides has become a major concern in crop production worldwide.&lt;ref name=\"10.1111/wre.12153\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; \nResistance to herbicides is often attributed to overuse as well as the strong evolutionary pressure on the affected weeds. Three agricultural practices account for the evolutionary pressure upon weeds to evolve resistance: monoculture, neglecting non-herbicide weed control practices, and reliance on one herbicide for weed control. To minimize resistance, rotational programs of herbicide application, where herbicides with multiple modes of action are used, have been widely promoted. In particular, glyphosate resistance evolved rapidly in part because when glyphosate use first began, it was continuously and heavily relied upon for weed control. This caused incredibly strong selective pressure upon weeds, encouraging mutations conferring glyphosate resistance to persist and spread.\nHowever, in 2015, an expansive study showed an increase in herbicide resistance as a result of rotation, and instead recommended mixing multiple herbicides for simultaneous application. As of 2023, the effectiveness of combining herbicides is also questioned, particularly in light of the rise of non-target site resistance.\nPlants developed resistance to atrazine and to ALS-inhibitors relatively early, but more recently, glyphosate resistance has dramatically risen. Marestail is one weed that has developed glyphosate resistance. Glyphosate-resistant weeds are present in the vast majority of soybean, cotton and corn farms in some U.S. states. Weeds that can resist multiple other herbicides are spreading. Few new herbicides are near commercialization, and none with a molecular mode of action for which there is no resistance. Because most herbicides could not kill all weeds, farmers rotate crops and herbicides to stop the development of resistant weeds.\nA 2008\u20132009 survey of 144 populations of waterhemp in 41 Missouri counties revealed glyphosate resistance in 69%. Weeds from some 500 sites throughout Iowa in 2011 and 2012 revealed glyphosate resistance in approximately 64% of waterhemp samples. As of 2023, 58 weed species have developed glyphosate resistance. Weeds resistant to multiple herbicides with completely different biological action modes are on the rise. In Missouri, 43% of waterhemp samples were resistant to two different herbicides; 6% resisted three; and 0.5% resisted four. In Iowa 89% of waterhemp samples resist two or more herbicides, 25% resist three, and 10% resist five.\nAs of 2023, Palmer amaranth with resistance to six different herbicide modes of action has emerged. Annual bluegrass collected from a golf course in the U.S. state of Tennessee was found in 2020 to be resistant to seven herbicides at once. Rigid ryegrass and annual bluegrass share the distinction of the species with confirmed resistance to the largest number of herbicide modes of action, both with confirmed resistance to 12 different modes of action; however, this number references how many forms of herbicide resistance are known to have emerged in the species at some point, not how many have been found simultaneously in a single plant.\nIn 2015, Monsanto released crop seed varieties resistant to both dicamba and glyphosate, allowing for use of a greater variety of herbicides on fields without harming the crops. By 2020, five years after the release of dicamba-resistant seed, the first example of dicamba-resistant Palmer amaranth was found in one location.\nEvolutionary insights.\nWhen mutations occur in the genes responsible for the biological mechanisms that herbicides interfere with, these mutations may cause the herbicide mode of action to work less effectively. This is called target-site resistance. Specific mutations that have the most helpful effect for the plant have been shown to occur in separate instances and dominate throughout resistant weed populations. This is an example of convergent evolution. Some mutations conferring herbicide resistance may have fitness costs, reducing the plant's ability to survive in other ways, but over time, the least costly mutations tend to dominate in weed populations.\nRecently, incidences of non-target site resistance have increasingly emerged, such as examples where plants are capable of producing enzymes that neutralize herbicides before they can enter the plant's cells \u2013 metabolic resistance. This form of resistance is particularly challenging, since plants can develop non-target-site resistance to herbicides their ancestors were never directly exposed to.\nBiochemistry of resistance.\nResistance to herbicides can be based on one of the following biochemical mechanisms: \nThe following terms are also used to describe cases where plants are resistant to multiple herbicides at once:\nResistance management.\nDue to herbicide resistance \u2013 a major concern in agriculture \u2013 a number of products combine herbicides with different means of action. Integrated pest management may use herbicides alongside other pest control methods.\nIntegrated weed management (IWM) approach utilizes several tactics to combat weeds and forestall resistance. This approach relies less on herbicides and so selection pressure should be reduced. By relying on diverse weed control methods, including non-herbicide methods of weed control, the selection pressure on weeds to evolve resistance can be lowered. Researchers warn that if herbicide resistance is combatted only with more herbicides, \"evolution will most likely win.\" In 2017, the USEPA issued a revised Pesticide Registration Notice (PRN 2017-1), which provides guidance to pesticide registrants on required pesticide resistance management labeling. This requirement applies to all conventional pesticides and is meant to provide end-users with guidance on managing pesticide resistance. An example of a fully executed label compliant with the USEPA resistance management labeling guidance can be seen on the specimen label for the herbicide cloransulam-methyl, updated in 2022.\nOptimising herbicide input to the economic threshold level should avoid the unnecessary use of herbicides and reduce selection pressure. Herbicides should be used to their greatest potential by ensuring that the timing, dose, application method, soil and climatic conditions are optimal for good activity. In the UK, partially resistant grass weeds such as \"Alopecurus myosuroides\" (blackgrass) and Avena genus (wild oat) can often be controlled adequately when herbicides are applied at the 2-3 leaf stage, whereas later applications at the 2-3 tiller stage can fail badly. Patch spraying, or applying herbicide to only the badly infested areas of fields, is another means of reducing total herbicide use.\nApproaches to treating resistant weeds.\nAlternative herbicides.\nWhen resistance is first suspected or confirmed, the efficacy of alternatives is likely to be the first consideration. If there is resistance to a single group of herbicides, then the use of herbicides from other groups may provide a simple and effective solution, at least in the short term. For example, many triazine-resistant weeds have been readily controlled by the use of alternative herbicides such as dicamba or glyphosate.\nMixtures and sequences.\nThe use of two or more herbicides which have differing modes of action can reduce the selection for resistant genotypes. Ideally, each component in a mixture should:\nNo mixture is likely to have all these attributes, but the first two listed are the most important. There is a risk that mixtures will select for resistance to both components in the longer term. One practical advantage of sequences of two herbicides compared with mixtures is that a better appraisal of the efficacy of each herbicide component is possible, provided that sufficient time elapses between each application. A disadvantage with sequences is that two separate applications have to be made and it is possible that the later application will be less effective on weeds surviving the first application. If these are resistant, then the second herbicide in the sequence may increase selection for resistant individuals by killing the susceptible plants which were damaged but not killed by the first application, but allowing the larger, less affected, resistant plants to survive. This has been cited as one reason why ALS-resistant \"Stellaria media\" has evolved in Scotland recently (2000), despite the regular use of a sequence incorporating mecoprop, a herbicide with a different mode of action.\nNatural herbicide.\nThe term organic herbicide has come to mean herbicides intended for organic farming. Few natural herbicides rival the effectiveness of synthetics. Some plants also produce their own herbicides, such as the genus \"Juglans\" (walnuts), or the tree of heaven; such actions of natural herbicides, and other related chemical interactions, is called allelopathy. The applicability of these agents is unclear.\nFarming practices and resistance: a case study.\nHerbicide resistance became a critical problem in Australian agriculture after many Australian sheep farmers began to exclusively grow wheat in their pastures in the 1970s. Introduced varieties of ryegrass, while good for grazing sheep, compete intensely with wheat. Ryegrasses produce so many seeds that, if left unchecked, they can completely choke a field. Herbicides provided excellent control, reducing soil disruption because of less need to plough. Within little more than a decade, ryegrass and other weeds began to develop resistance. In response Australian farmers changed methods. By 1983, patches of ryegrass had become immune to Hoegrass (diclofop-methyl), a family of herbicides that inhibit an enzyme called acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase.\nRyegrass populations were large and had substantial genetic diversity because farmers had planted many varieties. Ryegrass is cross-pollinated by wind, so genes shuffle frequently. To control its distribution, farmers sprayed inexpensive Hoegrass, creating selection pressure. In addition, farmers sometimes diluted the herbicide to save money, which allowed some plants to survive application. Farmers turned to a group of herbicides that block acetolactate synthase when resistance appeared. Once again, ryegrass in Australia evolved a kind of \"cross-resistance\" that allowed it to break down various herbicides rapidly. Four classes of herbicides become ineffective within a few years. In 2013, only two herbicide classes called Photosystem II and long-chain fatty acid inhibitors, were effective against ryegrass.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They also continue to influence feelings and behavior even after some degree of consciousness developed later on.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"archetype\", \"original pattern from which copies are made,\" first entered into English usage in the 1540s. It derives from the Latin noun , latinization of the Greek noun (), whose adjective form is (), which means \"first-molded\", which is a compound of , \"beginning, origin\", and , which can mean, among other things, \"pattern\", \"model\", or \"type\". It, thus, referred to the beginning or origin of the pattern, model or type.\nArchetypes in literature.\nFunction.\nUsage of archetypes in specific pieces of writing is a holistic approach, which can help the writing win universal acceptance. This is because readers can relate to and identify with the characters and the situation, both socially and culturally. By deploying common archetypes contextually, a writer aims to impart realism to their work. According to many literary critics, archetypes have a standard and recurring depiction in a particular human culture or the whole human race that ultimately lays concrete pillars and can shape the whole structure in a literary work.\nStory archetypes.\nChristopher Booker, author of \"The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories\", argues that the following basic archetypes underlie all stories:\nThese themes coincide with the characters of Jung's archetypes.\nLiterary criticism.\nArchetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works and that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Cultural archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or made concrete by recurring images, symbols, or patterns (which may include motifs such as the \"quest\" or the \"heavenly ascent\"; recognizable character types such as the \"trickster\", \"saint\", \"martyr\" or the \"hero\"; symbols such as the apple or the snake; and imagery) and that have all been laden with meaning prior to their inclusion in any particular work.\nThe archetypes reveal shared roles universal among societies, such as the role of the mother in her natural relations with all members of the family. These archetypes create a shared imagery which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious, and mythical framework.\nJungian archetypes.\nThe concept of psychological archetypes was advanced by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, c. 1919. Jung has acknowledged that his conceptualization of archetype is influenced by Plato's Theory of forms, which he described as \"the formulated meaning of a primordial image by which it was represented symbolically.\" According to Jung, the term \"archetype\" is an explanatory paraphrase of the Platonic \"eidos\", also believed to represent the word \"form\". He maintained that Platonic archetypes are metaphysical ideas, paradigms, or models, and that real things are held to be only copies of these model ideas. However, archetypes are not easily recognizable in Plato's works in the way in which Jung meant them.\nIn Jung's psychological framework, archetypes are innate, libidinally collective schemas, universal prototypes for idea-sensory impression images and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a complex (e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype). Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through evolution. At the same time, it has also been observed that evolution can itself be considered an archetypal construct.\nJung states in part one of \"Man And His Symbols\" that:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My views about the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images,' have been constantly criticized by people who lack sufficient knowledge of the psychology of dreams and of mythology. The term 'archetype' is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological images or motifs, but these are nothing more than conscious representations. Such variable representations cannot be inherited. The archetype \"is a tendency to form such representations\" of a motif\u2014representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern.While there are a variety of categorizations of archetypes, Jung's configuration is perhaps the most well known and serves as the foundation for many other models. The four major archetypes to emerge from his work, which Jung originally terms \"primordial images,\" include the anima/animus, the self, the shadow, and the persona. Additionally, Jung referred to images of the wise old man, the child, the mother, and the maiden. He believed that each human mind retains these basic unconscious understandings of the human condition and the collective knowledge of our species in the construct of the collective unconscious.\nNeo-Jungian concepts.\nOther authors, such as Carol Pearson and Margaret Mark, have attributed 12 different archetypes to Jung, organized in three overarching categories, based on a fundamental driving force. These include:\nOther authors, such as Margaret Hartwell and Joshua Chen, go further to give these 12 archetypes families 5 archetypes each.\nThey are as follows:\nOther uses of archetypes.\nThere is also the position that the use of archetypes in different ways is possible because every archetype has multiple manifestations, with each one featuring different attributes. For instance, there is the position that the function of the archetype must be approached according to the context of biological sciences and is accomplished through the concept of the ultimate function. This pertains to the organism's response to those pressures in terms of biological trait.\nDichter's application of archetypes.\nLater in the 1900s, a Viennese psychologist named Dr. Ernest Dichter took these psychological constructs and applied them to marketing. Dichter moved to New York around 1939 and sent every ad agency on Madison Avenue a letter boasting of his new discovery. He found that applying these universal themes to products promoted easier discovery and stronger loyalty for brands.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is housed in the former , a Beaux-Arts railway station built from 1898 to 1900. The museum holds mainly French art (including works by France based foreign artists) dating from 1848 to 1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography. It houses the largest collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by painters including Berthe Morisot, Claude Monet, \u00c9douard Manet, Degas, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and van Gogh. Many of these works were held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum's opening in 1986. It is one of the largest art museums in Europe.\nIn 2022 the museum had 3.2 million visitors, up from 1.4 million in 2021. It was the sixth-most-visited art museum in the world in 2022, and second-most-visited art museum in France, after the Louvre.\nHistory.\nThe museum building was originally a railway station, , located next to the Seine river. Built on the site of the Palais d'Orsay, its central location was convenient for commuting travelers. The station was constructed for the and finished in time for the 1900 Exposition Universelle to the design of three architects: Lucien Magne, \u00c9mile B\u00e9nard and Victor Laloux. The Gare d'Orsay design was considered to be an \"anachronism\". The museum building is accountable to 19th-century aesthetics and construction techniques that were molded to accommodate modern life. Paris had become a modern capital city following grand changes implemented by Napoleon III and Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann. So architecture was allocated a permanent exhibition area in the museum showcasing the new Paris opera house, the designed by Charles Garnier and built from 1863 to 1875. At the end of the museum's central aisle a space was dedicated to town planning, architecture and decoration.\nIn the 1970s work began on building a 1 km-long tunnel under the station as part of the creation of line C of the with a new station under the old station. In 1970, permission was granted to demolish the station but Jacques Duhamel, Minister for Cultural Affairs, ruled against plans to build a new hotel in its stead. The station was put on the supplementary list of Historic Monuments and finally listed in 1978. The suggestion to turn the station into a museum came from the Directorate of the Museum of France. The idea was to build a museum that would bridge the gap between the Louvre and the National Museum of Modern Art at the Georges Pompidou Centre. The plan was accepted by Georges Pompidou and a study was commissioned in 1974. In 1978, a competition was organized to design the new museum. ACT Architecture, a team of three young architects (Pierre Colboc, Renaud Bardon and Jean-Paul Philippon), were awarded the contract which involved creating of new floorspace on four floors. The construction work was carried out by Bouygues. In 1981, the Italian architect Gae Aulenti was chosen to design the interior including the internal arrangement, decoration, furniture and fittings of the museum. The arrangement of the galleries she designed was elaborate and inhabited the three main levels that are under the museum's barrel vault atrium. On the main level of the building, a central nave was formed by the surrounding stone structures that were previously the building's train platforms. The central nave's structures break up the immense sculpture and gallery spaces and provided more organized units for viewing the art.\nIn July 1986, the museum was ready to receive its exhibits. It took 6 months to install the 2,000 or so paintings, 600 sculptures and other works. The museum officially opened in December 1986 by then-president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. At any time about 3,000 art pieces are on display within Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. Within the museum is a 1:100 scale model created by Richard Peduzzi of an aerial view of Paris Opera and surrounding area. This model is encapsulated underneath glass flooring that viewers walk on as they proceed through the museum. This installation allows the viewers to understand the city planning of Paris at the time, which has made this attraction one of the most popular within the museum.\nAnother exhibit within the museum is \"A Passion for France: The Marlene and Spencer Hays Collection\". This collection was donated by Marlene and Spencer Hays, art collectors who reside in Texas and have been collecting art since the early 1970s. In 2016 the museum complied to keeping the collection of about 600 art pieces in one collection rather than dispersed throughout other exhibits. Since World War II, France has not been donated a collection of foreign art this large. The collection favors mostly post-impressionist works. Artists featured in this collection are Bonnard, Vuillard, Maurice Denis, Odilon Redon, Aristide Maillol, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Edgar Degas, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. To make room for the art that has been donated, the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay is scheduled to undergo a radical transformation over the next decade, 2020 on. This remodel is funded in part by an anonymous US patron who donated \u20ac20 million to a building project known as \"Orsay Grand Ouvert\" (Orsay Wide Open). The gift was made via the American Friends of the Mus\u00e9es d'Orsay et de l'Orangerie. The projected completion date is 2026, implementing new galleries and education opportunities to endorse a conductive experience.\nThe square next to the museum displays six bronze allegorical sculptural groups in a row, originally produced for the :\nCollection.\nSculptures.\nSculpture was in high demand in the 19th century and became widely used as a way to display a person's social and political standings. The style and ideology represented by many of the sculptures were out of fashion by the mid-20th century, and the sculptures were put into storage and no longer displayed. It wasn't until the conversion of the Orsay railway station into the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay museum in the 1970s that many sculptures from the 19th century were placed on exhibit again. The substantial nave inside the new museum offered a perfect area for the display of sculptures. During the grand opening in December 1986 of the museum, 1,200 sculptures were present, brought in from collections such as the Louvre, state loans, and Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. The museum also obtained more than 200 sculptures before opening though donations of art connoisseurs, the lineage of artists, and people\nin support of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\nSince the grand opening in 1986 the museum has collected works from exchanges that other museums or institutions once showcased such as \"Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science\" by Louis-Ernest Barrias that was initially commissioned for Conservatoire des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, as well as \"The Thinker\" and \"The Gates of Hell\" by Auguste Rodin. The museum also purchases specific works to fill gaps and finish the collections already in the museum such as one of the panels of \"Be Mysterious\" by Paul Gauguin, the full set of Honor\u00e9 Daumier's \"C\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9s du Juste Milieu\", and \"Maturity\" by Camille Claudel.

It is home to both Palace House and the National Motor Museum. In 2020, it was named the fifth most beautiful village in the UK and Ireland by \"Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler\".\nHistory.\nThe name \"Beaulieu\" comes from the French \"beau lieu\", which means \"beautiful place\". It is derived from Beaulieu Abbey, which was populated by 30 monks sent from the French abbey of C\u00eeteaux, the mother house of the Cistercian order. The medieval Latin name of the monastery was \"Bellus Locus Regis\" (\"the beautiful place of the king\") or \"monasterium Belli loci Regis\".\nDuring the Second World War, the Beaulieu Estate of Lord Montagu in the New Forest was the site of group B schools for agents operated by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) between 1941 and 1945. One of the trainers was Kim Philby, who was later found to be spying for the Soviets. In 2005, a special exhibition was installed at the Beaulieu Estate, with a video showing photographs from that era as well as voice recordings of former SOE trainers and agents.\nThe village has remained largely unspoilt by industrial progress and is a favourite stop for tourists in the area, as well as birdwatchers seeking local species like the Dartford warbler, European honey buzzard, and Eurasian hobby.\nTransport.\nThe nearest railway station is Beaulieu Road, about away on the London-Weymouth main line. While the station previously had infrequent service, 20 trains a day now stop there. Wilts &amp; Dorset bus service 112 serves the village on its way between Hythe and Lymington. In the summer, Beaulieu is served by the New Forest Tour, an hourly open-top bus service.\nPalace House.\nPalace House, not to be confused with the Palace of Beaulieu in Essex, overlooks the village from across the Beaulieu River and began in 1204 as the gatehouse to Beaulieu Abbey. It has been the ancestral home of a branch of the Montagu family since 1538, when it was seized from the monks and sold during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries.\nThe house was extended in the 16th century, and again in the 19th century; today, it is a fine example of a Gothic country house. Although still home to the current Lord and Lady Montagu, parts of the house and gardens are open to the public every day. It is a member of the Treasure Houses of England consortium.\nCulture.\nThe village is home to the National Motor Museum, opened in 1952 as the Montagu Motor Museum before becoming a charitable trust in 1972. It contains an important collection of historic motor vehicles, including four world land speed record holders: Sir Malcolm Campbell's 1920 Sunbeam 350hp, his son Donald Campbell's 1961 Bluebird-Proteus CN7, the 1927 Sunbeam 1000hp (the first motor car to reach ), and the 1929 Irving-Napier Special 'Golden Arrow'. The latter two were both driven by Major Henry Segrave.\nIn the late 1950s, Beaulieu was the surprising location for one of Britain's first experiments in pop festival culture, with the annual Beaulieu Jazz Festival, which quickly expanded to become a significant event in the burgeoning jazz and youth pop music scene of the period. Camping overnight, a rural invasion, eccentric dress, wild music and sometimes wilder behaviour; these now familiar features of pop festivals happened at Beaulieu each summer, culminating in the so-called 'Battle of Beaulieu' at the 1960 festival, when rival gangs of modern and traditional jazz fans indulged in a spot of what sociologists went on to call 'subcultural contestation'.\nIn popular culture.\nPalace House was featured in the comedy-drama film \"Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont\" (2005).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was called on to stage after the curtain, where he received enthusiastic applause. Amidst the cheers, one audience member booed. Shaw riposted, \"My dear fellow, I quite agree with you, but what are we two against so many?\"\n\"Arms and the Man\" humorously exposes the futility of war and the hypocrisies of human nature.\nSource: \"The Stage\".\nPlot summary.\nThe play takes place during the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War. Its heroine, Raina Petkoff, is a young Bulgarian woman engaged to Sergius Saranoff, a battlefield hero whom she idolizes. On the night after the Battle of Slivnitza, Captain Bluntschli, a Swiss mercenary in the defeated Serbian army, climbs in through her bedroom balcony and threatens her not to give the alarm. When Russian and Bulgarian troops burst in to search for him, Raina hides him. He tells her that \"nine soldiers out of ten are born fools\". Bluntschli's businesslike attitude to war shocks the idealistic Raina, especially after he admits that he uses his ammunition pouches to carry chocolates rather than pistol cartridges. When the search dies down, Raina and her mother Catherine sneak him out of the house, disguised in one of Raina's father's old coats.\nThe war ends and Raina's father, Major Paul Petkoff, returns home with Sergius. Raina begins to find Sergius bombastic and tiresome, but she hides it. Sergius also finds Raina's romantic ideals tiresome, and flirts with Raina's insolent servant girl Louka (a soubrette role), who is engaged to the Petkoffs' manservant Nicola. Bluntschli unexpectedly returns to give back the old coat, but also to see Raina. Raina and her mother are shocked when Major Petkoff and Sergius reveal that they have met Bluntschli before and invite him to lunch (and to help them figure out how to send the troops home).\nLeft alone with Bluntschli, Raina realizes that though he sees through her romanticism, he respects her, as Sergius does not. She reveals that she left a photograph of herself in a pocket of the coat, inscribed \"To my chocolate-cream soldier\", but Bluntschli says he did not find it, and it must still be in the coat. Bluntschli gets a telegram informing him of his father's death: he must now take over the family's luxury hotels in Switzerland.\nLouka gossips to Sergius that Raina had protected Bluntschli and is in love with him. Sergius challenges Bluntschli to a duel, but Bluntschli evades it. Sergius and Raina break off their engagement, with some relief on both sides. Major Petkoff discovers the photograph in the pocket of his old coat; Raina and Bluntschli try to dispose of it, but Petkoff is determined to learn the truth and claims that the \"chocolate-cream soldier\" is Sergius. After Bluntschli confesses the whole story to Major Petkoff, Sergius proposes marriage to Louka (to Major Petkoff and Catherine's horror); the manservant Nicola quietly and gallantly lets Sergius have her; and Bluntschli, recognising Nicola's merits, offers him a job as hotel manager.\nWhile Raina is now unattached, Bluntschli protests that\u2014being 34 and believing she is 17\u2014he is too old for her. On learning that she is actually 23, he immediately proposes and shows her the telegram announcing his inheritance. Raina, realizing the hollowness of her romantic ideals, protests that she would prefer him as a poor \"chocolate-cream soldier\" than as a wealthy businessman. Bluntschli protests that he is still the same person, and she proclaims her love for him. The play ends as Bluntschli, with Swiss precision, arranges the major's troop movements and informs them he will return to marry Raina in exactly two weeks.\nReception.\nGeorge Orwell said that \"Arms and the Man\" was written when Shaw was at the height of his powers as a dramatist. \"It is probably the wittiest play he ever wrote, the most flawless technically, and in spite of being a very light comedy, the most telling.\" His other plays of the period, equally well written, were about issues that, according to Orwell, were no longer controversial at the time Orwell was writing. For example, the theme of \"Mrs. Warren's Profession\", which so shocked audiences at the time, was that the causes of prostitution are mainly economic, which was already a common opinion in Orwell's time, and the play \"Widowers' Houses\" was an attack on slum landlords, who had since become stock villains.\nIn 2024, an attempt to stage John Malkovich's production of the play at Ivan Vazov National Theatre of Bulgaria was targeted by nationalist protesters that considered it a calumny of Bulgaria. The mob surrounded the theatre, threw smoke bombs, prevented the visitors that had bought tickets from entering the theatre hall, accusing them of being traitors and threatening them, and physically assaulted the director of the play and the director of the theatre.\nPejorative military use of \"chocolate soldier\".\nThe chocolate-cream soldier of the play has inspired a pejorative military use of the term. Israeli soldiers use the term \"chocolate soldier\" (\"hayal shel shokolad\", \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc \u05e9\u05dc \u05e9\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3) to disparage a soldier not tough enough to fight. The Australian Citizens Military Force were derided by the regular army as \"chokos\" or chocolate soldiers, implying they were not real soldiers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53926", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53926", "title": "Lucan", "text": "Roman poet (AD 39\u201365)\nMarcus Annaeus Lucanus (3 November AD 39 \u2013 30 April AD 65), better known in English as Lucan (), was a Roman poet, born in Corduba, Hispania Baetica (present-day C\u00f3rdoba, Spain). He is regarded as one of the outstanding figures of the Imperial Latin period, known in particular for his epic \"Pharsalia\". His youth and speed of composition set him apart from other poets.\nLife.\nThree brief ancient accounts allow for the reconstruction of a modest biography \u2013 the earliest attributed to Suetonius, another to an otherwise unknown Vacca, and the third anonymous and undated \u2013 along with references in Martial, Cassius Dio, Tacitus's \"Annals\", and one of Statius's \"Silvae\". Lucan was born in the Roman colony of Corduba into a wealthy family of central Italic origins; he was the son of Marcus Annaeus Mela and grandson of Seneca the Elder. He grew up under the tutelage of his uncle Seneca the Younger. He studied rhetoric at Athens and was probably provided with a philosophical and Stoic education by his uncle.\nThe 5th-century author Sidonius Apollinaris implies that Polla Argentaria\u2014Lucan's wife\u2014may have assisted him in the creation of the \"Pharsalia\", though the philologist Peter White suggests that this story could easily be a later invention and denigrates the account as \"sentimental fancy\".\nHe found success under Nero, became one of the emperor's close friends and was rewarded with a quaestorship in advance of the legal age. In AD 60, he won a prize for extemporizing \"Orpheus\" and \"Laudes Neronis\" at the quinquennial Neronia, and was again rewarded when the emperor appointed him to the augurate. During this time he circulated the first three books of his epic poem \"Pharsalia\" (labelled \"De Bello civili\" in the manuscripts), which told the story of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey.\nAt some point, a feud began between Nero and Lucan. Two very different accounts of the events have survived that both trivialize the feud. According to Tacitus, Nero became jealous of Lucan and forbade him to publish his poems. According to Suetonius, Nero disrupted a public reading by Lucan, by leaving and calling a meeting of the senate, and Lucan responded by writing insulting poems about Nero.\nOther works, though, point to a more serious basis to the feud. Works by the grammarian Vacca and the poet Statius may support the claim that Lucan wrote insulting poems about Nero. Vacca mentions that one of Lucan's works was entitled \"De Incendio Urbis\" (On the Burning of the City). Statius's ode to Lucan mentions that Lucan described how the \"unspeakable flames of the criminal tyrant roamed the heights of Remus.\" Additionally, the later books of \"Pharsalia\" are anti-Imperial and pro-Republic. This criticism of Nero and office of the Emperor may have been the true cause of the ban.\nLucan later joined the conspiracy of Gaius Calpurnius Piso against Nero. The conspiracy was discovered and he was obliged, at the age of 25, to commit suicide by opening a vein, but not before incriminating his mother, Acilia, among others, in the hopes of a pardon. According to Tacitus, as Lucan bled to death, \"(he) recalled some poetry he had composed in which he had told the story of a wounded soldier dying a similar kind of death and he recited the very lines. These were his last words.\" An alternative interpretation of events is that his death was not by suicide, but was an execution carried out at Nero's command. \nHis father was involved in the proscription, but his mother escaped. Statius's poem about Lucan was addressed to his widow, Polla Argentaria, upon the occasion of his birthday during the reign of Domitian (\"Silvae\", ii.7, the \"Genethliacon Lucani\").\nWorks.\nAccording to Vacca and Statius, Lucan's works included:\nSurviving work:\nOften attributed to him (but to others as well):\nLost works:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A non-strict form allows one exception to this format restriction for allowing the empty word (epsilon, \u03b5) to be a member of the described language. The normal form was established by Sheila Greibach and it bears her name.\nMore precisely, a context-free grammar is in Greibach normal form, if all production rules are of the form:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is a nonterminal symbol, formula_3 is a terminal symbol, and\nformula_4 is a (possibly empty) sequence of nonterminal symbols.\nObserve that the grammar does not have left recursions.\nEvery context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent grammar in Greibach normal form. Various constructions exist. Some do not permit the second form of rule and cannot transform context-free grammars that can generate the empty word.

The algorithm is named after some of its rediscoverers: John Cocke, Daniel Younger, Tadao Kasami, and Jacob T. Schwartz. It employs bottom-up parsing and dynamic programming.\nThe standard version of CYK operates only on context-free grammars given in Chomsky normal form (CNF). However any context-free grammar may be algorithmically transformed into a CNF grammar expressing the same language .\nThe importance of the CYK algorithm stems from its high efficiency in certain situations. Using big \"O\" notation, the worst case running time of CYK is formula_1, where formula_2 is the length of the parsed string and formula_3 is the size of the CNF grammar formula_4 . This makes it one of the most efficient parsing algorithms in terms of worst-case asymptotic complexity, although other algorithms exist with better average running time in many practical scenarios.\nStandard form.\nThe dynamic programming algorithm requires the context-free grammar to be rendered into Chomsky normal form (CNF), because it tests for possibilities to split the current sequence into two smaller sequences. Any context-free grammar that does not generate the empty string can be represented in CNF using only production rules of the forms formula_5 and formula_6; to allow for the empty string, one can explicitly allow formula_7, where formula_8 is the start symbol.\nAlgorithm.\nAs pseudocode.\nThe algorithm in pseudocode is as follows:\n let the input be a string \"I\" consisting of \"n\" characters: \"a\"1 ... \"a\"\"n\".\n let the grammar contain \"r\" nonterminal symbols \"R\"1 ... \"R\"\"r\", with start symbol \"R\"1.\n let \"P\"[\"n\",\"n\",\"r\"] be an array of booleans. Initialize all elements of \"P\" to false.\n let \"back\"[\"n\",\"n\",\"r\"] be an array of lists of backpointing triples. Initialize all elements of \"back\" to the empty list.\n for each \"s\" = 1 to \"n\"\n for each unit production \"R\"\"v\" \u2192 \"a\"\"s\"\n set \"P\"[\"1\",\"s\",\"v\"] = true\n for each \"l\" = 2 to \"n\" \"-- Length of span\"\n for each \"s\" = 1 to \"n\"-\"l\"+1 \"-- Start of span\"\n for each \"p\" = 1 to \"l\"-1 \"-- Partition of span\"\n for each production \"R\"\"a\" \u2192 \"R\"\"b\" \"R\"\"c\"\n if \"P\"[\"p\",\"s\",\"b\"] and \"P\"[\"l\"-\"p\",\"s\"+\"p\",\"c\"] then\n set \"P\"[\"l\",\"s\",\"a\"] = true, \n append to \"back\"[\"l\",\"s\",\"a\"]\n if \"P\"[n,\"1\",\"1\"] is true then\n \"I\" is member of language\n return \"back\" -- by \"retracing the steps through back, one can easily construct all possible parse trees of the string.\"\n else\n return \"not a member of language\"\nProbabilistic CYK (for finding the most probable parse).\nAllows to recover the most probable parse given the probabilities of all productions.\n let the input be a string \"I\" consisting of \"n\" characters: \"a\"1 ... \"a\"\"n\".\n let the grammar contain \"r\" nonterminal symbols \"R\"1 ... \"R\"\"r\", with start symbol \"R\"1.\n let \"P\"[\"n\",\"n\",\"r\"] be an array of real numbers. Initialize all elements of \"P\" to zero.\n let \"back\"[\"n\",\"n\",\"r\"] be an array of backpointing triples.\n for each \"s\" = 1 to \"n\"\n for each unit production \"R\"\"v\" \u2192\"a\"\"s\"\n set \"P\"[\"1\",\"s\",\"v\"] = Pr(\"R\"\"v\" \u2192\"a\"\"s\")\n for each \"l\" = 2 to \"n\" \"-- Length of span\"\n for each \"s\" = 1 to \"n\"-\"l\"+1 \"-- Start of span\"\n for each \"p\" = 1 to \"l\"-1 \"-- Partition of span\" \n for each production \"R\"\"a\" \u2192 \"R\"\"b\" \"R\"\"c\"\n prob_splitting = Pr(\"R\"\"a\" \u2192\"R\"\"b\" \"R\"\"c\") * \"P\"[\"p\",\"s\",\"b\"] * \"P\"[\"l\"-\"p\",\"s\"+\"p\",\"c\"]\n if prob_splitting &gt; \"P\"[\"l\",\"s\",\"a\"] then \n set \"P\"[\"l\",\"s\",\"a\"] = prob_splitting\n set \"back\"[\"l\",\"s\",\"a\"] = \n if \"P\"[n,\"1\",\"1\"] &gt; 0 then\n find the parse tree by retracing through \"back\"\n return the parse tree\n else\n return \"not a member of language\"\nAs prose.\nIn informal terms, this algorithm considers every possible substring of the input string and sets formula_9 to be true if the substring of length formula_10 starting from formula_11 can be generated from the nonterminal formula_12. Once it has considered substrings of length 1, it goes on to substrings of length 2, and so on. For substrings of length 2 and greater, it considers every possible partition of the substring into two parts, and checks to see if there is some production formula_13 such that formula_14 matches the first part and formula_15 matches the second part. If so, it records formula_16 as matching the whole substring. Once this process is completed, the input string is generated by the grammar if the substring containing the entire input string is matched by the start symbol.\nExample.\nThis is an example grammar:\nformula_17\nNow the sentence \"she eats a fish with a fork\" is analyzed using the CYK algorithm. In the following table, in formula_18, i is the number of the row (starting at the bottom at 1), and j is the number of the column (starting at the left at 1).\nFor readability, the CYK table for \"P\" is represented here as a 2-dimensional matrix \"M\" containing a set of non-terminal symbols, such that Rk is in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; if, and only if, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nIn the above example, since a start symbol \"S\" is in &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the sentence can be generated by the grammar.\nExtensions.\nGenerating a parse tree.\nThe above algorithm is a recognizer that will only determine if a sentence is in the language. It is simple to extend it into a parser that also constructs a parse tree, by storing parse tree nodes as elements of the array, instead of the boolean 1. The node is linked to the array elements that were used to produce it, so as to build the tree structure. Only one such node in each array element is needed if only one parse tree is to be produced. However, if all parse trees of an ambiguous sentence are to be kept, it is necessary to store in the array element a list of all the ways the corresponding node can be obtained in the parsing process. This is sometimes done with a second table B[n,n,r] of so-called \"backpointers\".\nThe end result is then a shared-forest of possible parse trees, where common trees parts are factored between the various parses. This shared forest can conveniently be read as an ambiguous grammar generating only the sentence parsed, but with the same ambiguity as the original grammar, and the same parse trees up to a very simple renaming of non-terminals, as shown by .\nParsing non-CNF context-free grammars.\nAs pointed out by , the drawback of all known transformations into Chomsky normal form is that they can lead to an undesirable bloat in grammar size. The size of a grammar is the sum of the sizes of its production rules, where the size of a rule is one plus the length of its right-hand side. Using formula_19 to denote the size of the original grammar, the size blow-up in the worst case may range from formula_20 to formula_21, depending on the transformation algorithm used. For the use in teaching, Lange and Lei\u00df propose a slight generalization of the CYK algorithm, \"without compromising efficiency of the algorithm, clarity of its presentation, or simplicity of proofs\" .\nParsing weighted context-free grammars.\nIt is also possible to extend the CYK algorithm to parse strings using weighted and stochastic context-free grammars. Weights (probabilities) are then stored in the table P instead of booleans, so P[i,j,A] will contain the minimum weight (maximum probability) that the substring from i to j can be derived from A. Further extensions of the algorithm allow all parses of a string to be enumerated from lowest to highest weight (highest to lowest probability).\nNumerical stability.\nWhen the probabilistic CYK algorithm is applied to a long string, the splitting probability can become very small due to multiplying many probabilities together. This can be dealt with by summing log-probability instead of multiplying probabilities.\nValiant's algorithm.\nThe worst case running time of CYK is formula_22, where \"n\" is the length of the parsed string and |\"G\"| is the size of the CNF grammar \"G\". This makes it one of the most efficient algorithms for recognizing general context-free languages in practice. gave an extension of the CYK algorithm. His algorithm computes the same parsing table\nas the CYK algorithm; yet he showed that algorithms for efficient multiplication of matrices with 0-1-entries can be utilized for performing this computation.\nUsing the Coppersmith\u2013Winograd algorithm for multiplying these matrices, this gives an asymptotic worst-case running time of formula_23. However, the constant term hidden by the Big O Notation is so large that the Coppersmith\u2013Winograd algorithm is only worthwhile for matrices that are too large to handle on present-day computers , and this approach requires subtraction and so is only suitable for recognition. The dependence on efficient matrix multiplication cannot be avoided altogether: has proved that any parser for context-free grammars working in time formula_24 can be effectively converted into an algorithm computing the product of formula_25-matrices with 0-1-entries in time formula_26, and this was extended by Abboud et al. to apply to a constant-size grammar.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Partially serialised in the American journal \"The Little Review\" from March 1918 to December 1920, the entire work was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's fortieth birthday. It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and a classic of the genre, having been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement\".\n\"Ulysses\" chronicles the experiences of three Dubliners over the course of a single day, 16 June 1904 (which its fans now celebrate annually as Bloomsday). Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem the \"Odyssey\", and the novel establishes a series of parallels between Leopold Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus. There are also correspondences with William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\" and with other literary, religious, and mythological figures, including Jesus, Elijah, Moses, Dante Alighieri and Don Juan. Such themes as antisemitism, human sexuality, British rule in Ireland, Catholicism and Irish nationalism are treated in the context of early-20th-century Dublin. It is highly allusive and written in a variety of styles.\nThe writer Djuna Barnes quoted Joyce as saying, \"The pity is ... the public will demand and find a moral in my book\u2014or worse they may take it in some more serious way, and on the honour of a gentleman, there is not one single serious line in it. ... In \"Ulysses\" I have recorded, simultaneously, what a man says, sees, thinks, and what such seeing, thinking, saying does, to what you Freudians call the subconscious.\"\nAccording to the writer Declan Kiberd, \"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking\". Its stream of consciousness technique, careful structuring and prose of an experimental nature\u2014replete with puns, parodies, epiphanies and allusions\u2014as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works. Since its publication it has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 to protracted disputes about the authoritative version of the text.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nJoyce first encountered the figure of Odysseus/Ulysses in Charles Lamb's \"Adventures of Ulysses\", an adaptation of \"The Odyssey\" for children, which seems to have established the Latin name in Joyce's mind. At school he wrote an essay on the character, titled \"My Favourite Hero\". Joyce told Frank Budgen that he considered Ulysses the only all-round character in literature. He considered writing another short story for \"Dubliners\", to be titled \"Ulysses\" and based on a Jewish Dubliner named Alfred H. Hunter, a putative cuckold. The idea grew from a story in 1906, to a \"short book\" in 1907, to the vast novel he began in 1914.\nLocations.\nThe action of the novel moves from one side of Dublin Bay to the other, opening in Sandycove to the south of the city and closing on Howth Head to the north. The plot of the first three chapters, along with chapter 12, \"Nausicaa\", takes place on the shores of Dublin Bay, off the map.\nThe orange line on the map shows the route of Paddy Dignam's carriage ride from episode 6 (\"Hades\"). The Viceroy's journey in episode 10 (\"The Wandering Rocks\") appears in blue. Bloom and Steven's route in episode 18 (\"Penelope\") appears in red.\nStructure.\n\"Ulysses\" is divided into the three books (marked I, II, and III) and 18 episodes. The episodes do not have chapter headings or titles, and are numbered only in Gabler's edition. In the various editions, the breaks between episodes are indicated in different ways; in the Modern Library edition, for example, each episode begins at the top of a new page.\nJoyce seems to have relished his book's obscurity, saying he had \"put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring [sic] one's immortality\". The judge who decided that \"Ulysses\" was not obscene admitted that it \"is not an easy book to read or to understand\", and advised reading \"a number of other books which have now become its satellites\". One such book available at the time was Herbert Gorman's first book on Joyce, which included his own brief list of correspondences between \"Ulysses\" and the \"Odyssey\". Another was Stuart Gilbert's study of \"Ulysses\", which included a schema of the novel Joyce created. Gilbert was later quoted in the legal brief prepared for the obscenity trial. Joyce had already sent Carlo Linati a different schema. The Gilbert and Linati schemata made the links to the \"Odyssey\" clearer and also explained the work's structure.\nJoyce and Homer.\nThe 18 episodes of \"Ulysses\" \"roughly correspond to the episodes in Homer's \"Odyssey\"\". In Homer's epic, Odysseus, \"a Greek hero of the Trojan War ... took ten years to find his way from Troy to his home on the island of Ithaca\". Homer's poem includes violent storms and a shipwreck, giants, monsters, gods, and goddesses, while Joyce's novel takes place during an ordinary day in early 20th-century Dublin. Leopold Bloom, \"a Jewish advertisement canvasser\", corresponds to Odysseus in Homer's epic; Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist of Joyce's earlier, largely autobiographical \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\", corresponds to Odysseus's son Telemachus; and Bloom's wife Molly corresponds to Penelope, Odysseus's wife, who waited 20 years for him to return.\n\"The Odyssey\" is divided into 24 books, which are divided into 3 parts of 4, 8, and 12 books. Although \"Ulysses\" has fewer episodes, their division into 3 parts of 3, 12, and 3 episodes is determined by the tripartite division of \"The Odyssey\". Joyce referred to the episodes by their Homeric titles in his letters. The novel's text does not include the episode titles used below, which originate from the Linati and Gilbert schemata. Joyce scholars have drawn upon both to identify and explain the parallels between \"Ulysses\" and \"The Odyssey\".\nScholars have argued that Victor B\u00e9rard's , which Joyce discovered in Zurich while writing \"Ulysses\", influenced his creation of the novel's Homeric parallels. B\u00e9rard's theory that \"The Odyssey\" had Semitic roots accords with Joyce's reincarnation of Odysseus as the Jewish Leopold Bloom.\nEzra Pound regarded the Homeric correspondences as \"a scaffold, a means of construction, justified by the result, and justifiable by it only. The result is a triumph in form, in balance, a main schema with continuous weaving and arabesque.\" For T. S. Eliot, the Homeric correspondences had \"the importance of a scientific discovery\". He wrote, \"In manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity\u00a0... Mr. Joyce is pursing a method which others must pursue after him.\" This method \"is simply a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history\".\nEdmund Wilson wrote, \"The adventures of Ulysses ... do represent the ordinary man in nearly every common relation. Yet I cannot but feel that Mr. Joyce made a mistake to have the whole plan of his story depend on the structure of the \"Odyssey\" rather than on the natural demands of the situation. ... His taste for symbolism is closely allied with his extraordinary poetic faculty for investing particular incidents with universal significance, nevertheless ... it sometimes overruns the bounds of art into an arid ingenuity which would make a mystic correspondence do duty for an artistic reason. The result is that one sometimes feels as if the brilliant succession of episodes were taking place on the periphery of a wheel which has no hub.\"\nIn the late 1930s Joyce told Samuel Beckett, \"I may have over-systematized \"Ulysses\".\" Around 1937, in a conversation with Vladimir Nabokov, Joyce disparaged the use of mythology in modern literature. Nabokov replied, \"But you employed Homer!\" \"A whim\", Joyce said. When Nabokov pointed to his collaboration with Stuart Gilbert, Joyce replied, \"A terrible mistake ... an advertisement for the book. I regret it very much.\"\nThe American literary scholar William York Tindall has written, \"Joyce considered Homer's myth the complete expression of man. ... Exile, home, humanity, and art, Joyce's concerns, found expression in Homer's \"Odyssey\". ... But the Homeric pattern is only one level of the narrative Joyce composed. Another level is the Christian pattern. ... Bloom is not only Odysseus but Jesus-God. These traditional beliefs, however, are less important than the main level of Joyce's myth: the story of Stephen Dedalus and Mr. Bloom in Dublin or the present, the particular, and the personal. \"Ulysses\" is a narrative composition of three levels, to which, by allusion, Joyce added others of less importance. His myth is not the \"Odyssey\" but \"Ulysses\".\"\nJoyce and Shakespeare.\nAfter Homer's \"Odyssey\", the literary work \"Ulysses\" parallels most closely is William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\". The play is mentioned in \"Telemachus\". \"Hamlet\" is a symbol in the Linati schema. In the Library episode, Stephen Dedalus puts forth a theory of \"Hamlet\" based on 12 lectures, now lost, that Joyce gave in Trieste in 1912. Chief among the implied parallels with \"Ulysses\" are Shakespeare and Joyce, King Hamlet and Leopold Bloom, and Prince Hamlet and Stephen.\nAccording to Stephen, Shakespeare has a double presence in \"Hamlet\". The king is the mature Shakespeare; the prince is Shakespeare as a young man. Stephen's insistence on Shakespeare's double presence in \"Hamlet\" hints at Joyce's double presence in \"Ulysses\". Bloom is the mature Joyce; Stephen is Joyce as a young man. Other parallels with \"Hamlet\" include Gertrude and Molly Bloom, Claudius and Buck Mulligan, and Claudius and Blazes Boylan.\nLike Shakespeare, Dante was a major influence on Joyce. It has been argued that the interrelationship of Joyce, Dedalus, and Bloom is defined in the Incarnation doctrines Stephen lists in \"Telemachus\".\nPlot summary.\nPart I: Telemachia.\nEpisode 1, \"Telemachus\".\nAt 8 a.m., Malachi \"Buck\" Mulligan, a boisterous medical student, calls an aspiring writer, Stephen Dedalus, up to the roof of the Sandycove Martello tower, where they live. There is tension between Stephen and Mulligan: Stephen overheard Mulligan make a cruel remark about Stephen's recently deceased mother, and Mulligan has invited an English student, Haines, whom Stephen dislikes, to stay with them. The three men eat breakfast and walk to the shore, where Mulligan demands from Stephen the key to the tower and a loan. The three make plans to meet at a pub, The Ship, at 12:30pm. Departing, Stephen decides that he will not return to the tower that night, as Mulligan, the \"usurper\", has taken it over.\nEpisode 2, \"Nestor\".\nStephen is teaching a history class on the victories of Pyrrhus of Epirus. After class, one student, Cyril Sargent, stays behind so that Stephen can show him how to do a set of algebraic exercises. Stephen looks at Sargent's ugly face and tries to imagine Sargent's mother's love for him. He then visits unionist school headmaster Garrett Deasy, from whom he collects his pay. Deasy asks Stephen to take his long-winded letter about foot-and-mouth disease to a newspaper office for printing. The two discuss Irish history and Deasy lectures on what he believes is the role of Jews in the economy. As Stephen leaves, Deasy jokes that Ireland has \"never persecuted the Jews\" because the country \"never let them in\". This episode is the source of some of the novel's best-known lines, such as Dedalus's claim that \"history is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake\" and that God is \"a shout in the street\".\nEpisode 3, \"Proteus\".\nStephen walks along Sandymount Strand for some time, mulling various philosophical concepts, his family, his life as a student in Paris, and his mother's death. As he reminisces he lies down among some rocks, watches a couple whose dog urinates behind a rock, scribbles some ideas for poetry and picks his nose. This chapter is characterised by a stream of consciousness narrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen's education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode, which have earned it a reputation for being one of the book's most difficult chapters.\nPart II: Odyssey.\nEpisode 4, \"Calypso\".\nThe narrative shifts abruptly. The time is again 8 a.m., but the action has moved across the city and to the second protagonist of the book, Leopold Bloom, a part-Jewish advertising canvasser. The episode opens with the line \"Mr. Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.\" After starting to prepare breakfast, Bloom decides to walk to a butcher to buy a mutton kidney. Returning home, he prepares breakfast and brings it with the mail to his wife Molly as she lounges in bed. One of the letters is from her concert manager Blazes Boylan, with whom she is having an affair. Bloom reads a letter from their daughter Milly Bloom, who tells him about her progress in the photography business in Mullingar. The episode closes with Bloom reading a magazine story titled \"Matcham's Masterstroke\", by Mr. Philip Beaufoy, while defecating in the outhouse.\nEpisode 5, \"Lotus Eaters\".\nWhile making his way to Westland Row post office Bloom is tormented by the knowledge that Molly will welcome Boylan into her bed later that day. At the post office he surreptitiously collects a love letter from one 'Martha Clifford' addressed to his pseudonym, 'Henry Flower'. He meets an acquaintance, and while they chat, Bloom attempts to ogle a woman wearing stockings, but is prevented by a passing tram. Next, he reads the letter from Martha Clifford and tears up the envelope in an alley. He wanders into a Catholic church during a service and muses on theology. The priest has the letters I.N.R.I. or I.H.S. on his back; Molly had told Bloom that they meant \"I have sinned\" or \"I have suffered\", and \"Iron nails ran in\". He buys a bar of lemon soap from a chemist. He then meets another acquaintance, Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly takes him to be offering a racing tip for the horse \"Throwaway\". Finally, Bloom heads towards the baths.\nEpisode 6, \"Hades\".\nThe episode begins with Bloom entering a funeral carriage with three others, including Stephen's father. They drive to Paddy Dignam's funeral, making small talk on the way. The carriage passes both Stephen and Blazes Boylan. There is discussion of various forms of death and burial. Bloom is preoccupied by thoughts of his dead infant son, Rudy, and the suicide of his own father. They enter the chapel for the service and subsequently leave with the coffin cart. Bloom sees a mysterious man wearing a Mackintosh raincoat during the burial. Bloom continues to reflect upon death, but at the end of the episode rejects morbid thoughts to embrace \"warm fullblooded life\".\nEpisode 7, \"Aeolus\".\nAt the office of the \"Freeman's Journal\", Bloom attempts to place an ad. Although initially encouraged by the editor, he is unsuccessful. Stephen arrives bringing Deasy's letter about foot-and-mouth disease, but Stephen and Bloom do not meet. Stephen leads the editor and others to a pub, relating an anecdote on the way about \"two Dublin vestals\". The episode is broken into short segments by newspaper-style headlines, and is characterised by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.\nEpisode 8, \"Lestrygonians\".\nBloom's thoughts are peppered with references to food as lunchtime approaches. He meets an old flame, hears news of Mina Purefoy's labour, and helps a blind boy cross the street. He enters the restaurant of the Burton Hotel, where he is revolted by the sight of men eating like animals. He goes instead to Davy Byrne's pub, where he consumes a gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy, and muses upon the early days of his relationship with Molly and how the marriage has declined: \"Me. And me now.\" Bloom's thoughts touch on what goddesses and gods eat and drink. He ponders whether the statues of Greek goddesses in the National Museum have anuses as do mortals. On leaving the pub Bloom heads toward the museum, but spots Boylan across the street and, panicking, rushes into the gallery across the street from the museum.\nEpisode 9, \"Scylla and Charybdis\".\nAt the National Library, Stephen explains to some scholars his biographical theory of the works of Shakespeare, especially \"Hamlet\", which he argues are based largely on the posited adultery of Shakespeare's wife. Buck Mulligan arrives and interrupts to read out the telegram that Stephen had sent him indicating that he would not make their planned rendezvous at The Ship. Bloom enters the National Library to look up an old copy of the ad he has been trying to place. He passes in between Stephen and Mulligan as they exit the library at the end of the episode.\nEpisode 10, \"Wandering Rocks\".\nIn this episode, nineteen short vignettes depict the movements of various characters, major and minor, through the streets of Dublin. The episode begins by following Father Conmee, a Jesuit priest, on his trip north, and ends with an account of the cavalcade of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, William Ward, Earl of Dudley, through the streets, which is encountered by several characters from the novel.\nEpisode 11, \"Sirens\".\nIn this episode, dominated by motifs of music, Bloom has dinner with Stephen's uncle at the Ormond hotel, while Molly's lover, Blazes Boylan, proceeds to his rendezvous with her. While dining, Bloom listens to the singing of Stephen's father and others, watches the seductive barmaids, and composes a reply to Martha Clifford's letter.\nEpisode 12, \"Cyclops\".\nThis episode is narrated by an unnamed denizen of Dublin who works as a debt collector. The narrator goes to Barney Kiernan's pub where he meets a character referred to only as \"The Citizen\". This character is believed to be a satirisation of Michael Cusack, a founder member of the Gaelic Athletic Association. When Leopold Bloom enters the pub, he is berated by the Citizen, who is a fierce Fenian and anti-Semite. The episode ends with Bloom reminding the Citizen that his Savior was a Jew. As Bloom leaves the pub, the Citizen throws a biscuit tin at Bloom's head, but misses. The episode is marked by extended tangents made in voices other than that of the unnamed narrator; these include streams of legal jargon, a report of a boxing match, Biblical passages, and elements of Irish mythology.\nEpisode 13, \"Nausicaa\".\nAll the action of the episode takes place on the rocks of Sandymount Strand, the shoreline that Stephen visited in Episode 3. A young woman, Gerty MacDowell, is seated on the rocks with her two friends, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman. The girls are taking care of three children, a baby, and four-year-old twins named Tommy and Jacky. Gerty contemplates love, marriage and femininity as night falls. The reader is gradually made aware that Bloom is watching her from a distance. Gerty teases the onlooker by exposing her legs and underwear, and Bloom, in turn, masturbates. Bloom's masturbatory climax is echoed by the fireworks at the nearby bazaar. As Gerty leaves, Bloom realises that she has a lame leg, and believes this is the reason she has been \"left on the shelf\". After several mental digressions he decides to visit Mina Purefoy at the maternity hospital. It is uncertain how much of the episode is Gerty's thoughts, and how much is Bloom's sexual fantasy. Some believe that the episode is divided into two halves: the first half the highly romanticized viewpoint of Gerty, and the other half that of the older and more realistic Bloom. Joyce himself said, however, that \"nothing happened between [Gerty and Bloom]. It all took place in Bloom's imagination\". \"Nausicaa\" attracted immense notoriety while the book was being published in serial form. It has also attracted great attention from scholars of disability in literature. The style of the first half of the episode borrows from (and parodies) romance magazines and novelettes. Bloom's contemplation of Gerty parodies Dedalus's vision of the wading girl at the seashore in \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\".\nEpisode 14, \"Oxen of the Sun\".\nBloom visits the maternity hospital where Mina Purefoy is giving birth, and finally meets Stephen, who has been drinking with his medical student friends and is awaiting the promised arrival of Buck Mulligan. As the only father in the group of men, Bloom is concerned about Mina Purefoy in her labour. He starts thinking about his wife and the births of his two children. He also thinks about the loss of his only 'heir', Rudy. The young men become boisterous, and start discussing such topics as fertility, contraception and abortion. There is also a suggestion that Milly, Bloom's daughter, is in a relationship with one of the young men, Bannon. They continue on to a pub to continue drinking, following the successful birth of a son to Mina Purefoy. This chapter is remarkable for Joyce's wordplay, which, among other things, recapitulates the entire history of the English language. After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, Anglo-Saxon alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others, Malory, the King James Bible, Bunyan, Pepys, Defoe, Sterne, Walpole, Gibbon, Dickens, and Carlyle, before concluding in a Joycean version of contemporary slang. The development of the English language in the episode is believed to be aligned with the nine-month gestation period of the foetus in the womb.\nEpisode 15, \"Circe\".\nEpisode 15 is written as a play script, complete with stage directions. The plot is frequently interrupted by \"hallucinations\" experienced by Stephen and Bloom\u2014fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters. Stephen and his friend Lynch walk into Nighttown, Dublin's red-light district. Bloom pursues them and eventually finds them at Bella Cohen's brothel where, in the company of her workers including Zoe Higgins, Florry Talbot and Kitty Ricketts, he has a series of hallucinations regarding his sexual fetishes, fantasies and transgressions. In one of these hallucinations, Bloom is put in the dock to answer charges by a variety of sadistic, accusing women including Mrs Yelverton Barry, Mrs Bellingham and the Hon Mrs Mervyn Talboys. In another of Bloom's hallucinations, he is crowned king of his own city, which is called Bloomusalem\u2014Bloom imagines himself being loved and admired by Bloomusalem's citizens, but then imagines himself being accused of various charges. As a result, he is burnt at the stake and several citizens pay their respects to him as he dies.\nThen the hallucination ends, Bloom finds himself next to Zoe, and the two talk. After they talk, Bloom continues to encounter other miscellaneous hallucinations, including one in which he converses with his grandfather Lipoti Virag, who lectures him about sex, among other things. At the end of the hallucination, Bloom is speaking with some prostitutes when he hears a sound coming from downstairs. He hears heels clacking on the staircase, and he observes what appears to be a male form passing down the staircase. He speaks with Zoe and Kitty for a moment, and then sees Bella Cohen come into the brothel. He observes her appearance and talks with her for a little while. But this conversation subsequently begins another hallucination, in which Bloom imagines Bella to be a man named Mr. Bello and Bloom imagines himself to be a woman. In this fantasy, Bloom imagines himself (or \"herself\", in the hallucination) being dominated by Bello, who both sexually and verbally humiliates Bloom. Bloom also interacts with other imaginary characters in this scene before the hallucination ends.\nAfter the hallucination ends, Bloom sees Stephen overpay at the brothel, and decides to hold onto the rest of Stephen's money for safekeeping. Stephen hallucinates that his mother's rotting cadaver has risen up from the floor to confront him. He cries \"Non serviam!\", uses his walking stick to smash a chandelier, and flees the room. Bloom quickly pays Bella for the damage, then runs after Stephen. He finds Stephen engaged in an argument with an English soldier, Private Carr, who, after hearing Stephen utter a perceived insult to King Edward VII, punches him. The police arrive and the crowd disperses. As Bloom tends to Stephen, he has a hallucination of his deceased son, Rudy, as an 11-year-old.\nPart III: Nostos.\nEpisode 16, \"Eumaeus\".\nBloom takes Stephen to a cabman's shelter near Butt Bridge to restore him to his senses. There, they encounter a drunken sailor, D. B. Murphy (W. B. Murphy in the 1922 text). The episode is dominated by the motif of confusion and mistaken identity, with Bloom, Stephen and Murphy's identities being repeatedly called into question. The narrative's rambling and laboured style in this episode reflects the protagonists' nervous exhaustion and confusion.\nEpisode 17, \"Ithaca\".\nBloom returns home with Stephen, makes him a cup of cocoa, discusses cultural and linguistic differences between them, considers the possibility of publishing Stephen's parable stories, and offers him a place to stay for the night. Stephen refuses Bloom's offer and is ambiguous in response to Bloom's proposal of future meetings. The two men urinate in the backyard, Stephen departs and wanders off into the night, and Bloom goes to bed, where Molly is sleeping. She awakens and questions him about his day. The episode is written in the form of a rigidly organised and \"mathematical\" catechism of 309 questions and answers, and was reportedly Joyce's favourite episode in the novel. The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination and include a list of 25 men that purports to be the \"preceding series\" of Molly's suitors and Bloom's reflections on them. While describing events apparently chosen randomly in ostensibly precise mathematical or scientific terms, the episode is rife with errors made by the undefined narrator, many or most of which are intentional by Joyce.\nEpisode 18, \"Penelope\".\nThe final episode consists of Molly Bloom's thoughts as she lies in bed next to her husband. The episode uses a stream-of-consciousness technique in eight paragraphs and lacks punctuation. Molly thinks about Boylan and Bloom, her past admirers, including Lieutenant Stanley G. Gardner, the events of the day, her childhood in Gibraltar, and her curtailed singing career. She also hints at a lesbian relationship in her youth, with a childhood friend, Hester Stanhope. These thoughts are occasionally interrupted by distractions, such as a train whistle or the need to urinate. Molly is surprised by the early arrival of her menstrual period, which she ascribes to her vigorous sex with Boylan. The episode concludes with Molly's remembrance of Bloom's marriage proposal, and of her acceptance: \"he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.\"\nReception.\nCensorship.\nWritten over a seven-year period from 1914 to 1921, \"Ulysses\" was serialised in the American journal \"The Little Review\" from 1918 to 1920, when the publication of the \"Nausicaa\" episode led to a prosecution for obscenity under the Comstock Act of 1873, which made it illegal to circulate materials deemed obscene in the U.S. mail. In 1919, sections of the novel also appeared in the London literary journal \"The Egoist\", but the novel itself was banned in the United Kingdom until 1936. Joyce had resolved that the book would be published on his 40th birthday, 2 February 1922, and Sylvia Beach, Joyce's publisher in Paris, received the first three copies from the printer that morning.\nThe 1920 prosecution in the US was brought after \"The Little Review\" serialised a passage of the book depicting characters masturbating. Three earlier chapters had been banned by the US Post Office, but it was Secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice John S. Sumner who instigated this legal action. The Post Office did partially suppress the \"Nausicaa\" edition of \"The Little Review\". Legal historian Edward de Grazia has argued that few readers would have been fully aware of the masturbation in the text, given the metaphoric language. Irene Gammel extends this argument to suggest that the obscenity allegations brought against \"The Little Review\" were influenced by the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven's more explicit poetry, which had appeared alongside the serialization of \"Ulysses\". At the trial in 1921 the magazine was declared obscene and, as a result, \"Ulysses\" was effectively banned in the United States. Throughout the 1920s, the United States Post Office Department burned copies of the novel.\nIn 1932, Random House and lawyer Morris Ernst arranged to import the French edition and have a copy seized by Customs. Random House contested the seizure, and in \"United States v. One Book Called Ulysses\", U.S. District Judge John M. Woolsey ruled that the book was not pornographic and therefore could not be obscene, a decision Stuart Gilbert called \"epoch-making\". The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling in 1934. The U.S. thus became the first English-speaking country where the book was freely available. Although Ireland's Censorship of Publications Board never banned \"Ulysses\", a customs loophole prevented it from being allowed into Ireland. It was first openly available in Ireland in the 1960s.\nCritical reception.\nIn 1922, Ezra Pound wrote, \"All men should 'Unite to give praise to \"Ulysses\"'; those who will not, may content themselves with a place in the lower intellectual orders.\" He claimed that in writing \"Ulysses\", \"this super-novel\", Joyce surpassed Gustave Flaubert, Miguel de Cervantes, Henry James, and Marcel Proust, concluding that, besides Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, he \"can think of no other prose writer whose proportional status in pan-literature is not modified by the advent of \"Ulysses\"\".\nIn a 1922 review in \"The Outlook\", the British novelist Arnold Bennett expressed his lack of admiration for Joyce detailing one day in 700 pages. He wrote, \"Given sufficient time, paper, childish caprice, and obstinacy, one might easily write over seven thousand pages about twenty hours of life.\" Bennett also opposed Valery Larbaud's view that Joyce elaborately planned and organized the day he wrote about. He wrote that Joyce \"apparently thinks there is something truly artistic and high minded in playing the lout to the innocent and defenseless reader. As a fact, there isn't ... After all, to comprehend \"Ulysses\" is not among the recognized learned professions, and nobody should give his entire existence to the job.\" Bennett acknowledged that Joyce's \"verbal method can be justified\" since he is \"trying to reproduce the thoughts of personage\", but called the details \"trivial and perfectly futile in the narrative\".\nIn April 1922, writing in \"The Nation and Athenaeum\", English writer John Middleton Murry called Joyce \"a genius of the very highest order, strictly comparable to Goethe or Dostoevsky\u2026\"Ulysses\" is, fundamentally (though it is much else besides), an immense, a prodigious self-laceration, the tearing away from himself, by a half-demented man of genius, of inhibitions and limitations which have grown to be flesh of his flesh\u2026Mr. Joyce has made the superhuman effort to empty the whole of his consciousness into it\u2026[But he has become] the victim of his own anarchy\u2026.[Joyce] is the man with the bomb who would blow what remains of Europe into the sky\u2026This transcendental buffoonery, this sudden uprush of the \"vis comica \"into a world where in the tragic incompatibility of the practical and the instinctive is embodied, is a very great achievement.\"\nThe next month, in the \"Sunday Express\", newspaper editor James Douglas called \"Ulysses\" \"the most infamously obscene book in ancient or modern literature. ... All the secret sewers of vice are canalized in its flood of unimaginable thoughts, images and pornographic words. And its unclean lunacies are larded with appalling and revolting blasphemies directed against the Christian religion and against the name of Christ\u2014blasphemies hitherto associated with the most degraded orgies of Satanism and the Black Mass.\" \nIn a 1922 review in \"The New Republic\", literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote, \"\"Ulysses\" is a work of high genius. Its importance seems to me to lie ... in its once more setting the standard of the novel so high that it need not be ashamed to take its place beside poetry and drama. \"Ulysses\" has the effect at once of making everything else look brassy. Since I have read it, the texture of other novelists seems intolerably loose and careless; when I come suddenly unawares upon a page that I have written myself I quake like a guilty thing surprised. ... Who else has had the supreme devotion and accomplished the definitive beauty? If he has really laid down his pen never to take it up again he must know that the hand which laid it down upon the great affirmative of Mrs. Bloom, though it never write another word, is already the hand of a master.\"\nIn a 1922 review in \"The New York Times\", Joseph Collins wrote, \"\"Ulysses\" is the most important contribution that has been made to fictional literature in the twentieth century. ... It is likely that there is no one writing English today that could parallel Mr. Joyce's feat, and it is also likely that few would care to do it were they capable. ... When a master technician of words and phrases sets himself the task of revealing the product of the unconscious mind of a moral monster, a pervert and an invert, an apostate to his race and his religion, the simulacrum of a man who has neither cultural background nor personal self-respect, who can neither be taught by experience nor lessoned by example, as Mr. Joyce has done in drawing the picture of Leopold Bloom, and giving a faithful reproduction of his thoughts, purposeful, vagrant and obsessive, he undoubtedly knew full well what he was undertaking, and how unacceptable the vile contents of that unconscious mind would be to ninety-nine men out of a hundred, and how incensed they would be at having the disgusting product thrown in their faces. But that has nothing to do with that with which I am here concerned, viz., has the job been done well and is it a work of art, to which there can be only an affirmative answer.\"\nIn 1922, the writer and Irish nationalist Shane Leslie called \"Ulysses\" \"literary Bolshevism ... experimental, anti-conventional, anti-Christian, chaotic, totally unmoral\". In the same year, Sisley Huddleston wrote in \"The Observer\": \"I confess that I cannot see how the work upon which Mr Joyce spent seven strenuous years, years of wrestling and of agony, can ever be given to the public. ... This is undoubtedly an obscene book; but that, says Mr Joyce, is not his fault. If the thoughts of men and women are such as may be properly described as obscene then how can you show what life is unless you put in the obscenity.\" Molly Bloom's monologue, Leslie wrote, is \"the vilest [chapter] according to ordinary standards, in all literature. And yet its very obscenity is somehow beautiful and wrings the soul to pity. Is that not high art? I cannot, however, believe that sex plays such a preponderant part in life as Mr Joyce represents. He may aim at putting everything in, but he has, of course, like everybody else, selected carefully what he puts in. Has he not exaggerated the vulgarity and magnified the madness of mankind and the mysterious materiality of the universe?\" \nIn a 1923 review, Virginia Woolf wrote, \"\"Ulysses\" was a memorable catastrophe\u2014immense in daring, terrific in disaster.\" In \"The Dial\" the same year, T. S. Eliot wrote: \"I hold [\"Ulysses\"] to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\" He added that Joyce was not at fault if people after him did not understand it: \"The next generation is responsible for its own soul; a man of genius is responsible to his peers, not to a studio full of uneducated and undisciplined coxcombs.\"\nIn his 1930 book-length study of the novel, Stuart Gilbert said that the \"personages of \"Ulysses\" are \"not\" fictitious\" but that \"these people are as they must be; they act, we see, according to some \"lex eterna\", an ineluctable condition of their very existence\". Through these characters Joyce \"achieves a coherent and integral interpretation of life\".\nIn \"Axel's Castle\" (1931), Edmund Wilson noted that \"Ulysses\" attempts to render \"as precisely and as directly as it is possible in words to do, what our participation in life is like\u2014or rather, what it seems to us like as from moment to moment we live\".\nAddressing the first All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934, the writer and communist revolutionary Karl Radek called \"Ulysses\" \"a heap of dung, crawling with worms, photographed by a cinema camera through a microscope\". Writing in \"America\" magazine that year, Francis X. Talbot vehemently decried Judge Woolsey's recent decision that \"Ulysses\" was not obscene, adding, \"Only a person who had been a Catholic, only one with an incurably diseased mind, could be so diabolically venomous toward God, toward the Blessed Sacrament, toward the Virgin Mary.\"\nIn \"Irish Literary Portraits\" (1935), John Eglinton characterized \"Ulysses\" as an act of revenge: \"I am convinced that the only person concerned in the narrative who comes out as a real hero is the author himself. What kind of hero after all is brought to mind by the name Ulysses if not a hero long absent from his kingdom, returning, after being the sport of the gods for ten years, in triumph and vengeance? And it was after nearly as many years of absence as Ulysses from the country 'which belonged to him' that Joyce turned up again for us in Dublin, with a vengeance! ... Endued ... with the elemental diabolism of Ulysses, he was transfigured. A thousand unexpected faculties and gay devices were liberated in his soul. The discovery of a new method in literary art, in which the pen is no longer the slave of logic and rhetoric, made of this Berlitz School teacher a kind of public danger, threatening to the corporate existence of 'literature' as established in the minds and affections of the older generation. ... Our Romano-Celtic Joyce nurses an ironic detachment from the whole of the English tradition. Indeed, he is its enemy. ... It must have seemed to him that he held English, his country's spiritual enemy, in the hollow of his hand, for the English language too came at his call to do his bidding. ... This language found itself constrained by its new master to perform tasks to which it was unaccustomed in the service of pure literature; against the grain it was forced to reproduce Joyce's fantasies in all kinds of juxtapositions, neologisms, amalgamations, truncations, words that are only found scrawled up in public lavatories, obsolete words, words in limbo or belike in the womb of time.\"\nIn a 1946 essay, Irene Hendry identified four distinct epiphany techniques in Joyce's work, noting their use in \"Ulysses\", from the simplest device, such as the revelation of Gerty Macdowell's limp, to the more complex, such as the bowl symbolism in \"Telemachus\". Cited as an example of Joyce's major epiphany technique\u2014\"quidditas\" produced directly\u2014is the revelation of Molly Bloom as \"female essence\".\nIn his first book on Joyce, the American scholar William York Tindall wrote, \"Since the naturalists tried to establish reality, they were descriptive. Before perfecting his art, Joyce tried this method. The Dublin of \"Dubliners\" and its people are described. But almost abandoning description in \"Ulysses\" Joyce evoked place and people. He established his characters by what they say; and his places, named but not described, live in the minds of his characters. Yet no place is more solid than Joyce's Dublin and no characters are more substantial. During his walk along the beach, Stephen exercises his descriptive powers on what he sees and hears. Gerty MacDowell's scene, which concerns the eye, is suitably pictorial. The catalogue of externals in Mr. Bloom's parlor is not naturalistic but a parody of naturalism and its reduction to absurdity. ... Joyce did not approach things directly like a naturalist but indirectly, through correspondence or analogy, as a symbolist.\"\nIn his second book on Joyce, Tindall wrote, \"It is certain that, careful of external details, Joyce observed his city as a naturalist would. ... Yet, in \"Ulysses\", as in the earlier works, he used these particulars to suggest inner or general things\u2014in the manner of Baudelaire and Flaubert. Such usage is symbolist; for a symbol is a common thing, closely observed, suggesting other things. An observer of things, Joyce saw something else within them and beyond, something they embodied and showed forth. That much is plain, let critics quarrel as they will. And it is plain that, however reliant upon details of Dublin, Joyce called again upon parallel and motif to enlarge his particulars and hold them together. ... The riddling motifs of \"Ulysses\" are complicated in turn by allusion, quotation, and single images or charged words\u2014like those in \"A Portrait\" or, better, since \"Ulysses\" is a kind of poem, like those in 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'.\"\nIn his book-length study of \"Ulysses\" (1961), the Australian scholar S. L. Goldberg argued that interior monologue in \"Ulysses\" was rooted in Joyce's epiphany technique. For Goldberg, the epiphany is \"the real artistic (and dramatic) unit of Joyce's 'stream-of-consciousness' writing. What he renders dramatically are minds engaged in the apprehension of epiphanies\u2014the elements of meaning apprehended in life.\" \nIn a 1965 interview, novelist Vladimir Nabokov called \"Ulysses\" \"a divine work of art [that] will live on despite the academic nonentities who turn it into a collection of symbols or Greek myths.\" He named it the greatest masterpiece of 20th-century prose. In a 1966 interview, he said, \"it towers above the rest of Joyce's writing\" with \"noble originality and unique lucidity of thought and style\". \nPsychology professor Charles Fernyhough called \"Ulysses\" \"the archetypal stream of consciousness novel\".\nJoyce uses \"metaphors, symbols, ambiguities, and overtones which gradually link themselves together so as to form a network of connections binding the whole\" work. This system of connections gives the novel a wide, more universal significance, as \"Leopold Bloom becomes a modern Ulysses, an Everyman in a Dublin which becomes a microcosm of the world.\"\nThe American author Michael Chabon wrote, \"\"Ulysses\" struck me, most of all, as a book of life; every sentence, even those that laid bare the doubt, despair, shame, or vanity of its characters, seemed to have been calibrated to assert, in keeping with the project of the work as a whole, the singularity and worth of even the most humdrum and throwaway of human days.\" \nTIME Magazine, Modern Library, Folha de S.Paulo and CounterPunch have all published lists ranking \"Ulysses\" as the greatest novel of the 20th century.\nPublication history.\nThe publication history of \"Ulysses\" is complex. There have been at least 18 editions, and variations among different impressions of each edition.\nAccording to Joyce scholar Jack Dalton, the first edition of \"Ulysses\" contained over 2,000 errors. As subsequent editions attempted to correct these mistakes, they would often add more, due in part to the difficulty of separating non-authorial errors from Joyce's deliberate \"errors\" devised to challenge the reader.\nNotable editions include:\n\"Joyce Wars\".\nHans Walter Gabler's 1984 edition was the most sustained attempt to produce a corrected text, but it has received much criticism, most notably from John Kidd. Kidd's main theoretical criticism is of Gabler's choice of a patchwork of manuscripts as his copy-text (the base edition with which the editor compares each variant).\nIn June 1988, Kidd published \"The Scandal of \"Ulysses\"\" in \"The New York Review of Books\", charging that not only did Gabler's changes overturn Joyce's last revisions, but in another 400 places Gabler failed to follow any manuscript whatever, making nonsense of his own premises. Kidd accused Gabler of unnecessarily changing Joyce's spelling, punctuation, use of accents, and all the details he claimed to have been restoring. Instead, Gabler was actually following printed editions such as that of 1932, not the manuscripts. Gabler was found to have made genuine blunders, such as his changing the name of the real-life Dubliner Harry Thrift to \"Shrift\" and cricketer Captain Buller to \"Culler\" on the basis of handwriting irregularities in the extant manuscript. (Gabler undid these \"corrections\" in 1986.) Kidd said that many of Gabler's errors resulted from his use of facsimiles rather than original manuscripts.\nIn December 1988, in \"The New \"Ulysses:\" The Hidden Controversy\", Charles Rossman revealed that some of Gabler's own advisers felt that too many changes were being made, but that the publishers were pushing for as many alterations as possible. Then Kidd produced a 174-page critique that filled an entire issue of the \"Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America\", dated the same month. Kidd's James Joyce Research Center at Boston University published this \"Inquiry into \"Ulysses\": The Corrected Text\" the next year in book format and on floppy disk.\nGabler and others, including Michael Groden, have rejected Kidd's critique. In his 1993 afterword to the Gabler edition, Groden writes that Kidd's lists of supposed errors were constructed \"with so little demonstrated understanding of Gabler's theoretical assumptions and procedures\u00a0... that they can point to errors or misjudgments only by accident\". The scholarly community remains divided. \nGabler edition replaced.\nIn 1990, Gabler's US publisher, Random House, after consulting a committee of scholars, replaced the Gabler edition with its 1961 version, and in the United Kingdom the Bodley Head press revived its 1960 version (upon which Random House's 1961 version is based). In both the UK and US, Everyman's Library also republished the 1960 \"Ulysses\". In 1992, Penguin dropped Gabler and reprinted the 1960 text. The Gabler version remained available from Vintage International. Reprints of the 1922 first edition have also become widely available since 2012, when it entered the public domain under US copyright law.\nIn 1992, W. W. Norton announced that it would publish Kidd's much-anticipated edition of \"Ulysses\" as part of \"The Dublin Edition of the Works of James Joyce\" series. This book had to be withdrawn when the Joyce estate objected. For a period thereafter the estate refused to authorise any further editions of Joyce's work. This ended when it agreed to allow Wordsworth Editions to bring out a bargain version (a reprint of the 1932 Odyssey Press edition) in 2010, ahead of copyright expiration in 2012.\nMedia adaptations.\nTheatre.\n\"Ulysses in Nighttown\", based on Episode 15 (\"Circe\"), premiered off-Broadway in 1958, with Zero Mostel as Bloom; it debuted on Broadway in 1974.\nIn 2006, playwright Sheila Callaghan's \"Dead City\", a contemporary stage adaptation of the book set in New York City, and featuring the male figures Bloom and Dedalus reimagined as female characters Samantha Blossom and Jewel Jupiter, was produced in Manhattan by New Georges.\nIn 2012, an adaption was staged in Glasgow, written by Dermot Bolger and directed by Andy Arnold. The production first premiered at the Tron Theatre, and later toured in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, made an appearance at the Edinburgh Festival, and was performed in China. In 2017 a revised version of Bolger's adaption, directed and designed by Graham McLaren, premiered at Ireland's national theatre, the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, as part of the 2017 Dublin Theatre Festival. It was revived in June 2018, and the script was published by Oberon Books.\nIn 2013, a new stage adaptation of the novel, \"Gibraltar\", was produced in New York by the Irish Repertory Theatre. It was written by and starred Patrick Fitzgerald and directed by Terry Kinney. This two-person play focused on the love story of Bloom and Molly, played by Cara Seymour.\nFilm.\nIn 1967, a film version of the book was directed by Joseph Strick. Starring Milo O'Shea as Bloom, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\nIn 2003, a movie version, \"Bloom\", was released starring Stephen Rea and Angeline Ball.\nTelevision.\nIn 1988, the episode \"James Joyce's \"Ulysses\"\" of the documentary series \"The Modern World: Ten Great Writers\" was shown on Channel 4. Some of the novel's scenes were dramatised. David Suchet played Leopold Bloom.\nIn September 2022, the episode \"James Joyce's \"Ulysses\"\" of the documentary series \"Arena\", was shown on BBC.&lt;ref name=\"bbc/m001bvp2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"irishnews/2022/ulysses-documentary\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"lboro.ac.uk/bbc-ulysses\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"independent.ie/arena-ulysses\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"themorgan.org/arena-ulysses\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAudio.\nOn Bloomsday 1982, RT\u00c9, Ireland's national broadcaster, aired a full-cast, unabridged, dramatised radio production of \"Ulysses\", that ran uninterrupted for 29 hours and 45 minutes.\nThe unabridged text of \"Ulysses\" has been performed by Jim Norton with Marcella Riordan. Naxos Records released the recording on 22 audio CDs in 2004. It follows an earlier abridged recording with the same actors. Both recordings were directed by the composer Roger Marsh, who has also produced an unabridged audiobook of \"Finnegans Wake\".\nOn Bloomsday 2010, author Frank Delaney launched a series of weekly podcasts called \"Re:Joyce\" that took listeners page by page through \"Ulysses\", discussing its allusions, historical context and references. The podcast ran until Delaney's death in 2017, at which point it was on the \"Wandering Rocks\" chapter.\nBBC Radio 4 aired a new nine-part adaptation dramatised by Robin Brooks and produced/directed by Jeremy Mortimer, and starring Stephen Rea as the Narrator, Henry Goodman as Bloom, Niamh Cusack as Molly and Andrew Scott as Dedalus, for Bloomsday 2012, beginning on 16 June 2012.\nComedy/satire recording troupe The Firesign Theatre ends its 1969 album \"How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All?\" with a male voice reciting the final lines of Molly Bloom's soliloquy.\nMusic.\n\"Thema (Omaggio a Joyce)\" is an electroacoustic composition for voice and tape by Luciano Berio. Composed between 1958 and 1959, it is based on an interpretative reading of the novel's \"Sirens\" chapter, as sung/voiced by his then wife Cathy Berberian. Umberto Eco, a lifelong admirer of Joyce, also contributed to its realisation. Berio's \"Epifanie\" (1961/65) also includes texts from \"Ulysses\".\nReferences to Molly's infidelities with Boylan and Bloom's sleeping posture, as related in her monologue in the \"Penelope\" chapter, appear in Grace Slick's song \"Rejoyce\", the last track on Jefferson Airplane's 1967 album \"After Bathing at Baxter's\".\nAnthony Burgess composed the operetta \"Blooms of Dublin\" in 1982, as a very free interpretation of Joyce's text. It was televised by the BBC, to mixed reviews.\nThe Radiators from Space released a song \"Kitty Ricketts\" on their album \"Ghostown\" (1979), in which the ghost of one of the prostitutes from Bella Cohen's brothel haunts modern Dublin.\nKate Bush's 1989 song \"Flower of the Mountain\" (originally the title track on \"The Sensual World\") sets to music the end of Molly Bloom's soliloquy.\nThe James Joyce Society in Dublin released the album \"Classical Ulysses\" for the Bloomsday100 celebrations in 2004. It contains recordings of the classical music mentioned in the book.\nProse.\nJacob M. Appel's novel \"The Biology of Luck\" (2013) is a retelling of \"Ulysses\" set in New York City.

{"id": "53932", "revid": "45266726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53932", "title": "Euclidean distance", "text": "Length of a line segment\nIn mathematics, the Euclidean distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of the line segment between them. It can be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem, and therefore is occasionally called the Pythagorean distance.\nThese names come from the ancient Greek mathematicians Euclid and Pythagoras. In the Greek deductive geometry exemplified by Euclid's \"Elements\", distances were not represented as numbers but line segments of the same length, which were considered \"equal\". The notion of distance is inherent in the compass tool used to draw a circle, whose points all have the same distance from a common center point. The connection from the Pythagorean theorem to distance calculation was not made until the 18th century.\nThe distance between two objects that are not points is usually defined to be the smallest distance among pairs of points from the two objects. Formulas are known for computing distances between different types of objects, such as the distance from a point to a line. In advanced mathematics, the concept of distance has been generalized to abstract metric spaces, and other distances than Euclidean have been studied. In some applications in statistics and optimization, the square of the Euclidean distance is used instead of the distance itself.\nDistance formulas.\nOne dimension.\nThe distance between any two points on the real line is the absolute value of the numerical difference of their coordinates, their absolute difference. Thus if formula_1 and formula_2 are two points on the real line, then the distance between them is given by:\nformula_3\nA more complicated formula, giving the same value, but generalizing more readily to higher dimensions, is:\nformula_4\nIn this formula, squaring and then taking the square root leaves any positive number unchanged, but replaces any negative number by its absolute value.\nTwo dimensions.\nIn the Euclidean plane, let point formula_1 have Cartesian coordinates formula_6 and let point formula_2 have coordinates formula_8. Then the distance between formula_1 and formula_2 is given by:\nformula_11\nThis can be seen by applying the Pythagorean theorem to a right triangle with horizontal and vertical sides, having the line segment from formula_1 to formula_2 as its hypotenuse. The two squared formulas inside the square root give the areas of squares on the horizontal and vertical sides, and the outer square root converts the area of the square on the hypotenuse into the length of the hypotenuse. In terms of the Pythagorean addition operation formula_14, available in many software libraries as codice_1, the same formula can be expressed as:\nformula_15\nIt is also possible to compute the distance for points given by polar coordinates. If the polar coordinates of formula_1 are formula_17 and the polar coordinates of formula_2 are formula_19, then their distance is given by the law of cosines:\nformula_20\nWhen formula_1 and formula_2 are expressed as complex numbers in the complex plane, the same formula for one-dimensional points expressed as real numbers can be used, although here the absolute value sign indicates the complex norm:\nformula_23\nHigher dimensions.\nIn three dimensions, for points given by their Cartesian coordinates, the distance is\nformula_24\nIn general, for points given by Cartesian coordinates in formula_25-dimensional Euclidean space, the distance is\nformula_26\nThe Euclidean distance may also be expressed more compactly in terms of the Euclidean norm of the Euclidean vector difference:\nformula_27\nObjects other than points.\nFor pairs of objects that are not both points, the distance can most simply be defined as the smallest distance between any two points from the two objects, although more complicated generalizations from points to sets such as Hausdorff distance are also commonly used. Formulas for computing distances between different types of objects include:\nThe distance from a point to a curve can be used to define its parallel curve, another curve all of whose points have the same distance to the given curve.\nProperties.\nThe Euclidean distance is the prototypical example of the distance in a metric space, and obeys all the defining properties of a metric space:\nAnother property, Ptolemy's inequality, concerns the Euclidean distances among four points formula_1, formula_2, formula_33, and formula_43. It states that\nformula_44\nFor points in the plane, this can be rephrased as stating that for every quadrilateral, the products of opposite sides of the quadrilateral sum to at least as large a number as the product of its diagonals. However, Ptolemy's inequality applies more generally to points in Euclidean spaces of any dimension, no matter how they are arranged. For points in metric spaces that are not Euclidean spaces, this inequality may not be true. Euclidean distance geometry studies properties of Euclidean distance such as Ptolemy's inequality, and their application in testing whether given sets of distances come from points in a Euclidean space.\nAccording to the Beckman\u2013Quarles theorem, any transformation of the Euclidean plane or of a higher-dimensional Euclidean space that preserves unit distances must be an isometry, preserving all distances.\nSquared Euclidean distance.\nIn many applications, and in particular when comparing distances, it may be more convenient to omit the final square root in the calculation of Euclidean distances, as the square root does not change the order (formula_45 if and only if formula_46). The value resulting from this omission is the square of the Euclidean distance, and is called the squared Euclidean distance. For instance, the Euclidean minimum spanning tree can be determined using only the ordering between distances, and not their numeric values. Comparing squared distances produces the same result but avoids an unnecessary square-root calculation and sidesteps issues of numerical precision. As an equation, the squared distance can be expressed as a sum of squares:\nformula_47\nBeyond its application to distance comparison, squared Euclidean distance is of central importance in statistics, where it is used in the method of least squares, a standard method of fitting statistical estimates to data by minimizing the average of the squared distances between observed and estimated values, and as the simplest form of divergence to compare probability distributions. The addition of squared distances to each other, as is done in least squares fitting, corresponds to an operation on (unsquared) distances called Pythagorean addition. In cluster analysis, squared distances can be used to strengthen the effect of longer distances.\nSquared Euclidean distance does not form a metric space, as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. However it is a smooth, strictly convex function of the two points, unlike the distance, which is non-smooth (near pairs of equal points) and convex but not strictly convex. The squared distance is thus preferred in optimization theory, since it allows convex analysis to be used. Since squaring is a monotonic function of non-negative values, minimizing squared distance is equivalent to minimizing the Euclidean distance, so the optimization problem is equivalent in terms of either, but easier to solve using squared distance.\nThe collection of all squared distances between pairs of points from a finite set may be stored in a Euclidean distance matrix, and is used in this form in distance geometry.\nGeneralizations.\nIn more advanced areas of mathematics, when viewing Euclidean space as a vector space, its distance is associated with a norm called the Euclidean norm, defined as the distance of each vector from the origin. One of the important properties of this norm, relative to other norms, is that it remains unchanged under arbitrary rotations of space around the origin. By Dvoretzky's theorem, every finite-dimensional normed vector space has a high-dimensional subspace on which the norm is approximately Euclidean; the Euclidean norm is the\nonly norm with this property. It can be extended to infinite-dimensional vector spaces as the \"L\"2 norm or \"L\"2 distance. The Euclidean distance gives Euclidean space the structure of a topological space, the Euclidean topology, with the open balls (subsets of points at less than a given distance from a given point) as its neighborhoods.\nOther common distances in real coordinate spaces and function spaces:\nFor points on surfaces in three dimensions, the Euclidean distance should be distinguished from the geodesic distance, the length of a shortest curve that belongs to the surface. In particular, for measuring great-circle distances on the Earth or other spherical or near-spherical surfaces, distances that have been used include the haversine distance giving great-circle distances between two points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes, and Vincenty's formulae also known as \"Vincent distance\" for distance on a spheroid.\nHistory.\nEuclidean distance is the distance in Euclidean space. Both concepts are named after ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, whose \"Elements\" became a standard textbook in geometry for many centuries. Concepts of length and distance are widespread across cultures, can be dated to the earliest surviving \"protoliterate\" bureaucratic documents from Sumer in the fourth millennium BC (far before Euclid), and have been hypothesized to develop in children earlier than the related concepts of speed and time. But the notion of a distance, as a number defined from two points, does not actually appear in Euclid's \"Elements\". Instead, Euclid approaches this concept implicitly, through the congruence of line segments, through the comparison of lengths of line segments, and through the concept of proportionality.\nThe Pythagorean theorem is also ancient, but it could only take its central role in the measurement of distances after the invention of Cartesian coordinates by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in 1637. The distance formula itself was first published in 1731 by Alexis Clairaut. Because of this formula, Euclidean distance is also sometimes called Pythagorean distance. Although accurate measurements of long distances on the Earth's surface, which are not Euclidean, had again been studied in many cultures since ancient times (see history of geodesy), the idea that Euclidean distance might not be the only way of measuring distances between points in mathematical spaces came even later, with the 19th-century formulation of non-Euclidean geometry. The definition of the Euclidean norm and Euclidean distance for geometries of more than three dimensions also first appeared in the 19th century, in the work of Augustin-Louis Cauchy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A material with high permittivity polarizes more in response to an applied electric field than a material with low permittivity, thereby storing more energy in the material. In electrostatics, the permittivity plays an important role in determining the capacitance of a capacitor.\nIn the simplest case, the electric displacement field D resulting from an applied electric field E is\nformula_1\nMore generally, the permittivity is a thermodynamic function of state. It can depend on the frequency, magnitude, and direction of the applied field. The SI unit for permittivity is farad per meter (F/m).\nThe permittivity is often represented by the relative permittivity \u03b5r which is the ratio of the absolute permittivity \u03b5 and the vacuum permittivity \u03b50\nformula_2\nThis dimensionless quantity is also often and ambiguously referred to as the \"permittivity\". Another common term encountered for both absolute and relative permittivity is the \"dielectric constant\" which has been deprecated in physics and engineering as well as in chemistry.\nBy definition, a perfect vacuum has a relative permittivity of exactly 1 whereas at standard temperature and pressure, air has a relative permittivity of \nRelative permittivity is directly related to electric susceptibility (\u03c7) by\nformula_3\notherwise written as\nformula_4\nThe term \"permittivity\" was introduced in the 1880s by Oliver Heaviside to complement Thomson's (1872) \"permeability\". Formerly written as p, the designation with \u03b5 has been in common use since the 1950s.\nUnits.\nThe SI unit of permittivity is farad per meter (F/m or F\u00b7m\u22121).\nformula_5\nExplanation.\nIn electromagnetism, the electric displacement field D represents the distribution of electric charges in a given medium resulting from the presence of an electric field E. This distribution includes charge migration and electric dipole reorientation. Its relation to permittivity in the very simple case of \"linear, homogeneous, isotropic\" materials with \"\"instantaneous\" response\" to changes in electric field is:\nformula_6\nwhere the permittivity \u03b5 is a scalar. If the medium is anisotropic, the permittivity is a second rank tensor.\nIn general, permittivity is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a nonlinear medium, the permittivity can depend on the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values.\nIn SI units, permittivity is measured in farads per meter (F/m or A2\u00b7s4\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7m\u22123). The displacement field D is measured in units of coulombs per square meter (C/m2), while the electric field E is measured in volts per meter (V/m). D and E describe the interaction between charged objects. D is related to the \"charge densities\" associated with this interaction, while E is related to the \"forces\" and \"potential differences\".\nVacuum permittivity.\nThe vacuum permittivity \u03b5o (also called permittivity of free space or the electric constant) is the ratio in free space. It also appears in the Coulomb force constant,\nformula_7\nIts value is\nformula_8\nwhere\nThe constants c and \u00b50 were both defined in SI units to have exact numerical values until the 2019 revision of the SI. Therefore, until that date, \u03b50 could be also stated exactly as a fraction, formula_9\neven if the result was irrational (because the fraction contained \u03c0). In contrast, the ampere was a measured quantity before 2019, but since then the ampere is now exactly defined and it is \u03bc0 that is an experimentally measured quantity (with consequent uncertainty) and therefore so is the new 2019 definition of \u03b50 (c remains exactly defined before and since 2019).\nRelative permittivity.\nThe linear permittivity of a homogeneous material is usually given relative to that of free space, as a relative permittivity \u03b5r (also called dielectric constant, although this term is deprecated and sometimes only refers to the static, zero-frequency relative permittivity). In an anisotropic material, the relative permittivity may be a tensor, causing birefringence. The actual permittivity is then calculated by multiplying the relative permittivity by \u03b5o:\nformula_10\nwhere \u03c7 (frequently written \u03c7e) is the electric susceptibility of the material.\nThe susceptibility is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a tensor) relating an electric field E to the induced dielectric polarization density P such that\nformula_11\nwhere \u03b5o is the electric permittivity of free space.\nThe susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity \u03b5r by\nformula_12\nSo in the case of a vacuum,\nformula_13\nThe susceptibility is also related to the polarizability of individual particles in the medium by the Clausius-Mossotti relation.\nThe electric displacement D is related to the polarization density P by\nformula_14\nThe permittivity \u03b5 and permeability \u00b5 of a medium together determine the phase velocity \"v\" \n of electromagnetic radiation through that medium:\nformula_15\nPractical applications.\nDetermining capacitance.\nThe capacitance of a capacitor is based on its design and architecture, meaning it will not change with charging and discharging. The formula for capacitance in a parallel plate capacitor is written as\nformula_16\nwhere formula_17 is the area of one plate, formula_18 is the distance between the plates, and formula_19 is the permittivity of the medium between the two plates. For a capacitor with relative permittivity formula_20, it can be said that\nformula_21\nGauss's law.\nPermittivity is connected to electric flux (and by extension electric field) through Gauss's law. Gauss's law states that for a closed Gaussian surface, S,\nformula_22\nwhere formula_23 is the net electric flux passing through the surface, formula_24 is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface, formula_25 is the electric field vector at a given point on the surface, and formula_26 is a differential area vector on the Gaussian surface.\nIf the Gaussian surface uniformly encloses an insulated, symmetrical charge arrangement, the formula can be simplified to\nformula_27\nwhere formula_28 represents the angle between the electric field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to S.\nIf all of the electric field lines cross the surface at 90\u00b0, the formula can be further simplified to\nformula_29\nBecause the surface area of a sphere is formula_30 the electric field a distance formula_31 away from a uniform, spherical charge arrangement is\nformula_32\nThis formula applies to the electric field due to a point charge, outside of a conducting sphere or shell, outside of a uniformly charged insulating sphere, or between the plates of a spherical capacitor.\nDispersion and causality.\nIn general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is\nformula_33\nThat is, the polarization is a convolution of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by \"\u03c7\"(\u0394\"t\"). The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines \"\u03c7\"(\u0394\"t\") \n 0 for \u0394\"t\" &lt; 0. An instantaneous response would correspond to a Dirac delta function susceptibility \"\u03c7\"(\u0394\"t\") \n \"\u03c7\u03b4\"(\u0394\"t\").\nIt is convenient to take the Fourier transform with respect to time and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Because of the convolution theorem, the integral becomes a simple product,\nformula_34\nThis frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the dispersion properties of the material.\nMoreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. effectively \"\u03c7\"(\u0394\"t\") \n 0 for \u0394\"t\" &lt; 0), a consequence of causality, imposes Kramers\u2013Kronig constraints on the susceptibility \"\u03c7\"(0).\nComplex permittivity.\nAs opposed to the response of a vacuum, the response of normal materials to external fields generally depends on the frequency of the field. This frequency dependence reflects the fact that a material's polarization does not change instantaneously when an electric field is applied. The response must always be \"causal\" (arising after the applied field), which can be represented by a phase difference. For this reason, permittivity is often treated as a complex function of the (angular) frequency \u03c9 of the applied field:\nformula_35\n(since complex numbers allow specification of magnitude and phase). The definition of permittivity therefore becomes\nformula_36\nwhere\n \u2212 1 .\nThe response of a medium to static electric fields is described by the low-frequency limit of permittivity, also called the static permittivity \u03b5s (also \u03b5DC):\nformula_37\nAt the high-frequency limit (meaning optical frequencies), the complex permittivity is commonly referred to as \u03b5\u221e (or sometimes \u03b5opt). At the plasma frequency and below, dielectrics behave as ideal metals, with electron gas behavior. The static permittivity is a good approximation for alternating fields of low frequencies, and as the frequency increases a measurable phase difference \u03b4 emerges between D and E. The frequency at which the phase shift becomes noticeable depends on temperature and the details of the medium. For moderate field strength (Eo), D and E remain proportional, and\nformula_38\nSince the response of materials to alternating fields is characterized by a complex permittivity, it is natural to separate its real and imaginary parts, which is done by convention in the following way:\nformula_39\nwhere\nThe choice of sign for time-dependence, e\u2212\"i\u03c9t\", dictates the sign convention for the imaginary part of permittivity. \nThe complex permittivity is usually a complicated function of frequency \u03c9, since it is a superimposed description of dispersion phenomena occurring at multiple frequencies. The dielectric function \"\u03b5\"(\"\u03c9\") must have poles only for frequencies with positive imaginary parts, and therefore satisfies the Kramers\u2013Kronig relations. However, in the narrow frequency ranges that are often studied in practice, the permittivity can be approximated as frequency-independent or by model functions.\nAt a given frequency, \u03b5\u2033, leads to absorption loss if it is positive (in the above sign convention) and gain if it is negative. More generally, the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the anisotropic dielectric tensor should be considered.\nIn the case of solids, the complex dielectric function is intimately connected to band structure. The primary quantity that characterizes the electronic structure of any crystalline material is the probability of photon absorption, which is directly related to the imaginary part of the optical dielectric function \"\u03b5\"(\"\u03c9\"). The optical dielectric function is given by the fundamental expression:\nformula_40\nIn this expression, \"W\"\"c\",\"v\"(\"E\") represents the product of the Brillouin zone-averaged transition probability at the energy E with the joint density of states,\n\"J\"\"c\",\"v\"(\"E\"); \u03c6 is a broadening function, representing the role of scattering in smearing out the energy levels.\nIn general, the broadening is intermediate between Lorentzian and Gaussian;\nfor an alloy it is somewhat closer to Gaussian because of strong scattering from statistical fluctuations in the local composition on a nanometer scale.\nTensorial permittivity.\nAccording to the Drude model of magnetized plasma, a more general expression which takes into account the interaction of the carriers with an alternating electric field at millimeter and microwave frequencies in an axially magnetized semiconductor requires the expression of the permittivity as a non-diagonal tensor:\nformula_41\nIf \u03b52 vanishes, then the tensor is diagonal but not proportional to the identity and the medium is said to be a uniaxial medium, which has similar properties to a uniaxial crystal.\nClassification of materials.\nMaterials can be classified according to their complex-valued permittivity \u03b5, upon comparison of its real \"\u03b5\"\u2032 and imaginary \"\u03b5\"\u2033 components (or, equivalently, conductivity, \u03c3, when accounted for in the latter). A \"perfect conductor\" has infinite conductivity, \"\u03c3\" \n \u221e, while a \"perfect dielectric\" is a material that has no conductivity at all, \"\u03c3\" \n 0; this latter case, of real-valued permittivity (or complex-valued permittivity with zero imaginary component) is also associated with the name \"lossless media\". Generally, when formula_42 we consider the material to be a \"low-loss dielectric\" (although not exactly lossless), whereas formula_43 is associated with a \"good conductor\"; such materials with non-negligible conductivity yield a large amount of loss that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves, thus are also said to be \"lossy media\". Those materials that do not fall under either limit are considered to be general media.\nLossy media.\nIn the case of a lossy medium, i.e. when the conduction current is not negligible, the total current density flowing is:\nformula_44\nwhere\nNote that this is using the electrical engineering convention of the complex conjugate ambiguity; the physics/chemistry convention involves the complex conjugate of these equations.\nThe size of the displacement current is dependent on the frequency \u03c9 of the applied field E; there is no displacement current in a constant field.\nIn this formalism, the complex permittivity is defined as:\nformula_47\nIn general, the absorption of electromagnetic energy by dielectrics is covered by a few different mechanisms that influence the shape of the permittivity as a function of frequency:\nThe above effects often combine to cause non-linear effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption refers to the inability of a capacitor that has been charged for a long time to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called \"soakage\" or \"battery action\". For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1\u20132% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15\u201325% in the case of electrolytic capacitors or supercapacitors.\nQuantum-mechanical interpretation.\nIn terms of quantum mechanics, permittivity is explained by atomic and molecular interactions.\nAt low frequencies, molecules in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the microwave frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. The field does work against the bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as heat. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.\nAt moderate frequencies, the energy is too high to cause rotation, yet too low to affect electrons directly, and is absorbed in the form of resonant molecular vibrations. In water, this is where the absorptive index starts to drop sharply, and the minimum of the imaginary permittivity is at the frequency of blue light (optical regime).\nAt high frequencies (such as UV and above), molecules cannot relax, and the energy is purely absorbed by atoms, exciting electron energy levels. Thus, these frequencies are classified as ionizing radiation.\nWhile carrying out a complete \"ab initio\" (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, it has not been widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors. The Debye model and the Lorentz model use a first-order and second-order (respectively) lumped system parameter linear representation (such as an RC and an LRC resonant circuit).\nMeasurement.\nThe relative permittivity of a material can be found by a variety of static electrical measurements. The complex permittivity is evaluated over a wide range of frequencies by using different variants of dielectric spectroscopy, covering nearly 21 orders of magnitude from 10\u22126 to 1015 hertz. Also, by using cryostats and ovens, the dielectric properties of a medium can be characterized over an array of temperatures. In order to study systems for such diverse excitation fields, a number of measurement setups are used, each adequate for a special frequency range.\nVarious microwave measurement techniques are outlined in Chen \"et al.\" Typical errors for the Hakki\u2013Coleman method employing a puck of material between conducting planes are about 0.3%.\nAt infrared and optical frequencies, a common technique is ellipsometry. Dual polarisation interferometry is also used to measure the complex refractive index for very thin films at optical frequencies.\nFor the 3D measurement of dielectric tensors at optical frequency, Dielectric tensor tomography can be used.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53938", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53938", "title": "History of the Czech lands", "text": " \nThe history of the Czech lands \u2013 an area roughly corresponding to the present-day Czech Republic \u2013 starts approximately 800 years BCE. A simple chopper from that age was discovered at the Red Hill () archeological site in Brno. Many different primitive cultures left their traces throughout the Stone Age, which lasted approximately until 2000 BCE. The most widely known culture present in the Czech lands during the pre-historical era is the \u00dan\u011btice Culture, leaving traces for about five centuries from the end of the Stone Age to the start of the Bronze Age. Celts \u2013 who came during the 5th century BCE \u2013 are the first people known by name. One of the Celtic tribes were the Boii (plural), who gave the Czech lands their first name \"Boiohaemum\" \u2013 Latin for \"the Land of Boii\". Before the beginning of the Common Era the Celts were mostly pushed out by Germanic tribes. The most notable of those tribes were the Marcomanni and traces of their wars with the Roman Empire were left in south Moravia.\nAfter the turbulent times of the Migration Period, the Czech lands were ultimately settled by the Slavic tribes. The year of 623 marks the formation of the first known state in the Czech lands, when Samo united the local Slavic tribes, defended their lands from the Avars to the east and \u2013 few years later \u2013 won the battle of Wogastisburg against the Franks invading the Czech lands from the west. The next state appearing in the Czech lands after the dissolution of the Samo's state was probably the Great Moravia. The center of its power lay in the area of Moravia and present-day western Slovakia. In 863, Cyril and Methodius, two scholars from Greece, brought Christianity to the Great Moravia and established the first Slavic script \u2013 Glagolitsa. The Great Moravia fell during the Magyar invasion at the start of the 10th century.\nA new state formed around the tribe of Premyslids, who founded the Duchy of Bohemia. The duchy existed largely within the sphere of influence of the East Franconia and later the Holy Roman Empire. The duchy sided with the Roman Catholic Church during the East-West Schism and in 1212, the duke Ottokar I was granted the hereditary title of king for his service to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. The P\u0159emyslid dynasty died out at the start of the 14th century and was replaced by the Luxembourg dynasty. The most notable of the Luxembourg rulers was Charles IV, who was elected the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He established the Archbishopric of Prague and Charles University, the first university north of the Alps and east of Paris. The start of the 15th century saw the rise of Proto-Protestantic sentiments in the Czech lands. The execution of Jan Hus sparked the Hussite Wars and the religious split that followed them. The Jagiellon dynasty ascended the Czech throne in 1471. They ruled for half a century before the king Louis Jagiellon died in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs and the empty throne was given to the House of Habsburg.\nAfter the death of the Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg, the religious and political tensions grew, resulting in the Second Defenestration of Prague, which sparked the Thirty Years' War. Many of the Czech nobles supported the Protestant side and were stripped of their properties as a result. Germanization and recatholicisation of the Czech lands followed. The spread of Romanticism during the late 18th century went hand in hand with the movement of the Czech National Revival. After 1848, the leading representatives of the Czech National Revival increased their political efforts to gain more autonomy for the Czech lands within the Habsburg Monarchy.\nThe start of World War I opened the possibility of gaining full independence and formation of a sovereign state. In the Cleveland Agreement of 1915, the Czech and Slovak representatives declared their goal of creating a common state, based on the right of a people to self-determination. After the capitulation of Austria-Hungary three years later, the Czechoslovak Republic became a reality. The so-called First Republic lasted for 20 years, cut short by the advent of the World War II. Following the end of World War II, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took power in 1948, and Czechoslovakia became a member of the Eastern Bloc. In August 1968, armies of the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia to prevent further attempts at the reformation of the Communist system. In November 1989, the Velvet Revolution replaced the Communist regime with a democratic Czech and Slovak Federative Republic. Three years later, Czech and Slovak representatives agreed to the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia and the formation of separate states. In 1999, the Czech Republic joined Nato and in 2004, became a member of the European Union.\nAncient times.\nStone Age.\nA simple chopper \u2013 left by the ancestors of the present-day Homo Sapiens \u2013 dated to 800,000 BCE was uncovered in Red Hill in Brno. First evidence of human camps was found in P\u0159ezletice near Prague and in Str\u00e1nsk\u00e1 sk\u00e1la near Brno which dates to about 200,000 years after that. \nStone tools were found in the K\u016flna Cave in central Moravia, with the estimated age of 120,000 years. More stone tools and the skeletal remains of a Neanderthal man were found at the same site in a 50,000-year-old layer.\nHuman remains from 45,000 years ago were found in Kon\u011bprusy Caves in Zlat\u00fd k\u016f\u0148 at Beroun District. Human remains from 30,000 years BCE were found in Mlade\u010d caves mammoth tusks with complex engravings (again around 30,000 BCE) were found both in Pavlov and P\u0159edmost\u00ed at P\u0159erov, making south Moravia one of the most important archeological areas in Europe.\nThe archeological site in P\u0159edmost\u00ed at P\u0159erov represents the largest accumulation of human remains of the Gravettian culture, \nknown for creating so-called Venus figurines. One of such figurines is the famous Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice (29,000\u201325,000 BCE) found in Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice in south Moravia along with many other artifacts from that time. Another Venus figurine is the Venus of Pet\u0159kovice, found in what is today Ostrava. Remains of mammoth hunters from 22,000 BCE were also found in the aforementioned K\u016flna Cave along with the remains of reindeer hunters and horse hunters, dated to about 10,000 years later. Approximately between 5500 and 4500 BCE, people of the Linear Pottery culture resided in Czech lands. Their settlement was discovered in Bylany near Kutn\u00e1 hora. Their culture was succeeded by the Lengyel culture, Funnelbeaker culture and Stroke-ornamented ware culture, which coexisted in the Czech Lands during the end of the Stone Age.\nCopper Age and Bronze Age.\nCorded Ware culture in the north and Baden culture in the south were the predominant cultures in the Czech Lands throughout the Copper Age. The Bell Beaker culture represented the transition from the Copper Age to the Bronze Age. With the start of the Bronze Age, \u00dan\u011btice culture appeared. This culture got its name from a village near Prague, where the first discovery was made in the 1870s. Many of their burial mounds were uncovered, mostly in central Bohemia. It was followed by the Middle Bronze Age Tumulus culture from around 1600 BC. The Urnfield culture is blanket term for various Late Bronze Age cultures dating from c. 1300-800 BC who cremated their dead and buried the urns with their ashes. The Hallstatt culture was the last culture of the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. The key archeological site of the Hallstatt culture in the Czech Lands is the B\u00fd\u010d\u00ed sk\u00e1la Cave, where a rare bronze statue of a bull was found. Many of these archeological sites were occupied by multiple cultures throughout the ancient times.\nIron Age.\nThe area was settled by the Celtic tribes at the start of the Iron Age. The most prominent tribe in Bohemia were the Boii (plural), who gave the area the name of \"Boiohaemia\" (Latin for \"the land of Boii\"), which later turned into Bohemia. Before the start of the 1st century CE, they were pushed out by various Germanic tribes (Marcomanni, Quadi, Lombards). Around 60 to 50 BC, the Dacian king Burebista established an empire that extended its reach into the lands of the Boii. The Dacian occupation primarily affected modern-day Slovakia but also held sway over regions of present-day Czech Republic and Pannonia. Following Burebista's demise in 44 BC, his empire crumbled, liberating the lands of the Boii from Dacian rule. Traces of Roman army camps were found in south Moravia, most notably near Mu\u0161ov. The winter camp in Mu\u0161ov was built to house approximately 20,000 soldiers. The Romans were repeatedly at war with the Marcomanni tribe during the first two centuries CE. Germanic towns are described on the Map of Ptolemaios from the 2nd century, e.g. Coridorgis for Jihlava.\nArrival of the Slavs.\nThe following centuries of what is known as the Great Migration once again changed the ethnic composition of the Czech Lands. In the 6th century, Slavic tribes, displaced by Langobard and Thuringian tribes began to move into the Czech Lands from the east. They fought with neighboring Avars \u2013 Turko-Tartar nomads \u2013 who seized the Pannonia and frequently raided the Slavic lands and even the Frankish Empire.\nSamo's realm.\nIn 623 \u2013 according to the Chronicle of Fredegar \u2013 the Slavic tribes revolted against the oppression of the Avars. During this time, the Frankish merchant Samo allegedly came to the Czech lands with his entourage and joined with the Slavs to defeat the Avars. Thus the Slavs adopted Samo as their ruler. Later Samo and the Slavs came into conflict with the Frankish empire whose ruler Dagobert I wanted to extend his rule to the east. That led to the Battle of Wogastisburg in 631, in which the newly established Realm of Samo successfully defended its autonomy. The realm disintegrated after Samo's death.\nMedieval times.\nGreat Moravia.\nThe realm of Great Moravia probably was established in the area of today's Moravia and western Slovakia in the 830s. It saw the rise of the first ever Slavic literary culture in the Old Church Slavonic language and the creation of the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet dedicated to a Slavic language. Glagolitic was later simplified into the Cyrillic alphabet that is today used in Russia and many countries in eastern Europe and central Asia. Glagolitic was created by St. Cyril and St. Methodius, who arrived in Great Moravia in 863 from Thessaloniki in Byzantine Empire. They were invited by the king Rastislav who invited them to introduce literacy and a legal system to Great Moravia. His nephew and successor Svatopluk I's diplomacy was oriented more towards Rome. Great Moravia was taken under the protection of the Holy See in 880 and six years after, he expelled the disciples of Methodius after their teacher's death. During his reign, Great Moravia's sphere of influence reached its peak. After his death, the realm was split among his sons and soon after fell to ruin due to infighting and constant Magyar raids during the start of the 10th century.\nDuchy of Bohemia.\nBo\u0159ivoj from Lev\u00fd Hradec was the first known member of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty. In 880, he moved his residence to Prague Castle, which laid the foundation of the city of Prague that emerged centuries later. He was a vassal to the kings of Great Moravia and was baptised during the christianisation of Great Moravia by St. Cyril and St. Methodius. His son Spytihn\u011bv I together with the head of another major Bohemian tribe Witizla used the collapse of Great Moravia and in 895 swore allegiance to the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia. Spytihn\u011bv's nephew Wenceslaus (later proclaimed a saint by the Catholic Church) ruled from 921 and had to submit to the Saxon king Henry I in order to maintain his ducal authority. He was murdered by his younger brother Boleslaus I. Boleslaus I expanded the Duchy of Bohemia eastwards conquering the lands of Moravia and Silesia and areas around Krak\u00f3w. He stopped paying tribute to the Saxon king igniting a war which he lost and was forced to recognize Saxon suzerainty over the Duchy of Bohemia. The Bishopric of Prague was founded in 973 during the reign of his son Boleslaus II. The bishopric was subordinated to the Archbishopric of Mainz.\nIn 1002, during the reign of the duke Vladivoj, the Duchy of Bohemia formally became a part of the Holy Roman Empire. After a period of dynastic infighting, Old\u0159ich took power. His son B\u0159etislav I led many ambitious conquests and later revolted against the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III hoping to gain a full autonomy for the Duchy of Bohemia. Despite the initial success in Battle at Br\u016fdek, he could not withstand the second invasion of the imperial army and ultimately had to renounce all of his conquests save for Moravia and recognize Henry III as his sovereign. After B\u0159etislav's death, the infighting among P\u0159emyslids continued \u2013 a consequence of seniority inheritance laws. Among the more notable rulers belong (Vratislaus II and Vladislaus) who were awarded lifetime titles of kings by the Holy Roman Emperors for their services.\nKingdom of Bohemia.\nLate P\u0159emyslids.\nIn 1212 Ottokar I was granted a hereditary title of the King of Bohemia by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Thus began the Kingdom of Bohemia, which lasted de iure until the end of World War I. His reign marked the start of the German eastward colonization, which over time significantly altered the language composition of the Czech Lands. His son Wenceslaus I had to deal with the Mongol invasion of Europe at the start of 1240s. He managed to defend Bohemia, but Moravian lands were heavily plundered. When the Duke of Austria Frederick II died in 1246 without male heirs, Wenceslaus I tried to secure the Austrian lands by marrying his eldest son Vladislaus to Frederick's niece Gertrude. This plan failed because of Vladislaus's premature death in the year after. Wenceslaus I then decided for the invasion of Austria and he was successful. His successor, Ottokar II, continued the expansion of the realm. He gained more territory south of Austria and led two crusades against the pagan Old Prussians. He was hoping to gain the Imperial crown, but lost in the 1273 election to Rudolf of Habsburg, the first in a line of Habsburg emperors. Rudolf of Habsburg demanded that Ottokar II returns all of the lands he had acquired south of Bohemia. Ottokar refused and waged two wars against the emperor which ended with his death at the battlefield of Marchfeld in 1278.\nThe crown was passed to his 6-year-old son Wenceslaus II. Otto V, Margrave of Brandenburg ruled as a regent in his stead, later replaced by Z\u00e1vi\u0161 of Falkenstein, who married Ottokar II's widow. In 1290, Wenceslaus II had Z\u00e1vi\u0161 beheaded for alleged treason and began ruling independently. Year later, Przemys\u0142 II, the king of Poland, was murdered and Wenceslaus II gained the Polish crown for himself. At the end of the 13th century, huge deposits of silver were found in Kutn\u00e1 Hora, which allowed him to start issuing vast amounts of silver coins called Prague groschen. In 1301, another neighbouring monarch died \u2013 Andrew III of Hungary, the last male member of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty. Wenceslaus II married his son Wenceslaus III to Andrew III's only daughter and had him crowned in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the King of Hungary. Four years later, Wenceslaus II died \u2013 only 33 years old \u2013 probably of tuberculosis. Wenceslaus III abandoned his claim to the Hungarian throne, seeing that his rule was only nominal. W\u0142adys\u0142aw the Elbow-high challenged Wenceslaus III's rule in Poland and conquered Krakow in 1306. Before Wenceslaus III could start his retaliation campaign, he was murdered in Olomouc by unknown assassins.\nHouse of Luxembourg.\nWenceslaus III was the last male member of the main branch of P\u0159emyslids. The Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII of the House of Luxembourg married his son John to Wenceslaus III's sister Elisabeth and secured for him the Bohemian throne. John of Luxembourg was raised in Paris, did not speak any Czech and was widely unpopular among the Czech nobility. John never stayed long in the Czech lands, he traveled all across Europe and took part in multiple military conflicts. While crusading in Lithuania in 1336, John lost his eyesight due to ophthalmia, which earned him the nickname John the Blind. A year later he took the side of King Philip VI of France in the Hundred Years' War and died in 1346 in the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy. His eldest son, Charles IV succeeded him on the Bohemian throne.\nEarlier in 1346, the Pope Clement VI declared the Emperor Louis IV a heretic and demanded a new Imperial election. Charles IV was the pope's preferred candidate and he was crowned as the King of Romans in November 1346 in Bonn. Charles had been in charge of the administration of Czech Lands since 1333, due to his father's absence and health indisposition. Soon after his coronation as the King of Bohemia and the King of Romans, he settled in Prague and laid the foundations of the New Town expanding the capitol. In 1348 he founded the University of Prague, the first university north of Alps and east of Paris. He also legally established the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (\"Corona regni Bohemiae\" in Latin), meaning the core territories no longer belonged to a king or a dynasty but to the Bohemian monarchy (crown) itself. In 1355, Charles IV travelled to Rome where he was crowned the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He ruled as the Holy Roman Emperor for over 20 years and managed to secure the title of the King of Romans for his eldest son Wenceslaus IV.\nWenceslaus IV did not share the governance abilities of his father. In 1393, the torture and murder John of Nepomuk \u2013 vicar-general of the archbishop Jan of Jen\u0161tejn \u2013 sparked a noble rebellion. He was imprisoned for two years at Kr\u00e1l\u016fv Dv\u016fr and was only released after an intervention from his younger brother Sigismund, who had become the King of Hungary. In 1400, Wenceslaus IV was deposed as the Holy Roman Emperor, mainly due to his failure to address the Papal Schism. Two years later, Wenceslaus IV was briefly imprisoned again, this time by his brother Sigismund, who looted Moravia. After the death of Rupert \u2013 who had replaced Wenceslaus as the King of Romans \u2013 Wenceslaus IV competed with his brother Sigismund and his cousin Jobst of Moravia for the title of the King of Romans. He ultimately surrendered the title to Sigismund in exchange for keeping Bohemia. In 1414, Sigismund called the Council of Constance, which finally resolved the Papal Schism. It also condemned the teaching of Jan Hus, rector of the University of Prague and a popular church reformist. After Jan Hus refused to retract his teachings, he was burnt alive at stake, which prompted the Hussite Wars. The religious military conflicts stopped in 1434 with the battle Battle of Lipany, but the religious tensions continued on. Although Sigismund became the titular King of Bohemia after Wenceslaus IV's death in 1419, it was not until 1436 that he was recognized by the Czech Estates and he died a year after.\nHouse of Habsburg.\nAfter Sigismunds's death the title of the King of Bohemia went to his son-in-law Albert from the House of Habsburg, who died shortly after. The claim to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown was passed to his unborn son Ladislaus, who gained the nickname \"Posthumous\". He was raised at the court of his distant relative Emperor Frederick III. Although he was crowned the King of Bohemia in 1453, his regent George of Pod\u011bbrady continued to effectively rule Bohemia in his stead. Ladislaus died in Prague after fleeing a rebellion in Hungary, aged only seventeen. Many of his contemporaries suspected he was poisoned, but modern examinations of his skeleton proved he died of acute leukemia. With his death the Albertinian Line of the House of Habsburg ended.\nHouse of Pod\u011bbrady.\nIn 1458, the estates of Bohemia elected George of Pod\u011bbrady as the new King of Bohemia. He had a difficult role trying to maintain a fragile peace between the Catholic side and the Hussite side, for which he earned the nickname \"King of two peoples\". Despite his efforts, he ultimately did not succeed and in 1465, the catholic nobles formed the Unity of Green Mountain and challenged his rule. A year after, he was excommunicated by the new Pope Paul II, which gave a justification for the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus to invade the Czech Lands and start the Bohemian\u2013Hungarian War. &lt;br&gt;\nHouse of Jagiellon.\nAfter the king George's death, the war was continued by Vladislaus II from the House of Jagiellon, who was offered the throne of Bohemia by George of Pod\u011bbrady himself. After ten years of fighting, the Bohemian-Hungarian War finally ended by signing of the Peace of Olomouc in 1479, in which Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia were ceded to Matthias Corvinus for the rest of his life and both monarchs were allowed to use the title of King of Bohemia. In 1485, Vladislaus II confirmed right of all Bohemian noblemen and commoners to freely adhere either to Hussitism or Catholicism in the Peace of Kutn\u00e1 Hora. After Matthias Corvinus died in 1490, Vladislaus II was elected the King of Hungary and gained all the territories he ceded 30 years earlier. From then on he ruled from Buda. Although Vladislaus II was married three times, he only had two children late in his life: son Louis and daughter Anne. Vladislaus II's two children married two children of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I as a result of negotiations at the First Congress of Vienna, tying the House of Jagiellon and the House of Habsburg together.\nA year after that, in 1516, Vladislaus II died and his ten-year-old son Louis II became the king of both Hungary and Bohemia. In 1521 he refused to pay the agreed annual tribute to the new Ottoman sultan, S\u00fcleyman I and executed his ambassadors. War ensued, Belgrade fell to Ottoman hands the same year. In 1526, Louis II led his forces against Suleiman I in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, which ended with a decisive defeat of the Hungarian army and Louis II drowned during his attempted retreat. He left no heirs and so the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were inherited by Ferdinand I from the House of Habsburg, as was agreed during the First Congress of Vienna.\nPart of Habsburg Monarchy.\nProtestantism.\nAfter the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, the Ottomans were unsuccessful in their Siege of Vienna in 1529 and Ferdinand I managed to sign the Treaty of Constantinopole, postponing the Ottoman expansion attempts. Ferdinand and his brother Charles V \u2013 who was the Holy Roman Emperor at the same time \u2013 had to deal with not only the Ottoman threat, but also with the Schmalkaldic League which formed in 1531 to advance the interests of Lutheran states in the Holy Roman Empire. Largely Protestant Czech nobility had a favorable view of the Schmalkaldic League's goals and so when in 1546 Ferdinand I ordered the Czech estates to raise their army and march against the Protestant Electorate of Saxony as part of the Schmalkaldic War, they did so very reluctantly. The next year the Czech estates refused to gather an army again and rebelled, for which they were punished after the Schmalkaldic League decisively lost the Battle of M\u00fchlberg. As a result, Ferdinand I managed to strengthen his position in the Land of the Bohemian Crown, limit city privileges and begin the process of recatholicization by inviting the Jesuit Order to Prague in 1556. &lt;br&gt;\nFrom 1599 to 1711, Moravia (a Land of the Bohemian Crown) was frequently subjected to raids by the Ottoman Empire and its vassals (especially the Tatars and Transylvania). Overall, hundreds of thousands were enslaved whilst tens of thousands were killed.\nMaximilian II succeeded Ferdinand I in 1562 and \u2013 like his father \u2013 ruled from Vienna. He approved Czech Confession (\"Confessio Bohemica\" in Latin) \u2013 a new document confirming religious freedoms \u2013 replacing the older Compacts of Basel, that did not take non-Utraquist Protestants into account. He also showed his religious tolerance by reaffirming the Statuta Judaeorum \u2013 a document providing legal protection for the Jews in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. His son Rudolf II succeeded him in 1576 and in 1583 he moved the royal court to Prague. Thanks to Rudolf's patronage of art, Prague became a major cultural hub of Europe during his reign. He was a reclusive ruler who preferred his hobbies to the daily affairs of the state. In 1605 Rudolf II was forced by his other family members to cede the rule of Hungary to his younger brother Archduke Matthias following the Bocskai Uprising after the Long Turkish War. The differences of opinions between the two brothers ultimately resulted in Rudolf's imprisonment at the Prague Castle and all effective power was given into the hands of Matthias. After Rudolf II's death in 1612 the royal court moved back to Vienna. Matthias did not have any children \u2013 same as his brother Rudolf \u2013 and he died six years later, aged 62. &lt;br&gt;\nHe was succeeded by his cousin Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria. The Diets of Bohemia confirmed Ferdinand's position as Matthias' successor only after he had promised to respect the Letter of Majesty \u2013 a document granting religious freedoms, signed by Rudolf II. eight years earlier. Ferdinand II did not share the religious benevolence of his predecessors. A year after he was crowned, he prohibited the construction of Protestant ecclesial buildings on royal land. That led to protests among the Protestant nobility \u2013 who saw it as a violation of the Letter of Majesty \u2013 and the Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618, which sparked the conflict that would become the Thirty Years' War. The revolting Bohemian estates then chose Frederick V of Palatinate as their new king and gathered an army in preparation of war. They were joined by Lutheran nobility in Austria. Ferdinand II asked his Spanish relative Philip III for help. Spanish army in the Netherlands made sure forces of Protestant Union could not join the revolt happening in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown and in Austria. After dealing with the Austrian rebels, Ferdinand II decisively defeated Frederick V at the Battle of White Mountain, near Prague. Widespread confiscation of property followed, which was then sold to loyal nobles, often of foreign origin. Ferdinand II also had the 27 leaders of the revolt publicly beheaded and strengthened the royal power over the estates. The Lands of the Bohemian Crown and especially Silesia were some of the territories that were hit the hardest by the devastating Thirty Years' War. The war continued even after Ferdinand II's death during the reign of Ferdinand III.\nAbsolutism and National Revival.\nLate Habsburgs.\nIn 1648, the Thirty Years' War finally ended with the Peace of Westphalia. Ferdinand III continued the recatholicization and centralization policies of his father. After his death in 1657, he was succeeded by his only surviving son Leopold I. During the fourth Austro-Turkish War in 1663 the Turkish army invaded Moravia before being stopped in the Battle of Saint Gotthard. Leopold continued waging wars with Ottomans and France throughout his long rule. He increased corv\u00e9e to three days a week which caused the Peasant Revolt of 1680. The infamous Losiny Estate Witch Trials took place between 1678 and 1696 resulting in almost 100 dead. More protests against the increased corv\u00e9e occurred, but all in vain. In 1705, Leopold I's rule ended and his son Joseph I succeeded him. Joseph I planned to enact many administrative reforms, most of which he did not get the chance to finish, due to his premature death of smallpox. One year before his death he issued letters patent ordering that all Romani people in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown had one of their ears cut off. If they returned after being expelled, all Romani men were to be hanged without a trial. Similar letters patents were published in other territories under his rule and led to mass killings of Romani people. After Joseph I's premature death in 1711, the Austrian throne went to his younger brother Charles VI. &lt;br&gt;\nCharles VI had no male heirs and with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 he ensured that all the titles held by him could be inherited by a woman. Charles VI sought the other European powers' approval, which he gained in exchange for various concessions. Regardless, after her father's death, Maria Theresa had to defend her inheritance from the coalition of Prussia, Bavaria, France, Spain, Saxony and Poland in the War of Austrian Succession, that broke out mere weeks after her coronation in 1740. She ultimately managed to defend her title, but paid for it with the loss of Silesia, which became a part of Prussia. That was the ended the unity of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. In 1757 during the Seven Years' War, the Prussians invaded Bohemia again and laid siege to Prague, but subsequently lost the Battle of Kol\u00edn and were repelled. Maria Theresa was not able to regain Silesia and the war ended in a draw. She tried to follow the ideas of Enlightenment, she established compulsory secular primary schools, but also state censorship of books that were deemed to be against the Catholic religion. Because of her marriage to Francis Stephen of Lorraine, all of her children were considered to be members of a new joint House of Habsburg-Lorraine.\nHouse of Habsburg\u2013Lorraine.\nAfter the death of Maria Theresa's husband in 1765, her son Joseph II started to rule with her as a co-ruler and since 1780 as the sole ruler. He enforced many reforms, among the most notable are the abolition of serfdom, Patent of Toleration expanding religious freedom and the dissolution of all monastic orders not involved in education, healthcare or science. As part of his centralization efforts, he also pressed for the expansion of German language to all territories under his rule. Both of his wives died relatively young of smallpox and because he had no sons, he was succeeded by his younger brother Leopold II. Although Leopold II only ruled for two years, he spent several weeks in Prague in 1791 and he let himself be crowned the King of Bohemia. The first Czech Industrial Exhibition was prepared in honor of his visit in Clementinum and the Czech Estates commissioned an opera from Mozart for the occasion. Leopold II was succeeded by Francis I, the first-born of his 12 sons. &lt;br&gt;\nIn 1805, Napoleon's army attacked Austria and defeated the Austrian and Russian army in the decisive Battle of Austerlitz in south Moravia. In the Peace of Pressburg, Francis I lost many of his territories and soon after, the Holy Roman Empire dissolved, replaced by the Confederation of the Rhine. Following the end of Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna reinstated the Austrian Empire as one of the Great Powers of Europe in 1815. Francis I was a proponent of conservatism and his policies suppressed all of the emerging liberal and nationalist movements in his Empire. He was the first of Austrian monarchs to widely utilize the secret police and he increased censorship. His son Ferdinand I became the Austrian Emperor after him. Because of his frequent seizures, he was not capable of ruling and the actual executive power was held by the Regent's Council. In 1836, one year after his succession, he was crowned the King of Bohemia under the name of Ferdinand V. &lt;br&gt;\nThroughout the 19th century, the nationalist tendencies and movements in the Czech lands known as the Czech National Revival slowly grew, led by activists such as linguists Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd and Josef Jungmann, historian and politician Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd or writer Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1 and journalist Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd. The efforts of the Czech National Revival first peaked during the revolutions of 1848. Ferdinand I was forced to abdicate and his successor was his young nephew Francis Joseph I. When he \u2013 after losing the war with Italy in 1859 \u2013 also lost the war with Prussia in 1866, the Hungarian representatives forced Francis Joseph I to end his absolutist rule over Hungary in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The Czech representatives who hoped for a similar increase in autonomy were left out and the Czech lands remained firmly under the control of Austria.\nAustria-Hungary.\nThe newly formed Real union of Austria-Hungary lasted for the next half-a-century. The policies suppressing the National Revival in the Czech lands under the Austrian government continued, as well as the suppression of the Slovak National Revival under the Hungarian government. The end of the 19th century also was a time of a demographic boom and a rapid urbanization. Population in centers of industry doubled or tripled within a few decades. At the start of the 20th century, Austria's unilateral annexation of Bosnia in 1908 caused the Bosnian Crisis and prompted the eventual assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, sparking the World War I in 1914. Many of the Czech nationalists saw the war as an opportunity for gaining full independence from the Austria-Hungary. Desertion among the Czech conscripts was commonplace and Czechoslovak Legions were formed to fight for the side of Entente Powers. In the Cleveland Agreement of 1915, the Czech and Slovak representatives declared their goal of creating a common state, based on the right of a people to self-determination. When the World War I ended in 1918, the Kingdom of Bohemia officially ceased to exist and a new democratic republic of Czechoslovakia took its place.\nModern times.\nCzechoslovakia.\nThe republic of Czechoslovakia was declared in October 1918. It was a democratic presidential republic. In 1920, its defined territory was not inhabited only by Czechs and Slovaks, it contained significant populations of other nationalities: Germans (22.95%), Hungarians (5.47%) and Ruthenians (3.39%). The Great Depression starting at the end of 1920's together with the rise of the National Socialist Party in neighbouring Germany during the 1930s caused increasing tensions between the different nationalist groups in Czechoslovakia. In foreign relations the newly established republic relied heavily on its western allies of Great Britain and France. That proved to be a mistake as in 1938, both allied countries agreed to Hitler's demands and co-signed the Munich Treaty, stripping the Czechoslovakia of its borderlands, leaving it indefensible.\nGerman protectorate.\nAfter giving up Sudetenland, the Second Czechoslovak Republic lasted only half-a-year before its full dismemberment before the start of World War II. The Slovak Republic declared its independence from Czechoslovakia and became Germany's client state, while two days later the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was proclaimed. During World War II \u2013 given the high level of industrialization of pre-war Czechoslovakia \u2013 the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia served as a major hub of military production for Germany. The oppression of ethnic Czechs increased after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by members of the Czech resistance in 1942. After Germany's defeat in 1945, the vast majority of ethnic Germans were forcefully deported from Czechoslovakia.\nRule of the Communist Party.\nIn February 1948, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat. Klement Gottwald became the first communist president. He nationalized the country's industry and collectivized its farms to form Sovkhozs inspired by the Soviet model. Czechoslovakia thus became a part of the Eastern Bloc. Attempts at a reformation of the political system during the Prague Spring of 1968 were ended by the invasion of armies of the Warsaw Pact. The Czechoslovakia remained under the rule of the Communist Party until the Velvet Revolution of 1989.\nPost-Cold War.\nOne of the leaders of the dissent, V\u00e1clav Havel became the first president of the democratic Czechoslovakia. Slovakia's demands for sovereignty were fulfilled at the end of 1992, when the representatives of Czechs and Slovaks agreed to split the Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The official start of the current Czech Republic was set on 1 January 1993. The Czech Republic became a member of NATO in 12 March 1999, and the European Union in 1 May 2004.\nSee also.\nLists:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The coins first came into use in 2002. They have a common reverse, portraying a map of Europe, but each country in the eurozone has its own design on the obverse, which means that each coin has a variety of different designs in circulation at once. Four European microstates that are not members of the European Union (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) use the euro as their currency and also have the right to mint coins with their own designs on the obverse side.\nThe coins, and various commemorative coins, are minted at numerous national mints across the eurozone to strict national quotas. Not every eurozone member state has its own mint. Obverse designs are chosen nationally, while the reverse and the currency as a whole is managed by the European Central Bank (ECB).\nHistory.\nAT\nBE\nHR\nCY\nFI\nEE\nFR\nGR\nDE\nIE\nIT\nLV\nLT\nLU\nMT\nNL\nPT\nSK\nSI\nES\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Eurozone members (20)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Monetary agreement (4)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Unilaterally adopted (2)\nThe euro came into existence on 1 January 1999. It had been a goal of the European Union (EU) and its predecessors since the 1960s. The Maastricht Treaty entered into force in 1993 with the goal of creating economic and monetary union by 1999 for all EU states except the United Kingdom and Denmark (even though Denmark has a fixed exchange rate policy with the euro).\nIn 1999, the currency was born virtually and in 2002 notes and coins began to circulate. It rapidly replaced the former national currencies and the eurozone has since expanded further to some newer EU states. In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty formalised its political authority, the Eurogroup, alongside the European Central Bank.\nIn 2004, the very first \u20ac2 commemorative coin was issued by Greece to celebrate the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004.\nAs the EU's membership has since expanded in 2004, 2007 and 2013, with further expansions envisaged, the common face of all euro coins from the value of 10c and above were redesigned in 2007 to show a new map.\nSlovenia joined the eurozone in 2007, Cyprus and Malta joined in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, Lithuania in 2015 and Croatia in 2023, introducing eight more national-side designs.\nBulgaria is the last EU member state to announce its national design. The design of the euro coins was officially chosen by the Bulgarian National Bank in November 2023 and approved by the Council of the EU in February 2024. The minting of the coins in the necessary quantities started shortly after the Council of the EU approved Bulgaria to adopt the euro, so that they can be put into circulation from the date of introduction of the euro in Bulgaria.\nSpecification.\nThere are eight different denominations of euro coins: \u20ac0.01, \u20ac0.02, \u20ac0.05, \u20ac0.10, \u20ac0.20, \u20ac0.50, \u20ac1.00 and\u00a0\u20ac2.00 The \u20ac0.01, \u20ac0.02 and \u20ac0.05\u00a0coins show Europe in relation to Asia and Africa in the world. The remaining coins show the EU before its enlargement in May 2004 if minted before 1 January 2007, a map of Europe if minted after. Coins from Austria, Italy, San Marino, Portugal and the Vatican City show the map if minted in 2008 or later.\nVatican Euro coins with images of Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI\nThe common side was designed by Luc Luycx of the Royal Belgian Mint. They symbolise the unity of the EU. The national sides were designed by the national central banks of the Eurosystem in separate competitions. There are specifications which apply to all coins such as the requirement of including twelve stars. National designs were not allowed to change until the end of 2008, unless a monarch (whose portrait usually appears on the coins) dies or abdicates. National designs have seen some changes due to a new rule stating that national designs should include the name of the issuing country.\nThe common side of the \u20ac0.01, \u20ac0.02 and \u20ac0.05\u00a0coins depict the denomination, the words 'EURO CENT' beside it, twelve stars and Europe highlighted on a globe in relation to Asia and Africa in the world. The common side of the \u20ac0.10, \u20ac0.20 and \u20ac0.50 coins currently depict the denomination on the right, the words 'EURO CENT' underneath it, with twelve stars and the European continent on the left.\nCoins minted from 1999 to 2006 depicted only the EU15, rather than the entire European continent, which is on coins minted after 2007. The common side of the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2\u00a0coins depict the denomination on the left, the currency, map of Europe and twelve stars on the right. Similarly, coins minted from 1999 to 2006 depicted the EU15, rather than the whole European continent, which is on coins minted from 2007.\nThe 1c, 2c and 5c\u00a0coins, however, keep their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15\u00a0member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map.\nDesign.\nCommon side.\nAll coins have a common reverse side showing how much the coin is worth, with a design by Belgian designer Luc Luycx. The design of the 1c, 2c and 5c\u00a0coins shows Europe's place in the world as a whole, The 10c\u00a0coins and above show either the 15\u00a0countries that were the European Union in 2002, or, if minted after 2007, the whole European continent, along with Luc Luycx's signature, which is visible as two L letters connected together (LL). Coins from Italy, San Marino, the Vatican, Austria and Portugal show the new design if minted 2008 or later. The coins symbolise the unity of the EU.\nCurrent design.\nOn 2005 June 7, the European Council decided that the common side of the 10 euro cent to \u20ac2 coins should be brought up to date to reflect the enlargement of the EU in 2004. The 1c, 2c and 5c\u00a0coins show Europe in relation to the rest of the world, therefore they remained unchanged. In 2007, the new design was introduced. The design still retains all elements of the original designs, including the twelve stars, but the map of the fifteen states is replaced by one showing the whole of Europe as a continent, without borders, to stress unity. These coins were not mandatory for existing eurozone members when introduced in 2007, but became so for every member in 2008.\nStarting in 2017 the 1, 2, and 5\u00a0euro cent coins from individual member states have started adjusting their common side design to a new version, identified by smaller and more rounded numeral and longer lines outside of the stars at the coin's circumference.\nCyprus is shown several hundred kilometers northwest of its real position in order to include it on the map. On the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2\u00a0coins, the island is shown to be directly east of mainland Greece; on the \u20ac0.10, \u20ac0.20 and \u20ac0.50\u00a0coins, it appears directly below Crete. The original proposal from the European Commission was to include Turkey on the map, but this design was rejected by the Council.\nInitial design.\nThe original designs of the 10c, 20c and 50c\u00a0coins showed the outline of each of the 15\u00a0EU member states. Each state was shown as separate from the others, thus giving Europe the appearance of an archipelago. EU member states outside the eurozone (Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) were also depicted. Non-EU states were not depicted.\nOn the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins, the landmass appeared more cohesive although borders were indicated. As in current issues, all coins featured 12\u00a0stars in their design.\nThe year featured on the coins can date back to 1999, when the currency was formally established (only Belgian, Dutch, Finnish, French and Spanish coins were struck with the 1999 date). These countries traditionally strike coins with the year of minting rather than the year it was put into circulation.\nResearchers from the University of Z\u00fcrich warned that an external ring of metal surrounding an inner pill of a different colour, as in the euro coins, can lead to the release of high levels of nickel, causing allergic reactions with people sensitive to the metal. The researchers also warned that the coins could contain between 240 and 320\u00a0times the amount of nickel allowed under the EU nickel directive.\nNational sides.\nThe obverse side varies from state to state, with each member allowed to choose its own design. Each of the eight coins can have the same design (such as Irish coins), or can vary from coin to coin (such as Italian coins). In monarchies, the national side usually features a portrait of the country's monarch, often in a design carried over from the former currency (e.g. Belgian coins). Republics tend to feature national monuments, symbols, or stylised designs (such as French coins). Engravings on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin are also subject to national choice.\nThere are at present no plans to abolish the national designs in favour of a common European one. However, the Commission has proposed that the 1c, 2c and 5c\u00a0coins have a common design to keep costs down.\nThough they are not members of the EU, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City (and Andorra since 2014) also have euro coins featuring a national side, but a considerable number of these coins were not put into general circulation by the authorities who instead sold them to collectors for prices higher than their face value. Due to this, in 2012, a European Regulation established that: \"A\u00a0minor proportion, not exceeding 5 % of the cumulated total net value and volume of circulation coins issued by a Member State, taking into account only years with positive net issuance, may be put on the market above face value if justified by the special quality of the coin, a special packaging or any additional services provided\".\nNo territories associated with eurozone countries issue their own euro coins. France and the Netherlands have overseas regions with their own currencies.\nSince 2023, there are 24 countries (the 20 members of the eurozone and the 4 European microstates mentioned above) issue euro coins with their own national sides, for a total 192\u00a0different euro coins, not counting annual differences or commemorative coins.\nRegulations.\nThe basis for the euro coins is derived from a European recommendation from 2003, which allowed changing the national obverse sides of euro coins from 1 January 2004 onwards. However, a number of recommendations and restrictions still apply.\nEuro coins must still have a common reverse side, so only the national obverse sides may be varied. Also, the standard national obverse sides \"per se\" should not be changed until the end of 2008, unless the head of state depicted on some coins changes before then. (This clause already came into effect for Monaco and the Vatican City, whose heads of state\u2014Rainier\u00a0III and Pope John Paul\u00a0II respectively\u2014died in 2005 and whose national obverse sides were changed for 2006).\nIn 2005, another recommendation added two more guidelines regarding the design of the coins. The state issuing a coin should in some way clearly be identified on the obverse side, either by stating the full name or a clearly identifiable abbreviation of it; and neither name nor the denomination of the coin should be repeated on the obverse, as it is already featured on the common reverse side.\nThese restrictions do not apply retroactively; only new designs\u2014the national obverse sides for regular issues of states newly joining the euro or of eurozone states which change their design, and \u20ac2\u00a0commemorative coins issued from 2006 onwards\u2014are subject to them. However, the five countries whose designs violated the first update to the rules (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany and Greece) initially were assumed to have to change their design in the future, which Finland did for 2007 and Belgium for 2008.\nIn 2008, another recommendation changed the rules again:\n# every fifteen years to bring it into line with the head of state's current appearance;\n# if the head of state abdicates or dies. However, temporary heads of state may not be used as a reason for changing the design; instead a \u20ac2\u00a0commemorative coin (potentially a second \u20ac2\u00a0commemorative coin) will be allowed to be issued.\nFinland and Belgium had already corrected their design on the coins issued to include the initials of the country in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Belgium was forced to change its design back to show the original portrait of its monarch, because the 2008 update to follow the recommendations also updated the portrait, which was against the rules. The Belgian coins from 2009 onwards show the original royal portrait of 1999, but otherwise keep the new 2008 coin design as far as the country identification and year mark are concerned. These provisions additionally prohibit further \"sede vacante\" sets of coins by the Vatican City, allowing only commemorative coins for such occasions. Finland and Spain updated their designs to meet the new rules about the stars in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\nIn 2012, a European Regulation approved new specifications of euro coins and named (in article 1\u00a0g) a deadline for national sides of regular coins to be updated to fully comply with the current regulation: 20 June 2062.\nIn 2014, a new Regulation regarding euro coins was approved. In it, no changes related to what was mentioned above were established.\nInitially, Monaco, the Netherlands and Vatican City did not comply the specifications in their coins. Following changes in their heads of state and the subsequent changes in the design of their coins (in 2006, 2014 and 2006, respectively), they began to comply with the specifications.\nIn 2022, France came to comply with the stars' rule after the design change it made on the 1 and 2\u00a0euro coins, in which the year had until then been inserted between the stars of the Union.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], Austria, Germany and Greece still have to include an indication of the issuing Member State. Additionally, Greece, Luxembourg and Slovenia have to comply with the rule of the stars. Finally, Austria must eliminate the denominations on the national side of their euro coins.\nBear in mind that the foregoing refers to \"regular\" coins since, in the case of the 2\u00a0euro commemorative coins, the aforementioned is fulfilled in all coins since 2013. This is due to the fact that each one of these coins supposes a variation in the design, while, as mentioned, \"regular\" coins were not affected unless the design of the national sides was changed, and have until June 20, 2062 in the event that the design had not been changed before.\nFinally, the different States must inform each other of their new draft designs (both of \"regular\" and 2\u00a0euro commemorative coins), as well as the European Council and the European Commission, which must give its approval. In one example, the initial design of Andorran 10, 20 and 50\u00a0cent coins did not obtain EU approval because the image of the \"Pantokrator of San Mart\u00ed de la Cortinada\", included in those coins, violated the principle of religious neutrality. The image of the religious figure was eliminated in the final Andorran coin design. Another example, the 2\u00a0euro commemorative coins that Belgium planned to issue in 2015 on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, caused complaints by France and withdrawal of the design. However, Belgium did issue a 2.50\u00a0euro collector's coin, taking advantage of the fact that these coins are not submitted to the draft design approval.\nSecurity features.\nEuro coins have high-security machine-readable features. Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2\u00a0coins. The 10c, 20c and 50c\u00a0coins are made of Nordic gold, which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins. The lettering on the edge of the \u20ac2\u00a0coin also protects it from counterfeiting.\nFeatures for persons with impaired sight.\nEuro coins were designed in cooperation with organisations representing blind people, and as a result incorporate many features allowing them to be distinguished by touch alone. In addition, their visual appearance is designed to make them easy to tell apart for persons who cannot read the inscriptions on the coins.\nThe coins increase in size and weight with value. Of the eight denominations of euro coins, the three lowest denominations are small, resemble copper in colour and are quite thin and light. The next three denominations resemble gold in colour and are thicker as well as heavier. The highest two denominations are bimetallic, being generally larger and thicker than the lower denominations.\nIn general, the greater the value, the heavier and larger the coin. Copper colour identifies low value; gold colour identifies medium value; two different metals identify high value.\nThere are also differences within each group. The 2\u00a0cent coin has a grooved edge to distinguish it from the 1 and 5\u00a0cent coins and also from the US\u00a0penny, which has the same colour and diameter. Similarly, the 20\u00a0cent coin edge is smooth with seven indents to distinguish it from the 10 and 50\u00a0cent coins.\nWhile currencies predating the euro were specifically designed in similar ways (different sizes, colours, and ridges) to aid the visually impaired, the euro was the first to have authorities consult organisations representing the blind and visually impaired before the release of the currency.\nCommemorative issues.\nEach state may also mint two 2\u00a0euro commemorative coins each year from June 2012. From 2004 to May 2012, countries were only allowed to mint one coin per year. Only \u20ac2\u00a0coins may be used in this way (for them to be legal tender) and there is a limit on the number that can be issued. The coin must adhere to the normal design criteria, such as the twelve stars, the year and the issuing country.\nGreece was the first country to issue a commemorative coin, and was followed by other countries. In 2007, every eurozone state participated in the Treaty of Rome programme, in which all member states issued a coin of similar design to commemorate the signing of the Treaty, only differing in the name of the issuing country and language of the text. This was also the case in 2009, in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Economic and Monetary Union. The design was selected by electronic voting by EU citizens. In 2012, a common commemorative coin was issued to commemorate the tenth anniversary of euro coins and banknotes. In 2015, a common commemorative coin was issued to commemorate 30\u00a0years of the European Union flag. Finally, in 2022 a common commemorative coin was issued to commemorate 35\u00a0years of the Erasmus Programme.\nIn 2006, Germany began issuing a series of coins, the German Bundesl\u00e4nder series, showing each of the states of Germany on its coins; It was originally intended to run until 2021, but one extra issue was added in 2019, which pushed back the last three planned issues (2019, 2020, 2021) by one year. The series ended in 2022. In 2023 a new series (Bundesl\u00e4nder series\u00a0II) began until 2038.\nSpain started a commemorative coin series \"\" (UNESCO World Heritage) in 2010, commemorating all of Spain's UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which is currently planned until 2058. The order in which the coin for a specific site is issued coincides with the order in which they were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nIn 2021, France started a commemorative coin series about 2024 Summer Olympics. It finished in 2024.\nLatvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Malta have also issued a series of\u00a02 euro commemorative coins.\nGold and silver commemorative issues.\nA legacy of old national practice is the minting of silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender throughout the eurozone, but only in the country where they are issued (e.g. a\u00a0\u20ac10 Finnish commemorative coin cannot be used in Portugal).\nHowever, these gold coins are intended for collectors as their bullion value vastly exceeds their face value. Some silver coins, such as the German \u20ac10\u00a0commemoratives, are often available at banks and some retailers at face value. These coins, however, generally do not circulate but are kept by collectors.\nIt is uncertain whether the EU Council of Ministers will grant such coins legal tender status outside national boundaries, as Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City also issue this kind of coin.\nBelgian 2.50 euro coin.\nIn 2015, Belgium issued a 2.50\u00a0euro commemorative coin which is legal tender inside the country. 70,000\u00a0coins were minted, commemorating the 200th\u00a0anniversary of Napoleon's defeat in the Battle of Waterloo.\nBelgium originally planned to mint 2\u00a0euro commemorative coins for the occasion. This plan was blocked by France, however (after 180,000 of the coins had already been minted; they had to be discarded). Minting the 2.50\u00a0euro denomination obviated France's complaints as the coins are not legal tender in the European Union, only in Belgium.\nEU law states that any country can issue any new coins it wants as long as they are in an irregular denomination, so it invented a \u20ac2.50\u00a0coin.\nCirculation.\nThe European Central Bank closely monitors the circulation and stock of the euro coins and banknotes. It is a task of the Eurosystem to ensure an efficient and smooth supply of euro coins and to maintain their integrity throughout the eurozone.\nStatistics.\nAs of December 2021, there are approximately 141\u00a0billion coins in circulation around the eurozone. In contrast, the United States has minted over 300\u00a0billion pennies since 1983 when the current copper-plated zinc metallic composition began. Using a population of 341.9\u00a0million for the euro area, that is roughly 199\u00a0coins of denomination 1c or 2c\u00a0per capita, and 215\u00a0other coins per capita.\nCounterfeiting.\nApproximately 100,000 counterfeit euro coins are taken from circulation annually, and roughly the same number are seized before they can be released. Given a total circulation of 56\u00a0billion coins, counterfeit coins are relatively rare. About half the counterfeits feature the German national design, but counterfeits have been detected for every issuing country. The majority of counterfeit coins are \u20ac2 (60% in 2011), with most of the rest being \u20ac1, and a few 50c\u00a0coins. The number of counterfeit \u20ac2\u00a0coins being found annually is decreasing, while numbers of counterfeit \u20ac1 and 50-cent coins are increasing.\nThe European Technical and Scientific Centre (ETSC) estimates that up to 2\u00a0million counterfeit coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nRecent investigations by the European Commission have shown that counterfeit sophistication is increasing, making prompt detection more difficult. In 2008, Irish MEP Eoin Ryan called for tighter regulation over tokens and medals that are being increasingly used for small purchases mainly in vending machines across Europe.\nSmall-denomination coins.\nThe 1c, 2c, and 5c coins account for approximately 80% of all new coins minted in the eurozone. Due to the expense of producing such low-value coinage, the Commission and some member states have proposed that costs could be cut by having a common design on both sides of these coins, rather than minting numerous different designs.\nThe \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins are two-toned. The \"gold\" is an alloy, 75%\u00a0copper, 20%\u00a0zinc and 5%\u00a0nickel. The \"silver\" is cupronickel, 75%\u00a0copper and 25%\u00a0nickel. The 10c, 20c and 50c\u00a0coins are a proprietary alloy known as \"Nordic Gold\", consisting of 89%\u00a0copper, 5% aluminium, 5% zinc and 1% tin. The 1c, 2c, and 5c\u00a0coins are copper-coated steel fourr\u00e9es. The copper alloys make the coinage antimicrobial.\nPrice rounding.\n \n Percentage of people in favour of abolishing the use of the 1- and 2-euro cent coins.\nThe 1c and 2c coins were initially introduced to ensure that the introduction of the euro was not used as an excuse by retailers to heavily round up prices. However, due to the cost of maintaining a circulation of low-value coins, both by business and the mints, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Estonia and Lithuania round prices to the nearest five cents (Swedish rounding) if paying with cash, while producing only a handful of those coins for collectors, rather than general circulation. The coins are still legal tender and produced outside these states.\nCountries with Swedish rounding.\nThe Swedish rounding law in Finland was issued in January 2002, shortly after the coins were put into circulation.\nThe Netherlands followed suit in September 2004, under pressure from retail businesses, which claimed that dealing with 1- and 2-cent coins was too expensive. After a successful experiment in the town of Woerden in May 2004, retailers across the Netherlands were permitted in September 2004 to round cash transactions to the nearest five cents.\nIn Belgium, rounding has been common practice since 2014; by law, rounding has been obligatory for cash purchases since 1 December 2019. For payments with debit or credit cards, the merchant can choose whether to apply rounding but has to inform the client beforehand. With the obligatory rounding in effect, Belgium's National Bank has stopped production of 1- and 2-cent coins.\nIreland introduced rounding in 2015 after a 2013 trial in Wexford.\nIn May 2017, the Italian parliament passed a resolution to stop minting 1c and 2c\u00a0coins starting 1 January 2018 and to introduce Swedish rounding.\nThe withdrawal of low-circulation coins is due in part to rising metal prices: De Nederlandsche Bank calculated it would save $36\u00a0million a year by not using the smaller coins. Other countries such as Germany favoured retaining the coins due to their desire for \u20ac1.99\u00a0prices, which appear more attractive to the consumer than a \u20ac2\u00a0price. According to James Debono writing for \"Malta Today\", \"scrapping the coins is considered unthinkable for Germany where both consumers and retailers are obsessed with precise pricing.\" Luxembourg and Malta also declared that they do not wish to remove the coins. This is echoed by the European Central Bank which supports the coins, stating it allows businesses to calculate prices more exactly to attract consumers, such as \u20ac0.99. \nAccording to a 2005 Eurobarometer survey of EU citizens, Germans were most sceptical about the removal of the 1c and 2c\u00a0coins from complete circulation in the eurozone, but on average a majority of Germans still supported their removal (58% for the one cent coin and 52% for the two cent coin in 2005). The Belgians were most supportive of their removal. A similar survey in 2017 found 64% across the eurozone favoring their removal with prices rounded, with over 70% in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovakia. Only Portugal and Latvia had a plurality in favour of retaining the coins (49% against removal, 45\u201346% in favour). The same survey in 2021 found that 67% of respondents across the eurozone were in favor of the removal, and all countries in the eurozone showed a plurality of people also in favour.\nThe Commission in 2010 released its guidelines on daily life euro cash questions, to give citizens guidelines on issues with direct implications for daily life. The guidelines were based on ten guiding principles, including two that still remain: \"No surcharges should be imposed on payments in cash\" and \"Member States should not adopt new rounding rules to the nearest five cent\". Following a consultation, a Commission initiative considering the adoption of price rounding was due to be adopted by the end of 2021. Regardless of the Commission's decision, Slovakia proposed introducing rounding from 2022.\nControversy.\nIn spring 2016, controversy arose in the Netherlands after an episode of the television program \"Keuringsdienst van Waarde\" showed that euro coins for the Netherlands and other countries were being made by South Korean company Poongsan, a known producer of cluster munitions. Cluster munitions are banned internationally by the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), because of their indiscriminate and long-term effects on civilians. The CCM prohibits the use, production, stockpiling or transfer of cluster munitions as well as assistance with these acts. After parliamentary questions were posed, the Dutch government stated that the Royal Dutch Mint had ordered around 40\u00a0million 'coin blanks' between 2011 and 2016, and that Poongsan was on a list of vetted suppliers of the European Commission's Mint Directors Working Group. Since then, both the Royal Dutch Mint and the Norwegian Mint have excluded Poongsan as a coin blank supplier due to its involvement with cluster munitions. Questions were also raised that year in the European Parliament about Poongsan's presence on the vetted list of coin blank suppliers of the European Commission's Mint Directors Working Group. The Commission responded with claims that, despite the European Union's support of the CCM, the EU itself is not a Party to it and responsibility on the issue lies with EU member states.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This statement permits the inclusion of degenerate triangles, but some authors, especially those writing about elementary geometry, will exclude this possibility, thus leaving out the possibility of equality. If a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle then the triangle inequality states that\nformula_1\nwith equality only in the degenerate case of a triangle with zero area.\nIn Euclidean geometry and some other geometries, the triangle inequality is a theorem about vectors and vector lengths (norms):\nformula_2\nwhere the length of the third side has been replaced by the length of the vector sum u + v. When u and v are real numbers, they can be viewed as vectors in formula_3, and the triangle inequality expresses a relationship between absolute values.\nIn Euclidean geometry, for right triangles the triangle inequality is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem, and for general triangles, a consequence of the law of cosines, although it may be proved without these theorems. The inequality can be viewed intuitively in either formula_4 or formula_5. The figure at the right shows three examples beginning with clear inequality (top) and approaching equality (bottom). In the Euclidean case, equality occurs only if the triangle has a 180\u00b0 angle and two 0\u00b0 angles, making the three vertices collinear, as shown in the bottom example. Thus, in Euclidean geometry, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\nIn spherical geometry, the shortest distance between two points is an arc of a great circle, but the triangle inequality holds provided the restriction is made that the distance between two points on a sphere is the length of a minor spherical line segment (that is, one with central angle in ) with those endpoints.\nThe triangle inequality is a \"defining property\" of norms and measures of distance. This property must be established as a theorem for any function proposed for such purposes for each particular space: for example, spaces such as the real numbers, Euclidean spaces, the Lp spaces (\"p\" \u2265 1), and inner product spaces.\nEuclidean geometry.\nThe triangle inequality theorem is stated in Euclid's Elements, Book I, Proposition 20:\n\"[\u2026] in the triangle ABC the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining one, that is, the sum of BA and AC is greater than BC, the sum of AB and BC is greater than AC, and the sum of BC and CA is greater than AB.\"\nEuclid proved the triangle inequality for distances in plane geometry using the construction in the figure. Beginning with triangle ABC, an isosceles triangle is constructed with one side taken as and the other equal leg along the extension of side . It then is argued that angle \u03b2 has larger measure than angle \u03b1, so side is longer than side . However: \nformula_6 \nso the sum of the lengths of sides and is larger than the length of . This proof appears in Euclid's Elements, Book I, Proposition 20.\nMathematical expression of the constraint on the sides of a triangle.\nFor a proper triangle, the triangle inequality, as stated in words, literally translates into three inequalities (given that a proper triangle has side lengths \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" that are all positive and excludes the degenerate case of zero area):\nformula_7\nA more succinct form of this inequality system can be shown to be\nformula_8\nAnother way to state it is\nformula_9\nimplying\nformula_10\nand thus that the longest side length is less than the semiperimeter.\nA mathematically equivalent formulation is that the area of a triangle with sides \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" must be a real number greater than zero. Heron's formula for the area is\nformula_11\nIn terms of either area expression, the triangle inequality imposed on all sides is equivalent to the condition that the expression under the square root sign be real and greater than zero (so the area expression is real and greater than zero).\nThe triangle inequality provides two more interesting constraints for triangles whose sides are \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", where \"a\" \u2265 \"b\" \u2265 \"c\" and formula_12 is the golden ratio, as\nformula_13\nformula_14\nRight triangle.\nIn the case of right triangles, the triangle inequality specializes to the statement that the hypotenuse is greater than either of the two sides and less than their sum.\nThe second part of this theorem is already established above for any side of any triangle. The first part is established using the lower figure. In the figure, consider the right triangle ADC. An isosceles triangle ABC is constructed with equal sides \"AB\" \n \"AC\". From the triangle postulate, the angles in the right triangle ADC satisfy:\nformula_15\nLikewise, in the isosceles triangle ABC, the angles satisfy:\nformula_16\nTherefore,\nformula_17\nand so, in particular,\nformula_18\nThat means side AD, which is opposite to angle \u03b1, is shorter than side AB, which is opposite to the larger angle \u03b2. But \"AB\" \n \"AC\". Hence:\nformula_19\nA similar construction shows \"AC\" &gt; \"DC\", establishing the theorem.\nAn alternative proof (also based upon the triangle postulate) proceeds by considering three positions for point B: (i) as depicted (which is to be proved), or (ii) B coincident with D (which would mean the isosceles triangle had two right angles as base angles plus the vertex angle \u03b3, which would violate the triangle postulate), or lastly, (iii) B interior to the right triangle between points A and D (in which case angle ABC is an exterior angle of a right triangle BDC and therefore larger than \"\u03c0\"/2, meaning the other base angle of the isosceles triangle also is greater than \"\u03c0\"/2 and their sum exceeds \u03c0 in violation of the triangle postulate).\nThis theorem establishing inequalities is sharpened by Pythagoras' theorem to the equality that the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\nExamples of use.\nConsider a triangle whose sides are in an arithmetic progression and let the sides be \"a\", \"a\" + \"d\", \"a\" + 2\"d\". Then the triangle inequality requires that\nformula_20\nTo satisfy all these inequalities requires\nformula_21\nThe first inequality requires \"a\" &gt; 0; consequently it can be divided through and eliminated. With \"a\" &gt; 0, the middle inequality only requires \"r\" &gt; 0. This now leaves the first and third inequalities needing to satisfy\nformula_22\nThe first of these quadratic inequalities requires r to range in the region beyond the value of the positive root of the quadratic equation \"r\"2 + \"r\" \u2212 1 \n 0, i.e. \"r\" &gt; \"\u03c6\" \u2212 1 where \u03c6 is the golden ratio. The second quadratic inequality requires r to range between 0 and the positive root of the quadratic equation \"r\"2 \u2212 \"r\" \u2212 1 \n 0, i.e. 0 &lt; \"r\" &lt; \"\u03c6\". The combined requirements result in r being confined to the range\nformula_23\nWhen r the common ratio is chosen such that \"r\" \n \u221a\"\u03c6\" it generates a right triangle that is always similar to the Kepler triangle.\nGeneralization to any polygon.\nThe triangle inequality can be extended by mathematical induction to arbitrary polygonal paths, showing that the total length of such a path is no less than the length of the straight line between its endpoints. Consequently, the length of any polygon side is always less than the sum of the other polygon side lengths.\nExample of the generalized polygon inequality for a quadrilateral.\nConsider a quadrilateral whose sides are in a geometric progression and let the sides be \"a\", \"ar\", \"ar\"2, \"ar\"3. Then the generalized polygon inequality requires that\nformula_24\nThese inequalities for \"a\" &gt; 0 reduce to the following\nformula_25\nformula_26\nThe left-hand side polynomials of these two inequalities have roots that are the tribonacci constant and its reciprocal. Consequently, r is limited to the range 1/\"t\" &lt; \"r\" &lt; \"t\" where t is the tribonacci constant.\nRelationship with shortest paths.\nThis generalization can be used to prove that the shortest curve between two points in Euclidean geometry is a straight line.\nNo polygonal path between two points is shorter than the line between them. This implies that no curve can have an arc length less than the distance between its endpoints. By definition, the arc length of a curve is the least upper bound of the lengths of all polygonal approximations of the curve. The result for polygonal paths shows that the straight line between the endpoints is the shortest of all the polygonal approximations. Because the arc length of the curve is greater than or equal to the length of every polygonal approximation, the curve itself cannot be shorter than the straight line path.\nConverse.\nThe converse of the triangle inequality theorem is also true: if three real numbers are such that each is less than the sum of the others, then there exists a triangle with these numbers as its side lengths and with positive area; and if one number equals the sum of the other two, there exists a degenerate triangle (that is, with zero area) with these numbers as its side lengths.\nIn either case, if the side lengths are a, b, c we can attempt to place a triangle in the Euclidean plane as shown in the diagram. We need to prove that there exists a real number h consistent with the values a, b, and c, in which case this triangle exists.\nBy the Pythagorean theorem we have \"b\"2 \n \"h\"2 + \"d\"2 and \"a\"2 \n \"h\"2 + (\"c\" \u2212 \"d\")2 according to the figure at the right. Subtracting these yields \"a\"2 \u2212 \"b\"2 \n \"c\"2 \u2212 2\"cd\". This equation allows us to express d in terms of the sides of the triangle:\nformula_27\nFor the height of the triangle we have that \"h\"2 \n \"b\"2 \u2212 \"d\"2. By replacing d with the formula given above, we have\nformula_28\nFor a real number h to satisfy this, \"h\"2 must be non-negative:\nformula_29\nwhich holds if the triangle inequality is satisfied for all sides. Therefore, there does exist a real number formula_30 consistent with the sides formula_31, and the triangle exists. If each triangle inequality holds strictly, formula_32 and the triangle is non-degenerate (has positive area); but if one of the inequalities holds with equality, so formula_33, the triangle is degenerate.\nGeneralization to higher dimensions.\nThe area of a triangular face of a tetrahedron is less than or equal to the sum of the areas of the other three triangular faces. More generally, in Euclidean space the hypervolume of an (\"n\" \u2212 1)-facet of an n-simplex is less than or equal to the sum of the hypervolumes of the other n facets.\nMuch as the triangle inequality generalizes to a polygon inequality, the inequality for a simplex of any dimension generalizes to a polytope of any dimension: the hypervolume of any facet of a polytope is less than or equal to the sum of the hypervolumes of the remaining facets.\nIn some cases the tetrahedral inequality is stronger than several applications of the triangle inequality. For example, the triangle inequality appears to allow the possibility of four points A, B, C, and Z in Euclidean space such that distances\n\"AB\" = \"BC\" = \"CA\" = 26\nand\n\"AZ\" = \"BZ\" = \"CZ\" = 14.\nHowever, points with such distances cannot exist: the area of the 26\u201326\u201326 equilateral triangle \"ABC\" is formula_34, which is larger than three times formula_35, the area of a 26\u201314\u201314 isosceles triangle (all by Heron's formula), and so the arrangement is forbidden by the tetrahedral inequality.\nNormed vector space.\nIn a normed vector space V, one of the defining properties of the norm is the triangle inequality:\nformula_36\nThat is, the norm of the sum of two vectors is at most as large as the sum of the norms of the two vectors. This is also referred to as subadditivity. For any proposed function to behave as a norm, it must satisfy this requirement.\nIf the normed space is Euclidean, or, more generally, strictly convex, then formula_37 if and only if the triangle formed by u, v, and u + v, is degenerate, that is, u and v are on the same ray, i.e., u \n 0 or v \n 0, or u \n \"\u03b1\" v for some \"\u03b1\" &gt; 0. This property characterizes strictly convex normed spaces such as the \"\u2113p\" spaces with 1 &lt; \"p\" &lt; \u221e. However, there are normed spaces in which this is not true. For instance, consider the plane with the \"\u2113\"1 norm (the Manhattan distance) and denote u \n (1, 0) and v \n (0, 1). Then the triangle formed by u, v, and u + v, is non-degenerate but\nformula_38\nExample norms.\nThe \"absolute value\" is a norm for the real line; as required, the absolute value satisfies the triangle inequality for any real numbers u and v. If u and v have the same sign or either of them is zero, then formula_39 If u and v have opposite signs, then without loss of generality assume formula_40 Then formula_41\nThe triangle inequality is useful in mathematical analysis for determining the best upper estimate on the size of the sum of two numbers, in terms of the sizes of the individual numbers. There is also a lower estimate, which can be found using the \"reverse triangle inequality\" which states that for any real numbers u and v, formula_42\nThe \"taxicab norm\" or 1-norm is one generalization absolute value to higher dimensions. To find the norm of a vector formula_43 just add the absolute value of each component separately, formula_44\nThe \"Euclidean norm\" or 2-norm defines the length of translation vectors in an n-dimensional Euclidean space in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system. For a vector formula_43 its length is defined using the n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem: formula_46,\nand if formula_47 then trivially formula_48 by the nonnegativity of the norm. \nThus, in both cases, we find that formula_49.\nFor metric spaces, the proof of the reverse triangle inequality is found similarly by:\nformula_50\nformula_51\nPutting these equations together we find:\nformula_52\nAnd in the converse, beginning from the reverse triangle inequality, we can again use two cases:\nIf formula_53, then formula_54,\nand if formula_55 then formula_56 again by the nonnegativity of the metric. \nThus, in both cases, we find that formula_57.\nTriangle inequality for cosine similarity.\nBy applying the cosine function to the triangle inequality and reverse triangle inequality for arc lengths and employing the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosines, it follows immediately that\nformula_58\nand\nformula_59\nWith these formulas, one needs to compute a square root for each triple of vectors {\"u\", \"v\", \"w\"} that is examined rather than arccos(sim(\"u\",\"v\")) for each pair of vectors {\"u\", \"v\"} examined, and could be a performance improvement when the number of triples examined is less than the number of pairs examined.\nReversal in Minkowski space.\nThe Minkowski space metric formula_60 is not positive-definite, which means that formula_61 can have either sign or vanish, even if the vector u is non-zero. Moreover, if u and v are both timelike vectors lying in the future light cone, the triangle inequality is reversed:\n formula_62\nA physical example of this inequality is the twin paradox in special relativity. The same reversed form of the inequality holds if both vectors lie in the past light cone, and if one or both are null vectors. The result holds in formula_63 dimensions for any formula_64. If the plane defined by formula_65 and formula_66 is space-like (and therefore a Euclidean subspace) then the usual triangle inequality holds.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was initially scheduled for fielding by 2008. United Defense was the prime contractor; General Dynamics the major subcontractor.

The prototype SPH vehicle is on display at the cannon park at Fort Sill.\nInception.\nThe Crusader was conceived as the Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS), part of a family of vehicles built around a common chassis in the Armored Systems Modernization program. In October 1992, the Army canceled Armored Systems Modernization due to changing budgetary priorities caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nIn 1994 AFAS was renamed \"Crusader.\"\nIn 1996, the Crusader's experimental liquid propellant system was replaced by more traditional solid propellant bags. In 1997 the Government Accountability Office advised the Army to consider either upgrading the Paladin or to purchase the German Panzerhaubitze 2000 instead.\nThe Crusader was intended to replace the M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzer and the M992 Field Artillery Ammunition Support Vehicle (FAASV). It was intended to be an automated gun artillery system to support the Interim Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) Counterattack Corps and a basis for other vehicle developments.\nKey features of the Crusader design included:\nThe Army required that the Crusader was to share a common engine with the M1 Abrams. The principal driver for this change was to shed weight off the Crusader. Caterpillar Inc. proposed a diesel engine, as did a joint venture of General Dynamics and DaimlerChrysler. In September 2000, the Army selected Honeywell's LV 100 turbine engine. The Army was to procure as many as 3600 of these, including 2845 for the Abrams and 846 for the Crusader.\nUsing the same chassis, the resupply vehicles (RSVs) would deliver automatic, reciprocal transfer of ammunition, data and fuel to the SPH or another RSV.\nCancellation.\nIn October 1999, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki outlined a future that envisioned transforming heavy brigades into lighter brigades outfitted with wheeled Interim Armored Vehicles, later renamed \"Stryker.\" Shinseki said the priority of a lighter, more mobile army could shift resources from heavier armored vehicle acquisitions. The following month Shinseki said the vehicles were too heavy: the howitzer and its resupply vehicle would weigh a combined 110 tons, more than could be carried by any of the Air Force's aircraft, including the C-5 Galaxy if flight rules aren't waived. Shinseki spoke with contractor United Defense about bringing down the combined weight of the two vehicles by 20 tons, which United agreed was possible.\nIn April 2001, a panel convened by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recommended canceling the Crusader and other defense modernization programs. An official involved called the Crusader \"a wonderful system -- for a legacy world.\"\nAs of 2002, the Army planned to acquire 480 Crusaders at a program cost of $11 billion.\nIn February 2002, President George W. Bush allocated $475 million for the Crusader program in the White House's 2003 budget proposal, which also proposed increased Pentagon spending by $48 billion.\nIn April, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, whose concerns about defense modernization overspending had intensified, met with Pentagon officials including Army Secretary Thomas E. White to discuss defense spending cuts to free funding for more essential modernization programs. The officials discussed cuts to the Crusader, RAH-66 Comanche helicopter, and F-22 Raptor. Some officials questioned whether the howitzer was redundant given the parallel development of a lighter howitzer for the Future Combat Systems modernization effort.\nOn 9 May, Rumsfeld announced that he would ask Congress to cancel the $11 billion program. Days before, Congress members favorable to the Crusader received talking points from Army officials who sought to save the program. The last-minute lobbying prompted anger from Rumsfeld and an internal Army investigation into its congressional liaison office. The investigation culminated with the resignation of the Army official who had distributed the talking points. After being absolved himself of wrongdoing in the matter, Army Secretary White assured that he supported Rumsfeld's decision and said the Army was analyzing alternatives to the Crusader including the M982 Excalibur 155 mm guided artillery shell. The House Appropriations Committee responded, after rejecting a measure that would have sustained the program until the fall, asking the Pentagon to delay plans to cancel the Crusader. Later that month President Bush asked Congress to reallocate the Crusader's budget towards other Army developmental weapons including $310 million for Future Combat Systems in the proposed 2003 Pentagon budget.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53948", "revid": "49649547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53948", "title": "Hippocampus", "text": "Vertebrate brain region\nThe hippocampus (pl.: hippocampi; via Latin from Greek , 'seahorse'), also hippocampus proper, is a major component of the brain of humans and many other vertebrates. In the human brain the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, and the subiculum are components of the hippocampal formation located in the limbic system. \nThe hippocampus plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation. In humans and other primates the hippocampus is located in the archicortex, one of the three regions of allocortex, in each hemisphere with direct neural projections to, and reciprocal indirect projections from the neocortex. The hippocampus, as the medial pallium, is a structure found in all vertebrates.\nIn Alzheimer's disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be damaged; short-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy. People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia: the inability to form and retain new memories.\nSince different neuronal cell types are neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently been used as a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was initially discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed to be one of the main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.\nUsing rodents as model organisms, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation. Many neurons in the rat and mouse hippocampi respond as place cells: that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a specific part of its environment. Hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex.\nName.\nThe earliest description of the ridge running along the floor of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle comes from the Venetian anatomist Julius Caesar Aranzi (1587), who likened it first to a silkworm and then to a seahorse (Latin \"hippocampus\", from Greek \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (latinised: \"\u00ecpp\u00f3kampos\") from \u1f35\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (\"ippos\"), 'horse' + \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (\"k\u00e1mpos\"), 'sea monster'). The German anatomist Johann Georg Duvernoy (1729), the first to illustrate the structure, also wavered between \"seahorse\" and \"silkworm\". \"Ram's horn\" was proposed by the Danish anatomist Jacob Winsl\u00f8w in 1732; and a decade later his fellow Parisian, the surgeon de Garengeot, used \"cornu Ammonis\" \u2013 horn of Amun, after the ancient Egyptian god who was often represented as having a ram's head. \"Ammon\" is the Greek name for Amun.\nThe head region of the hippocampus is enlarged, and presents two or three rounded elevations or foot-like digitations, and hence it was named the pes hippocampi (\"pes\" meaning \"foot\"). Later this part was described as \"pes hippocampi major\", with an adjacent bulge in the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle, described as \"pes hippocampi minor\" later renamed as the calcar avis. In 1786 F\u00e9lix Vicq-d'Azyr published an authoritative description naming just the \"hippocampus\" but the term remained largely unused with no description of any function proposed until in the middle of the 20th century it was associated with memory.\nMayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by some other authors until Karl Friedrich Burdach resolved this error in 1829. In 1861 the hippocampus minor became the center of a dispute over human evolution between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen, satirized as the Great Hippocampus Question. The term hippocampus minor fell from use in anatomy textbooks and was officially removed in the Nomina Anatomica of 1895. The modern term for the structure is just the hippocampus, with the term \"cornu Ammonis\" (that is, 'Ammon's horn') surviving in the names of the hippocampal subfields CA1\u2013CA4.\nIn the limbic system.\nThe hippocampus is one of the structures of the limbic lobe, first described by Broca in 1878, as the cortical areas that line the deep edge of the cerebral cortex. The limbic lobe is the main component of the limbic system. The cingulate gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus are the two main parts of the described lobe, which had been largely associated with olfaction. Many studies later culminating in work by Papez, and MacLean, the involvement of other interacting brain regions associated with emotion was recognized. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior, including the septal area, the hypothalamic mammillary bodies, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus. MacLean proposed that the associated structures of the limbic lobe be included in what he termed as the \"limbic system\".\nAnatomy.\nThe hippocampus is a five centimeter long ridge of gray matter tissue within the parahippocampal gyrus that can only be seen when the gyrus is opened. The hippocampus is an inward fold of three-layered archicortex (one of three regions of the allocortex) into the medial temporal lobe of the brain, where it elevates into the floor of each lateral ventricle inferior horn. The hippocampus stretches along its anterior-posterior axis, from the amygdala to the splenium of the corpus callosum, with the head, body, and tail regions as subdivisions of this axis. The dentate gyrus, CA subfields, fimbria, and subiculum are divisions across the short axis, the proximal-distal axis.\nThe hippocampal formation refers to the hippocampus, and its related adjoining parts to include the dentate gyrus, the subiculum, the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex. Sometimes the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum are grouped together as the \"subicular complex\", but the regions are neuroanatomically distinct. Some sources may only include the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and subiculum, being regions of the hippocampal three-layered archicortex. But the six regions are linked together serially by almost unidirectional neural pathways. Other sources include the indusium griseum, gyrus fasciolaris, the medial and longitudinal striae, and uncus, and exclude subicular regions. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.\nThe hippocampus has a generally similar appearance across the range of mammals, from egg-laying mammals such as the echidna, to humans and other primates. The hippocampal-size-to-body-size ratio broadly increases, being about twice as large for primates as for the echidna. It does not, however, increase at anywhere close to the rate of the neocortex-to-body-size ratio. Therefore, the hippocampus takes up a much larger fraction of the cortical mantle in rodents than in primates. In adult humans the volume of the hippocampus on each side of the brain is about 3.0 to 3.5\u00a0cm3 as compared to 320 to 420\u00a0cm3 for the volume of the neocortex. There is also a general relationship between the size of the hippocampus and spatial memory. When comparisons are made between similar species, those that have a greater capacity for spatial memory tend to have larger hippocampal volumes.\nNeuroanatomy.\nThe hippocampus, and dentate gyrus that is folded into the hippocampal archicortex have the shape of a curved, rolled-up tube. The curve of the hippocampus (known as \"cornu Ammonis\") uses the initial letters \"CA\" to name the hippocampal subfields CA1-CA4. CA4 is in fact the polymorphic layer or hilus of the dentate gyrus, but CA4 is still sometimes in use to describe the part of CA3 that inserts between the dentate gyrus regions or \"blades\".\nIt can be distinguished as an area where the cortex narrows into a single layer of densely packed pyramidal neurons, which curl into a tight U shape. One edge of the \"U\" is CA4, the hilus of the dentate gyrus. This is embedded into the backward-facing, flexed dentate gyrus. In humans the hippocampus is described as having an anterior and posterior part; in other primates they are termed rostral and caudal, and in rodent literature they are the ventral and dorsal part. Both parts are of similar composition but belong to different neural circuits. The dentate gyrus combined with other hippocampal regions form a banana-like structure, with the two hippocampi joined at the stems by the commissure of fornix (also called the hippocampal commissure). In primates, the part of the hippocampus at the bottom, near the base of the temporal lobe, is much broader than the part at the top. This means that in cross-section the hippocampus can show a number of different shapes, depending on the angle and location of the cut.\nIn a cross-section of the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus, several layers will be shown. The dentate gyrus has three layers of cells \u2013 the outer \"molecular layer\", the middle \"granular layer\", and the inner \"polymorphic layer\" also known as the \"hilus\". The CA3 subfield has the following cell layers known as strata: lacunosum-moleculare, radiatum, lucidum, pyramidal, and oriens. CA2 and CA1 also have these layers except the lucidum stratum.\nThe input to the hippocampus (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) comes from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures as well as with the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.\nThe EC is located in the parahippocampal gyrus, a cortical region adjacent to the hippocampus. This gyrus conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal gyrus is adjacent to the perirhinal cortex, which plays an important role in the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.\nCircuitry.\nThe major input to the hippocampus is through the entorhinal cortex (EC), whereas its major output is via CA1 to the subiculum. Information reaches CA1 via two main pathways, direct and indirect. Axons from the EC that originate in layer III are the origin of the direct perforant pathway and form synapses on the very distal apical dendrites of CA1 neurons. Conversely, axons originating from layer II are the origin of the indirect pathway, and information reaches CA1 via the trisynaptic circuit. In the initial part of this pathway, the axons project through the perforant pathway to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus (first synapse). From then, the information follows via the mossy cell fibers to CA3 (second synapse). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1 (third synapse). Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex, completing the circuit.\nBasket cells in CA3 receive excitatory input from the pyramidal cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This \"recurrent inhibition\" is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells give a \"recurrent excitation\" which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.\nSeveral other connections play important roles in hippocampal function. Beyond the output to the EC, additional output pathways go to other cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. A major output goes via the fornix to the lateral septal area and to the mammillary body of the hypothalamus (which the fornix interconnects with the hippocampus). The hippocampus receives modulatory input from the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine systems, and from the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus to field CA1. A very important projection comes from the medial septal nucleus, which sends cholinergic, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) stimulating fibers (GABAergic fibers) to all parts of the hippocampus. The inputs from the medial septal nucleus play a key role in controlling the physiological state of the hippocampus; destruction of this nucleus abolishes the hippocampal theta rhythm and severely impairs certain types of memory.\nSubfields.\nHippocampal subfields, and subregions, head, body, and tail, are functionally and anatomically differentiated, and connect differently to other brain regions. Their cells are morphologically different. They also have different levels of vulnerability to disease.\nIn humans the head of the hippocampus is termed the anterior hippocampus, the body is the intermediate hippocampus, and the tail the posterior hippocampus. The subregions all serve different functions, project with different neural pathways, and have varying numbers of place cells. (In other primates the terms used are rostral and caudal, and in rodents they are termed ventral and dorsal). The posterior hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze in rats, lesions in the dorsal hippocampus were shown to cause spatial memory impairment. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus, and supramammillary nucleus. In the rat the dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.\nIn the early 20th century, the widely held view was that olfaction was a major hippocampal function. This view was argued against, pointing out that the hippocampus was present in some animals such as dolphins and whales, that did not have a sense of smell; and further that lesions in the temporal lobe in dogs had been shown to have no effect on their sense of smell. These arguments were concluded in 1947 and held for a few more decades. In 1984, and 1987, studies in the rat showed that the entorhinal cortex receives substantial input from the olfactory bulb, with part of the EC being directly innervated by the lateral olfactory tract. Secondary inputs to the EC were also shown to include some from the periamygdaloid and piriform cortices, and CA1 in the ventral hippocampus was shown to sends axons to the main olfactory bulb. It is evident that the hippocampus does have an involvement in memory for odors.\nThe intermediate hippocampus has overlapping characteristics with both the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Studies in 2002, showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced the amount of information sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats. In 2007, studies using anterograde tracing methods, located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus has been particularly linked to fear conditioning and affective processes. \nFunction.\nTheories.\nThree main theories of hippocampal function have been in dominance: response inhibition, episodic memory, and spatial cognition. The response inhibition theory (caricatured by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel as \"slam on the brakes!\") was very popular up to the 1960s. It was based largely on two observations: first, that animals with hippocampal damage tend to be hyperactive; second, that animals with hippocampal damage often have difficulty learning to inhibit previously learnt responses, especially if the response requires remaining quiet as in a passive avoidance test. British psychologist Jeffrey Gray developed this line of thought into a complete theory of the role of the hippocampus in anxiety, called the behavioral inhibition system.\nThe second major line of thought relates the hippocampus to memory. Although it had historical precursors, this idea derived its main impetus from a famous report by American neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville and British-Canadian neuropsychologist Brenda Milner. It described the results of surgical destruction of the hippocampi when trying to relieve epileptic seizures in an American man Henry Molaison, known until his death in 2008 as \"Patient H.M.\" The unexpected outcome of the surgery was severe anterograde, and partial retrograde amnesia; Molaison was unable to form new episodic memories after his surgery and could not remember any events that occurred just before his surgery, but he did retain memories of events that occurred many years earlier extending back into his childhood. This case attracted such widespread professional interest that Molaison became the most intensively studied subject in medical history. \nThe third important theory of hippocampal function relates the hippocampus to space, and spatial memory, with the idea of a cognitive map first proposed by American psychologist E.C. Tolman. This theory was followed further by O'Keefe, and in 1971, he and his student Dostrovsky discovered neurons, in the rat hippocampus that seemed to show activity related to the rat's location within its environment. The neurons were described as place cells. A book was later produced in 1978, \"The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map\" written by O'Keefe and Nadel. It has been generally agreed that the hippocampus plays a key role in spatial coding but the details are widely debated.\nResearch has focused on trying to bridge the disconnect between the two main views of hippocampal function as being split between memory and spatial cognition. In some studies, these areas have been expanded to the point of near convergence. In an attempt to reconcile the two disparate views, it is suggested that a broader view of the hippocampal function is taken and seen to have a role that encompasses both the organization of experience (mental mapping, as per Tolman's original concept in 1948) and the directional behavior seen as being involved in all areas of cognition, so that the function of the hippocampus can be viewed as a broader system that incorporates both the memory and the spatial perspectives in its role that involves the use of a wide scope of cognitive maps. This relates to the purposive behaviorism born of Tolman's original goal of identifying the complex cognitive mechanisms and purposes that guided behavior.\nIt has also been proposed that the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated spatially, and it was suggested that the mechanisms of memory and planning both evolved from mechanisms of navigation and that their neuronal algorithms were basically the same.\nMany studies have made use of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and a functional role in approach-avoidance conflict has been noted. The anterior hippocampus is seen to be involved in decision-making under approach-avoidance conflict processing. It is suggested that the memory, spatial cognition, and conflict processing functions may be seen as working together and not mutually exclusive.\nRole in memory.\nThe hippocampus is essential for the formation of explicit memory, also known as declarative memory. Episodic memory, and semantic memory are the two components of explicit memory.\nThe hippocampus also encodes emotional context from the amygdala. This is partly why returning to a location where an emotional event occurred may evoke that emotion. There is a deep emotional connection between episodic memories and places.\nDue to bilateral symmetry the brain has a hippocampus in each cerebral hemisphere. If damage to the hippocampus occurs in only one hemisphere, leaving the structure intact in the other hemisphere, the brain can retain near-normal memory functioning. Severe damage to the hippocampi in both hemispheres results in profound difficulties in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia) and often also affects memories formed before the damage occurred (retrograde amnesia). Although the retrograde effect normally extends many years back before the brain damage, in some cases older memories remain. This retention of older memories leads to the idea that consolidation over time involves the transfer of memories out of the hippocampus to other parts of the brain. Experiments using intrahippocampal transplantation of hippocampal cells in primates with neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus have shown that the hippocampus is required for the formation and recall, but not the storage, of memories. It has been shown that a decrease in the volume of various parts of the hippocampus leads to specific memory impairments. In particular, efficiency of verbal memory retention is related to the anterior parts of the right and left hippocampus. The right head of the hippocampus is more involved in executive functions and regulation during verbal memory recall. The tail of the left hippocampus tends to be closely related to verbal memory capacity.\nDamage to the hippocampus does not affect some types of memory, such as the ability to learn new skills (playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles, for example). This fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory such as procedural memory in implicit memory function, implicating different brain regions. Furthermore, amnesic patients frequently show implicit memory for experiences even in the absence of conscious knowledge. For example, patients asked to guess which of two faces they have seen most recently may give the correct answer most of the time in spite of stating that they have never seen either of the faces before. Some researchers distinguish between conscious \"recollection\", which depends on the hippocampus, and \"familiarity\", which depends on portions of the medial temporal lobe. A study claims to have confirmed that the hippocampus is not associated with implicit memory. But other sources say the question is still up for debate (as of 2024).\nWhen rats are exposed to an intense learning event, they may retain a life-long memory of the event even after a single training session. The memory of such an event appears to be first stored in the hippocampus, but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. When such an intense learning event was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one hour and at 24 hours after training. These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated, often due to the formation of new 5-methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore, many other genes were upregulated, likely often due to the removal of methyl groups from previously existing 5-methylcytosines (5mCs) in DNA. Demethylation of 5mC can be carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including TET enzymes as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway.\nBetween systems model.\nThe between-systems memory interference model describes the inhibition of non-hippocampal systems of memory during concurrent hippocampal activity. Specifically it was found that when the hippocampus was inactive, non-hippocampal systems located elsewhere in the brain were found to consolidate memory in its place. However, when the hippocampus was reactivated, memory traces consolidated by non-hippocampal systems were not recalled, suggesting that the hippocampus interferes with long-term memory consolidation in other memory-related systems.\nOne of the major implications that this model illustrates is the dominant effects of the hippocampus on non-hippocampal networks when information is incongruent. With this information in mind, future directions could lead towards the study of these non-hippocampal memory systems through hippocampal inactivation, further expanding the labile constructs of memory. Additionally, many theories of memory are holistically based around the hippocampus. This model could add beneficial information to hippocampal research and memory theories such as the multiple trace theory. Lastly, the between-system memory interference model allows researchers to evaluate their results on a multiple-systems model, suggesting that some effects may not be simply mediated by one portion of the brain.\nRole in spatial memory and navigation.\nThere are several types of navigational cells in the brain that are either in the hippocampus itself or are strongly connected to it. They include the place cells, speed cells present in the medial entorhinal cortex, head direction cells, grid cells, and boundary cells. Together these cells form a network that serves as spatial memory.\nThe first of these types of cell discovered in the 1970s were the place cells, which led to the idea of the hippocampus acting to give a neural representation of the environment in a cognitive map. When the hippocampus is dysfunctional, orientation is affected; people may have difficulty in remembering how they arrived at a location and how to proceed further. Getting lost is a common symptom of amnesia. Studies with animals have shown that an intact hippocampus is required for initial learning and long-term retention of some spatial memory tasks, in particular ones that require finding the way to a hidden goal.\nStudies on freely moving rats and mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields, and these fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a particular location.\nHippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex. Speed cells are thought to provide input to the hippocampal grid cells. This place-related neural activity in the hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a restraint chair. However, the place cells may have fired in relation to where the monkey was looking rather than to its actual location in the room. Over many years, many studies have been carried out on place-responses in rodents, which have given a large amount of information. Place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and by granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons, and these often show place-related variations in their firing rate that are much weaker. There is little, if any, spatial topography in the representation; in general, cells lying next to each other in the hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns. Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hz when the rat is near the center. Neural activity sampled from 30 to 40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat's location to be reconstructed with high confidence. The size of place fields varies in a gradient along the length of the hippocampus, with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields, cells near the center showing larger fields, and cells at the ventral tip showing fields that cover the entire environment. In some cases, the firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also the direction a rat is moving, the destination toward which it is traveling, or other task-related variables. The firing of place cells is timed in relation to local theta waves, a spatiotemporal process termed phase precession.\nCells with location-specific firing patterns have been reported during a study of people with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize the source of their seizures, with a view to surgical resection. They had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampi and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London's black cab drivers need to learn the locations of a large number of places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions. Another study showed opposite findings in blind individuals. The anterior part of the right hippocampus was larger and the posterior part was smaller, compared with sighted individuals.\nRole in approach-avoidance conflict processing.\nApproach-avoidance conflict happens when a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making has been associated with anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision-making in uncertain conditions.\nA review makes reference to a number of studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that one challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.\nRole in social memory.\nThe hippocampus has received renewed attention for its role in social memory. Epileptic human subjects with depth electrodes in the left posterior, left anterior or right anterior hippocampus demonstrate distinct, individual cell responses when presented with faces of presumably recognizable famous people. Associations among facial and vocal identity were similarly mapped to the hippocampus of rhesus monkeys. Single neurons in the CA1 and CA3 responded strongly to social stimulus recognition by MRI. The CA2 was not distinguished, and may likely comprise a proportion of the claimed CA1 cells in the study. The dorsal CA2 and ventral CA1 subregions of the hippocampus have been implicated in social memory processing. Genetic inactivation of CA2 pyramidal neurons leads to pronounced loss of social memory, while maintaining intact sociability in mice. Similarly, ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons have also been demonstrated as critical for social memory under optogenetic control in mice.\nPhysiology.\nThe hippocampus shows two major modes of activity, each associated with a distinct pattern of neural population activity and waves of electrical activity as measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG). These modes are named after the EEG patterns associated with them: theta and large irregular activity (LIA). The main characteristics described below are for the rat, which is the animal most extensively studied.\nThe theta mode appears during states of active, alert behavior (especially locomotion), and also during REM sleep (dreaming). In the theta mode, the EEG is dominated by large regular waves with a frequency range of 6 to 9 Hz, and the main groups of hippocampal neurons (pyramidal cells and granule cells) show sparse population activity, which means that in any short time interval, the great majority of cells are silent, while the small remaining fraction fire at relatively high rates, up to 50 spikes in one second for the most active of them. An active cell typically stays active for half a second to a few seconds. As the rat behaves, the active cells fall silent and new cells become active, but the overall percentage of active cells remains more or less constant. In many situations, cell activity is determined largely by the spatial location of the animal, but other behavioral variables also clearly influence it.\nThe LIA mode appears during slow-wave sleep (non-dreaming), and also during states of waking immobility such as resting or eating. In the LIA mode, the EEG is dominated by sharp waves that are randomly timed large deflections of the EEG signal lasting for 25\u201350 milliseconds. Sharp waves are frequently generated in sets, with sets containing up to 5 or more individual sharp waves and lasting up to 500 ms. The spiking activity of neurons within the hippocampus is highly correlated with sharp wave activity. Most neurons decrease their firing rate between sharp waves; however, during a sharp wave, there is a dramatic increase in firing rate in up to 10% of the hippocampal population.\nThese two hippocampal activity modes can be seen in primates as well as rats, with the exception that it has been difficult to see robust theta rhythmicity in the primate hippocampus. There are, however, qualitatively similar sharp waves and similar state-dependent changes in neural population activity.\nHippocampal theta rhythm.\nThe underlying currents producing the theta wave are generated mainly by densely packed neural layers of the entorhinal cortex, CA3, and the dendrites of pyramidal cells. The theta wave is one of the largest signals seen on EEG, and is known as the hippocampal theta rhythm. In some situations the EEG is dominated by regular waves at 3 to 10\u00a0Hz, often continuing for many seconds. These reflect subthreshold membrane potentials and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons and synchronize across the hippocampus in a travelling wave pattern. The trisynaptic circuit is a relay of neurotransmission in the hippocampus that interacts with many brain regions. From rodent studies it has been proposed that the trisynaptic circuit generates the hippocampal theta rhythm.\nTheta rhythmicity previously clearly shown in rabbits and rodents has also been shown in humans. In rats (the animals that have been the most extensively studied), theta is seen mainly in two conditions: first, when an animal is walking or in some other way actively interacting with its surroundings; second, during REM sleep. The function of theta has not yet been convincingly explained although numerous theories have been proposed. The most popular hypothesis has been to relate it to learning and memory. An example would be the phase with which theta rhythms, at the time of stimulation of a neuron, shape the effect of that stimulation upon its synapses. What is meant here is that theta rhythms may affect those aspects of learning and memory that are dependent upon synaptic plasticity. It is well established that lesions of the medial septum\u00a0\u2013 the central node of the theta system\u00a0\u2013 cause severe disruptions of memory. However, the medial septum is more than just the controller of theta; it is also the main source of cholinergic projections to the hippocampus. It has not been established that septal lesions exert their effects specifically by eliminating the theta rhythm.\nSharp waves.\nDuring sleep or during resting, when an animal is not engaged with its surroundings, the hippocampal EEG shows a pattern of irregular slow waves, somewhat larger in amplitude than theta waves. This pattern is occasionally interrupted by large surges called \"sharp waves\". These events are associated with bursts of spike activity lasting 50 to 100 milliseconds in pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1. They are also associated with short-lived high-frequency EEG oscillations called \"ripples\", with frequencies in the range 150 to 200\u00a0Hz in rats, and together they are known as sharp waves and ripples. Sharp waves are most frequent during sleep when they occur at an average rate of around 1 per second (in rats) but in a very irregular temporal pattern. Sharp waves are less frequent during inactive waking states and are usually smaller. Sharp waves have also been observed in humans and monkeys. In macaques, sharp waves are robust but do not occur as frequently as in rats.\nSharp waves appear to be associated with memory. Numerous later studies, have reported that when hippocampal place cells have overlapping spatial firing fields (and therefore often fire in near-simultaneity), they tend to show correlated activity during sleep following the behavioral session. This enhancement of correlation, commonly known as \"reactivation\", has been found to occur mainly during sharp waves. It has been proposed that sharp waves are, in fact, reactivations of neural activity patterns that were memorized during behavior, driven by strengthening of synaptic connections within the hippocampus. This idea forms a key component of the \"two-stage memory\" theory, advocated by Buzs\u00e1ki and others, which proposes that memories are stored within the hippocampus during behavior and then later transferred to the neocortex during sleep. Sharp waves in Hebbian theory are seen as persistently repeated stimulations by presynaptic cells, of postsynaptic cells that are suggested to drive synaptic changes in the cortical targets of hippocampal output pathways. Suppression of sharp waves and ripples in sleep or during immobility can interfere with memories expressed at the level of the behavior, nonetheless, the newly formed CA1 place cell code can re-emerge even after a sleep with abolished sharp waves and ripples, in spatially non-demanding tasks.\nLong-term potentiation.\nSince at least the time of Ramon y Cajal (1852\u20131934), psychologists have speculated that the brain stores memory by altering the strength of connections between neurons that are simultaneously active. This idea was formalized by Donald Hebb in 1949, but for many years remained unexplained. In 1973, Tim Bliss and Terje L\u00f8mo described a phenomenon in the rabbit hippocampus that appeared to meet Hebb's specifications: a change in synaptic responsiveness induced by brief strong activation and lasting for hours or days or longer. This phenomenon was soon referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP). As a candidate mechanism for long-term memory, LTP has since been studied intensively, and a great deal has been learned about it. However, the complexity and variety of the intracellular signaling cascades that can trigger LTP is acknowledged as preventing a more complete understanding.\nThe hippocampus is a particularly favorable site for studying LTP because of its densely packed and sharply defined layers of neurons, but similar types of activity-dependent synaptic change have also been observed in many other brain areas. The best-studied form of LTP has been seen in CA1 of the hippocampus and occurs at synapses that terminate on dendritic spines and use the neurotransmitter glutamate. The synaptic changes depend on a special type of glutamate receptor, the \"N\"-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a cell surface receptor which has the special property of allowing calcium to enter the postsynaptic spine only when presynaptic activation and postsynaptic depolarization occur at the same time. Drugs that interfere with NMDA receptors block LTP and have major effects on some types of memory, especially spatial memory. Genetically modified mice that are modified to disable the LTP mechanism, also generally show severe memory deficits.\nResearch.\nA brain implant for use as a hippocampal prosthesis has been the subject of research since the early 2000s. It was reported in 2018 that a nonlinear multi-input multi-output model (MIMO) had been developed that in some studies, had been shown to restore and improve memory function. This has been followed by a modified version known as the memory decoding model (MDM). This model has been shown to have the potential use in significant modification of memory. A study concluded that further research could be pointed towards an evaluation of both models, in particular focusing on the hippocampal theta wave input.\nClinical significance.\nAging.\nNormal aging is associated with a gradual decline in some types of memory, including episodic memory and working memory (or short-term memory). Because the hippocampus is thought to play a central role in memory, there has been considerable interest in the possibility that age-related declines could be caused by hippocampal deterioration. Some early studies reported substantial loss of neurons in the hippocampus of elderly people, but later studies using more precise techniques found only minimal differences. Similarly, some MRI studies have reported shrinkage of the hippocampus in elderly people, but other studies have failed to reproduce this finding. There is, however, a reliable relationship between the size of the hippocampus and memory performance; so that where there is age-related shrinkage, memory performance will be impaired. There are also reports that memory tasks tend to produce less hippocampal activation in the elderly than in the young. Furthermore, a randomized control trial published in 2011 found that aerobic exercise could increase the size of the hippocampus in adults aged 55 to 80 and also improve spatial memory.\nDementia.\nIn Alzheimer's disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be damaged;\nshort-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. Amyloid beta deposits begin in the frontal lobes before the signs of neurofibrillary tangles are seen in the hippocampus. Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may cause anterograde amnesia: the inability to form and retain new memories. \nDementia is very often caused by cerebral ischemia that is believed to trigger changes in the hippocampus. Changes in CA1, the hippocampal area that underlies episodic memory, cause episodic memory impairment, the earliest symptom of post-ischemic dementia.\nStress.\nThe hippocampus contains high levels of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of other parts of the brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. Anterior hippocampal volume in children is positively correlated with parental family income and this correlation is thought to be mediated by income-related stress. A study has revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.\nChronic stress resulting in elevated levels of glucocorticoids, notably of cortisol, is seen to be a cause of neuronal atrophy in the hippocampus. This atrophy results in a smaller hippocampal volume which is also seen in Cushing's syndrome. The higher levels of cortisol in Cushing's syndrome is usually the result of medications taken for other conditions. Neuronal loss also occurs as a result of impaired neurogenesis. Another factor that contributes to a smaller hippocampal volume is that of dendritic retraction where dendrites are shortened in length and reduced in number, in response to increased glucocorticoids. This dendritic retraction is reversible. After treatment with medication to reduce cortisol in Cushing's syndrome, the hippocampal volume is seen to be restored by as much as 10%. This change is seen to be due to the reforming of the dendrites. This dendritic restoration can also happen when stress is removed. There is, however, evidence derived mainly from studies using rats that stress occurring shortly after birth can affect hippocampal function in ways that persist throughout life.\nSex-specific responses to stress have also been demonstrated in the rat to have an effect on the hippocampus. Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones. In rats, DNA damage increases in the hippocampus under conditions of stress.\nPTSD.\nSome studies shows correlation of reduced hippocampus volume and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans with no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in those with chronic PTSD, traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). It is also the case that non-combat twin brothers of Vietnam veterans with PTSD also had smaller hippocampi than other controls, raising questions about the nature of the correlation. A 2016 study strengthened the theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus increases the likelihood of efficacious treatment.\nTransient global amnesia.\nTransient global amnesia is a syndrome of unknown cause that results in a sudden and temporary anterograde amnesia and variable past memory loss. An attack usually lasts for up to 24 hours during which time the memory loss is experienced. The only diagnostic evidence of TGA is given by DWI-MRI that shows lesions as small dots in the CA1 subfield.\nThe lesions are detectable from around 24 to 96 hours after symptoms onset, and can be seen to have been resolved at a six-month follow-up. The lesions are between 1 and 5 mm, and can be single or multiple and may be confined to either hemisphere. Lesions in the dominant hemisphere affect episodic verbal memory and those in the non-dominant hemisphere affect visuospatial memory.\nCA1 lesions shows selective affect over other CA subfields. The selective vulnerability of CA1 neurons suggests a cause of metabolic stress that could result from emotional or behavioral stress. Other possible causes have been debated including cerebral venous reflex, arterial ischema, epilepsy, and migraine. TGA as a \"network disease\" has also been put forward; DTI studies show a decreased connectivity between brain regions that may impact the hippocampus.\nEpilepsy.\nThe hippocampus is one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated. This process of neurogenesis is confined to the dentate gyrus. Neurogenesis can be positively affected by exercise or negatively affected by epileptic seizures.\nSeizures in temporal lobe epilepsy can affect the normal development of new neurons and can cause tissue damage. Hippocampal sclerosis specific to the mesial temporal lobe, is the most common type of such tissue damage. It is not yet clear, however, whether the epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether the hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures. However, in experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals, hippocampal damage is a frequent result. This may be a consequence of the concentration of excitable glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. Hyperexcitability can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. It may also have something to do with the hippocampus being a site of continuous neurogenesis, and to abnormalities in this process.\nSchizophrenia.\nA reduction in hippocampal volume is well reported in those with schizophrenia. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The volume reduction is modest but consistent, and can be first seen in the prodromal stage with modest progression shown as the disease advances. The reduced volume has been shown to be independent of treatment with antipsychotics. Some studies suggest that hippocampal alterations play a role in causing the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. \nIn those with psychosis the greatest reduction is seen to be in CA3 and CA2 subfields, and a correlation has been made between the reduced volume and memory dysfunction. A reduced hippocampal volume has been shown to result in a decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, with the declarative memory characteristic of hippocampal function becoming selectively impaired. The impaired connectivity is evident both at rest and during task-activity. \nEvidence of dysfunctional GABA transmission has been shown in studies of the whole hippocampus.Another noted change in the hippocampus in schizophrenia is a reduced M4 muscarinic cholinergic receptor, but an unaffected M1 receptor. Reduced neurogenesis has been shown in the dentate gyrus with a noted reduction in the density of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the dentate gyrus and hilus.\nHyperactivity in the hippocampus has been suggested to be implicated in schizophrenic psychosis. The CA1 subfield is mostly indicated to be affected, and hyperactivity almost exclusively found in the anterior hippocampus. It has been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. Many post-mortem studies have assessed the hippocampal subfield proteins. Evidence of hyperactivity was a consistent finding. In CA1 BDNF (an indication of hyperactivity) was notably increased, but the synaptic protein changes seen in the other subfields were not affected. The strongest change was seen in CA3 synaptic anatomy with an increase in the dendritic spines on the apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons. This was most evident at the site of the entrance of the mossy fiber pathway to CA3 neurons. All three subfields have distinct molecular changes associated with schizophrenia.\nMicrocephaly.\nHippocampus atrophy has been characterized in those with microcephaly. Mouse models with Wdr62 mutations which recapitulate human point mutations show a deficiency in hippocampal development, and neurogenesis.\nOther animals.\nOther vertebrates.\nNon-mammalian vertebrates lack a brain structure that looks like the mammalian hippocampus, but they have one that is considered homologous to it. The hippocampus is in essence part of the allocortex. Only mammals have a fully developed cortex, but the structure it evolved from, called the pallium, is present in all vertebrates, even the most primitive ones such as the lamprey or hagfish. The pallium is usually divided into three zones: medial, lateral and dorsal. The medial pallium forms the precursor of the hippocampus. It does not resemble the hippocampus visually because the layers are not warped into an S shape or enfolded by the dentate gyrus, but the homology is indicated by strong chemical and functional affinities. There is evidence that these hippocampal-like structures are involved in spatial cognition in reptiles, and in fish.\nFish.\nIn teleost fish, the forebrain is everted (like an inside-out sock) with structures that lie on the outside, as contrasted with other vertebrate structures that lie in the interior, next to the ventricles. One of the consequences of this is that the medial pallium, the hippocampal zone of a typical vertebrate, is thought to correspond to the lateral pallium of a typical fish. Several types of fish (particularly goldfish) have been shown experimentally to have strong spatial memory abilities, even forming cognitive maps of the areas they inhabit. Studies in goldfish show that damage to both the lateral pallium, and the medial pallium impairs spatial memory coding. It is not clear if the medial pallium plays a similar role in basal vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, or even lampreys and hagfish. The dorsolateral pallium of the teleost is considered as homologous to the hippocampus in terrestrial vertebrates. In 2023, the goldfish brain was mapped by molecular parcellization showing that its telencephalon subregions were homogeneous to the hippocampal subfields in the mouse.\nBirds.\nIn birds, the correspondence is sufficiently well established that most anatomists refer to the medial pallial zone as the \"avian hippocampus\". Numerous species of birds have strong spatial skills, in particular those that cache (store) food. There is evidence that food-caching birds have a larger hippocampus than other types of birds and that damage to the hippocampus causes impairments in spatial memory.\nInsects and molluscs.\nSome types of insects such as cockroaches, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, suggesting that there is no common evolutionary origin. Mushroom bodies in insect brains are associated with learning and memory carried out in the mammalian hippocampus. The brain of the octopus is arranged in a circle of lobes around the esophagus. The vertical lobe has been shown to be involved in forming long term memory, and is seen to be analogous to the mammalian hippocampus and cerebellum, and also to share some functional features of the mushroom bodies in insects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are closely related to the red colobus monkeys of genus \"Piliocolobus\". There are five species of this monkey, and at least eight subspecies. They are generally found in high-density forests where they forage on leaves, flowers and fruit. Social groups of colobus are diverse, varying from group to group. Resident-egalitarian and allomothering relationships have been observed among the female population. Complex behaviours have also been observed in this species, including greeting rituals and varying group sleeping patterns. Colobi play a significant role in seed dispersal.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"colobus\" comes from the Ancient Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03c2 (\"kolob\u00f3s\"), meaning \"docked, maimed\" and refers to their stump-like thumb.\nTaxonomy.\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Common name\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25%;\"|Scientific name and subspecies\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Range\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:29%;\"\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:16%; min-width:112px;\"\n!scope=\"row\"|Angola colobus \n!scope=\"row\"|Black colobus \n!scope=\"row\"|King colobus \n!scope=\"row\"|Mantled guereza \n!scope=\"row\"|Ursine colobus \nFossil species\nBehaviour and ecology.\nColobus habitats include primary and secondary forests, riverine forests, and wooded grasslands; they are found more in higher-density logged forests than in other primary forests. Their ruminant-like digestive systems have enabled them to occupy niches that are inaccessible to other primates: they are herbivorous, eating leaves, fruit, flowers, lichen, herbaceous vegetation and bark. Colobuses are important for seed dispersal through their sloppy eating habits, as well as through their digestive systems.\nLeaf toughness influences colobus foraging efficiency. Tougher leaves correlate negatively with ingestion rate (g/min) as they are costly in terms of mastication, but positively with investment (chews/g). Individuals spend approximately 150 minutes actively feeding each day. In a montane habitat colobus are known to utilise lichen as a fallback food during periods of low food availability.\nSocial patterns and morphology.\nColobuses live in territorial groups that vary in both size (3-15 individuals) and structure. It was originally believed that the structure of these groups consisted of one male and about 8 female members. However, more recent observations have shown variation in structure and the number of males within groups, with one species forming multi-male, multifemale groups in a multilevel society, and in some populations supergroups form exceeding 500 individuals. There appears to be a dominant male, whilst there is no clear dominance among female members. Relationships among females are considered to be resident-egalitarian, as there is low competition and aggression between them within their own groups. Juveniles are treated as a lower-rank (in regards to authority) than subadults and likewise when comparing subadults to adults. Colobuses do not display any type of seasonal breeding patterns.\nAs suggested by their name, adult colobi have black fur with white features. White fur surrounds their facial region and a \"U\" shape of long white fur runs along the sides of their body. Newborn colobi are completely white with a pink face. Cases of allomothering, whereby members of the troop other than the infant's biological mother care for it, are documented. Allomothering is believed to increase inclusive fitness or maternal practice for the benefit of future offspring.\nSocial behaviours.\nMany members participate in a greeting ritual when they are reunited with familiar individuals, an act of reaffirming. The greeting behaviour is generally carried out by the approaching monkey and often is followed with grooming. They participate in three greeting behaviours of physical contact. This includes mounting, head mounting (grasps the shoulders) and embracing. It seems as though these behaviours do not have any relationship with mating or courting.Black-and-white colobus have complex sleeping patterns. They sleep in trees near a food source, which may serve to save energy. Groups seem to regularly switch up sleeping locations (suggested due to reducing risk of parasites and placement prediction) and generally do not sleep near other groups. They also tend to sleep more tightly together on nights with great visibility. They sleep in mid- to upper sections of tall trees which allows for predator watch as well as protection from ground and aerial predators while they are asleep. Although there is no obvious preference for tree type, they have often been observed in \"Antiaris toxicaria.\"\nConservation.\nColobuses are prey for many forest predators such as leopards and chimpanzees, and are threatened by hunting for the bushmeat trade, logging, and habitat destruction.\nIndividuals are more vigilant (conspecific threat) in low canopy, they also spend less time scanning when they are around familiar group members as opposed to unfamiliar. There exists no clear difference in vigilance between male and females. However, there is a positive correlation between mean monthly vigilance and encounter rates. Male vigilance generally increases during mating.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal.\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to a virus, bacterium, or parasite\u2014a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks, which can be either watery or bloody). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present, it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures to confirm the exact cause are not required.\nDiarrhea can be prevented by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding for at least six months and vaccination against rotavirus is also recommended. Oral rehydration solution (ORS)\u2014clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar\u2014is the treatment of choice. Zinc tablets are also recommended. These treatments have been estimated to have saved 50\u00a0million children in the past 25 years. When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food, and babies continue to be breastfed. If commercial ORS is not available, homemade solutions may be used. In those with severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required. Most cases, however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Antibiotics, while rarely used, may be recommended in a few cases such as those who have bloody diarrhea and a high fever, those with severe diarrhea following travelling, and those who grow specific bacteria or parasites in their stool. Loperamide may help decrease the number of bowel movements but is not recommended in those with severe disease.\nAbout 1.7 to 5\u00a0billion cases of diarrhea occur per year. It is most common in developing countries, where young children get diarrhea on average three times a year. Total deaths from diarrhea are estimated at 1.53\u00a0million in 2019\u2014down from 2.9 million in 1990. In 2012, it was the second most common cause of deaths in children younger than five (0.76 million or 11%). Frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those younger than five years of age. Other long term problems that can result include stunted growth and poor intellectual development.\nTerminology.\nThe word diarrhea is from the Ancient Greek from ' \"through\" and ' \"flow\".\n\"Diarrhea\" is the spelling in American English, whereas \"diarrhoea\" is the spelling in British English. Canadian English uses both spellings.\nSlang terms for the condition include \"the runs\", \"the squirts\" (or \"squits\" in Britain), \"Hershey squirts\", \"Montezuma's Revenge\", and \"the trots\".\nThe word is often pronounced as .\nDefinition.\nDiarrhea is defined by the World Health Organization as having three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or as having more stools than is normal for that person.\nAcute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days, by World Gastroenterology Organization. Acute diarrhea that is watery may be known as AWD (Acute Watery Diarrhoea.)\nSecretory.\nSecretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion, or there is an inhibition of absorption. There is little to no structural damage. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions, especially chloride ions (Cl\u2013). Therefore, to maintain a charge balance in the gastrointestinal tract, sodium (Na+) is carried with it, along with water. In this type of diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion is isotonic with plasma even during fasting. It continues even when there is no oral food intake.\nOsmotic.\nOsmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt, these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea. Osmotic diarrhea can also result from maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or coeliac disease) in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium, vitamin\u00a0C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have fructose malabsorption, excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent (e.g., milk or sorbitol) is stopped.\nExudative.\nExudative diarrhea occurs with the presence of blood and pus in the stool. This occurs with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, and other severe infections such as \"E.\u00a0coli\" or other forms of food poisoning.\nInflammatory.\nInflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea can be found in this type of diarrhea. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.\nDysentery.\nIf there is blood visible in the stools, it is also known as dysentery. The blood is a trace of an invasion of bowel tissue. Dysentery is a symptom of, among others, \"Shigella\", \"Entamoeba histolytica\", and \"Salmonella\".\nHealth effects.\nDiarrheal disease may have a negative impact on both physical fitness and mental development. \"Early childhood malnutrition resulting from any cause reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults\", and diarrhea is a primary cause of childhood malnutrition. Further, evidence suggests that diarrheal disease has significant impacts on mental development and health; it has been shown that, even when controlling for helminth infection and early breastfeeding, children who had experienced severe diarrhea had significantly lower scores on a series of tests of intelligence.\nDiarrhea can cause electrolyte imbalances, kidney impairment, dehydration, and defective immune system responses. When oral drugs are administered, the efficiency of the drug is to produce a therapeutic effect and the lack of this effect may be due to the medication travelling too quickly through the digestive system, limiting the time that it can be absorbed. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration. The interventions to control the diarrhea are not often effective. Diarrhea can have a profound effect on the quality of life because fecal incontinence is one of the leading factors for placing older adults in long term care facilities (nursing homes).\nCauses.\nIn the latter stages of human digestion, ingested materials are inundated with water and digestive fluids such as gastric acid, bile, and digestive enzymes in order to break them down into their nutrient components, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream via the intestinal tract in the small intestine. Prior to defecation, the large intestine reabsorbs the water and other digestive solvents in the waste product in order to maintain proper hydration and overall equilibrium. Diarrhea occurs when the large intestine is prevented, for any number of reasons, from sufficiently absorbing the water or other digestive fluids from fecal matter, resulting in a liquid, or \"loose\", bowel movement.\nAcute diarrhea is most commonly due to viral gastroenteritis with rotavirus, which accounts for 40% of cases in children under five. In travelers, however, bacterial infections predominate. Various toxins such as mushroom poisoning and drugs can also cause acute diarrhea.\nChronic diarrhea can be the part of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and bile acid malabsorption.\nInfections.\nThere are many causes of infectious diarrhea, which include viruses, bacteria and parasites. Infectious diarrhea is frequently referred to as gastroenteritis. Norovirus is the most common cause of viral diarrhea in adults, but rotavirus is the most common cause in children under five years old. Adenovirus types 40 and 41, and astroviruses cause a significant number of infections. Shiga-toxin producing \"Escherichia coli\", such as , are the most common cause of infectious bloody diarrhea in the United States.\n\"Campylobacter\" spp. are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by \"Salmonella\" spp., \"Shigella\" spp. and some strains of \"Escherichia coli\" are also a frequent cause.\nIn the elderly, particularly those who have been treated with antibiotics for unrelated infections, a toxin produced by \"Clostridioides difficile\" often causes severe diarrhea.\nParasites, particularly protozoa e.g., \"Cryptosporidium\" spp., \"Giardia\" spp., \"Entamoeba histolytica\", \"Blastocystis\" spp., \"Cyclospora cayetanensis\", are frequently the cause of diarrhea that involves chronic infection. The broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent nitazoxanide has shown efficacy against many diarrhea-causing parasites.\nOther infectious agents, such as parasites or bacterial toxins, may exacerbate symptoms. In sanitary living conditions where there is ample food and a supply of clean water, an otherwise healthy person usually recovers from viral infections in a few days. However, for ill or malnourished individuals, diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration and can become life-threatening.\nSanitation.\nOpen defecation is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea leading to death.\nPoverty is a good indicator of the rate of infectious diarrhea in a population. This association does not stem from poverty itself, but rather from the conditions under which impoverished people live. The absence of certain resources compromises the ability of the poor to defend themselves against infectious diarrhea. \"Poverty is associated with poor housing, crowding, dirt floors, lack of access to clean water or to sanitary disposal of fecal waste (sanitation), cohabitation with domestic animals that may carry human pathogens, and a lack of refrigerated storage for food, all of which increase the frequency of diarrhea... Poverty also restricts the ability to provide age-appropriate, nutritionally balanced diets or to modify diets when diarrhea develops so as to mitigate and repair nutrient losses. The impact is exacerbated by the lack of adequate, available, and affordable medical care.\"\nOne of the most common causes of infectious diarrhea is a lack of clean water. Often, improper fecal disposal leads to contamination of groundwater. This can lead to widespread infection among a population, especially in the absence of water filtration or purification. Human feces contains a variety of potentially harmful human pathogens.\nNutrition.\nProper nutrition is important for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea. It is especially important to young children who do not have a fully developed immune system. Zinc deficiency, a condition often found in children in developing countries can, even in mild cases, have a significant impact on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system. Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency and reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes. However, there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency. Given that estimates suggest 127\u00a0million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.\nMalabsorption.\nMalabsorption is the inability to absorb food fully, mostly from disorders in the small bowel, but also due to maldigestion from diseases of the pancreas.\nCauses include:\nInflammatory bowel disease.\nThe two overlapping types here are of unknown origin:\nIrritable bowel syndrome.\nAnother possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool (diarrhea or constipation) for at least three days a week over the previous three months. Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed through a combination of dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements and medications such as loperamide or codeine. About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have bile acid malabsorption diagnosed with an abnormal SeHCAT test.\nOther diseases.\nDiarrhea can be caused by other diseases and conditions, namely:\nMedications.\nOver 700 medications, such as penicillin, are known to cause diarrhea. The classes of medications that are known to cause diarrhea are laxatives, antacids, heartburn medications, antibiotics, anti-neoplastic drugs, anti-inflammatories as well as many dietary supplements.\nPathophysiology.\nEvolution.\nAccording to two researchers, Nesse and Williams, diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism. As a result, if it is stopped, there might be a delay in recovery. They cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating \"Shigella\" with the anti-diarrhea drug (Co-phenotrope, Lomotil) caused people to stay feverish twice as long as those not so treated. The researchers indeed themselves observed that: \"Lomotil may be contraindicated in shigellosis. Diarrhea may represent a defense mechanism\".\nDiagnostic approach.\nThe following types of diarrhea may indicate further investigation is needed:\nA severity score is used to aid diagnosis in children.\nWhen diarrhea lasts for more than four weeks a number of further tests may be recommended including:\nA 2019 guideline recommended that testing for ova and parasites was only needed in people who are at high risk though they recommend routine testing for giardia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were not recommended.\nEpidemiology.\nWorldwide in 2004, approximately 2.5\u00a0billion cases of diarrhea occurred, which resulted in 1.5\u00a0million deaths among children under the age of five. Greater than half of these were in Africa and South Asia. This is down from a death rate of 4.5 million in 1980 for gastroenteritis. Diarrhea remains the second leading cause of infant mortality (16%) after pneumonia (17%) in this age group.\nThe majority of such cases occur in the developing world, with over half of the recorded cases of childhood diarrhea occurring in Africa and Asia, with 696 million and 1.2 billion cases, respectively, compared to only 480 million in the rest of the world.\nInfectious diarrhea resulted in about 0.7 million deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. In the Americas, diarrheal disease accounts for a total of 10% of deaths among children aged 1\u201359 months while in South East Asia, it accounts for 31.3% of deaths. It is estimated that around 21% of child mortalities in developing countries are due to diarrheal disease.\nThe World Health Organization has reported that \"deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases have dropped by 45%, from sixth leading cause of death in 2000 to thirteenth in 2021.\"\nEven though diarrhea is best known in humans, it affects many other species, notably among primates. The cecal appendix, when present, appears to afford some protection against diarrhea to young primates.\nPrevention.\nSanitation.\nNumerous studies have shown that improvements in drinking water and sanitation (WASH) lead to decreased risks of diarrhoea. Such improvements might include for example use of water filters, provision of high-quality piped water and sewer connections.\nIn institutions, communities, and households, interventions that promote hand washing with soap lead to significant reductions in the incidence of diarrhea. The same applies to preventing open defecation at a community-wide level and providing access to improved sanitation. This includes use of toilets and implementation of the entire sanitation chain connected to the toilets (collection, transport, disposal or reuse of human excreta).\nThere is limited evidence that safe disposal of child or adult feces can prevent diarrheal disease.\nHand washing.\nBasic sanitation techniques can have a profound effect on the transmission of diarrheal disease. The implementation of hand washing using soap and water, for example, has been experimentally shown to reduce the incidence of disease by approximately 30\u201348%. Hand washing in developing countries, however, is compromised by poverty as acknowledged by the CDC: \"Handwashing is integral to disease prevention in all parts of the world; however, access to soap and water is limited in a number of less developed countries. This lack of access is one of many challenges to proper hygiene in less developed countries.\" Solutions to this barrier require the implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviours.\nWater.\nGiven that water contamination is a major means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean water supply and improved sanitation have the potential to dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed that we might expect an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene. Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a 22\u201327% reduction in disease incidence, and a 21\u201330% reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.\nChlorine treatment of water, for example, has been shown to reduce both the risk of diarrheal disease, and of contamination of stored water with diarrheal pathogens.\nVaccination.\nImmunization against the pathogens that cause diarrheal disease is a viable prevention strategy, however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination. In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2\u20133%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6\u201310%. Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera is not one of the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease. Since this time, more effective vaccines have been developed that have the potential to save many thousands of lives in developing nations, while reducing the overall cost of treatment, and the costs to society.\nRotavirus vaccine decreases the rates of diarrhea in a population. New vaccines against rotavirus, \"Shigella\", Enterotoxigenic \"Escherichia coli\" (ETEC), and cholera are under development, as well as other causes of infectious diarrhea.\nNutrition.\nDietary deficiencies in developing countries can be combated by promoting better eating practices. Zinc supplementation proved successful showing a significant decrease in the incidence of diarrheal disease compared to a control group. The majority of the literature suggests that vitamin A supplementation is advantageous in reducing disease incidence. Development of a supplementation strategy should take into consideration the fact that vitamin A supplementation was less effective in reducing diarrhea incidence when compared to vitamin A and zinc supplementation, and that the latter strategy was estimated to be significantly more cost effective.\nBreastfeeding.\nBreastfeeding practices have been shown to have a dramatic effect on the incidence of diarrheal disease in poor populations. Studies across a number of developing nations have shown that those who receive exclusive breastfeeding during their first 6 months of life are better protected against infection with diarrheal diseases. One study in Brazil found that non-breastfed infants were 14 times more likely to die from diarrhea than exclusively breastfed infants. Exclusive breastfeeding is currently recommended for the first six months of an infant's life by the WHO, with continued breastfeeding until at least two years of age.\nOthers.\nProbiotics decrease the risk of diarrhea in those taking antibiotics. Insecticide spraying may reduce fly numbers and the risk of diarrhea in children in a setting where there is seasonal variations in fly numbers throughout the year.\nManagement.\nIn many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth \u2013 oral rehydration therapy \u2013 or, in severe cases, intravenously. Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended. Research does not support the limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea. To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain, and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning. CDC recommends that children and adults with cholera also continue to eat. There is no evidence that early refeeding in children can cause an increase in inappropriate use of intravenous fluid, episodes of vomiting, and risk of having persistent diarrhea.\nMedications such as loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate may be beneficial; however they may be contraindicated in certain situations.\nFluids.\nOral rehydration solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened and salty water) can be used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the \"taste of tears\"). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.\nAppropriate amounts of supplemental zinc and potassium should be added if available. But the availability of these should not delay rehydration. As WHO points out, the most important thing is to begin preventing dehydration as early as possible. In another example of prompt ORS hopefully preventing dehydration, CDC recommends for the treatment of cholera continuing to give Oral Rehydration Solution during travel to medical treatment.\nVomiting often occurs during the first hour or two of treatment with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration since most of the fluid is still absorbed. WHO recommends that if a child vomits, to wait five or ten minutes and then start to give the solution again more slowly.\nDrinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under five as they may \"increase\" dehydration. A too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water. Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable. Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.\nEating.\nThe WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed. Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. In contrast, children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly. The WHO states \"Food should \"never\" be withheld and the child's usual foods should \"not\" be diluted. Breastfeeding should \"always\" be continued.\" In the specific example of cholera, the CDC makes the same recommendation. Breast-fed infants with diarrhea often choose to breastfeed more, and should be encouraged to do so. In young children who are not breast-fed and live in the developed world, a lactose-free diet may be useful to speed recovery.\nEating food containing soluble fibre may help, but insoluble fibre might make it worse.\nMedications.\nAntidiarrheal agents can be classified into four different groups: antimotility, antisecretory, adsorbent, and anti-infectious. While antibiotics are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhea, they are usually not used except in specific situations. There are concerns that antibiotics may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome in people infected with . In resource-poor countries, treatment with antibiotics may be beneficial. However, some bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance, particularly \"Shigella\". Antibiotics can also cause diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea is the most common adverse effect of treatment with general antibiotics.\nWhile bismuth compounds (Pepto-Bismol) decreased the number of bowel movements in those with travelers' diarrhea, they do not decrease the length of illness. Anti-motility agents like loperamide are also effective at reducing the number of stools but not the duration of disease. These agents should be used only if bloody diarrhea is not present.\nDiosmectite, a natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay, is effective in alleviating symptoms of acute diarrhea in children, and also has some effects in chronic functional diarrhea, radiation-induced diarrhea, and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Another absorbent agent used for the treatment of mild diarrhea is kaopectate.\nRacecadotril an antisecretory medication may be used to treat diarrhea in children and adults. It has better tolerability than loperamide, as it causes less constipation and flatulence. However, it has little benefit in improving acute diarrhea in children.\nBile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine can be effective in chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as SeHCAT retention.\nAlternative therapies.\nGreen bananas improved recovery, reduced dehydration and prevented prolonged diarrhea in children with diarrhea. The benefit was attributed to its production of short-chain fatty acids in the colon from its resistant starch content, which enhances colonic water and electrolyte absorption. \nZinc supplementation may benefit children over six months old with diarrhea in areas with high rates of malnourishment or zinc deficiency. This supports the World Health Organization guidelines for zinc, but not in the very young.\nA Cochrane Review from 2020 concludes that probiotics make little or no difference to people who have diarrhea lasting 2 days or longer and that there is no proof that they reduce its duration. The probiotic \"Lactobacillus\" can help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults but possibly not children. For those with lactose intolerance, taking digestive enzymes containing lactase when consuming dairy products often improves symptoms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The aim of the game is to get the boxes onto storage locations. Hiroyuki Imabayashi created the first \"Sokoban\" game in 1981 as a hobby, and the following year, his company Thinking Rabbit published an enhanced commercial version in Japan for the NEC PC-8801 computer. Over the years, new titles were released for various platforms, developed by Thinking Rabbit or other companies under license. The game became popular in Japan and internationally, and the official series has remained active, with its most recent title released in 2021. \"Sokoban\" has inspired unofficial versions, thousands of custom puzzles, similar games, and artificial intelligence research.\nGameplay.\n\"Sokoban\" takes place in a warehouse viewed from above and composed of walls and floor squares. A floor square may be empty, occupied by the player, or occupied by a box. Some floor squares are marked as storage locations. The number of storage locations equals the number of boxes. The objective of the puzzle is to push all boxes onto storage locations.\nThe player can move one square at a time, either horizontally or vertically, onto an empty floor square. Boxes and walls block the player's movement, but the player can walk up to a box and push it to an empty square directly beyond it. If a box is pushed against a wall or another box, it does not move. Pulling boxes is not possible.\nPlaying \"Sokoban\" requires thinking several steps ahead and visualizing all possible outcomes. Players must think carefully and thoroughly before pushing a box to prevent it from being permanently trapped against a wall or other boxes, or in a dead end. These are deadlocks from which the puzzle cannot be solved, regardless of subsequent moves.\nHistory.\nIn 1981, Hiroyuki Imabayashi created the first \"Sokoban\" game as a hobby for the NEC PC-8001 computer. The game used text-based graphics and featured five levels designed by him. For the core mechanic, he was inspired by a part of the gameplay in Hudson Soft's 1980 action game, Aldebaran #1, for the MZ-80K, where the player pushed luggage to act as a wall to prevent radiation. Imabayashi conceptualized that in the warehouse, the boxes had to be organized, but they themselves also became obstacles in the process. He worked to design levels that provided a real challenge, and friends he invited to his home to play the game struggled to solve them. At that time, his wife's parents owned a record store with a small computer section. By chance, a salesman saw the game and suggested that it would sell. Imabayashi used a NEC PC-8801 computer in the store's computer section to port the game, enhancing the graphics and expanding the levels to twenty. In 1982, he founded his company, Thinking Rabbit, based in Takarazuka, Japan, and released this PC-8801 version as the first commercial \"Sokoban\" game in December.\nIn 1983, the Japanese magazine \"PC Magazine\" published \"Sokoban Extra Edition\" as a type-in program featuring ten new puzzles. This game was developed by Thinking Rabbit under request. In 1984, Thinking Rabbit published \"Sokoban 2\", featuring a puzzle editor. Throughout the rest of the 1980s, new titles appeared on a variety of Japanese platforms, including home computers such as the MSX and PC-9801, and video game consoles such as the Famicom, Sega SG-1000, Sega Mega Drive, and Game Boy. These releases were developed either by Thinking Rabbit or by other companies under license agreements.\nIn 1987, Spectrum HoloByte, under license from ASCII, ported and adapted the MSX version of \"Sokoban\" to IBM PC, Apple II, and Commodore 64, adding features for the U.S. market. The game was released in the United States early in 1988 as \"Soko-Ban\".\nIn the 1990s in Japan, further titles followed for the Super Famicom, Windows, Macintosh, and PlayStation.\nAround 2000, Thinking Rabbit became inactive but remained a legal entity. In 2001, the Japanese software company Falcon acquired the copyright to the official \"Sokoban\" games and the trademarks for \"Sokoban\" and Thinking Rabbit, becoming the official developer and licensor of the series. From 2004 to 2007, Falcon developed several titles for Japanese mobile phones. Starting in 2015, it also developed several \"Sokoban\" titles for Windows; in 2016, the smartphone game \"Sokoban Touch\"; and in 2018, three \"Sokoban\" games for specific stations of Japanese digital terrestrial television. All of these titles were published under the Thinking Rabbit brand.\nGames.\nSince its debut in 1982, over 40 official \"Sokoban\" games have been released on various platforms, primarily in Japan but also in other regions. Most titles are standalone, though a few are sequels. The core mechanic of pushing boxes to storage locations has remained consistent in almost all official titles, with few exceptions:\nReception.\nThe December 1983 issue of \"MICOMGAMES\" reviewed the first \"Sokoban\" title, writing that the puzzle is simple but requires thinking comparable to Go or Shogi, and that \"once you start playing, it is hard to stop\" (translated from Japanese). The magazine rated the game's originality 90 out of 100. This first title was a commercial success in Japan, selling over 25,000 copies by July 1984.\nEarly \"Sokoban\" titles released for several Japanese home computer systems such as the NEC PC-9801 and Sharp X1 were a hit, selling over 100,000 copies in total. The Japanese \"Sokoban\" title for MSX published by ASCII sold over 400,000 copies and was considered a commercial success.\nOutside Japan, the US version \"Soko-Ban\" was reviewed in several magazines. In 1988, in the May issue of \"Computer Gaming World\", Roy Wagner reviewed \"Soko-Ban\" (for the IBM PC and Commodore 64). He emphasized the game's addictive quality by suggesting that anyone trying it would likely remain absorbed for a prolonged period, concluding that \"Soko-Ban\" was \"very playable and mentally challenging.\" The IBM PC version was also reviewed in 1988 by other publications; the German magazine \"Happy Computer\", in its January issue, gave it a rating of 87 out of 100, calling it \"a brilliant, relaxed logic puzzle that keeps you thinking without pressure\" (translated from German), and \"Dragon\" magazine's mini-reviews, by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser, considered it their favorite combination of an arcade and strategy game, rating it with 4.5 out of five stars. Separately, the \"Computer Entertainer\" newsletter recommended the Apple II version, stating that playing it was fascinating and hard to stop, receiving 3.5 out of four stars for gameplay and entertainment, with the same rating for graphics. \"Soko-Ban\" sold over 50,000 units by mid-September 1988.\nConsole versions of the game were also reviewed. \"Sokoban Special of Tears\" for Famicom was reviewed in the Japanese \"Family Computer\" magazine's \"All Catalog\" supplement, calling it \"a pioneering puzzle game\" (translated from Japanese) and received 13.45 out of 25 points. \"Computer and Video Games\" magazine rated for Game Boy 88% overall, indicating it as one of the \"simple but effective puzzle games.\" It compared the game's addictiveness with \"Tetris\", stating the game \"is an infuriatingly addictive little title; not quite on a par with \"Tetris\", but not far off.\" Also in the Japanese \"Family Computer\" magazine's \"All Catalog\" supplement, for Game Boy was described as great because of its simple gameplay, receiving 18.78 out of 30 points. was also noted as significantly more difficult and received 17.65 out of 30 points. for Mega Drive was reviewed in the March 1990 issue of the Japanese magazine \"BEEP! Mega Drive\", receiving a total score of 25 out of 40. One reviewer questioned whether people would buy the console specifically to play a puzzle game, while the other three recommended this title for puzzle enthusiasts. In the June 1990 issue of \"Game Player's\" magazine, Tom R. Halfhill reviewed \"Shove It!\" for Sega Genesis, noting it was challenging and would require players to plan their moves carefully. He highlighted its unhurried pace as a refreshing respite from frenzied action games. However, he considered all puzzles essentially the same. In the same issue, Halfhill also reviewed \"Boxxle\" for Game Boy, stating that it required careful planning or plenty of trial and error (usually both), and noted that the game's gameplay could become repetitive because the only variations in the screens were the number and arrangement of crates and the shape of the rooms. In the December 1990 issue of the same magazine, Halfhill reviewed \"Boxyboy\" for TurboGrafx-16, highlighting its logical, untimed puzzles and describing it as a welcome change from typical action games, noting that it was \"virtually identical\" to \"Shove It!\" and \"Boxxle\".\nFinally, in a 1990 issue of \"Famicom Winning Book\", the magazine described the series as \"one of the few early computer games that continues to be discussed today, noted for its difficulty and depth\" (translated from Japanese). It also stated that the game \"has established a firm position as a staple of puzzle games, and has been ported to numerous platforms, including various [Japanese personal computer platforms], where it continues to be published\" (translated from Japanese).\nLegacy.\nThe name \"Sokoban\" is a registered trademark for video game titles. However, the core mechanic of pushing boxes to storage locations on a grid is not protected by intellectual property rights. This has enabled others to create many unofficial versions. Consequently, the term \"Sokoban,\" which refers to the official \"Sokoban\" games, has become genericized and is also used to describe the genre of box-pushing puzzle games that adopt the same core mechanic.\nThe active fan community has created thousands of custom puzzles spanning a wide range of difficulty, as well as software tools, including puzzle editors, solvers, and solution optimizers.\nSeveral independently developed games are based on \"Sokoban\", introducing new mechanics or objectives. One example is \"Sokomania 2: Cool Job\", which featured switches, conveyor belts, and boxes that continued moving after being pushed once.\nResearch.\nThe computational problem of solving Sokoban puzzles has been studied using computational complexity theory, and has been proved to be NP-hard and PSPACE-complete. Solving non-trivial Sokoban puzzles is difficult for computers because of the high branching factor (many legal pushes at each turn) and the considerable search depth (many pushes needed to reach a solution). Even small puzzles can require lengthy solutions.\nSokoban puzzles provide a challenging testbed for developing and evaluating planning techniques. The first documented automated solver, Rolling Stone, was developed at the University of Alberta. It employed a conventional search algorithm enhanced with domain-specific techniques such as deadlock detection. A later solver, Festival, introduced the FESS search algorithm and became the first automatic system to solve all ninety puzzles in the widely used XSokoban test suite. Despite these advances, even the most sophisticated solvers cannot solve many complex puzzles that humans can solve with time and effort, using their ability to plan, recognize patterns, and reason about long-term consequences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53954", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53954", "title": "Work function", "text": "Type of energy\nIn solid-state physics, the work function (sometimes spelled workfunction) is the minimum thermodynamic work (i.e., energy) needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point in the vacuum immediately outside the solid surface. Here \"immediately\" means that the final electron position is far from the surface on the atomic scale, but still too close to the solid to be influenced by ambient electric fields in the vacuum.\nThe work function is not a characteristic of a bulk material, but rather a property of the surface of the material (depending on crystal face and contamination).\nDefinition.\nThe work function \"W\" for a given surface is defined by the difference\nformula_1\nwhere \u2212\"e\" is the charge of an electron, \"\u03d5\" is the electrostatic potential in the vacuum nearby the surface, and \"E\"F is the Fermi level (electrochemical potential of electrons) inside the material. The term \u2212\"e\u03d5\" is the energy of an electron at rest in the vacuum nearby the surface.\nIn practice, one directly controls \"E\"F by the voltage applied to the material through electrodes, and the work function is generally a fixed characteristic of the surface material. Consequently, this means that when a voltage is applied to a material, the electrostatic potential \"\u03d5\" produced in the vacuum will be somewhat lower than the applied voltage, the difference depending on the work function of the material surface. Rearranging the above equation, one has\nformula_2\nwhere \"V\" \n \u2212\"E\"F / \"e\" is the voltage of the material (as measured by a voltmeter, through an attached electrode), relative to an electrical ground that is defined as having zero Fermi level. The fact that \"\u03d5\" depends on the material surface means that the space between two dissimilar conductors will have a built-in electric field, when those conductors are in total equilibrium with each other (electrically shorted to each other, and with equal temperatures).\nThe work function refers to removal of an electron to a position that is far enough from the surface (many nm) that the force between the electron and its image charge in the surface can be neglected. The electron must also be close to the surface compared to the nearest edge of a crystal facet, or to any other change in the surface structure, such as a change in the material composition, surface coating or reconstruction. The built-in electric field that results from these structures, and any other ambient electric field present in the vacuum are excluded in defining the work function.\nMeasurement.\nCertain physical phenomena are highly sensitive to the value of the work function. The observed data from these effects can be fitted to simplified theoretical models, allowing one to extract a value of the work function. These phenomenologically extracted work functions may be slightly different from the thermodynamic definition given above. For inhomogeneous surfaces, the work function varies from place to place, and different methods will yield different values of the typical \"work function\" as they average or select differently among the microscopic work functions.\nMany techniques have been developed based on different physical effects to measure the electronic work function of a sample. One may distinguish between two groups of experimental methods for work function measurements: absolute and relative.\nMethods based on thermionic emission.\nThe work function is important in the theory of thermionic emission, where thermal fluctuations provide enough energy to \"evaporate\" electrons out of a hot material (called the 'emitter') into the vacuum. If these electrons are absorbed by another, cooler material (called the \"collector\") then a measurable electric current will be observed. Thermionic emission can be used to measure the work function of both the hot emitter and cold collector. Generally, these measurements involve fitting to Richardson's law, and so they must be carried out in a low temperature and low current regime where space charge effects are absent.\nIn order to move from the hot emitter to the vacuum, an electron's energy must exceed the emitter Fermi level by an amount\nformula_3\ndetermined simply by the thermionic work function of the emitter.\nIf an electric field is applied towards the surface of the emitter, then all of the escaping electrons will be accelerated away from the emitter and absorbed into whichever material is applying the electric field.\nAccording to Richardson's law the emitted current density (per unit area of emitter), \"J\"e (A/m2), is related to the absolute temperature \"T\"e of the emitter by the equation:\nformula_4\nwhere \"k\" is the Boltzmann constant and the proportionality constant \"A\"e is the Richardson's constant of the emitter.\nIn this case, the dependence of \"J\"e on \"T\"e can be fitted to yield \"W\"e.\nWork function of cold electron collector.\nThe same setup can be used to instead measure the work function in the collector, simply by adjusting the applied voltage.\nIf an electric field is applied \"away from\" the emitter instead, then most of the electrons coming from the emitter will simply be reflected back to the emitter. Only the highest energy electrons will have enough energy to reach the collector, and the height of the potential barrier in this case depends on the collector's work function, rather than the emitter's.\nThe current is still governed by Richardson's law. However, in this case the barrier height does not depend on \"W\"e. The barrier height now depends on the work function of the collector, as well as any additional applied voltages:\nformula_5\nwhere \"W\"c is the collector's thermionic work function, \u0394\"V\"ce is the applied collector\u2013emitter voltage, and \u0394\"V\"S is the Seebeck voltage in the hot emitter (the influence of \u0394\"V\"S is often omitted, as it is a small contribution of order 10 mV).\nThe resulting current density \"J\"c through the collector (per unit of collector area) is again given by Richardson's Law, except now\nformula_6\nwhere \"A\" is a Richardson-type constant that depends on the collector material but may also depend on the emitter material, and the diode geometry.\nIn this case, the dependence of \"J\"c on \"T\"e, or on \u0394\"V\"ce, can be fitted to yield \"W\"c.\nThis retarding potential method is one of the simplest and oldest methods of measuring work functions, and is advantageous since the measured material (collector) is not required to survive high temperatures.\nMethods based on photoemission.\nThe photoelectric work function is the minimum photon energy required to liberate an electron from a substance, in the photoelectric effect.\nIf the photon's energy is greater than the substance's work function, photoelectric emission occurs and the electron is liberated from the surface.\nSimilar to the thermionic case described above, the liberated electrons can be extracted into a collector and produce a detectable current, if an electric field is applied into the surface of the emitter.\nExcess photon energy results in a liberated electron with non-zero kinetic energy.\nIt is expected that the minimum photon energy formula_7 required to liberate an electron (and generate a current) is \nformula_8\nwhere \"W\"e is the work function of the emitter.\nPhotoelectric measurements require a great deal of care, as an incorrectly designed experimental geometry can result in an erroneous measurement of work function. This may be responsible for the large variation in work function values in scientific literature.\nMoreover, the minimum energy can be misleading in materials where there are no actual electron states at the Fermi level that are available for excitation. For example, in a semiconductor the minimum photon energy would actually correspond to the valence band edge rather than work function.\nOf course, the photoelectric effect may be used in the retarding mode, as with the thermionic apparatus described above. In the retarding case, the dark collector's work function is measured instead.\nKelvin probe method.\nThe Kelvin probe technique relies on the detection of an electric field (gradient in \"\u03d5\") between a sample material and probe material.\nThe electric field can be varied by the voltage \u0394\"V\"sp that is applied to the probe relative to the sample.\nIf the voltage is chosen such that the electric field is eliminated (the flat vacuum condition), then\nformula_9\nSince the experimenter controls and knows \u0394\"V\"sp, then finding the flat vacuum condition gives directly the work function difference between the two materials.\nThe only question is, how to detect the flat vacuum condition?\nTypically, the electric field is detected by varying the distance between the sample and probe. When the distance is changed but \u0394\"V\"sp is held constant, a current will flow due to the change in capacitance. This current is proportional to the vacuum electric field, and so when the electric field is neutralized no current will flow.\nAlthough the Kelvin probe technique only measures a work function difference, it is possible to obtain an absolute work function by first calibrating the probe against a reference material (with known work function) and then using the same probe to measure a desired sample.\nThe Kelvin probe technique can be used to obtain work function maps of a surface with extremely high spatial resolution, by using a sharp tip for the probe (see Kelvin probe force microscope).\nWork functions of elements.\nThe work function depends on the configurations of atoms at the surface of the material. For example, on polycrystalline silver the work function is 4.26 eV, but on silver crystals it varies for different crystal faces as (100) face: 4.64 eV, (110) face: 4.52 eV, (111) face: 4.74 eV. Ranges for typical surfaces are shown in the table below.\nPhysical factors that determine the work function.\nDue to the complications described in the modelling section below, it is difficult to theoretically predict the work function with accuracy. However, various trends have been identified. The work function tends to be smaller for metals with an open lattice, and larger for metals in which the atoms are closely packed. It is somewhat higher on dense crystal faces than open crystal faces, also depending on surface reconstructions for the given crystal face.\nSurface dipole.\nThe work function is not simply dependent on the \"internal vacuum level\" inside the material (i.e., its average electrostatic potential), because of the formation of an atomic-scale electric double layer at the surface. This surface electric dipole gives a jump in the electrostatic potential between the material and the vacuum.\nA variety of factors are responsible for the surface electric dipole. Even with a completely clean surface, the electrons can spread slightly into the vacuum, leaving behind a slightly positively charged layer of material. This primarily occurs in metals, where the bound electrons do not encounter a hard wall potential at the surface but rather a gradual ramping potential due to image charge attraction. The amount of surface dipole depends on the detailed layout of the atoms at the surface of the material, leading to the variation in work function for different crystal faces.\nDoping and electric field effect (semiconductors).\nIn a semiconductor, the work function is sensitive to the doping level at the surface of the semiconductor. Since the doping near the surface can also be controlled by electric fields, the work function of a semiconductor is also sensitive to the electric field in the vacuum.\nThe reason for the dependence is that, typically, the vacuum level and the conduction band edge retain a fixed spacing independent of doping. This spacing is called the electron affinity (note that this has a different meaning than the electron affinity of chemistry); in silicon for example the electron affinity is 4.05 eV. If the electron affinity \"E\"EA and the surface's band-referenced Fermi level \"E\"F-\"E\"C are known, then the work function is given by\nformula_10\nwhere \"E\"C is taken at the surface.\nFrom this one might expect that by doping the bulk of the semiconductor, the work function can be tuned. In reality, however, the energies of the bands near the surface are often pinned to the Fermi level, due to the influence of surface states. If there is a large density of surface states, then the work function of the semiconductor will show a very weak dependence on doping or electric field.\nTheoretical models of metal work functions.\nTheoretical modeling of the work function is difficult, as an accurate model requires a careful treatment of both electronic many body effects and surface chemistry; both of these topics are already complex in their own right.\nOne of the earliest successful models for metal work function trends was the jellium model, which allowed for oscillations in electronic density nearby the abrupt surface (these are similar to Friedel oscillations) as well as the tail of electron density extending outside the surface. This model showed why the density of conduction electrons (as represented by the Wigner\u2013Seitz radius \"rs\") is an important parameter in determining work function.\nThe jellium model is only a partial explanation, as its predictions still show significant deviation from real work functions. More recent models have focused on including more accurate forms of electron exchange and correlation effects, as well as including the crystal face dependence (this requires the inclusion of the actual atomic lattice, something that is neglected in the jellium model).\nTemperature dependence of the electron work function.\nThe electron behavior in metals varies with temperature and is largely reflected by the electron work function. A theoretical model for predicting the temperature dependence of the electron work function, developed by Rahemi et al. explains the underlying mechanism and predicts this temperature dependence for various crystal structures via calculable and measurable parameters. In general, as the temperature increases, the EWF decreases via formula_11 and formula_12 is a calculable material property which is dependent on the crystal structure (for example, BCC, FCC). formula_13 is the electron work function at T=0 and formula_14 is constant throughout the change.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nFor a quick reference to values of work function of the elements:"}

The sequel to \"Star Wars\" (1977), it is the second film in the \"Star Wars\" film series and the fifth chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set three years after the events of \"Star Wars\", the film recounts the battle between the malevolent Galactic Empire, led by the Emperor, and the Rebel Alliance, led by Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. As the Empire goes on the offensive, Luke trains to master the Force so he can confront the Emperor's powerful disciple, Darth Vader. The ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.\nFollowing the success of \"Star Wars\", Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel. After she died in 1978, he outlined the whole \"Star Wars\" saga and wrote the next draft himself, before hiring \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) writer Kasdan to enhance his work. To avoid the stress he faced directing \"Star Wars\", Lucas handed the responsibility to Kershner and focused on expanding his special effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic instead. Filmed from March to September 1979 in Finse, Norway, and at Elstree Studios in England, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" faced production difficulties, including actor injuries, illnesses, fires, and problems securing additional financing as costs rose. Initially budgeted at $8million, costs had risen to $30.5million by the project's conclusion.\nReleased on May 21, 1980, the highly anticipated sequel became the highest-grossing film that year, earning approximately $401.5million worldwide. Unlike its lighthearted predecessor, \"Empire\" met with mixed reviews from critics, and fans were conflicted about its darker and more mature themes. The film was nominated for various awards and won two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and a BAFTA, among others. Subsequent releases have raised the film's worldwide gross to $549\u2013$550million and, adjusted for inflation, it is the 13th-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada.\nSince its release, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" has been critically reassessed and is now often regarded as the best film in the \"Star Wars\" series and among the greatest films ever made. It has had a significant influence on filmmaking and popular culture and is often considered an example of a sequel superior to its predecessor. The climax, in which Vader reveals he is Luke's father, is often ranked as one of the greatest plot twists in cinema. The film spawned a variety of merchandise and adaptations, including video games and a radio play. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2010. \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983) followed \"Empire\", concluding the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. Prequel and sequel trilogies have since been released.\nPlot.\nThree years after the destruction of the Death Star, the Imperial fleet, led by Darth Vader, dispatches probe droids across the galaxy in search of the Rebel Alliance. One probe locates the rebel base on the ice planet Hoth. A wampa captures Luke Skywalker before he can investigate the probe crash site, but he escapes by using the Force to retrieve his lightsaber and wound the beast. Before Luke succumbs to hypothermia, the Force spirit of his deceased mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train as a Jedi Knight under the Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and insulates him against the weather inside his deceased tauntaun mount until they are rescued the next morning.\nAlerted to the rebels' location, the Empire launches a large-scale attack using AT-AT walkers, forcing the rebels to evacuate the base. Han, Princess Leia, C-3PO and Chewbacca escape aboard the \"Millennium Falcon\", but the ship's hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer amid the tension. Vader summons several bounty hunters, including Boba Fett, to find the \"Falcon\". Evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the gas planet Bespin, which is governed by his old friend Lando Calrissian. Fett tracks them there, and Vader forces Lando to surrender the group to the Empire, knowing Luke will come to their aid.\nMeanwhile, Luke travels with R2-D2 in his X-wing fighter to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets Yoda, a diminutive creature who reluctantly accepts him as his Jedi apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit. Yoda trains Luke to master the light side of the Force and resist negative emotions that will seduce him to the dark side, as they did Vader. Luke struggles to control his anger and impulsiveness and fails to comprehend the nature and power of the Force until he witnesses Yoda use it to levitate the X-wing from the swamp. Luke has a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, despite Obi-Wan's and Yoda's protestations, abandons his training to rescue them. Although Obi-Wan believes Luke is their only hope, Yoda asserts that \"there is another.\"\nLeia confesses her love for Han before Vader freezes him in carbonite to test whether the process will safely imprison Luke. Han survives and is given to Fett, who intends to collect his bounty from Jabba the Hutt. Lando frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett's escape. The group fights its way back to the \"Falcon\" and flees the city. Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel over the city's central air shaft. Vader defeats Luke, severing his right hand and separating him from his lightsaber. He urges Luke to embrace the dark side and help him destroy his master, the Emperor, so they may rule the galaxy together. Luke refuses, citing Obi-Wan's claim that Vader killed his father, prompting Vader to reveal that he is Luke's father. Distraught, Luke plunges down the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, latching onto an antenna. He reaches out through the Force to Leia, and the \"Falcon\" returns to rescue him. They are attacked by TIE fighters but narrowly evade capture by Vader's Star Destroyer when R2-D2 repairs the \"Falcon\"'s hyperdrive and the vessel escapes.\nAfter the group joins the rebel fleet, Luke's missing hand is replaced by a robotic prosthesis. He, Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 observe as Lando and Chewbacca depart on the \"Falcon\" to find Han.\nCast.\nThe film also features Alec Guinness as Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi, and John Hollis as Lobot, Lando's aide. The Rebel force includes General Rieekan (portrayed by Bruce Boa), Major Derlin (John Ratzenberger), Cal Alder (Jack McKenzie), Dak Ralter (John Morton), Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson), Zev Senesca (Christopher Malcolm), and Hobbie Klivian (Richard Oldfield).\nThe Empire's forces include Admiral Piett (Kenneth Colley), Admiral Ozzel (Michael Sheard), General Veers (Julian Glover), and Captain Needa (Michael Culver). The Emperor is voiced by Clive Revill and portrayed physically by Elaine Baker. The bounty hunter Boba Fett is portrayed physically by Jeremy Bulloch and voiced by Jason Wingreen (who remained uncredited until 2000). Other bounty hunters include Dengar (portrayed by Morris Bush) and the humanoid lizard Bossk (Alan Harris).\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nFollowing the unexpected financial success and cultural impact of \"Star Wars\" (1977), a sequel was swiftly put into production. In case \"Star Wars\" had failed, creator George Lucas had contracted Alan Dean Foster to write a low-budget sequel (later released as the novel \"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\"). Once the success of \"Star Wars\" was evident, Lucas was reluctant to direct the sequel because of the stress of making the first film and its impact on his health. The popularity of \"Star Wars\" brought Lucas wealth, fame and positive attention from the public, but it also brought negative attention in the form of threats and many requests for financial backing.\nConscious that the sequel needed to exceed the original's scope\u2014making it a bigger production\u2014and that his production effects company Lucasfilm was relatively small and operating out of a makeshift office, Lucas considered selling the project to 20th Century-Fox in exchange for a profit percentage. He had profited substantially from \"Star Wars\" and did not need to work, but was too invested in his creation to entrust it to others. Lucas had concepts for the sequel but no solid structure. He knew the story would be darker, would explore more mature themes and relationships, and would continue to explore the nature of the Force. Lucas intended to fund the production independently, using his $12million profit from \"Star Wars\" to relocate and expand his special effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and establish his Skywalker movie ranch in Marin County, California, with the remainder as collateral for a loan from Bank of America for the film's $8million budget.\nFox had the right of first negotiation and refusal to participate in any potential sequel. Negotiations began in mid-1977 between the studio and Lucas's representatives. Fox had already given Lucas controlling interest in the series' merchandising and sequels because it had thought \"Star Wars\" would be worthless. Terms were agreed quickly for the sequel compared to the original, in part because Fox executive Alan Ladd Jr. had been supportive of the original and was eager for the sequel. The 100-page contract was signed on September 21, 1977, dictating that Fox would distribute the film but have no creative input, in exchange for 50% of the gross profits on the first $20million earned, with the percentage increasing to 77.5% in the producers' favor if it exceeded $100million. Filming had to begin by January 1979 for release on May 1, 1980. The deal offered the possibility of significant financial gain for Lucas, but he risked financial ruin if the sequel failed.\nTo mitigate some of the risk, Lucas founded The Chapter II Company to control the film's development and absorb its liabilities. He signed a contract between the company and Lucasfilm, granting himself 5% of the box office gross profits. He also founded Black Falcon to license \"Star Wars\" merchandising rights, using the income to subsidize his ongoing projects. Development for the sequel began in August 1977, under the title \"Star Wars Chapter II\".\nLucas considered replacing producer Gary Kurtz with Howard Kazanjian because Kurtz had not fulfilled his role and left problems unresolved while filming \"Star Wars\". Kurtz convinced him otherwise by trading on his longtime loyalty to Lucas and knowledge of the \"Star Wars\" property. Lucas took an executive producer role, enabling him to focus on his businesses and the development of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981). By late 1977, Kurtz began hiring key crew members, including production designer Norman Reynolds, consultant John Barry, makeup artist Stuart Freeborn, and first assistant director David Tomblin. Lucas rehired artists Ralph McQuarrie and Joe Johnston to maintain visual consistency with \"Star Wars\", and the three began conceptualizing the Hoth battle in December. By this point, the budget had increased to $10million. Lucas wanted a director who would support the material and accept that he was ultimately in charge. He considered around 100 directors, including Alan Parker and John Badham, before hiring his old acquaintance Irvin Kershner in February 1978. Kershner was reluctant to direct the sequel to a film as successful as \"Star Wars\", and his friends warned him against taking the job, believing he would be blamed if it failed. Lucas convinced Kershner it was not so much a sequel as a chapter in a larger story; he also promised him he could make the film his own way.\nWriting.\nLucas began formulating ideas in August 1977. These included the Emperor, Luke's lost sister, and an explanation of facial injuries Hamill had suffered from an accident after filming \"Star Wars\" (Lucas told Hamill that, had he died, his character would have been replaced, not recast). Hamill recounted being told the sister character might be Leia, which he found disappointing. Lucas had written \"Star Wars\" but did not enjoy developing lore for an original universe. Science-fiction writer Leigh Brackett, whom Lucas met through a friend, excelled in quick-paced dialogue. He hired her for $50,000, aware that she had cancer.\nBetween November28 and December2, 1977, Lucas and Brackett held a story conference. Lucas had core ideas in mind but wanted Brackett to piece them together. He envisioned one central plot complemented by three main subplots, set across 60 scenes, 100 script pages, and a two-hour runtime. They formed a general outline and ideas that included the Wookiee homeworld, new alien species, the Galactic Emperor, a gambler from Han's past, water and city planets, Luke's lost twin sister, and a diminutive, froglike creature, Minch Yoda. Lucas drew on influences including \"The Thing from Another World\" (1951), the novel \"Dune\" (1965), and the television series \"Flash Gordon\" (1954). Around this time, Kurtz conceived the title \"The Empire Strikes Back\". He said they avoided calling it \"Star Wars\u00a0II\" because films with \"II\" in their titles were seen as inferior.\nBrackett completed her first draft in February 1978, titled \"Star Wars sequel, from the adventures of Luke Skywalker\". The draft contained a city in the clouds, a chase through an asteroid belt, a greater focus on the love triangle between Luke, Han, and Leia (who is portrayed as a damsel in distress), the battle of Hoth and a climactic duel between Luke and Darth Vader. The ghosts of his father and Obi-Wan visit Luke, leaving Vader a separate character. The draft reveals Luke has a sister (not Leia), Han goes on a mission to recruit his powerful stepfather, and Lando is a clone from the Clone Wars. Lucas made detailed notes and attempted to contact Brackett, but she had been hospitalized, and died of cancer a few weeks later, on March 18.\nRewrite.\nThe strict schedule left Lucas no choice but to write the second draft himself. Though Brackett's draft followed Lucas's outline, he found she had portrayed the characters differently than he intended. Lucas completed his handwritten, 121-page draft on April 1. He found the process more enjoyable than on \"Star Wars\" because he was familiar with the universe, but struggled to write a satisfying conclusion, leaving it open for a third film. This draft established Luke's sister as a new character undertaking a similar journey, Vader's castle and his fear of the emperor, distinct power levels in controlling the Force, Yoda's unconventional speech pattern, and bounty hunters, including Boba Fett. Lucas wrote Fett like the Man with No Name, combining him with an abandoned idea for a Super Stormtrooper. Lucas's handwritten draft included mention of Vader being Luke's father, but the typed script omitted this revelation. Despite contradictory information in drafts that included the ghost of Luke's father, Lucas said he had always intended for Vader to be Luke's father and omitted it from scripts to avoid leaks. Lucas included elements such as Han's debt to Jabba, and recontextualized Luke leaving Dagobah to rescue his friends: in Brackett's draft, Obi-Wan instructs Luke to leave; Lucas had Luke choose to do so. He also removed a scene of Luke massacring stormtroopers to convey him falling to the dark side, wanting to instead explore this in the next film. Lucas believed it was important the characters be inspirational and appropriate for children. His typed draft is titled \"Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\".\nIn June 1978, impressed with his work on \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", Lucas hired Lawrence Kasdan to refine the draft; Kasdan was paid $60,000. In early July, Kasdan, Kershner and Lucas held a story conference to discuss Lucas's draft. The group collaborated on ideas, with Lucas embracing their challenges and input. Mandated to deliver a fifth of the script every other week, Kasdan began his rewrite, focusing on developing character relationships and psychologies; he completed the third draft by early August. This version refined Minch Yoda\u2014alternately named \"the Critter\", Minch, Buffy, and simply Yoda\u2014from a slimy creature to a small blue one; each version retained the character's long life and wisdom. Yoda was intended to teach Luke to respect everyone and not judge by appearances, and defy audience expectations. The draft tightened or expanded dialogue to better pace action scenes, added more romance, and added or changed locations, such as moving a Vader scene from a spaceship deck to his private cubicle. Lucas removed a line mentioning Lando deliberately abandoning his people, and had Luke contact Leia through the Force instead of Obi-Wan's ghost. The fourth draft\u2014mostly the same but with more detailed action\u2014was submitted on October 24.\nAlthough some of Brackett's ideas remained, such as Luke's Dagobah training, her dialogue and characterization were removed. Kasdan described her take as from \"a different era\", lacking the necessary tone. Kazanjian did not believe the Writers Guild of America West would approve of her receiving credit, but Lucas liked Brackett and supported her credit as co-writer. He also provided for her family beyond her contracted pay. The fifth draft was completed in February 1979. It revised some scenes and introduced a \"Hogmen\" species devised by Kershner; Lucas did not like the idea because he perceived them as slaves.\nCasting.\nMark Hamill (Luke), Carrie Fisher (Leia), Harrison Ford (Han), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) all reprised their \"Star Wars\" roles. Hamill and Fisher were contracted for a second, third, and fourth film, but Ford had declined similar terms because of earlier bad experiences; he agreed to return because he wanted to improve on his \"Star Wars\" performance. Hamill spent four months bodybuilding and learning karate, fencing, and kendo to prepare for his stunts.\nDavid Prowse hesitated to return as Darth Vader because, as he was hidden behind a costume, he believed the role offered little job security; he returned after being told further delays would lead to his being replaced. James Earl Jones returned to voice Vader but, as with \"Star Wars\", declined a credit because he considered himself \"special effects\" to Prowse's physical performance. He earned $15,000 for half a day's work, plus a small percentage of the profits. Anthony Daniels was reluctant to return as C-3PO because he had received little acknowledgment for his previous performance, as the filmmakers played down his involvement to portray the droid as a real being. He ultimately agreed, however, for an improved salary. Alec Guinness said he could not return as Obi-Wan because his failing eyesight required him to avoid bright lights. Recasting him was considered but, determined to recruit him, Lucas agreed to a deal in late August 1979 which gave him a more limited role. Guinness was paid 0.25% of \"Empire\"'s box office gross for his few hours of work.\nBilly Dee Williams was cast as Lando Calrissian, making him the first black actor with a starring role in the series. He found the character interesting because of his cape and Armenian surname; Williams believed this gave him room to develop the character. Williams said Lando was much like himself\u2014a \"pretty cool guy\". He believed it was a token role, but was assured it was not specifically written for a black actor. Kershner said Williams had the fantastic charm of a \"Mississippi riverboat hustler\". Howard Rollins, Terry Alexander, Robert Christian, Thurman Scott, and Yaphet Kotto were also considered for the part. Yoda was voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, with assistance from Kathryn Mullen, David Barclay, and Wendy Froud. Lucas had intended for a different actor to provide Yoda's voice, but decided it would be too difficult to cast someone who could match their voice to Oz's puppetry.\nJeremy Bulloch did not audition for Boba Fett; he was hired because the costume fit him. It was uncomfortable and top-heavy, making it difficult to maintain his balance, and the mask often steamed up. Bulloch assumed his lines would be dubbed over, as he had little dialogue (Fett's voice actor, Jason Wingreen, remained uncredited until 2000). Bulloch also appears as an Imperial officer who restrains Leia on Bespin. No other cast member was available for this role, so Kurtz had him quickly change out of the Fett costume to stand in. John Morton portrays Fett in the same scene. There was no extensive casting for the Emperor. Lucas chose Clive Revill to provide the character's voice, and actress Marjorie Eaton physically portrayed the Emperor in test footage. The footage proved unsatisfactory, and special effects artist Rick Baker created a full mask that his wife Elaine wore. Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed over her face; cat eyes and assistant accountant Laura Crockett's eyes were also considered.\nPre-production.\nPre-production began in early 1978. Although Kershner wanted two years, this phase only lasted a year. Seeking an area to represent the ice planet Hoth, location scouts considered Finland, Sweden, and the Arctic Circle. The location needed to be free of trees and near populated areas for amenities. Kershner credited a Fox distribution employee with recommending Finse, Norway; Kurtz said it was Reynolds who had done so. For the bog planet Dagobah, scouts looked at Central Africa, Kenya, and Scandinavia, but Lucas wanted to avoid shooting on location. He funded the construction of a \"\"Star Wars\" stage\" at Elstree Studios, London, for the Dagobah and rebel base sets. Construction for the stage\u2014which measured and cost $2million\u2014began at the end of August. Sets were the single biggest expense of the production, costing a total of $3.5million. By December, the budget had increased to $21.5million, more than double the original estimate. Financial projections for The Chapter II Company suggested it would run a monthly deficit of $5\u201325million by the end of 1979, including over $2million in production costs and $400,000 to fund ILM.\nAs the start of filming in January 1979 loomed, a fire on Elstree's Stage 3\u2014where \"The Shining\" (1980) was being filmed\u2014destroyed the space planned for \"Empire\"'s sets. The impact was significant, resulting in the \"Empire\" production being forced to give up two stages so \"The Shining\" could continue filming. Sixty-four sets had to be moved through nine stages and the filming schedule had to be altered. Poor weather delayed construction of necessary sets, props, and the \"Star Wars\" stage. By February 25, the Finse location crew had arrived in Norway to receive flown-in equipment containers and begin digging trenches for battle scenes.\nMusic.\nThe musical score for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was composed and conducted by John Williams and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, at a cost of about $250,000. Williams began planning the score in November 1979, estimating the film would require 107 minutes of music. For two weeks across 18 three-hour sessions just after Christmas, Williams recorded the score at Anvil Studios and Abbey Road Studios, London. Up to 104 musicians were involved at a time, playing such instruments as oboes, piccolos, pianos, and harps.\nFilming.\nCommencement in Norway.\nPrincipal photography began on March\u00a05, 1979, on the Hardangerj\u00f8kulen glacier near Finse, Norway, representing the planet Hoth. Initially scheduled to conclude on June 22, by the end of the first week it was obvious it would take longer and cost more.\nFilming the Hoth scenes on a set was considered, but ultimately rejected as inauthentic. The location filming coincided with the area's worst snowstorm in half a century, impeding the production with blizzards, winds, and temperatures between and . The weather cleared only twice; some days, filming could not take place. The frigid conditions made the acetate film brittle, camera lenses iced over, snow seeped into equipment, and effects paint froze inside the tin. To counter these effects, lenses were kept cool but the camera body was warmed to protect the film, battery, and camera operators' hands. The crew was outside for up to 11 hours at a time, being subjected to thin air, limited visibility, and mild frostbite; one crewman slipped and broke two ribs. The difficult conditions led to strong camaraderie among crewmembers.\nAvalanches blocked direct transport links, and trenches dug by the crew quickly filled with snow. Scenes could be prepared only a few hours in advance and many scenes were filmed just outside the crew's hotel as the shifting weather regularly altered the scenery. Although Fisher was not scheduled to film scenes in Norway, she joined Hamill on location because she wanted to observe the process. Ford was not scheduled for the Finse phase, but to compensate for the delays, he was brought there instead of creating a separate set in a Leeds studio. On a few hours' notice, he arrived in Finse, having traveled the last of the snow-laden journey by snowplow. Production returned to England after a week, though Hamill had an additional day of filming. The second unit remained in Norway through March to film explosions, incidental footage, and battle scenes featuring 35 mountain rescue skiers as extras. The skiers' work was compensated with a donation to the Norwegian Red Cross.\nTo film the Imperial probe landing, eight sticks of dynamite were placed on the glacier and set to explode at sunrise, but the demolitions expert in charge knocked the battery out of his radio and received the message too late to capture the intended shot. The opening sweeping shot of the area was captured by flying a helicopter to and performing a controlled drop at a rate of or a minute. A heated shelter for the helicopter had to be constructed, which delayed filming of the shot by four weeks. The second unit, scheduled to be in Finse for three weeks, was there for eight. When the crew returned to London, they had only half the planned footage, and background images for special effects shots were uneven. \"Empire\"'s budget increased to around $22million because of the delays and having to rework scenes to compensate for the missing footage.\nFilming at Elstree Studios.\nFilming at Elstree began on March 13, 1979. Production remained behind schedule without Stage 3 (which had been destroyed by fire), and the incomplete \"Star Wars\" stage lacked protection from the cold weather. The result was that the crew had to work out of any available space. To save time, some scenes were shot simultaneously, such as those set in the ice cavern and medical bay. Kershner wanted each character to make a unique entrance in the film. While filming Vader's entrance, the snow troopers preceding Prowse tripped over the polystyrene ice, and the stuntman behind him stood on his cape, breaking it off, causing Prowse to fall onto the snow troopers.\nThe shoot was strenuous and mired in conflicts. Fisher suffered from influenza and bronchitis, her weight dropped to while working 12-hour days, and she collapsed on set from an allergic reaction to steam or spray paint. She was also allergic to most makeup. Her overuse of hallucinogens and painkillers worsened her condition, as did the anxiety she experienced while performing her speech to the rebels. Stress and personal traumas led to frequent arguments among Hamill, Fisher, and Ford. Ford and Hamill fell ill or were injured at different times. Hamill was depressed by his isolation from human cast members, as his scenes required him to interact mostly with puppets, robots, and actors whose voices would be added later or dubbed over. He was meant to use an earpiece to hear Oz's Yoda dialogue, but for various reasons this did not work, and he struggled to form a relationship with the character. The Dagobah set was liberally sprayed with mineral oil, which caused him physical discomfort for long periods. Hamill called it a \"physical ordeal the whole time... but I don't really mind that\". At one point, Oz cheered Hamill up with a Miss Piggy routine. Hamill recalled Ford giving him a kiss instead of reading his lines, which entertained the crew. Mayhew fell ill while filming Han's torture scene because the set used bursts of steam, which raised the ambient temperature to while he was wearing a wool suit.\nBank of America representatives visited the set in late March, concerned about rising costs. Lucas rarely visited the set, but arrived on May 6 after realizing the production was behind schedule and over budget. An official Lucasfilm memo instructed staff to misstate the film's direct costs as $17million. At this point, Kurtz and Lucas estimated it would cost $25\u201328million to complete filming. Finances ran out in mid-July when Bank of America refused to increase the loan. The crisis was kept from the crew, including Kershner, and tactics were used to delay its impact, including paying staff biweekly instead of weekly and Lucas borrowing money from his merchandising company Black Falcon. Lucas worried he would have to sell \"Empire\" and its associated rights to Fox to sustain the project, losing his creative freedom. Fox was also threatening to buy out the bond and take over filming. With about 20% of \"Empire\" left to film, Lucasfilm president Charles Weber arranged for Bank of Boston to refinance the loan to $31million, including $27.7million from Bank of Boston and $3million guaranteed by Fox in exchange for an increased percentage of the theatrical returns and 10% of merchandising profits. Lucasfilm took out the loan, making the company directly liable.\nThe \"Star Wars\" stage was completed in early May. It was too small to house the Rebel hangar and Dagobah sets, and an extension had to be funded and built. The producers mandated filming begin on the stage on May 18, regardless of its state. The hangar scene involved 77 rebel extras, which cost \u00a32,000 per day. Around of dendritic salt, mixed with magnesium sulfate for a sparkle effect, were used for the snowy sets; this combination of substances gave the cast and crew headaches. Second unit director John Barry died suddenly in early June; Harley Cokeliss replaced him a week later. The typical purpose of the second unit was to do time-consuming filming for special effects shots, but they were now filming main scenes\u2014including Luke's ice cave imprisonment\u2014because the schedule had overrun by around 26 days. Hamill was unavailable for several days after injuring his hand during a stunt jump from a speeder bike. Having been called in for the stunt the same day his son was born, aggravated by the salt-laden setting, and exhausted, he angrily chastised Kurtz for not using a double for the scene. Kershner's hands-on directing style, which included him acting out how he wanted a scene performed, agitated Hamill; Kershner, for his part, was frustrated that Hamill was not following his advice.\nThe life-size hangar set was dismantled in mid-June to allow the construction of other sets around the full-scale \"Millennium Falcon\". These scenes had to be filmed efficiently, so the \"Falcon\" could be dismantled to make way for the Dagobah set. Filming began on the carbon chamber scene in late June while the second unit filmed anything they could. The raised set was largely incomplete, and low lighting and steam were used to conceal any obvious flaws. The fog machines and heat from the steam made many cast and crew members sick; it took approximately three weeks to film. The confession of love between Leia and Han was scripted with both of them admitting their feelings for the other. Kershner felt this was too \"sappy\". He had Ford improvise lines repeatedly until Ford said he would do only one more take; his response to Leia's confession of love in the final take was \"I know\". By the end of the month, cast and crew morale was low.\nThe duel, Dagobah, and conclusion.\nHamill returned in early July to film his climactic battle against Darth Vader, portrayed by stunt double Bob Anderson, who said the experience was like fighting blindfolded because of the costume. Hamill spent weeks practicing his fencing routine, eventually growing frustrated and refusing to continue. The next scene, where Vader confesses he is Luke's father, was shrouded in secrecy. Prowse was given the line \"Obi-Wan Kenobi is your father\" to read because he was known for repeatedly leaking information. Only Kershner, the producers, and Hamill knew the actual line. While filming the scene, Hamill was positioned on a platform suspended above a pile of mattresses. Footage of his fall into the reactor shaft was damaged during processing and the scene had to be reshot in early August. The Vader confrontation took eight weeks to film. Hamill insisted on doing as many of his stunts as possible, though the insurers refused to allow him to perform a fall out of a window. He accidentally fell from a nine-inch ledge high but rolled on landing to avoid injury. Lucas returned to the set on July 15 and stayed for the rest of filming. He rewrote Luke's scenes on Dagobah, removing or trimming them so they could be shot in just over two weeks.\nMost of the cast completed filming by the start of August, including Ford, Fisher, Williams, Mayhew, and Daniels. Hamill began filming on the Dagobah set with Yoda. They only had 12 days to film because Oz was scheduled for another project. With the film now over 50 days behind schedule, Kurtz was removed from his role and replaced by Kazanjian and associate producer Robert Watts. One of the last scenes shot was of Luke exploring the dark side tree on Dagobah. A wrap party was held on the set to mark the official conclusion of filming on September 5, 1979, after 133 days. Guinness filmed his scenes against a bluescreen the same day. Kershner and the second unit continued filming additional footage, including Luke's X-Wing being raised from the swamp. Kershner left the set on September 9, and Hamill finished 103 days of filming two days later. The second unit finished filming on September 24 with Hamill's stunt double. There was approximately of film, or 80 hours of footage.\nThe final budget was $30.5million. Kurtz blamed , which had increased resource, cast, and crew costs significantly. Lucas blamed Kurtz for lack of oversight and poor financial planning. Watts said Kurtz was not good with people and never developed a working relationship with Kershner, making it difficult for him to temper the director's indulgences. Kurtz had also given Kershner more leeway because of the delays caused by the Stage 3 fire. Kershner's slower work pace had frustrated Lucas. He described his filming style as frugal, performing two or three takes with little coverage film that could later compensate for mistakes. Watts and Reynolds said Kershner often looked at new ways of doing things, but this required planning that only delayed things further. Kershner had tried replicating the quick pacing of \"Star Wars\", not lingering on any scene for too long, and encouraged improvisation, modifying scenes and dialogue to focus more on characters' emotions, such as C-3PO interrupting Han and Leia as they are about to kiss. Kazanjian said many mistakes were made but blamed Weber, Lucasfilm vice president John Moohr, and primarily Kurtz. Actor John Morton called Kurtz an unsung hero, who brought his experience of filming war to \"Empire\".\nPost-production.\nThe schedule overrun resulted in filming and post-production taking place simultaneously; filmed footage was shipped immediately to ILM to begin effects work. A rough cut resembling the finished film (minus special effects) was put together by mid-October 1979. Lucas provided 31 pages of notes about changes he wanted, mainly alterations in dialogue and scene lengths. Jones recorded Vader's dialogue in late 1979 and early 1980. In early 1980, Lucas changed the long-planned opening of Luke riding his tauntaun to a shot of the Star Destroyer launching probes. He continued tweaking elements to improve the special effects, but even with ILM staff working up to 24 hours a day, six days a week, there was not enough time to do everything they wanted. A Dagobah pick-up scene, in which R2-D2 is spat out by a monster, was filmed in Lucas's swimming pool; the Emperor's scenes were filmed in February 1980.\nFox executives did not see a cut of the film until March. That month, Lucas decided he wanted an additional Hoth scene and auditioned 50 ILM crew to appear as Rebels. The final 124-minute cut was completed on April 16, which triggered a $10million payment from Fox to Bank of Boston. Lucasfilm also launched an employee bonus scheme to share \"Empire\"'s profits with its staff. Test screenings were held in San Francisco on April 19. While the tauntaun special effect was criticized, audiences liked Han's reply of \"I know\" to Leia's confession of love. Lucas was unimpressed by the scene, believing it was not how Han would act. Because the magnetic soundtrack could flake from the film reels, Kurtz hired people to watch the film reels 24 hours a day to identify defects; 22% were defective.\nShortly after the film's theatrical release, Lucas decided the ending was unclear about where Luke and Leia were in relation to Lando and Chewbacca. In the three-week window between its limited and wider release, Lucas, Johnston, and visual effects artist Ken Ralston filmed enhancement scenes at ILM, using existing footage, a new score, modified dialogue, and new miniatures to create establishing shots of the Rebel fleet and their relative positions. By the project's conclusion, around 700 people had worked on \"Empire\".\nSpecial effects and design.\nLucas's firm, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, developed the special effects for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" at a cost of $8million, including staffing and the construction of the company's new facility in Marin County, California. The building was still under construction when staff arrived in September 1978, and initially lacked the equipment that would be necessary to complete their work. Compared to the 360 special effects shots for \"Star Wars\", \"Empire\" required around 600.\nThe crew, supervised by Richard Edlund and Brian Johnson, included Dennis Muren, Bruce Nicholson, Lorne Peterson, Steve Gawley, Phil Tippett, Tom St. Amand, and Nilo Rodis-Jamero. Up to 100 people worked on the project daily, including Stuart Freeborn, who was responsible mainly for crafting the Yoda puppet. Various techniques, including miniatures, matte paintings, stop motion, articulated models and full-size vehicles were used to create \"Empire\"'s many effects.\nRelease.\nContext.\nIndustry professionals expected comedies and positive entertainment to dominate theaters in 1980 because of low morale in the United States caused by an economic recession. This generally increased theatrical visits as audiences sought escapism and ignored romantic films and depictions of blue-collar life. A surge of interest in science fiction following \"Star Wars\" led to many low-budget entries in the genre attempting to profit by association and big-budget entries such as \"\" and \"The Black Hole\", both released just months before \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Sequels were not expected to perform as well as their originals, and there were low expectations for merchandising. Even so, tie-in deals were arranged with Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, General Mills, and Topps collectibles.\nFox was confident in the film and spent little money on advertising, taking out small advertisements in newspapers instead of full-page spreads. The studio's market research showed 60% of those interested in the film were male. Lucasfilm set up a telephone number allowing callers to hear a message from cast members. Fox demanded a minimum 28-week appearance in theaters, although 12 weeks was the norm for major films. Estimates suggested \"Empire\" needed to earn $57.2million to be profitable, after marketing, distribution, and loan interest costs.\nCredits and title.\nAs with \"Star Wars\", Lucas wanted to place all of the crew credits at the end of the film to avoid interfering with the opening. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Directors Guild of America (DGA) had allowed this for the first film because Lucas directed and it opened with the logo for his namesake Lucasfilm, but for \"Empire\" they refused to allow Kershner or the first and second unit directors to be credited only at the end, fined Lucas $250,000 when he ignored them and tried to have the film removed from theaters. Because Lucas had followed the laws relevant to the United Kingdom where it was produced, the DGA was unable to sanction him and instead fined Kershner $25,000. Lucas paid his fine but was so frustrated that he left the WGA, DGA, and Motion Picture Association, which restricted his ability to write and direct future films.\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" leaked the film's title in January 1978; it was officially announced in August. The opening crawl identified the film as \"Star Wars: Episode\u00a0V \u2014 The Empire Strikes Back\", establishing Lucas's plan to make a nine-part \"Star Wars\" series. \"Star Wars\" was also renamed \"Episode IV \u2014 A New Hope\". Roger Kastel designed the theatrical poster.\nBox office.\nA sneak preview of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" took place on May\u00a06, 1980 at the Dominion Theatre in London, followed by another preview screening on May\u00a017 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. This event, which featured the principal cast, was attended by 600 children, including Special Olympians. The film's world premiere took place on May\u00a020 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. Dubbed \"Empire Day\", the event included actors in Stormtrooper attire interacting with people across the city.\nIn North America, \"Empire\" opened mid-week on May\u00a021, leading into the extended Memorial Day holiday weekend. The number of theaters was deliberately limited to 126 to make it difficult to get a ticket, thus generating more appeal\u2014a strategy used with films expected to receive positive word of mouth. The film earned $1.3million during its opening day\u2014an average of $10,581 per theater. It garnered a further $4.9million during the weekend and $1.5million during the Monday holiday, for a total of $6.4million\u2014an average of $50,919 per theater. This made \"Empire\" the number one film of the weekend, ahead of the counterprogrammed debuts of the comedy \"The Gong Show Movie\" ($1.5million) and \"The Shining\" ($600,000). By the end of its first week, the film had earned $9.6million\u2014a 60% increase over \"Star Wars\"\u2014averaging $76,201 per theater, the highest-ever figure for a film in over 100 theaters.\nIt remained number one until its fourth weekend, when it fell to third with $3.6million, behind the spoof comedy \"Wholly Moses!\" ($3.62million) and the Western \"Bronco Billy\" ($3.7million). It regained the number one position in its fifth weekend, expanding its theater count to 823 and earning $10.8million. Combined with its weekday gross, \"Empire\" garnered a single-week gross of approximately $20million, a box office record the film would hold until \"Superman II\"'s $24million the following year. It remained number one for the next seven weeks, before falling to number two in its thirteenth week with $4.3million, behind the debuting \"Smokey and the Bandit II\" ($10.9million). Detailed box office tracking is unavailable for the rest of \"Empire\"'s 32-week, 1,278-theater total run.\n\"Empire\" earned between $181.4\u2013209.4million in its initial North American release, making it the highest-grossing film of the year, ahead of the comedy films \"9 to 5\" ($103.3million), \"Stir Crazy\" ($101.3million), and \"Airplane!\" ($83.5million). Although it earned less than the $221.3million of \"Star Wars\", \"Empire\" was considered a financial success. Industry experts estimated the film returned $120million to the filmmakers, which recouped Lucas's investment and cleared his debt; he paid out $5million in employee bonuses. Box office figures are unavailable for all the releases outside of North America in 1980, although \"The New York Times\" reported the film performed well in the United Kingdom and Japan. According to \"Variety\", \"Empire\" earned approximately $192.1million, giving the film a cumulative worldwide gross of $401.5million, making it the highest-grossing film of the year. \"Empire\" did not achieve the same success as \"Star Wars\", which Lucas blamed on its inconclusive ending.\n\"Empire\" has received multiple theatrical re-releases, including in July 1981 ($26.8million), November 1982 ($14.5million), and Special Edition versions (modified by Lucas) in February 1997 ($67.6million). Cumulatively, these releases have raised the North American box office gross to $291.7\u2013$292.8million. It is estimated to have earned a worldwide total of $549\u2013$550million. Adjusted for inflation, the North American box office is equivalent to $920.8million, making it the thirteenth-highest-grossing film ever.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\" received mixed reviews upon its initial release, a change from the positive reception of \"Star Wars\". In March 1981, The \"Los Angeles Times\" released a summary of the leading critics' choices for top 10 films of the year: Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" appeared on 42 lists, while \"Empire\" made it onto 24. Fan reactions were decidedly mixed, with many concerned by the film's change in tone and surprising narrative revelations, particularly Leia's love for Han over Luke and Luke's relationship with Vader. However, opening weekend audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, with males and those under the age of 25 rating it highest.\nSome critics believed \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was a good film but not as enjoyable as \"Star Wars\". They believed the tonal shift featuring darker material and more mature story lines detracted from the charm, fun, and comic silliness of the original. \"The Wall Street Journal\"'s Joy Gould Boyum believed it was \"absurd\" to add dramatic weight to the lighthearted \"Star Wars\", stripping it of its innocence. Writing for \"The Washington Post\", Gary Arnold found the darker undercurrents and greater narrative scale interesting because it created more dramatic threads to explore. \"The New Yorker\"'s David Denby argued it was more spectacular than the original, but lacked its camp style. \"The Hollywood Reporter\"'s Arthur Knight believed the novelty of the original and the plethora of space opera films produced since made \"Empire\" seem derivative; even so, he called it the best in the genre since \"Star Wars\". Writing for \"Time\", Gerald Clarke said \"Empire\" surpassed \"Star Wars\" in several ways, including being more visually and artistically interesting. \"The New York Times\"'s Vincent Canby called it a more mechanical, less suspenseful experience.\nWriting for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Charles Champlin said the inconclusive ending cleverly completed the narrative while serving as a cliffhanger, but Clarke called it a \"not very satisfying\" conclusion. Canby and the \"Chicago Reader\"'s Dave Kehr believed that as the middle film, it should have focused on narrative development instead of exposition, finding little narrative progression between the film's beginning and end. \"The Washington Post\"'s Judith Martin labeled it a \"good junk\" film, enjoyable but fleeting, because it lacked a stand-alone narrative. Knight and Clarke found the story sometimes difficult to follow\u2014Knight because the third act jumped between separate storylines, and Clarke because he missed important information in the fast-paced plot. Kehr and \"Sight &amp; Sound\"'s Richard Combs wrote that characterization seemed to be less important than special effects, visual spectacle and action set pieces that accomplished little narratively.\nReviews were mixed for the principal cast. Knight wrote that Kershner's direction made the characters more human and less archetypal. Hamill, Fisher, and Ford received some praise, with Champlin calling Hamill \"youthfully innocent\" and engaging, and Fisher independent. Arnold described the character progression as less about development and more about \"finesse\", with little change taking place, while Kehr felt the characters were \"stiffer\" without Lucas's direction. Knight called Guinness's performance half-hearted, and Janet Maslin criticized Lando Calrissian, the only major black character in the film, as \"exaggeratedly unctuous, untrustworthy and loaded with jive\". The \"Chicago Tribune\"'s Gene Siskel said the non-human characters, including the robots and Chewbacca, remained the most lovable creatures, with Yoda being the film's highlight. Knight, Gould Boyum, and Arnold thought Yoda to be incredibly lifelike; Arnold considered his expressions so realistic that he believed an actor's face had been composited onto the puppet. Canby called the human cast bland and nondescript, and said even the robot characters offered diminishing enjoyment, but Yoda was a success when used sparingly.\nAlthough Arnold praised Kershner's direction, others believed that Lucas's oversight was obvious and \"Empire\" lacked Kershner's established directorial sensibilities. Denby described his work as \"impersonal\" and Canby believed it was impossible to identify what Kershner had contributed. Combs believed Kershner was an \"ill-advised\" director because he emphasized the characters, and the result was common tropes at the expense of the comic-strip pace of \"Star Wars\". Peter Suschitzky's cinematography was praised for its visuals and bold color choices, and the special effects were lauded as \"breathtaking\", \"ingenious\", and visually dazzling. Jim Harwood said he was let down only by the familiarity of the effects from the original, which were emulated by other films. Champlin appreciated that the effects were used to enhance scenes rather than being the focus.\nAccolades.\nAt the 1981 Academy Awards, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" won the award for Best Sound (Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, and Peter Sutton) and a Special Achievement Academy Award for Best Visual Effects (Brian Johnson, Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren, and Bruce Nicholson). The film received a further two nominations: Best Art Direction (Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley, Harry Lange, Alan Tomkins, and Michael Ford) and Best Original Score (John Williams). Williams also won two Grammy Awards: Best Instrumental Composition and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. He earned the film's sole Golden Globe Awards nomination, for Best Original Score.\nThe 34th British Academy Film Awards garnered \"Empire\" one award for Best Music (Williams), and two additional nominations: Best Sound (Sutton, Varney, and Ben Burtt) and Best Production Design (Reynolds). At the 8th\u00a0Saturn Awards, \"Empire\" received four awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director (Irvin Kershner), Best Actor (Mark Hamill), and Best Special Effects (Johnson and Edlund). The film also won a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and a People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture.\nPost-release.\nSpecial Edition and other changes.\nAs part of his plan to develop a prequel trilogy of films in the late 1990s, Lucas remastered and rereleased the original trilogy, including \"Empire\", under the title \"Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition\" to test special effects. This included altering scenes or adding new scenes, some of which tied into the prequel films. Lucas described it as bringing the trilogy closer to his original vision with modern technology. Among the alterations were full shots of the wampa and computer-generated locations with added buildings or people. These editions were well received by critics. Roger Ebert called \"Empire\" the best and \"heart\" of the original trilogy.\nSince their initial release, the Special Editions have been altered multiple times. For the 2004 rerelease, the Clive Revill/Elaine Baker Emperor was replaced by Ian McDiarmid, who had performed the role since \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983). Temuera Morrison, who portrayed Fett's clone predecessor in \"\" (2002), dubbed over Wingreen's lines. Minor changes were made for the 2011 Blu-ray release, including adding flames to the probe droid's impact crater and color modifications. The Special Edition releases were controversial with fans, who considered the changes to the original films unnecessary or too substantial. The unaltered versions have been commercially unavailable since a 2006 DVD release, which used unrestored footage from an early 1990s Laserdisc release. \"Harmy's Despecialized Edition\" is an unofficial fan effort to preserve the unaltered films. The 2010 documentary \"The People vs. George Lucas\" documents the relationship between the films, their fans, and Lucas.\nHome media.\n\"Empire\" was released on VHS, Laserdisc, and CED videodisc formats at Christmas 1984. The VHS cost $79.95 and became the top-selling tape at that price point at the time with sales of 375,000 units. The VHS and Laserdisc versions received various releases in the following years, often alongside the other original trilogy films in collections, with minor alterations such as widescreen formats or remastered sound. The 1992 Special Collector's Edition included the documentary \"From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga\". In 1997, the Special Edition of the original trilogy was released on VHS. When the film debuted on television in November 1987, it was preceded by a second-person introduction by Darth Vader, framed as an interruption of the Earth broadcast by the Galactic Empire.\nThe film was released on DVD in 2004, collected with \"Star Wars\" and \"Return of the Jedi\", with additional alterations to each film. The release included the documentary \"\", about the making of the original trilogy. Lucas said the modified versions were the way he had wanted them to be, and he had no interest in restoring the original theatrical cuts for release. Public demand eventually led to the release of the 2006 Limited Edition DVD collection that included the original unmodified films transferred from the 1993 Laserdisc Definitive Edition, creating problems with the image display.\n\"Empire\" was released on Blu-ray in 2011, as part of a collection containing the Special Edition original trilogy and a separate version containing the original and prequel trilogies alongside featurettes about the making of the films. In 2015, \"Empire\" and the other available films were released digitally on various platforms. A 4K resolution version\u2014restored from the 1997 Special Edition print\u2014was released in 2019 on Disney+. In 2020, a 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set was released, which contained all nine films in the series. It featured a Blu-ray version and a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of each film, as well as special features from the 2011 release.\nOther media.\nMerchandise for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" includes posters, children's books, clothing, character busts and statues, action figures, furnishings, and Lego sets. The novelization of the film, written by Donald F. Glut and released in April 1980, was a success, selling 2\u20133million copies. A \"Star Wars\" comic book series, launched in 1977 by Marvel Comics and written by Archie Goodwin and Carmine Infantino, adapted the original trilogy of films; \"Empire\"'s run began in 1980. The book \"The Making of the Empire Strikes Back\" (2010) by J. W. Rinzler provides a comprehensive history of the film's production, including behind-the-scenes photos and cast interviews.\nThe film was the first in the series to be adapted for video games, beginning with ' (1982) developed by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600 games console. This was followed in 1985 by the ' arcade game. \"Star Wars Trilogy Arcade\" (1998) features the Hoth battle as a level. ' was released in 1992 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy, and ' followed in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Scenes from \"Empire\" have also appeared in games like ' (1998) and ' (2007). \"The Empire Strikes Back\" pinball machine (1980) was the first officially licensed \"Star Wars\" pinball machine. It became a collector's item, as only 350 machines were produced exclusively in Australia.\nThematic analysis.\nMythology and inspirations.\nCritical analysis has suggested various inspirations for \"Empire\", particularly the early 1930s \"Flash Gordon\" serials that include a cloud city similar to Bespin. Film critic Tim Robey wrote that much of \"Empire\"'s imagery and narrative can be connected to the 1975 film \"Dersu Uzala\", directed by Akira Kurosawa\u2014whose work inspired Lucas. Muren described the Empire's assault on Hoth with AT-AT vehicles as an analogy for the Vietnam War, specifically an invading military employing equipment inappropriate for the local terrain.\nClarke identified Luke as the heir to mythological heroes, such as Prometheus, Jason, and Galahad. He is guided initially by a traditional aide, Obi-Wan, who offers the promise of destiny until he is replaced by Yoda. Anne Lancashire wrote that the Yoda narrative is a traditional mythological tale in which the hero is trained by a wise old master and must abandon all his preconceived notions. Clarke described Luke's journey as the hero who ventures into the unknown to be tested by his own dark impulses but eventually overcomes them. He believed this represented the human ability to control irrational impulsiveness to serve love, order, and justice.\nLucas wanted Yoda to be a traditional fairy-tale or mythological character, akin to a frog or an unassuming old man, to instill a message about respecting everyone and not judging on appearance alone, because he believed that would lead the hero to succeed. \"The New York Observer\"'s Brandon Katz described Yoda as deepening the Force through philosophy. Yoda says they are all luminous beings beyond just flesh and matter, and presents the Jedi as Zen warriors who work in harmony with the Force. Kasdan described them as enlightened warrior priests, similar to Samurai.\nReligion.\nIn developing the Force, Lucas said he wanted it to represent the core essence of multiple religions unified by their common traits. Primarily, he designed it with the intent that there is good, evil, and a god. Lucas's personal faith includes a belief in God and basic morality, such as treating others fairly and not taking another's life. \"The Presbyterian Journal\" described the film's religious message as closer to Eastern religions such as Zoroastrianism or Buddhism than Judeo-Christian, presenting good and evil as abstract concepts. Similarly, God or the Force is an impersonal entity, taking no direct action. \"Christianity Today\" said that the film's drama is caused by the absence of a righteous god or being creating a direct influence.\nLancashire and J. W. Rinzler described Luke's journey as based purely on Christianity, focused on destiny and free will, with Luke serving as a Christ-like figure and Vader as a fallen angel attempting to lure him toward evil. Kershner said any religious symbolism was unintentional, as he wanted to focus on the power of an individual's untapped potential instead of magic.\nDuality and evil.\nAnne Lancashire contrasted the first \"Star Wars\" film's message of idealism, heroics, and friendship with the more complex tone of \"Empire\". The latter challenges the former's notions, primarily because Luke loses his innocence in coming to perceive people as neither entirely good nor evil. The scene in which Luke enters the dark side cave on Dagobah represents where his anger will lead him and forces him to move beyond his belief that he is completely on the light side of the Force. Kershner said the cave tests Luke against his greatest fear, but because the fear is in his mind, and he brought his weapon with him, it creates a scenario where he is forced to use it. After defeating the avatar of Vader, the mask splits open to reveal Luke's face, suggesting he will succumb to the temptations of the dark side unless he learns patience and to abandon his anger.\nThe darkness is similarly presented in Han, a self-interested smuggler struggling with his growing feelings for Leia and the responsibility associated with her cause. The film represents his two sides in Leia and Lando, a representative of his smuggler life. \"Empire\" questions the cost of friendship. Where \"Star Wars\" presents traditional friendship, \"Empire\" presents friendship as requiring sacrifice. Han sacrifices himself in the frigid cold of Hoth to save Luke's life. Similarly, Luke abandons his Jedi training, something he has longed for, to rescue his friends. This can be seen as a selfish choice, as he does so against Yoda and Obi-Wan's instructions, potentially sacrificing himself for his friends instead of training to defeat the Empire, a cause his friends support. According to Lancashire, characters are shown to be heroic through sacrificing for others instead of fighting battles.\nLancashire believed that Luke's impatience to leave for Bespin exemplifies his lack of growth from his training. There, Vader tempts him with the power of the dark side and the revelation that he is Luke's father. Vader wants Luke's help to destroy the Emperor, not for good, but so that Vader can impose his own order over the galaxy. This admission robs Luke of the idealized image of his Jedi father, reveals Obi-Wan's deception in hiding his parentage, and takes the last of his innocence. Gerald Clarke suggests Luke is not strong or virtuous enough to resist Vader during this confrontation, and so allows himself to fall into the airshaft below, showing the antagonist does sometimes win. The concept of a character having a good father and an evil father is a common story trope because of its simple representations of good and evil. At the film's finale, Luke has a greater understanding of the relationship between good and evil, and the dual nature of people.\nLegacy.\nCritical reassessment.\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\" remains an enduringly popular piece of cinema. It is considered groundbreaking for its cliffhanger ending, influence on mainstream films, and special effects. Brian Lowry of CNN wrote that without the \"groundwork laid by one of the best sequels ever, [the \"Star Wars\" franchise] wouldn't be the force that it is now\".\nDespite the film's initial mixed reception, it has since been reevaluated by critics and fans and is now often considered the best film in the \"Star Wars\" series, and one of the greatest films ever made. In 2014, members of the entertainment industry ranked \"Empire\" as the 32nd-best film of all time in a poll conducted by \"The Hollywood Reporter\" (\"Star Wars\" was #11). \"Empire\" magazine named it the third-best film of all time, stating that the modern clich\u00e9 of sequels employing a darker tone can be traced back to \"Empire\". A 1997 retrospective review by Roger Ebert declared the film the best of the original trilogy, praising the depth of its storytelling and its ability to create a sense of wonder in the audience. A vote by 250,000 \"Business Insider\" readers in 2014 listed it as the greatest film ever made; it is also included in the 2013 film reference book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\". The revelation that Vader is Luke's father continues to be seen as one of the greatest plot twists in cinema. Similarly, Han saying \"I know\" in response to Leia's love confession is considered one of the most iconic scenes in the \"Star Wars\" films and one of the more famous lines of improvised dialogue in cinema.\n\"Empire\" magazine selected the film as the sixth greatest movie sequel, lauding the \"bold\" unresolved ending and willingness to avoid the same formula as the first film. \"Den of Geek\" called it the second-best sequel\u2014after \"Aliens\" (1986)\u2014and hailed it as Lucas's \"masterpiece\". \"Playboy\" named it the third-best sequel, describing the disclosure of the relationship between Luke and Vader as the \"emotional core that has elevated \"Star Wars\" to the pantheon of timeless modern sagas\". The BBC and \"Collider\" listed it as one of the best sequels ever made, while \"Time\" and \"Playboy\" described it as a sequel that surpasses the original. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes recognizes it as the 27th-best sequel, based on review scores. \"Rolling Stone\"'s 2014 reader-voted list of the best sequels listed \"Empire\" at third.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Dark, sinister, but ultimately even more involving than \"A New Hope\", \"The Empire Strikes Back\" defies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels.\" \"Empire\" has a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic based on the reviews of 25 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Characters introduced in the film, such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian, are now considered iconic. The American Film Institute ranked Darth Vader as the third best villain on its 2003 list of the 100 Best Heroes &amp; Villains, after Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter.\nCultural influence.\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\" was ubiquitous in American culture upon its release. Freddie Mercury ended a 1980 Queen concert by riding on the shoulders of someone dressed as Darth Vader. The film was referenced in political cartoons. Kershner received letters from fans around the world asking for autographs, and from psychologists who had used Yoda to explain philosophical ideas to their patients. Other films, television shows, and video games have extensively referenced or parodied the film, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", \"Spaceballs\", \"Toy Story 2\", \"Logorama\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Stargate Universe\", \"The Muppet Show\", \"The Fairly OddParents\", \"Futurama\", \"American Dad!\", \"South Park\", \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\", \"The Venture Bros.\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Robot Chicken\", \"Family Guy\" and its subsequent . In 2010, the United States Library of Congress selected \"The Empire Strikes Back\" for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2025, a Darth Vader lightsaber prop used in the film, specifically during Vader's confrontation with Luke, sold for over $3.6million.\nLandon Palmer, Eric Diaz, and Darren Mooney argue that \"Empire\", and not \"Star Wars\", created the concept of the modern blockbuster film franchise, which includes sequels serving as chapters in an infinitely expanding narrative\u2014a template which was embraced by other film properties in the decades following \"Empire\"'s release. This new paradigm stood in opposition to the popular trend of exploiting a successful film by creating low-budget sequels (which resulted in diminishing returns, as happened with the \"Jaws\" franchise). Instead, more money was spent on \"Empire\" to expand the fictional universe and reap greater box-office returns. The use of a cliffhanger ending to set up a future sequel is seen in many modern films, particularly those in the MCU. It has also been suggested that \"Empire\" forged a narrative structure that continues to be emulated in trilogies, wherein the middle film is darker than the original and features an ending in which the protagonists fail to defeat the antagonists (which sets up a subsequent film). Emmet Asher-Perrin and Ben Sherlock cite the series \"Back to the Future\", \"The Matrix\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", and \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" as examples.\nFilmmakers such as the Russo brothers, Roland Emmerich, and Kevin Feige, and actors such as Neil Patrick Harris, Jim Carrey, and Jude Law, cite \"Empire\" as an inspiration in their careers or identify as fans.\nSequels, prequels, and adaptations.\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\" was adapted into a 1982 radio play broadcast on National Public Radio in the United States. \"Return of the Jedi\" was released in 1983, concluding the original film trilogy. \"Jedi\"'s plot follows the Rebel assault on the Empire and Luke's final confrontation with Vader and the Emperor. Like the previous films, \"Jedi\" was a financial success and fared well with critics.\nNearly two decades after the release of \"Empire\", Lucas wrote and directed the prequel trilogy, consisting of ' (1999), ' (2002), and ' (2005). The films chronicle the history between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter's fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader. The storylines and certain new characters in the prequel films polarized critics and fans. After Lucas sold the \"Star Wars\" franchise to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney developed a sequel trilogy, consisting of ' (2015), ' (2017), and ' (2019). Original trilogy cast members\u2014including Ford, Hamill, and Fisher\u2014reprised their roles, and were joined by new characters portrayed by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Oscar Isaac. Standalone films and television series have also been released, with narratives relating to the story arcs of the original trilogy.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nBooks\nJournals\nMagazines\nNewspapers"}

He was a key member of the Algonquin Round Table, and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1930.\nBiography.\nMarcus Cook Connelly was born to actor and hotelier Patrick Joseph Connelly and actress Mabel Fowler Cook in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. His father died in 1902. Connelly attended Trinity Hall boarding school in Washington, Pennsylvania, after which he began collecting money for ads in \"The Pittsburgh Press\" to help to support his mother.\nHis initial newspaper job led to Connelly's working as an Associated Press cub reporter, after which he became a junior reporter for \"The Pittsburgh Gazette Times\". Eventually he began writing a humor column for that newspaper. In 1919 he joined the Algonquin Round Table.\nWhile he was working in Pittsburgh, Connelly ventured into writing for the stage, creating skits for shows put on by an athletic association and one-act plays for a little theater group. His interest in the theater increased after he began reporting on the theater beat for \"The Morning Telegraph\" in New York City. In that role he developed a friendship with George S. Kaufman, who wrote about drama for \"The New York Times\".\nConnelly had contributed to several Broadway musicals before teaming up with his most important collaborator, Kaufman, in 1921. During their four-year partnership, they wrote five comedies \u2013 \"Dulcy\" (1921), \"To the Ladies\" (1922), \"Merton of the Movies\" (1922), \"The Deep Tangled Wildwood\" (1923) and \"Beggar on Horseback\" (1924) \u2013 and also co-directed and contributed sketches to the 1922 revue \"The '49ers\", collaborated on the book to the musical comedy \"Helen of Troy, New York\" (1923), and wrote both the book and lyrics for another musical comedy, \"Be Yourself\" (1924).\nConnelly received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for \"The Green Pastures\" in 1930.

He contributed verse and articles to \"Life\", \"Everybody's\", and other magazines.\nConnelly was a drama teacher at Yale University from 1946 to 1950. In 1968, Connelly published his memoirs, \"Voices Offstage\". Over the years, Connelly appeared as an actor in 21 movies, including \"The Spirit of St. Louis\" (1957) with James Stewart.\nConnelly's television debut as an actor came in 1953 in an episode of \"Broadway TV Theatre\" on WOR-TV. A review in the trade publication \"Variety\" said that Connelly \"handled himself with winning aplomb\".\nA film about the Round Table members, \"The Ten-Year Lunch\" (1987), won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and featured Connelly, who was the last survivor.

Harbach collaborated as lyricist or librettist with many of the leading Broadway composers of the early 20th century, including Jerome Kern, Louis Hirsch, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans, George Gershwin, and Sigmund Romberg. \nHarbach believed that music, lyrics, and story should be closely connected and, as Oscar Hammerstein II's mentor, he encouraged Hammerstein to write musicals in this manner. Harbach is considered one of the first great Broadway lyricists, and he helped raise the status of the lyricist in an age more concerned with music, spectacle, and stars. Some of his more famous lyrics are \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", \"Indian Love Call\" and \"Cuddle up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine\".\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nOtto Abels Hauerbach was born on August 18, 1873, in Salt Lake City, Utah to Danish immigrant parents. His family's original surname was Christiansen, but shortly after settling in the United States near Salt Lake City in the 1830s, they took Hauerbach, the name of the farm on which they worked, as their new surname.\nHe attended the Salt Lake Collegiate Institute, transferring to Knox College, in Galesburg, Illinois. There he became a friend of poet Carl Sandburg, joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and graduated in 1895. Knox has since named its 599-seat Harbach Theatre in his honor. \nHauerbach started his career teaching English and public speaking at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. He intended to become an English professor and started graduate work at Columbia University in New York. \nIn the early 1900s, complaining of eye difficulties that made prolonged reading uncomfortable, he became a newspaper reporter. He also worked at various advertising agencies, at an insurance firm, as a copywriter in advertising, and later as a journalist. He had to withdraw from Columbia when he could not financially support himself.\nEarly career (1902\u20131911).\nIn 1902, he spotted an advertisement for a new Joe Weber and Lew Fields musical with a picture of star Fay Templeton. He had not been interested in theatre but more in literary classics. After seeing the show, he realized he liked the lighthearted genre.\nThat same year, he met composer Karl Hoschna. They wrote a comic opera together, \"The Daughter of the Desert\", but no producer was interested in producing the work. \nHarbach and Hoschna continued to collaborate, writing songs to be added into other Broadway shows. They received their first chance to have a complete show produced on Broadway when Isidore Witmark asked Hoschna, his employee, to serve as composer for a musical version of Mary McIntire Pacheco's play \"Incog\". Hoschna asked Harbach to write the lyrics. With Witmark and Charles Dickson writing the libretto, the resulting show was \"Three Twins\", which opened in 1908 and ran for 288 performances (Harbach was paid a hundred dollars for his work). The show starred Clifton Crawford. One of Hoschna and Harbach's songs for \"Three Twins\", \"Cuddle Up A Little Closer, Lovey Mine,\" became a popular hit.\nTheir next collaboration was \"Madame Sherry\" in 1910, an adaptation of a 1902 German operetta, which featured Jack Gardner in the lead role. Their score included the standard \"Every Little Movement (Has a Meaning All Its Own)\". Harbach and Hoschna's score was augmented with interpolations, including the popular hit \"Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey\" by Albert von Tilzer and Junie McCree. They would collaborate for four more shows until Hoschna died in 1911, aged 35.\nCareer (1912\u20131936).\nHarbach's work with Hoschna had established his reputation as a competent Broadway lyricist and librettist. Producer Arthur Hammerstein asked Harbach in 1912 to serve as librettist for a new operetta called \"The Firefly\", to be composed by Rudolf Friml. Harbach set his libretto in contemporary Manhattan and Bermuda, which differed from the typical European setting for operettas. The result was a huge success, with hits such as \"Sympathy\", \"Giannina Mia\", and \"Love is Like a Firefly\".\nThe success of \"The Firefly\" led to ten more musical collaborations for librettist Harbach, composer Friml, and producer Arthur Hammerstein, including \"High Jinks\" (1913) and \"Katinka\" (1915). Most of the shows Harbach and Friml wrote ran for more than 200 performances each, which was a successful run for the time period.\nHarbach also worked on projects with other collaborators during this time. In 1914, he contributed the libretto only to the Percy Wenrich musical \"The Crinoline Girl\". He collaborated with composer Louis Hirsch and scored his biggest success thus far in his career in 1917 with \"Going Up\". This was his first attempt at a musical comedy, as opposed to an American operetta. The show was based on the 1910 comedy \"The Aviator\" by James Montgomery, who co-wrote the libretto with Harbach. The show ran for 351 performances, toured nationally, and was an even larger hit in London. \nAlso in 1917, he shortened his name from Hauerbach to Harbach, to avoid the anti-German sentiment caused by World War I. Harbach and Hirsch collaborated on another notable Broadway production in 1920, \"Mary\".\nAlso around 1920, producer Arthur Hammerstein introduced his nephew Oscar Hammerstein II to Harbach. Oscar was an aspiring lyricist and book writer, and Harbach became his mentor. Harbach encouraged Oscar to treat writing for the musical theatre as a \"serious art form.\" Together, they wrote book and lyrics for \"Tickle Me\" (1920), \"Jimmie\" (1920), \"Wildflower\" (1923), \"Rose-Marie\" (1924), \"Sunny\" (1925), \"Song of the Flame\" (1925), \"The Wild Rose\" (1926), \"The Desert Song\" (1926), \"Golden Dawn\" (1927), and \"Good Boy\" (1928).\nHarbach and Hammerstein's operetta collaboration, \"Wildflower\" (1923), was Harbach's first work with composer Vincent Youmans. Harbach collaborated again with Youmans, as well as with co-lyricist Irving Caesar and co-librettist Frank Mandel on the 1925 hit musical comedy \"No, No, Nanette\".\nHarbach first collaborated with Broadway composer Jerome Kern on \"Sunny\" (1925). They continued to work together on subsequent musicals, including \"Criss Cross\" (1926), \"The Cat and the Fiddle (1931)\", and \"Roberta\" (1933).\nBroadway historian Thomas S. Hischak states that Harbach's lyrics for Kern were the finest of his career. \"The Cat and the Fiddle\" was especially notable, as Harbach (writing both book and lyrics) and Kern wanted to create a modern operetta set in contemporary Brussels \"in which music and story were indispensable to each other.\" Hits from \"The Cat and the Fiddle\" included \"Try to Forget,\" \"She Didn't Say Yes\", \"The Breeze Kissed Your Hair\", and \"The Night Was Made for Love\". \"Roberta\" included the hits \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", \"Yesterdays\", \"You're Devastating\", and \"The Touch of Your Hand\".\nBy the mid-1930s, Harbach's operetta-influenced style was no longer current on Broadway. His final major production was a collaboration with operetta composer Sigmund Romberg, \"Forbidden Melody\" (1936).\nIn addition to his musical collaborations, Harbach also wrote non-musical farce plays for the Broadway stage. These included \"Up in Mabel's Room\" (1919), for which he collaborated with new playwright Wilson Collison from Ohio.\nImpact and legacy.\nHarbach was one of the most prolific Broadway lyricist/librettists of the early 20th century. He collaborated as lyricist or librettist with many of the leading Broadway writers and composers of that era, including Oscar Hammerstein II, Jerome Kern, Louis Hirsch, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans, George Gershwin, and Sigmund Romberg. He became a charter member of ASCAP in 1914, and he served as a director (1920\u20131963), vice president (1936\u20131940), and president (1950\u20131953).\nHarbach was also an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nHarbach died at his home in New York City on January 24, 1963, aged 89.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1918, Harbach married Eloise Smith Dougall of Salt Lake City, Utah. The Harbachs had two sons, William O. Harbach (a television producer) and Robert Harbach (a writer).\nNotable songs.\nHe was lyricist for many songs including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige. The cheese has a distinctive flavour, well developed but not too strong, creamy with a slight piquancy, and leaves an aftertaste that is characteristic of sheep's milk.\nThe designation is protected under Spain's denominaci\u00f3n de origen regulatory classification system, and the cheese has been granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Union.\nPDO requirements.\nA must satisfy these requirements:\nManchego cheese can be made from pasteurised or raw milk; if the latter, it may be labelled (artisan).

Traditionally, manchego cheese was made by pressing the curd in plaited esparto grass baskets, which left a distinctive zig-zag pattern (known as ) on the rind. Today, the same effect is achieved by the mould, the inside of which has a design in relief that imparts to the finished cheese an embossed pattern similar to that of woven esparto grass. The top and bottom surfaces of the cheese are impressed with a design of a head of wheat.\nDuring the maturation process, manchego cheese develops a natural rind. The regulations permit this to be washed, coated in paraffin, dipped in olive oil, or treated with certain approved transparent substances, but require that it must not be removed if the cheese is to be marketed as PDO.\nCheeses that meet the PDO requirements carry a casein tab that is applied when the cheese is in the mould and bear a distinctive label that is issued by the Manchego Cheese Denomination of Origin Regulating Council; this carries the legend , a serial number, and artwork depicting Don Quixote de La Mancha.\nA cheese that is similar to manchego and made in the same region, but from a blend of cows\u2019, goats\u2019, and ewes\u2019 milk, is sold as , or cheese.\nAlmost 60% of Spanish cheese with Denomination of Origin is Manchego, which makes it the main reference of Spanish cheese.

Some of his more famous lyrics include \"Blue Moon\"; \"The Lady Is a Tramp\"; \"Manhattan\"; \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\"; and \"My Funny Valentine\".\nLife and career.\nHart was born in Harlem, New York City, the elder of two sons, to Jewish immigrant parents, Max M. and Frieda (Isenberg) Hart, of German background. Through his mother, he was a great-grandnephew of the German poet Heinrich Heine. His father, a business promoter, sent Hart and his brother to private schools. (His brother, Teddy Hart, also went into theatre and became a musical comedy star. Teddy Hart's wife, Dorothy Hart, wrote a biography of Lorenz Hart.)\nHart received his early education from Columbia Grammar School and entered Columbia College in 1913 and graduated in 1918. From 1914 to 1916, he also spent two years at Columbia University School of Journalism. In 1919 a friend introduced him to Richard Rodgers, and the two joined forces to write songs for a series of amateur and student productions.\nBy 1918, Hart was working for the Shubert brothers, partners in theatre, translating German play songs into English. In 1919, his and Rodgers' song \"Any Old Place With You\" was included in the Broadway musical comedy \"A Lonely Romeo\". In 1920, six of their songs were used in the musical comedy \"Poor Little Ritz Girl\", which also had music by Sigmund Romberg. They were hired to write the score for the 1925 Theatre Guild production \"The Garrick Gaieties\", the success of which brought them acclaim.\nRodgers and Hart subsequently wrote the music and lyrics for 26 Broadway musicals during a partnership of more than 20 years that ended shortly before Hart's early death. Their \"big four\" were \"Babes in Arms,\" \"The Boys From Syracuse\", \"Pal Joey\", and \"On Your Toes.\" The Rodgers and Hart songs have been described as intimate and destined for long lives outside the theater. Many of their songs are standard repertoire for singers and jazz instrumentalists. Hart has been called \"the expressive bard of the urban generation which matured during the interwar years\". But the \"encomiums suggest[ing] that Larry Hart was a poet\" caused his friend and fellow writer Henry Myers to state otherwise. \"Larry in particular was primarily a showman. If you can manage to examine his songs technically, and for the moment elude their spell, you will see that they are all meant to be acted, that they are part of a play. Larry was a playwright.\"\nRodgers and Hart wrote music and lyrics for several films, including \"Love Me Tonight\" (1932), \"The Phantom President\" (1932), \"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum\" (1933), and \"Mississippi\" (1935). With their successes, during the Great Depression Hart was earning $60,000 annually, and he became a magnet for many people. He gave numerous large parties. Beginning in 1938, he traveled more often and suffered from his ongoing drinking. Nevertheless, Rodgers and Hart continued working together through mid-1942, with their final new musical being 1942's \"By Jupiter\".\n\"The New York Times\" reported on July 23, 1942: \"The Theatre Guild announced yesterday that Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II will soon begin work on a musical version of Lynn Riggs's folk-play, \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", which the Guild produced for sixty-four performances at the Guild Theatre in 1931.\" Rodgers had brought Hammerstein onto the project due to Hart's worsening mental state; Hart would admit he had difficulty writing a musical for such a rural setting as Oklahoma and departed, leaving an eager Hammerstein (whose own songwriting partner Jerome Kern had no interest in the project) to complete what would eventually become \"Oklahoma!.\" Rodgers and Hammerstein would continue collaborating for 16 years (ending in Hammerstein's death in 1960), a partnership that made the duo one of the most successful composing teams of the 20th century.\nHart, meanwhile, was much affected by his mother's death in late April 1943. Regrouping somewhat, Rodgers and Hart teamed a final time in the fall of 1943 for a revival of \"A Connecticut Yankee\". Six new numbers, including \"To Keep My Love Alive\", were written for this reworked version of the play; it would prove to be Hart's last lyric. Hart had taken off the night of the mid-November opening and was gone for two days. He was found in a hotel room ill from drink and was taken to Doctors Hospital, Upper East Side, but died within a few days.\nLyrical style.\nAccording to Thomas Hischak, Hart \"had a remarkable talent for polysyllabic and internal rhymes\", and his lyrics have often been praised for their wit and technical sophistication.\nAccording to \"The New York Times\" music critic Stephen Holden, \"Many of Hart's ballad lyrics conveyed a heart-stopping sadness that reflected his conviction that he was physically too unattractive to be lovable.\" Holden also noted that \"In his lyrics, as in his life, Hart stands as a compellingly lonely figure. Although he wrote dozens of songs that are playful, funny and filled with clever wordplay, it is the rueful vulnerability beneath their surface that lends them a singular poignancy.\"\nPersonal life and death.\nHart lived with his widowed mother Frieda. He was an alcoholic, and would sometimes disappear for weeks at a time on drinking binges.\nHart experienced depression and sadness throughout his life. His erratic behavior was often the cause of friction between him and Rodgers and led to Rodgers teaming with lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II in 1942. On March 31, 1943, Hart attended the Broadway premiere of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\". Then Hart attended the opening night party where he told Rodgers, \"This is one of the greatest shows I've ever seen, and it'll be playing twenty years from now!\"\nIn April 1943, Hart was devastated by the loss of his mother and did not recover emotionally.\nMany of Hart's contemporaries who knew him socially have stated he was a discreet homosexual, with a reputation as a voyeur, though his friends did not go into detail about people whose behavior he watched, such as their genders.\nRobert Gottlieb wrote in the April 2013 edition of \"The Atlantic\" magazine, There were rumors about Larry [Lorenz Hart] while he was alive, but nothing about his sexuality ever appeared in print. One night in Los Angeles, in 1933, someone from a Hollywood trade magazine approached Dick [Richard Rodgers] at a party and said, \"I've got to ask you something about Larry ... Is it true Larry's a fairy?\" Dick grabbed him by the collar, [biographer Gary] Marmorstein recounts, and said, \"I never heard that. And if you print it, I'll kill you.\"\nThough Richard Rodgers became celebrated for his music for \"Oklahoma!\" in 1943, later that year he decided that he and Hart should reunite and create a revival of \"A Connecticut Yankee\", their successful musical from 1927. Hart composed new lyrics for many of the songs in anticipation of the revival's November 17, 1943, premiere at the Martin Beck Theatre.\nOn the November 17 opening night, Hart showed up drunk in the audience at the Martin Beck Theatre. His condition was noticed by his sister-in-law. She persuaded him to accompany her to her Manhattan home. Sometime after they arrived at the couple's home, Hart left, venturing into cold weather to resume drinking. A friend of Hart's found him seated in the gutter of a bar that he favored on Manhattan's Eighth Avenue. Hart was shivering, and his friend accompanied him to a hospital, where it was determined that Hart had developed pneumonia from exposure. On November 22, 1943, approximately four days after admission to the hospital, Hart died.\nLorenz Hart is buried in Mount Zion Cemetery in Queens County, New York.\nIn popular culture.\nThe circumstances of Lorenz Hart's life were heavily altered and romanticized in the 1948 MGM biopic \"Words and Music\", with fictitious personal details such as changing his sexual orientation and attributing his erratic behavior and depression to an obsession with a woman (played in the film by Betty Garrett) who turns down his marriage proposal.\nIn 2025, the film \"Blue Moon\" was released. It is set during Hart's last days, mostly around Sardi\u2019s Restaurant on March 31, 1943, on the opening night of \"Oklahoma!\".\" Written by Robert Kaplow, the film is directed by Richard Linklater and stars Ethan Hawke as Hart, alongside Margaret Qualley, Bobby Cannavale, and Andrew Scott as Rodgers. The film had its world premiere at the main competition of the 75th Berlin International Film Festival, on 18 February 2025, where it won the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance for Scott. \"Blue Moon\" would receive a widespread release on October 24, 2025.\nNotable songs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She wrote the novel \"Freaky Friday\", which served as the basis of a 1976 film starring Jodie Foster, for which she wrote the screenplay, as well as three other versions. Her best-known musicals were \"Once Upon a Mattress\" and \"The Mad Show\", and she contributed songs to Marlo Thomas' successful children's album \"Free to Be... You and Me\".\nEarly life.\nRodgers was born in New York City. She was a daughter of composer Richard Rodgers and his wife, Dorothy Belle (n\u00e9e Feiner). She had a sister, Mrs. Linda Emory. She attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, and majored in music at Wellesley College.\nShe began writing music at the age of 16 and her professional career began with writing songs for Little Golden Records, which were albums for children with three-minute songs. One of these recordings, \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves\", which was released in 1957, featured performances by Bing Crosby of songs Mary Rodgers wrote with lyricist Sammy Cahn. She also composed music for television, including the jingle for the Prince Spaghetti commercial.\nCareer.\nHer first full-length musical, \"Once Upon a Mattress\", which was also her first collaboration with lyricist Marshall Barer (with whom she continued to write songs for nearly a decade), opened Off Broadway in May 1959 and moved to Broadway later in the year. Following the show's initial run of 244 performances, there were a US tour (in 1960), a production in London's West End (also 1960), three televised productions (in 1964, 1972, and 2005), and a Broadway revival (1996). Cast albums were released for the original Broadway production, the original London production, and the Broadway revival. To this day, the show is frequently performed by community and school groups across the United States.\nAnother significant compositional project for her was \"The Mad Show,\" a musical revue based on \"Mad\" magazine which opened Off Broadway in January 1966 and ran for a total of 871 performances. An original cast album, produced by Goddard Lieberson, was released on Columbia Masterworks. Although the show also began as a collaboration with Marshall Barer, he quit before the project was completed and the show's remaining songs feature lyrics by Larry Siegel (co-author of the show's book), Steven Vinaver, and Stephen Sondheim, who contributed the lyrics to a parody of \"The Girl from Ipanema\" called \"The Boy From...\" under the pseudonym Esteban Ria Nido.\nNone of her other shows had the same level of success, but she also wrote music for musicals and revues, the first on Broadway being \"Davy Jones' Locker\" with Bil Baird's marionettes, which had a two-week run at the Morosco Theatre from March 28 to April 11, 1959. (She also wrote the lyrics.) Others included \"From A to Z\" (1960), \"Hot Spot\" (1963), \"Working\" (1978), and Phyllis Newman's one-woman show \"The Madwoman of Central Park West\" (1979). A revue of Rodgers's music titled \"Hey, Love\", conceived and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. ran in June 1993 at Eighty-Eight's in New York City.\nShe later wrote children's books, most notably the popular \"Freaky Friday\" (1972), which was made into a feature film (released 1976), for which she wrote the screenplay, and was remade for television in 1995, and again for cinemas in 2003, screenplay by Heather Hach and Leslie Dixon \"based on the book by Mary Rodgers\". \nOne of the inspirations for \"Freaky Friday\" was a novel by Thorne Smith called \"Turnabout\". As she was considering a new children\u2019s book, following several picture books for young children, she remembered \"that when I was fourteen, I\u2019d read and loved a novel called \"Turnabout\", by Thorne Smith. Vicious and hilarious, it was something I thought I could emulate in children\u2019s fiction ... for teens.\"\nRodgers' other children's books include \"The Rotten Book\" (1969), \"A Billion for Boris\" (1974, later republished under the title \"ESP TV\"), and \"Summer Switch\" (1982), and she contributed songs to the landmark children's album \"Free to Be... You and Me\". She made a few brief forays back into writing for musical theater, including an adaptation of her book \"Freaky Friday\" (featuring music and lyrics by John Forster), which was presented by Theatreworks/USA in 1991, and \"The Griffin and the Minor Canon\", which was produced by Music Theatre Group, but after the latter show she never composed another note of music and never even played the piano again. She later explained, \"I had a pleasant talent but not an incredible talent ... I was not my father or my son. And you have to abandon all kinds of things.\"\nIn 2022, 8 years after she died, Rodgers' memoirs were published in \"Shy: The Alarmingly Outspoken Memoirs of Mary Rodgers\", co-authored by Jesse Green. \nPersonal life.\nHer first husband, whom she married in December 1951, was lawyer Julian B. Beaty, Jr.; they had three children. This marriage ended in 1957. She and her second husband, film executive Henry Guettel, had three sons, including Adam, a Tony Award-winning musical theater composer. Henry died in October 2013 at the age of 85.\nMary Rodgers was a director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization and a board member of ASCAP. She also served for several years as chairman of the Juilliard School.\nShe died from heart failure at her home in Manhattan on June 26, 2014.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53974", "revid": "69412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53974", "title": "Legend", "text": "Genre of storytelling that involves heroic humans\nA legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital.\nMany legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that they concern human beings as the main characters and do not necessarily have supernatural origins, and sometimes in that they have some sort of historical basis whereas myths generally do not. The Brothers Grimm defined \"legend\" as \"folktale historically grounded\". A by-product of the \"concern with human beings\" is the long list of legendary creatures, leaving no \"resolute doubt\" that legends are \"historically grounded.\"\nA modern folklorist's professional definition of \"legend\" was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:\nLegend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs.\nEtymology and origin.\n\"Legend\" is a loanword from Old French that entered English usage c.\u20091340. The Old French noun \"legende\" derives from the Medieval Latin \"legenda\". In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word \"legendary\" was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends. This word changed to \"legendry\", and \"legendary\" became the adjectival form.\nBy 1613, English-speaking Protestants began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any saint not acknowledged in John Foxe's \"Actes and Monuments\") was fictitious. Thus, \"legend\" gained its modern connotations of \"undocumented\" and \"spurious\", which distinguish it from the meaning of \"chronicle\".\nIn 1866, Jacob Grimm described the fairy tale as \"poetic, legend historic.\" Early scholars such as Karl Wehrhan Friedrich Ranke and Will Erich Peuckert followed Grimm's example in focussing solely on the literary narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s, by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends' social context. Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the Aarne\u2013Thompson folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis.\nIn an early attempt at defining some basic questions operative in examining folk tales, Friedrich Ranke in 1925 characterised the folk legend as \"a popular narrative with an objectively untrue imaginary content\", a dismissive position that was subsequently largely abandoned.\nCompared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively amorphous, Helmut de Boor noted in 1928. The narrative content of legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry irony of folktale; Wilhelm Heiske remarked on the similarity of motifs in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic mode, legend is not more historical than folktale.\nIn \"Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft\" (1928), Ernst Bernheim asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding rumour. Gordon Allport credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise; thus \"Urban legends\" are a feature of rumour. When Willian Hugh Jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly were \"short-term legends\" and the persistent ones be termed \"long-term legends\", the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini concluded.\nChristian \"legenda\".\nIn a narrow Christian sense, \"legenda\" (\"things to be read [on a certain day, in church]\") were hagiographical accounts, often collected in a legendary. Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, \"legend\", in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context, but that contains supernatural, divine or fantastic elements.\nOral tradition.\nHistory preserved orally through many generations often takes on a more narrative-based or mythological form over time, an example being the oral traditions of the African Great Lakes. \nUrban legend.\nUrban legends are a modern genre of folklore that is rooted in local popular culture, usually comprising fictional stories that are often presented as true, with macabre or humorous elements. These legends can be used for entertainment purposes, as well as semi-serious explanations for seemingly-mysterious events, such as disappearances and strange objects.\nThe term \"urban legend,\" as generally used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at least 1968. Jan Harold Brunvand, professor of English at the University of Utah, introduced the term to the general public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, \"The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends &amp; Their Meanings\" (1981) to make two points: first, that legends and folklore do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.\nRelated concepts.\nHippolyte Delehaye distinguished legend from myth: \"The \"legend\", on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot.\"\nFrom the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", Washington Irving transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with \"Gothic\" overtones, which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend.\nStories that exceed the boundaries of \"realism\" are called \"fables\". For example, the talking animal formula of Aesop identifies his brief stories as fables and not legends. The parable of the Prodigal Son would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a donkey that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.\nLegend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the original sense, through written text. Jacobus de Voragine's \"Legenda Aurea\" or \"The Golden Legend\" comprises a series of \"vitae\" or instructive biographical narratives, tied to the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of hagiography. The \"Legenda\" was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the saint of the day.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He collaborated with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner on a series of Broadway musicals, including \"Brigadoon\", \"Paint Your Wagon\", \"My Fair Lady\", and \"Camelot\", all of which were made into films, as well as the original film musical \"Gigi\" (1958), which was first transferred to the stage in 1973.\nBiography.\nLoewe was born in Charlottenburg, Berlin, Germany, to Viennese parents Edmund and Rosa Loewe. His father was a Jewish operetta star who performed throughout Europe and in North and South America; he starred as Count Danilo in the 1906 Berlin production of \"The Merry Widow\".\nLoewe grew up in Berlin and attended a Prussian cadet school from the age of five until he was thirteen. At an early age Loewe learned to play piano by ear and helped his father rehearse, and he began composing songs at age seven. He eventually attended the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, one year behind Claudio Arrau, and studied with Ferruccio Busoni and Eugene d'Albert. He won the coveted Hollander Medal awarded by the school and gave performances as a concert pianist while still in Germany. At 13, he was the youngest piano soloist ever to appear with the Berlin Philharmonic.\nIn 1924, his father received an offer to appear in New York City, and Loewe traveled there with him, determined to write for Broadway. This proved to be difficult. He eventually found work playing piano in German clubs in Yorkville and in movie theaters as the accompanist for silent films. In 1931, he married Ernestine Zerline. Childless, they divorced in 1957.\nLoewe began to visit the Lambs Club, a hangout for theater performers, producers, managers and directors. He credited The Lambs for keeping him working until his career expanded, and left a share of his royalties of \"Brigadoon\" to The Lambs Foundation. He met Alan Jay Lerner there in 1942. Their first collaboration was a musical adaptation of Barry Connor's farce \"The Patsy\", called \"Life of the Party\", for a Detroit stock company. It enjoyed a nine-week run and encouraged the duo to join forces with Arthur Pierson for \"What's Up?\", which opened on Broadway in 1943. It ran for 63 performances and was followed by \"The Day Before Spring\", which ran on Broadway from November 1945 to April 1946.\nTheir first hit was \"Brigadoon\", a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village, directed by Robert Lewis with choreography by Agnes de Mille. The musical ran on Broadway from March 1947 to July 1948 and won the 1947 New York Drama Critics' Circle award as Best Musical. It spawned the songs \"Almost Like Being in Love\" and \"The Heather on the Hill\", both of which became standards. It was followed in 1951 by the less successful Gold Rush story \"Paint Your Wagon\", which despite its lukewarm critical reception included several songs which went on to become popular, including \"Wand'rin' Star\" and \"They Call the Wind Maria\".\nIn 1956, Lerner and Loewe's \"My Fair Lady\" was produced on Broadway. Their adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion\", with the leads, Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, being played originally by Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, was a huge hit on Broadway and in London. The musical won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer took notice and commissioned them to write the film musical \"Gigi\" (1958), which won nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\nTheir next Broadway musical was \"Camelot\" in 1960. The production starred Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet. According to \"Playbill\", \"The show achieved an unprecedented advance sale of three and a half million dollars, propelled in part by a preview on the Ed Sullivan Show that featured its stars, Richard Burton and Julie Andrews.\" \"Camelot\" ran for 873 performances.\nLoewe then decided to retire to Palm Springs, California, where he bought a home in 1960. For many years he did not write anything until he was approached by Lerner to augment the \"Gigi\" film score with additional tunes for a 1973 stage adaptation, which won him his second Tony, this time for Best Original Score.\nIn 1974, they collaborated on a musical film version of \"The Little Prince\", based on the classic children's tale by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n This film was a critical failure, but the soundtrack recording and the film itself are in print on CD and DVD. Loewe and Lerner were nominated for the 1974 Academy Award for Best Song and Best Adapted or Original Song Score (with Angela Morley and Douglas Gamley).\nLoewe was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972. Seven years later, in 1979, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.\nLoewe remained in Palm Springs until his death at 86. The cause of death was cardiac arrest, according to John F. Morris, an artist and longtime friend. He had a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedicated to him in 1995. He was buried in the Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had a younger brother, Bernard. He grew up in relative poverty in the Bronx with his English-born Jewish immigrant parents.\nIn his youth, he had a formative relationship with his Aunt Kate, who piqued his interest in the theater, often taking him to see performances. Hart even went so far as to create an \"alternate ending\" to her life in his book \"Act One\". He learned that the theater made possible \"the art of being somebody else \u2026 not a scrawny boy with bad teeth, a funny name \u2026 and a mother who was a distant drudge.\"\nHart's first glimpse of Broadway came in 1918 when he was 14 years old. He later recounted exiting the subway at Times Square and standing agog at the urban tableau before him: \"A swirling mob of shouting happy people... confetti and paper streamers... soldiers and sailors climbed happily onto the tops of taxis, grabbing girls up to dance with them. My first thought was 'Of course, that's just the way I thought it would be.'\" Unbeknownst to Hart, his arrival had coincided with the signing of the armistice that ended World War One.\nCareer.\nAfter working several years as a director of amateur theatrical groups and an entertainment director at summer resorts, he scored his first Broadway hit with \"Once in a Lifetime\" (1930), a farce about the arrival of the sound era in Hollywood. The play was written in collaboration with Broadway veteran George S. Kaufman, who regularly wrote with others, notably Marc Connelly and Edna Ferber. (Kaufman also performed in the play's original Broadway cast in the role of a frustrated playwright hired by Hollywood) and produced by Sam Harris. Hart's agent at this time was Frieda Fishbein, who brought a lawsuit against Hart, contending she was entitled to a percentage of the royalties from plays produced by Harris. The matter was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.\nDuring the next decade, Kaufman and Hart teamed on a string of successes, including \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1936) and \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" (1939). Though Kaufman had hits with others, Hart is generally conceded to be his most important collaborator.\n\"You Can't Take It With You\", the story of an eccentric family and how they live during the Depression, won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for drama. It is Hart's most-revived play. When director Frank Capra and writer Robert Riskin adapted it for the screen in 1938, the film won the Best Picture Oscar and Capra won for Best Director.\n\"The Man Who Came To Dinner\" is about the caustic Sheridan Whiteside who, after injuring himself slipping on ice, must stay in a Midwestern family's house. The character was based on Kaufman and Hart's friend, critic Alexander Woollcott. Other characters in the play are based on No\u00ebl Coward, Harpo Marx and Gertrude Lawrence.\nThroughout the 1930s, Hart worked both with and without Kaufman on several musicals and revues, including \"Face the Music\" (1932); \"As Thousands Cheer\" (1933), with songs by Irving Berlin; \"Jubilee (musical)\" (1935), with songs by Cole Porter; and \"I'd Rather Be Right\" (1937), with songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. (Lorenz Hart and Moss Hart were not related.) \nAfter \"George Washington Slept Here\" (1940), Kaufman and Hart called it quits. Hart continued to write plays after parting with Kaufman, such as \"Christopher Blake\" (1946) and \"Light Up the Sky\" (1948), as well as the book for the musical \"Lady In The Dark\" (1941), with songs by Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin. However, he became best known during this period as a director. Among the Broadway hits he staged were \"Junior Miss\" (1941), \"Dear Ruth\" (1944) and \"Anniversary Waltz\" (1954). By far his biggest hit was the musical \"My Fair Lady\" (1956), adapted from George Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion\", with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. The show ran over six years and won a Tony Award for Best Musical. Hart picked up the Tony for Best Director.\nIn 1950 Hart was host of the game show \"Answer Yes or No\" on NBC television.\nHart also wrote some screenplays, including \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947) (for which he received an Oscar nomination), \"Hans Christian Andersen\" (1952) and \"A Star Is Born\" (1954). His memoir \"Act One: An Autobiography\" (1950) was adapted for film in 1963, with George Hamilton portraying Hart. \nThe last show Hart directed was the Lerner and Loewe musical \"Camelot\" (1960). During a troubled out-of-town tryout, Hart had a heart attack. The show opened before he fully recovered, but he and Lerner reworked it after the opening. That, along with huge pre-sales and a cast performance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", helped ensure the expensive production was a hit. \nGuild presidency.\nHart was the tenth president of the Dramatists Guild of America, from 1947 until 1956, when Oscar Hammerstein II became his successor.\nPersonal life.\nHart married Kitty Carlisle on August 10, 1946; they had two children.\nDeath.\nMoss Hart died of a heart attack at the age of 57 on December 20, 1961, at his winter home in Palm Springs, California. He was entombed in a crypt at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.\nLegacy.\nIn 1972, 11 years after his death, Moss Hart was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame, one of 23 people to be selected into the Hall of Fame's first induction class that year. Alan Jay Lerner paid tribute to Hart in his memoir, \"The Street Where I Live\".\nMoss Hart Awards.\nThe New England Theatre Conference offers the Moss Hart Memorial Award at their annual convention to theater groups in New England that put forth imaginative productions of exemplary scripts. These awards are designed to honor Moss Hart as well as the award recipients. Past winners include Wellesley Repertory Theatre, Staples Players, and Suffield Academy.\nMoss Hart and Kitty Carlisle Hart New Play Initiative.\nDeveloped as an offshoot of the very successful New Play Initiative of Burbank, California's, Grove Theater Center, the Moss Hart and Kitty Carlisle Hart New Play Initiative (Hart NPI) expands the program to one of the few programs of its kind where a playwright will be guaranteed a production of his/her play in Los Angeles (Burbank), as well as an Off-Broadway Premiere at 59E59 Theaters in New York City. The GTC New Play Initiative is the brainchild of producers Charles Johanson and Kevin Cochran (founders of Grove Theater Center) and its expansion to a truly bi-coastal program with the focus on the author and their vision for their work. The Hart NPI is under the leadership of Moss Hart's son Christopher Hart (artistic director), Kevin Cochran (producing artistic director) and Charles Johanson (executive director). In the first Hart NPI play cycle (2017-2018) there were 1,243 submissions from 44 states and 6 countries!. The Hart NPI will select 16-21 semifinalists, which will then be narrowed down to eight finalists and the eight will be narrowed down to the winners: Four Bronze Hart NPI winners will have a reading of their play at 59E59 Theaters, two Silver Hart NPI winners will have a production of their play in Los Angeles (Burbank), at the GTC Burbank and the Gold Hart NPI winner will have an Off-Broadway premiere at 59E59 Theaters. Dr. Catherine Hart (Moss and Kitty's daughter, who also serves on the board of trustees of the Hart NPI) said that \"Having a program like this in Moss &amp; Kitty's name would have made them proud.\"\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kaufman and Moss Hart\nI'd Rather Be Right is a 1937 musical with a book by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman, lyrics by Lorenz Hart, and music by Richard Rodgers. The story is a Depression-era political satire set in New York City about Washington politics and political figures such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The plot centers on Peggy Jones (Joy Hodges) and her boyfriend Phil (Austin Marshall), who needs a raise in order for them to get married. The President steps in and solves their dilemma.\nProduction.\n\"I'd Rather Be Right\" premiered on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre on November 2, 1937, produced by Sam H. Harris. It transferred to the Music Box Theatre, and ran for 290 performances. It starred George M. Cohan as Franklin D. Roosevelt. In such pieces as \"Off the Record\", Cohan, as FDR, danced\u2014not possible in real life for the President.\nReception.\nH. G. Wells wrote enthusiastically about the musical, and Cohan's performance as Roosevelt, in an article \"The Fall in America 1937\", published in \"Collier's\" on January 28, 1938, and reprinted in his \"World Brain\" (1938).\nCultural references.\nThe musical is prominently featured in the 1942 Cohan biopic \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\", in which it serves as a narrative bookend. James Cagney, playing Cohan, after meeting FDR in the Oval Office, performs a joyous tap dance as he walks back down the stairs of the White House. In the film, we also see Cagney as Cohan performing \"Off the Record\" during the show's run. Because the film was made during World War II, the film also anachronistically added some morale-boosting lyrics at the end of the song.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Euchromatin stands in contrast to heterochromatin, which is tightly packed and less accessible for transcription. 92% of the human genome is euchromatic.\nIn eukaryotes, euchromatin comprises the most active portion of the genome within the cell nucleus. In prokaryotes, euchromatin is the \"only\" form of chromatin present; this indicates that the heterochromatin structure evolved later along with the nucleus, possibly as a mechanism to handle increasing genome size.\nStructure.\nEuchromatin is composed of repeating subunits known as nucleosomes, reminiscent of an unfolded set of beads on a string, that are approximately 11\u00a0nm in diameter. At the core of these nucleosomes are a set of four histone protein pairs: H3, H4, H2A, and H2B. Each core histone protein possesses a 'tail' structure, which can vary in several ways; it is thought that these variations act as \"master control switches\" through different methylation and acetylation states, which determine the overall arrangement of the chromatin. Approximately 147 base pairs of DNA are wound around the histone octamers, or a little less than 2 turns of the helix. Nucleosomes along the strand are linked together via the histone, H1, and a short space of open linker DNA, ranging from around 0\u201380 base pairs. The key distinction between the structure of euchromatin and heterochromatin is that the nucleosomes in euchromatin are much more widely spaced, which allows for easier access of different protein complexes to the DNA strand and thus increased gene transcription.\nAppearance.\nEuchromatin resembles a set of beads on a string at large magnifications. From farther away, it can resemble a ball of tangled thread, such as in some electron microscope visualizations. In both optical and electron microscopic visualizations, euchromatin appears lighter in color than heterochromatin - which is also present in the nucleus and appears darkly - due to its less compact structure. When visualizing chromosomes, such as in a karyogram, cytogenetic banding is used to stain the chromosomes. Cytogenetic banding allows us to see which parts of the chromosome are made up of euchromatin or heterochromatin in order to differentiate chromosomal subsections, irregularities or rearrangements. One such example is G banding, otherwise known as Giemsa staining where euchromatin appears lighter than heterochromatin.\nFunction.\nTranscription.\nEuchromatin participates in the active transcription of DNA to mRNA products. The unfolded structure allows gene regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase complexes to bind to the DNA sequence, which can then initiate the transcription process. While not all euchromatin is necessarily transcribed, as the euchromatin is divided into transcriptionally active and inactive domains, euchromatin is still generally associated with active gene transcription. There is therefore a direct link to how actively productive a cell is and the amount of euchromatin that can be found in its nucleus.\nIt is thought that the cell uses transformation from euchromatin into heterochromatin as a method of controlling gene expression and replication, since such processes behave differently on densely compacted chromatin. This is known as the 'accessibility hypothesis'. One example of constitutive euchromatin that is 'always turned on' is housekeeping genes, which code for the proteins needed for basic functions of cell survival.\nEpigenetics.\nEpigenetics involves changes in the phenotype that can be inherited without changing the DNA sequence. This can occur through many types of environmental interactions. Regarding euchromatin, post-translational modifications of the histones can alter the structure of chromatin, resulting in altered gene expression without changing the DNA. Additionally, a loss of heterochromatin and increase in euchromatin has been shown to correlate with an accelerated aging process, especially in diseases known to resemble premature aging. Research has shown epigenetic markers on histones for a number of additional diseases.\nRegulation.\nEuchromatin is primarily regulated by post-translational modifications to its nucleosomes' histones, conducted by many histone-modifying enzymes. These modifications occur on the histones' N-terminal tails that protrude from the nucleosome structure, and are thought of to recruit enzymes to either keep the chromatin in its open form, as euchromatin, or in its closed form, as heterochromatin. Histone acetylation, for instance, is typically associated with euchromatin structure, whereas histone methylation promotes heterochromatin remodeling. Acetylation makes the histone group more negatively charged, which in turn disrupts its interactions with the DNA strand, essentially \"opening\" the strand for easier access. Acetylation can occur on multiple lysine residues of a histone's N-terminal tail and in different histones of the same nucleosome, which is thought to further increase DNA accessibility for transcription factors.\nPhosphorylation of histones is another method by which euchromatin is regulated. This tends to occur on the N-terminal tails of the histones, however some sites are present in the core. Phosphorylation is controlled by kinases and phosphatases, which add and remove the phosphate groups respectively. This can occur at serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues present in euchromatin. Since the phosphate groups added to the structure will incorporate a negative charge, it will promote the more relaxed \"open\" form, similar to acetylation. In regards to functionality, histone phosphorylation is involved with gene expression, DNA damage repair, and chromatin remodeling.\nAnother method of regulation that incorporates a negative charge, thereby favoring the \"open\" form, is ADP ribosylation. This process adds one or more ADP-ribose units to the histone, and is involved in the DNA damage response pathway.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53983", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53983", "title": "Heterochromatin", "text": "Compact and highly condensed form of chromatin\nHeterochromatin is a tightly packed form of DNA or \"condensed DNA\", which comes in multiple varieties. These varieties lie on a continuum between the two extremes of constitutive heterochromatin and facultative heterochromatin. Both play a role in the expression of genes. Because it is tightly packed, it was thought to be inaccessible to polymerases and therefore not transcribed; however, according to Volpe et al. (2002), and many other papers since, much of this DNA is in fact transcribed, but it is continuously turned over via RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS). Recent studies with electron microscopy and OsO4 staining reveal that the dense packing is not due to the chromatin.\nConstitutive heterochromatin can affect the genes near itself (e.g. position-effect variegation). It is usually repetitive and forms structural functions such as centromeres or telomeres, in addition to acting as an attractor for other gene-expression or repression signals.\nFacultative heterochromatin is the result of genes that are silenced through a mechanism such as histone deacetylation or Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) through RNAi. It is not repetitive and shares the compact structure of constitutive heterochromatin. However, under specific developmental or environmental signaling cues, it can lose its condensed structure and become transcriptionally active.\nHeterochromatin has been associated with the di- and tri -methylation of H3K9 in certain portions of the human genome. H3K9me3-related methyltransferases appear to have a pivotal role in modifying heterochromatin during lineage commitment at the onset of organogenesis and in maintaining lineage fidelity.\nStructure.\nChromatin is found in two varieties: euchromatin and heterochromatin. Originally, the two forms were distinguished cytologically by how intensely they get stained \u2013 the euchromatin is less intense, while heterochromatin stains intensely, indicating tighter packing. Heterochromatin was given its name for this reason by botanist Emil Heitz who discovered that heterochromatin remained darkly stained throughout the entire cell cycle, unlike euchromatin whose stain disappeared during interphase. Heterochromatin is usually localized to the periphery of the nucleus.\nDespite this early dichotomy, recent evidence in both animals and plants has suggested that there are more than two distinct heterochromatin states, and it may in fact exist in four or five 'states', each marked by different combinations of epigenetic marks.\nHeterochromatin mainly consists of genetically inactive satellite sequences, and many genes are repressed to various extents, although some cannot be expressed in euchromatin at all. Both centromeres and telomeres are heterochromatic, as is the Barr body of the second, inactivated X-chromosome in a female.\nFunction.\nHeterochromatin has been associated with several functions, from gene regulation to the protection of chromosome integrity; some of these roles can be attributed to the dense packing of DNA, which makes it less accessible to protein factors that usually bind DNA or its associated factors. For example, naked double-stranded DNA ends would usually be interpreted by the cell as damaged or viral DNA, triggering cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or destruction of the fragment, such as by endonucleases in bacteria.\nSome regions of chromatin are very densely packed with fibers that display a condition comparable to that of the chromosome at mitosis. Heterochromatin is generally clonally inherited; when a cell divides, the two daughter cells typically contain heterochromatin within the same regions of DNA, resulting in epigenetic inheritance. Variations cause heterochromatin to encroach on adjacent genes or recede from genes at the extremes of domains. Transcribable material may be repressed by being positioned (in \"cis\") at these boundary domains. This gives rise to expression levels that vary from cell to cell, which may be demonstrated by position-effect variegation. Insulator sequences may act as a barrier in rare cases where constitutive heterochromatin and highly active genes are juxtaposed (e.g. the 5'HS4 insulator upstream of the chicken \u03b2-globin locus, and loci in two \"Saccharomyces\" spp.).\nConstitutive heterochromatin.\nAll cells of a given species package the same regions of DNA in constitutive heterochromatin, and thus in all cells, any genes contained within the constitutive heterochromatin will be poorly expressed. For example, all human chromosomes 1, 9, 16, and the Y-chromosome contain large regions of constitutive heterochromatin. In most organisms, constitutive heterochromatin occurs around the chromosome centromere and near telomeres.\nFacultative heterochromatin.\nThe regions of DNA packaged in facultative heterochromatin will not be consistent between the cell types within a species, and thus a sequence in one cell that is packaged in facultative heterochromatin (and the genes within are poorly expressed) may be packaged in euchromatin in another cell (and the genes within are no longer silenced). However, the formation of facultative heterochromatin is regulated, and is often associated with morphogenesis or differentiation. An example of facultative heterochromatin is X chromosome inactivation in female mammals: one X chromosome is packaged as facultative heterochromatin and silenced, while the other X chromosome is packaged as euchromatin and expressed.\nAmong the molecular components that appear to regulate the spreading of heterochromatin are the Polycomb-group proteins and non-coding genes such as Xist. The mechanism for such spreading is still a matter of controversy. The polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 regulate chromatin compaction and gene expression and have a fundamental role in developmental processes. PRC-mediated epigenetic aberrations are linked to genome instability and malignancy and play a role in the DNA damage response, DNA repair and in the fidelity of replication.\nYeast heterochromatin.\n\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", or budding yeast, is a model eukaryote and its heterochromatin has been defined thoroughly. Although most of its genome can be characterized as euchromatin, \"S. cerevisiae\" has regions of DNA that are transcribed very poorly. These loci are the so-called silent mating type loci (HML and HMR), the rDNA (encoding ribosomal RNA), and the sub-telomeric regions.\nFission yeast (\"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\") uses another mechanism for heterochromatin formation at its centromeres. Gene silencing at this location depends on components of the RNAi pathway. Double-stranded RNA is believed to result in silencing of the region through a series of steps.\nIn the fission yeast \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\", two RNAi complexes, the RITS complex and the RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC), are part of an RNAi machinery involved in the initiation, propagation and maintenance of heterochromatin assembly. These two complexes localize in a siRNA-dependent manner on chromosomes, at the site of heterochromatin assembly. RNA polymerase II synthesizes a transcript that serves as a platform to recruit RITS, RDRC and possibly other complexes required for heterochromatin assembly. Both RNAi and an exosome-dependent RNA degradation process contribute to heterochromatic gene silencing. These mechanisms of \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\" may occur in other eukaryotes. A large RNA structure called RevCen has also been implicated in the production of siRNAs to mediate heterochromatin formation in some fission yeast.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term was introduced in the Western intellectual tradition by the Aristotelian \"De Sophisticis Elenchis\". \nFallacies may be committed intentionally to manipulate or persuade by deception, unintentionally because of human limitations such as carelessness, cognitive or social biases and ignorance, or potentially due to the limitations of language and understanding of language. These delineations include not only the ignorance of the right reasoning standard but also the ignorance of relevant properties of the context. For instance, the soundness of legal arguments depends on the context in which they are made.\nFallacies are commonly divided into \"formal\" and \"informal\". A formal fallacy is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument that renders the argument invalid, while an informal fallacy originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper logical form. Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally valid, but still fallacious.\nA special case is a mathematical fallacy, an intentionally invalid mathematical proof with a concealed, or subtle, error. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of false proofs of obvious contradictions.\nOverview.\nFallacies are types of erroneous reasoning that render arguments logically unsound. According to The New Handbook of Cognitive Therapy Techniques, they include \"unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts\". Informal fallacies, in particular, are frequently found in mass media such as television and newspapers. Understanding fallacies may allow one to recognize them in either one's own or others' writing. Avoiding fallacies may help improve one's ability to produce sound arguments.\nIt can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious, as arguments exist along a continuum of soundness and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones. Moreover, whether a specific argument is fallacious often depends on the content rather than the form of the argument. An example is a probabilistically valid instance of the formally invalid argument form of denying the antecedent or affirming the consequent. Thus, \"fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments, because for most fallacious instances of an argument form, a similar but non-fallacious instance can be found\". Evaluating an instance of an argument as fallacious is therefore often a matter of evaluating the context of the argument. \nRecognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in rhetorical patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements. Informal fallacies may also exploit the emotional, intellectual, or psychological weaknesses of the audience. Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true.\nArgumentation theory provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies. In the pragma-dialectical theory, for instance, an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals who attempt to resolve their disagreement on the merits of a case. The protocol consists of normative rules of interaction, and violations of these rules are considered fallacies because they frustrate the attempt at resolving the disagreement.\nFallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade. Examples in the mass media today include but are not limited to propaganda, advertisements, politics, newspaper editorials, and opinion-based news shows.\nSystems of classification.\nFallacies are generally classified strictly by either their structure or their content, such as by classifying them as formal fallacies or informal fallacies, respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption. Alternatively, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as material fallacies (content), verbal fallacies (linguistic), and formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies. Verbal fallacies may be placed in either formal or informal classifications: Compare equivocation, which is a word- or phrase-based ambiguity, to the fallacy of composition, which is premise- and inference-based ambiguity.\nGreek logic.\nThe Greek philosopher Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC) was the first to systematize logical errors into a list to make it easier to refute an opponent's thesis and thus win an argument. Aristotle's \"Sophistical Refutations\" () identifies thirteen fallacies. He divided them up into two major types: linguistic fallacies and non-linguistic fallacies, some of which depend on language and others that do not. These fallacies are called verbal fallacies and material fallacies, respectively. A material fallacy is an error in what the arguer is talking about, while a verbal fallacy is an error in how the arguer is talking. Verbal fallacies are those in which a conclusion is obtained by improper or ambiguous use of words.\nAn example of a language dependent fallacy is given as a debate as to who in humanity are learners: the wise or the ignorant.3 A language-independent fallacy is, for example:\nIndian logic.\nIndian logicians took great pains to identify fallacies in arguments. An influential collection of texts on logic and reason, the \"Ny\u0101ya S\u016btras\", attributed to Aksapada Gautama, variously estimated to have been composed between the 6th century BCE and the 2nd century CE, lists in its theory of inference five such reasons used in an argument that was further developed by later logicians.\nWhately's grouping.\nEnglish scholar and theologian Richard Whately (1787\u20131863) defines a fallacy broadly as, \"any argument, or apparent argument, which professes to be decisive of the matter at hand, while in reality it is not\".8\nWhately divided fallacies into two groups: \"logical\" and \"material\". According to Whately, logical fallacies are arguments where the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Material fallacies are not logical errors because the conclusion follows from the premises. He then divided the logical group into two groups: purely logical and semi-logical. The semi-logical group included all of Aristotle's sophisms except \"ignoratio elenchi\", \"petitio principii\", and \"non causa pro causa\", which are in the material group.\nOther systems of classification.\nOther famous methods of classifying fallacies are those of Francis Bacon and J. S. Mill. Bacon (\"Novum Organum\", Aph. 33, 38 sqq.) divided fallacies into four Idola (Idols, i.e. False Appearances), which summarize the various kinds of mistakes to which the human intellect is prone. J. S. Mill discussed the subject in book five of his Logic, and Jeremy Bentham's \"Book of Fallacies\" (1824) contains valuable remarks.\nFormal fallacy.\nA formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, logical fallacy or \"non sequitur\" (Latin for \"it does not follow\") is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument that renders the argument invalid. The flaw can be expressed in the standard system of logic. Such an argument is always considered to be wrong.\nThe presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument's premises or its conclusion. Both may actually be true or may even be more probable as a result of the argument, but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described.\nEven non-deductive arguments can be said to be fallacious: for example, an inductive argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or causality. But \"since deductive arguments depend on formal properties and inductive arguments don't, formal fallacies apply only to deductive arguments\".\nA logical form such as \"\"A\" and \"B\"\" is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions. Logical form alone can guarantee that, given true premises, a true conclusion must follow. However, formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false; the conclusion can be either true or false. Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee. Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a conclusion to be true.\nThe term \"non sequitur\" denotes a general formal fallacy, often meaning one that does not belong to any named subclass of formal fallacies, like affirming the consequent.\nCommon examples.\nEcological fallacy.\nAn ecological fallacy is committed when one draws an inference from data based on the premise that qualities observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals; for example, \"if countries with more Protestants tend to have higher suicide rates, then Protestants must be more likely to commit suicide\".\nObservational interpretation fallacy.\nThe \"observational interpretation fallacy\" is a cognitive bias that occurs exclusively in the medical field, leading to the mistaken interpretation of observed associations as causal relationships, negatively impacting medical guidelines, clinical decisions, and healthcare practices, potentially compromising patient safety.\nFallacy fork.\nMaarten Boudry and others have argued that formal, deductive fallacies rarely occur in real life and that arguments that would be fallacious in formally deductive terms are not necessarily so when context and prior probabilities are taken into account, thus making the argument defeasible and/or inductive. Boudry coined the term \"fallacy fork\". For a given fallacy, one must either characterize it by means of a deductive argumentation scheme, which rarely applies (the first prong of the fork), or one must relax definitions and add nuance to take the actual intent and context of the argument into account (the other prong of the fork). To argue, for example, that one became nauseated after eating a mushroom because the mushroom was poisonous could be an example of the \"post hoc ergo propter hoc\" fallacy.\nInformal fallacy.\nIn contrast to a formal fallacy, an informal fallacy originates from a reasoning error other than a flaw in the logical form of the argument. A deductive argument containing an informal fallacy may be formally valid, but still remain rationally unpersuasive. Nevertheless, informal fallacies apply to both deductive and non-deductive arguments.\nThough the form of the argument may be relevant, fallacies of this type are \"types of mistakes in reasoning that arise from the mishandling of the \"content\" of the propositions constituting the argument\".\nFaulty generalization.\nA special subclass of the informal fallacies is the set of faulty generalizations, also known as inductive fallacies. Here, the most important issue concerns inductive strength or methodology (for example, statistical inference). In the absence of sufficient evidence, drawing conclusions based on induction is unwarranted and fallacious. With the backing of sufficient amounts of the right type of empirical evidence, however, the conclusions may become warranted and convincing (at which point the arguments are no longer considered fallacious).\nHasty generalization.\nHasty generalization is described as making assumptions about a whole group or range of cases based on a sample that is inadequate (usually because it is atypical or just too small).\nStereotypes about people (\"frat boys are drunkards\", \"grad students are nerdy\", \"women don't enjoy sports\", etc.) are common examples of the principle.\nHasty generalization often follows a pattern such as:\nX is true for A.\nX is true for B.\nTherefore, X is true for C, D, etc.\nWhile never a valid logical deduction, if such an inference can be made on statistical grounds, it may nonetheless be convincing. This is because with enough empirical evidence, the generalization is no longer a hasty one.\nRelevance fallacy.\nThe fallacies of relevance are a broad class of informal fallacies, generically represented by missing the point: presenting an argument that may be sound but fails to address the issue in question.\nArgument from silence.\nAn argument from silence is a faulty conclusion that is drawn based on the absence of evidence rather than on the presence of evidence.\nExamples of informal fallacies.\n\"Post hoc\" (false cause).\nThe post hoc fallacy assumes that because B comes after A, A caused B. It gets its name from the Latin phrase \"post hoc, ergo propter hoc\", which translates as \"after this, therefore because of this\". \nSometimes one event really does cause another one that comes later\u2014for example, if one registers for a class and their name later appears on the roll, it's true that the first event caused the one that came later. But sometimes two events that seem related in time are not really related as cause and event. That is, temporal correlation does not necessarily entail causation. For example, if one eats a sandwich and then gets food poisoning, that does not necessarily mean the sandwich caused the food poisoning. Something else eaten earlier might have caused the food poisoning.\nSlippery slope.\nFor an argument to be a slippery slope type of argument, it must meet the requirements of that argumentation scheme. A slippery slope argument originates from a conversation or debate in which two actors take turns. It usually originates from one actor giving advice on a decision or act. Along the way, the actor must make additional choices on similar matters through which the actor enters the \u2018grey area\u2019 of the slippery slope. At this point, the actor potentially loses control over the direction of the arguments, thus leading to a \u2018fatal\u2019 outcome.\nSuch an argument is built up according to the following argumentation scheme: initial premise, sequential premise, indeterminacy premise, control premise, loss of control premise, catastrophic outcome premise, and conclusion. Slippery slope arguments may be defeated by asking critical questions or giving counterarguments.\nThere are several reasons for a slippery slope to be fallacious: for example, the argument is going too far into the future, it is a too complex argument whose structure is hard to identify, or the argument makes emotional appeals.\nIt may be that a slippery slope is not necessarily fallacious if context is taken into account and there is an effort to assess plausibility.\nFalse analogy.\nInformally known as the \"apples and oranges\" fallacy, a false analogy uses unsound comparisons.\nStraw man fallacy.\nThe straw man fallacy refers to the refutation of a standpoint in an argument that was never proposed. The fallacy usually occurs in the presentation of an opponent's standpoint as more extreme, distorted, or simplistic than it actually is. Compared to criticizing the opponent's actual standpoint, this allows the arguer to offer a seeming refutation of what is, however, not the actual standpoint. Such an argument involves two arguers, with one criticizing the other's perspective. The reason for the straw man argument to be fallacious originates from the problem of how to deal with natural discourse. The opponent's argument is not reflected by the arguments that are proposed by the speaker.\nMeasurement fallacy.\nSome of the fallacies described above may be committed in the context of measurement.\nWhere mathematical fallacies are subtle mistakes in reasoning leading to invalid mathematical proofs, measurement fallacies are unwarranted inferential leaps involved in the extrapolation of raw data to a measurement-based value claim. The ancient Greek Sophist Protagoras was one of the first thinkers to propose that humans can generate reliable measurements through his \"human-measure\" principle and the practice of \"dissoi logoi\" (arguing multiple sides of an issue). This history helps explain why measurement fallacies are informed by informal logic and argumentation theory.\nKnowledge value measurement fallacy.\nThe increasing availability and circulation of big data are driving a proliferation of new metrics for scholarly authority, and there is lively discussion regarding the relative usefulness of such metrics for measuring the value of knowledge production in the context of an \"information tsunami\".\nFor example, anchoring fallacies can occur when unwarranted weight is given to data generated by metrics that the arguers themselves acknowledge are flawed. For example, the limitations of the journal impact factor (JIF) are well documented, and even JIF pioneer Eugene Garfield notes that, \"while citation data create new tools for analyses of research performance, it should be stressed that they supplement rather than replace other quantitative and qualitative indicators\". To the extent that arguers jettison the acknowledged limitations of JIF-generated data in evaluative judgments or leave behind Garfield's \"supplement rather than replace\" caveat, they commit anchoring fallacies.\nThe observational interpretation fallacy is the cognitive bias where association identified in observational studies are misinterpreted as causal relationships.\nA naturalistic fallacy can occur, for example, in the case of sheer quantity metrics based on the premise \"more is better\" or, in the case of developmental assessment in the field of psychology, \"higher is better\".\nA false analogy occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons between data points. For example, the Scopus and Web of Science bibliographic databases have difficulty distinguishing between citations of scholarly work that are arms-length endorsements, ceremonial citations, or negative citations (indicating the citing author withholds endorsement of the cited work). Hence, measurement-based value claims premised on the uniform quality of all citations may be questioned on false analogy grounds.\nAs another example, consider the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index of Academic Analytics. This tool purports to measure overall faculty productivity, yet it does not capture data based on citations in books. This creates a possibility that low productivity measurements using the tool commit argument from silence fallacies, to the extent that such measurements are supported by the absence of book citation data.\nEcological fallacies can be committed when one measures the scholarly productivity of a sub-group of individuals (e.g. \"Puerto Rican\" faculty) via reference to aggregate data about a larger and different group (e.g., \"Hispanic\" faculty).\nIntentional fallacy.\nSometimes a speaker or writer uses a fallacy intentionally. In any context, including academic debate, a conversation among friends, political discourse, advertising, or comedic purposes, the arguer may use fallacious reasoning to try to persuade the listener or reader, by means other than offering relevant evidence, that the conclusion is true.\nExamples of this include the speaker or writer:\nIn humor, errors of reasoning are used for comical purposes. Groucho Marx used fallacies of amphiboly, for instance, to make ironic statements; Gary Larson and Scott Adams employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons. Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive by means of a whole host of informal and formal fallacies.\nWhen someone uses logical fallacies intentionally to mislead in academic, political, or other high-stakes contexts, the breach of trust calls into question the authority and intellectual integrity of that person.\nAssessment: pragmatic theory.\nAccording to the pragmatic theory, a fallacy can be either a heuristic error or a ploy used intentionally to unfairly win an argument. There are always two parties to an argument containing a fallacy: the perpetrator and the intended victim. \nThe dialogue framework required to support the pragmatic theory of fallacy is built on the presumption that argumentative dialogue has both an adversarial component and a collaborative component. A dialogue has individual goals for each participant as well as shared goals that apply to all participants. A fallacy of the second kind is seen as more than simply a violation of the rule of reasonable dialogue. It is also a deceptive tactic of argumentation based on sleight-of-hand. Aristotle explicitly compared contentious reasoning to unfair fighting in athletic contests. But the roots of the pragmatic theory go back even further in history, to the Sophists. The pragmatic theory finds its roots in the Aristotelian conception of a fallacy as a sophistical refutation but also supports the view that many of the types of arguments traditionally labeled as fallacies are in fact reasonable techniques of argumentation that can be used, in many cases, to support legitimate goals of dialogue. Hence, under the pragmatic approach, each case needs to be analyzed individually to determine whether the argument is fallacious or reasonable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, the relationship between these clades is unclear, and as a result of many historical taxonomic interpretations and differing opinions regarding the significance of morphological variations, rankings of taxa within the order are inconsistent.

Two functors that stand in this relationship are known as adjoint functors, one being the left adjoint and the other the right adjoint. Pairs of adjoint functors are ubiquitous in mathematics and often arise from constructions of \"optimal solutions\" to certain problems (i.e., constructions of objects having a certain universal property), such as the construction of a free group on a set in algebra, or the construction of the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification of a topological space in topology.\nBy definition, an adjunction between categories formula_1 and formula_2 is a pair of functors (assumed to be covariant)\nformula_3 and formula_4\nand, for all objects formula_5 in formula_1 and formula_7 in formula_2, a bijection between the respective morphism sets\nformula_9\nsuch that this family of bijections is natural in formula_5 and formula_7. For locally small categories, naturality here means that there are natural isomorphisms between the pair of functors formula_12 and formula_13 for a fixed formula_5 in formula_1, and also the pair of functors formula_16 and formula_17 for a fixed formula_7 in formula_2. For other categories, naturality is defined as a generalisation of this.\nThe functor formula_20 is called a left adjoint functor or left adjoint to formula_21, while formula_21 is called a right adjoint functor or right adjoint to formula_20. We write formula_24.\nAn adjunction between categories formula_1 and formula_2 is somewhat akin to a \"weak form\" of an equivalence between formula_1 and formula_2, and indeed every equivalence gives an adjunction, though the equivalence itself is not necessarily an adjunction. In many situations, an adjunction can be \"upgraded\" to an equivalence, by a suitable natural modification of the involved categories and functors.\nTerminology and notation.\nThe terms \"adjoint\" and \"adjunct\" are both used, and are cognates: one is taken directly from Latin, the other from Latin via French. In the classic text \"Categories for the Working Mathematician\", Mac Lane makes a distinction between the two. Given a family\n formula_29\nof hom-set bijections, we call formula_30 an adjunction or an adjunction between formula_31 and formula_32. If formula_33 is an arrow in formula_34, Mac Lane calls formula_35 the right adjunct of formula_33. The functor formula_31 is left adjoint to formula_21, and formula_21 is right adjoint to formula_20. (Note that formula_21 may have itself a right adjoint that is quite different from formula_20; see below for an example.)\nIn general, the phrases \"formula_31 is a left adjoint\" and \"formula_31 has a right adjoint\" are equivalent. We call formula_20 a left adjoint because it is applied to the left argument of formula_46, and formula_21 a right adjoint because it is applied to the right argument of formula_48.\nIf \"F\" is left adjoint to \"G\", we also write\nformula_49\nThe terminology comes from the Hilbert space idea of adjoint operators formula_50, formula_51 with formula_52, which is formally similar to the above relation between hom-sets. The analogy to adjoint maps of Hilbert spaces can be made precise in certain contexts.\nIntroduction and motivation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The slogan is \"Adjoint functors arise everywhere\".\u2014\u200a\nCommon mathematical constructions are very often adjoint functors. Consequently, general theorems about left/right adjoint functors encode the details of many useful and otherwise non-trivial results. Such general theorems include the equivalence of the various definitions of adjoint functors, the uniqueness of a right adjoint for a given left adjoint, the fact that left/right adjoint functors respectively preserve colimits/limits (which are also found in every area of mathematics), and the general adjoint functor theorems giving conditions under which a given functor is a left/right adjoint.\nSolutions to optimization problems.\nIn a sense, an adjoint functor is a way of giving the \"most efficient\" solution to some problem via a method that is \"formulaic\". For example, an elementary problem in ring theory is how to turn a rng (which is like a ring that might not have a multiplicative identity) into a ring. The \"most efficient\" way is to adjoin an element '1' to the rng, adjoin all (and only) the elements that are necessary for satisfying the ring axioms (e.g. \"r\"+1 for each \"r\" in the ring), and impose no relations in the newly formed ring that are not forced by axioms. Moreover, this construction is \"formulaic\" in the sense that it works in essentially the same way for any rng.\nThis is rather vague, though suggestive, and can be made precise in the language of category theory: a construction is \"most efficient\" if it satisfies a universal property, and is \"formulaic\" if it defines a functor. Universal properties come in two types: initial properties and terminal properties. Since these are dual notions, it is only necessary to discuss one of them.\nThe idea of using an initial property is to set up the problem in terms of some auxiliary category \"E\", so that the problem at hand corresponds to finding an initial object of \"E\". This has an advantage that the \"optimization\"\u2014the sense that the process finds the \"most efficient\" solution\u2014means something rigorous and recognisable, rather like the attainment of a supremum. The category \"E\" is also formulaic in this construction, since it is always the category of elements of the functor to which one is constructing an adjoint.\nBack to our example: take the given rng \"R\", and make a category \"E\" whose \"objects\" are rng homomorphisms \"R\" \u2192 \"S\", with \"S\" a ring having a multiplicative identity. The \"morphisms\" in \"E\" between \"R\" \u2192 \"S\"1 and \"R\" \u2192 \"S\"2 are commutative triangles of the form (\"R\" \u2192 \"S\"1, \"R\" \u2192 \"S\"2, \"S\"1 \u2192 \"S\"2) where S1 \u2192 S2 is a ring map (which preserves the identity). (Note that this is precisely the definition of the comma category of \"R\" over the inclusion of unitary rings into rng.) The existence of a morphism between \"R\" \u2192 \"S\"1 and \"R\" \u2192 \"S\"2 implies that \"S\"1 is at least as efficient a solution as \"S\"2 to our problem: \"S\"2 can have more adjoined elements and/or more relations not imposed by axioms than \"S\"1.\nTherefore, the assertion that an object \"R\" \u2192 \"R\"\u2217 is initial in \"E\", that is, that there is a morphism from it to any other element of \"E\", means that the ring \"R\"* is a \"most efficient\" solution to our problem.\nThe two facts that this method of turning rngs into rings is \"most efficient\" and \"formulaic\" can be expressed simultaneously by saying that it defines an \"adjoint functor\". More explicitly: Let \"F\" denote the above process of adjoining an identity to a rng, so \"F\"(\"R\")=\"R\"\u2217. Let \"G\" denote the process of \"forgetting\" whether a ring \"S\" has an identity and considering it simply as a rng, so essentially \"G\"(\"S\")=\"S\". Then \"F\" is the \"left adjoint functor\" of \"G\".\nNote however that we haven't actually constructed \"R\"\u2217 yet; it is an important and not altogether trivial algebraic fact that such a left adjoint functor \"R\" \u2192 \"R\"\u2217 actually exists.\nSymmetry of optimization problems.\nIt is also possible to \"start\" with the functor \"F\", and pose the following (vague) question: is there a problem to which \"F\" is the most efficient solution?\nThe notion that \"F\" is the \"most efficient solution\" to the problem posed by \"G\" is, in a certain rigorous sense, equivalent to the notion that \"G\" poses the \"most difficult problem\" that \"F\" solves.\nThis gives the intuition behind the fact that adjoint functors occur in pairs: if \"F\" is left adjoint to \"G\", then \"G\" is right adjoint to \"F\".\nFormal definitions.\nThere are various equivalent definitions for adjoint functors:\nThe equivalency of these definitions is quite useful. Adjoint functors arise everywhere, in all areas of mathematics. Since the structure in any of these definitions gives rise to the structures in the others, switching between them makes implicit use of many details that would otherwise have to be repeated separately in every subject area.\nConventions.\nThe theory of adjoints has the terms \"left\" and \"right\" at its foundation, and there are many components that live in one of two categories \"C\" and \"D\" that are under consideration. Therefore it can be helpful to choose letters in alphabetical order according to whether they live in the \"lefthand\" category \"C\" or the \"righthand\" category \"D\", and also to write them down in this order whenever possible.\nIn this article for example, the letters \"X\", \"F\", \"f\", \u03b5 will consistently denote things that live in the category \"C\", the letters \"Y\", \"G\", \"g\", \u03b7 will consistently denote things that live in the category \"D\", and whenever possible such things will be referred to in order from left to right (a functor \"F\" : \"D\" \u2192 \"C\" can be thought of as \"living\" where its outputs are, in \"C\"). If the arrows for the left adjoint functor F were drawn they would be pointing to the left; if the arrows for the right adjoint functor G were drawn they would be pointing to the right.\nDefinition via universal morphisms.\nBy definition, a functor \nformula_53 is a left adjoint functor if for each object formula_54 in formula_1 there exists a universal morphism \nfrom formula_20 to formula_54. Spelled out, this means that for each object formula_54 in formula_1 there exists an object \nformula_60 in formula_2 and a morphism formula_62 such that for every object \nformula_63 in formula_2 and every morphism formula_65 there exists a unique morphism \nformula_66 with formula_67.\nThe latter equation is expressed by the following commutative diagram:\nIn this situation, one can show that formula_21 can be turned into a functor formula_69 in a unique way such that \nformula_70 \nfor all morphisms formula_71 in formula_1; formula_20 is then called a left adjoint to formula_21.\nSimilarly, we may define right-adjoint functors. A functor formula_75 is a right adjoint functor if for each object formula_63 in formula_2, \nthere exists a universal morphism from formula_63 to formula_21. Spelled out, this means that for each object formula_63 in formula_2, \nthere exists an object formula_82 in formula_83 and a morphism formula_84 such that for every object formula_54 in formula_1 \nand every morphism formula_66 there exists a unique morphism formula_65 with formula_89.\nAgain, this formula_20 can be uniquely turned into a functor formula_53 such that formula_92 for formula_93 a morphism in formula_2; formula_21 is then called a right adjoint to formula_20.\nIt is true, as the terminology implies, that formula_20 is left adjoint to formula_21 if and only if formula_21 is right adjoint to formula_20.\nThese definitions via universal morphisms are often useful for establishing that a given functor is left or right adjoint, because they are minimalistic in their requirements. They are also intuitively meaningful in that finding a universal morphism is like solving an optimization problem.\nDefinition via Hom-sets.\nUsing hom-sets, an adjunction between two categories formula_1 and formula_2 can be defined as consisting of two functors formula_103 and formula_104 and a natural isomorphism\nformula_105.\nThis specifies a family of bijections\nformula_106\nfor all objects formula_107 and formula_108.\nIn this situation, formula_20 is left adjoint to formula_21 and formula_21 is right adjoint to formula_20.\nThis definition is a logical compromise in that it is more difficult to establish its satisfaction than the universal morphism definitions, and has fewer immediate implications than the counit\u2013unit definition. It is useful because of its obvious symmetry, and as a stepping-stone between the other definitions.\nIn order to interpret formula_113 as a \"natural isomorphism\", one must recognize formula_114 and formula_115 as functors. In fact, they are both bifunctors from formula_116 to formula_117 (the category of sets). For details, see the article on hom functors. Spelled out, the naturality of formula_113 means that for all morphisms formula_119 in formula_1 and all morphisms formula_121 in formula_2 the following diagram commutes:\nThe vertical arrows in this diagram are those induced by composition. Formally, formula_123 is given by formula_124 for each formula_125 formula_126 is similar.\nDefinition via counit\u2013unit.\nA third way of defining an adjunction between two categories formula_1 and formula_2 consists of two functors formula_103 and formula_104 and two natural transformations\nformula_131\nrespectively called the counit and the unit of the adjunction (terminology from universal algebra), such that the compositions\nformula_132\nformula_133\nare the identity morphisms formula_134 and formula_135 on F and G respectively.\nIn this situation we say that F is left adjoint to G and G is right adjoint to F, and may indicate this relationship by writing formula_136\u00a0, or, simply formula_24\u00a0.\nIn equational form, the above conditions on formula_138 are the counit\u2013unit equations\nformula_139\nwhich imply that for each formula_140 and each formula_141\nformula_142.\nNote that formula_143 denotes the identify functor on the category formula_144, formula_134 denotes the identity natural transformation from the functor F to itself, and formula_146 denotes the identity morphism of the object formula_147\nThese equations are useful in reducing proofs about adjoint functors to algebraic manipulations. They are sometimes called the \"triangle identities\", or sometimes the \"zig-zag equations\" because of the appearance of the corresponding string diagrams. A way to remember them is to first write down the nonsensical equation formula_148 and then fill in either F or G in one of the two simple ways that make the compositions defined.\nNote: The use of the prefix \"co\" in counit here is not consistent with the terminology of limits and colimits, because a colimit satisfies an \"initial\" property whereas the counit morphisms satisfy \"terminal\" properties, and dually for limit versus unit. The term \"unit\" here is borrowed from the theory of monads, where it looks like the insertion of the identity 1 into a monoid.\nHistory.\nThe idea of adjoint functors was introduced by Daniel Kan in 1958. Like many of the concepts in category theory, it was suggested by the needs of homological algebra, which was at the time devoted to computations. Those faced with giving tidy, systematic presentations of the subject would have noticed relations such as\nhom(\"F\"(\"X\"), \"Y\") = hom(\"X\", \"G\"(\"Y\"))\nin the category of abelian groups, where \"F\" was the functor formula_149 (i.e. take the tensor product with \"A\"), and \"G\" was the functor hom(\"A\",\u2013) (this is now known as the tensor-hom adjunction).\nThe use of the \"equals\" sign is an abuse of notation; those two groups are not really identical but there is a way of identifying them that is \"natural\". It can be seen to be natural on the basis, firstly, that these are two alternative descriptions of the bilinear mappings from \"X\" \u00d7 \"A\" to \"Y\". That is, however, something particular to the case of tensor product. In category theory the 'naturality' of the bijection is subsumed in the concept of a natural isomorphism.\nExamples.\nFree groups.\nThe construction of free groups is a common and illuminating example.\nLet \"F\" : Set \u2192 Grp be the functor assigning to each set \"Y\" the free group generated by the elements of \"Y\", and let \"G\" : Grp \u2192 Set be the forgetful functor, which assigns to each group \"X\" its underlying set. Then \"F\" is left adjoint to \"G\":\nformula_157\nshould be the identity. The intermediate group \"FGFY\" is the free group generated freely by the words of the free group \"FY\". (Think of these words as placed in parentheses to indicate that they are independent generators.) The arrow formula_158 is the group homomorphism from \"FY\" into \"FGFY\" sending each generator \"y\" of \"FY\" to the corresponding word of length one (\"y\") as a generator of \"FGFY\". The arrow formula_159 is the group homomorphism from \"FGFY\" to \"FY\" sending each generator to the word of \"FY\" it corresponds to (so this map is \"dropping parentheses\"). The composition of these maps is indeed the identity on \"FY\".\nformula_161\u00a0\nshould be the identity. The intermediate set \"GFGX\" is just the underlying set of \"FGX\". The arrow formula_162 is the \"inclusion of generators\" set map from the set \"GX\" to the set \"GFGX\". The arrow formula_163 is the set map from \"GFGX\" to \"GX\", which underlies the group homomorphism sending each generator of \"FGX\" to the element of \"X\" it corresponds to (\"dropping parentheses\"). The composition of these maps is indeed the identity on \"GX\".\nFree constructions and forgetful functors.\nFree objects are all examples of a left adjoint to a forgetful functor, which assigns to an algebraic object its underlying set. These algebraic free functors have generally the same description as in the detailed description of the free group situation above.\nDiagonal functors and limits.\nProducts, fibred products, equalizers, and kernels are all examples of the categorical notion of a limit. Any limit functor is right adjoint to a corresponding diagonal functor (provided the category has the type of limits in question), and the counit of the adjunction provides the defining maps from the limit object (i.e. from the diagonal functor on the limit, in the functor category). Below are some specific examples.\n The cartesian product of sets, the product of rings, the product of topological spaces etc. follow the same pattern; it can also be extended in a straightforward manner to more than just two factors. More generally, any type of limit is right adjoint to a diagonal functor.\n A suitable variation of this example also shows that the kernel functors for vector spaces and for modules are right adjoints. Analogously, one can show that the cokernel functors for abelian groups, vector spaces and modules are left adjoints.\nColimits and diagonal functors.\nCoproducts, fibred coproducts, coequalizers, and cokernels are all examples of the categorical notion of a colimit. Any colimit functor is left adjoint to a corresponding diagonal functor (provided the category has the type of colimits in question), and the unit of the adjunction provides the defining maps into the colimit object. Below are some specific examples.\n Analogous examples are given by the direct sum of vector spaces and modules, by the free product of groups and by the disjoint union of sets.\nFurther examples.\nPosets.\nEvery partially ordered set can be viewed as a category (where the elements of the poset become the category's objects and we have a single morphism from \"x\" to \"y\" if and only if \"x\" \u2264 \"y\"). A pair of adjoint functors between two partially ordered sets is called a Galois connection (or, if it is contravariant, an \"antitone\" Galois connection). See that article for a number of examples: the case of Galois theory of course is a leading one. Any Galois connection gives rise to closure operators and to inverse order-preserving bijections between the corresponding closed elements.\nAs is the case for Galois groups, the real interest lies often in refining a correspondence to a duality (i.e. \"antitone\" order isomorphism). A treatment of Galois theory along these lines by Kaplansky was influential in the recognition of the general structure here.\nThe partial order case collapses the adjunction definitions quite noticeably, but can provide several themes:\nThe role of quantifiers in predicate logics is in forming propositions and also in expressing sophisticated predicates by closing formulas with possibly more variables. For example, consider a predicate formula_173 with two open variables of sort formula_54 and formula_63. Using a quantifier to close formula_54, we can form the set\nformula_177\nof all elements formula_178 of formula_63 for which there is an formula_180 to which it is formula_173-related, and which itself is characterized by the property formula_182. Set theoretic operations like the intersection formula_183 of two sets directly corresponds to the conjunction formula_184 of predicates. In categorical logic, a subfield of topos theory, quantifiers are identified with adjoints to the pullback functor. Such a realization can be seen in analogy to the discussion of propositional logic using set theory but the general definition make for a richer range of logics.\nSo consider an object formula_63 in a category with pullbacks. Any morphism formula_186 induces a functor \nformula_187 \non the category that is the preorder of subobjects. It maps subobjects formula_50 of formula_63 (technically: monomorphism classes of formula_190) to the pullback formula_191. If this functor has a left- or right adjoint, they are called formula_192 and formula_193, respectively. They both map from formula_194 back to formula_195. Very roughly, given a domain formula_196 to quantify a relation expressed via formula_33 over, the functor/quantifier closes formula_54 in formula_191 and returns the thereby specified subset of formula_63.\n Example: In formula_201, the category of sets and functions, the canonical subobjects are the subset (or rather their canonical injections). The pullback formula_202 of an injection of a subset formula_50 into formula_63 along formula_33 is characterized as the largest set which knows all about formula_33 and the injection of formula_50 into formula_63. It therefore turns out to be (in bijection with) the inverse image formula_209.\nFor formula_210, let us figure out the left adjoint, which is defined via\nformula_211\nwhich here just means\nformula_212.\nConsider formula_213. We see formula_214. Conversely, If for an formula_215 we also have formula_216, then clearly formula_217. So formula_218 implies formula_213. We conclude that left adjoint to the inverse image functor formula_220 is given by the direct image. Here is a characterization of this result, which matches more the logical interpretation: The image of formula_221 under formula_222 is the full set of formula_178's, such that formula_224 is non-empty. This works because it neglects exactly those formula_225 which are in the complement of formula_226. So\nformula_227\nPut this in analogy to our motivation formula_228.\nThe right adjoint to the inverse image functor is given (without doing the computation here) by\nformula_229\n The subset formula_230 of formula_63 is characterized as the full set of formula_178's with the property that the inverse image of formula_233 with respect to formula_33 is fully contained within formula_221. Note how the predicate determining the set is the same as above, except that formula_236 is replaced by formula_237.\n\"See also powerset.\"\nProbability.\nThe twin fact in probability can be understood as an adjunction: that expectation commutes with affine transform, and that the expectation is in some sense the best \"solution\" to the problem of finding a real-valued approximation to a distribution on the real numbers.\nDefine a category based on formula_238, with objects being the real numbers, and the morphisms being \"affine functions evaluated at a point\". That is, for any affine function formula_239 and any real number formula_240, define a morphism formula_241.\nDefine a category based on formula_242, the set of probability distribution on formula_238 with finite expectation. Define morphisms on formula_242 as \"affine functions evaluated at a distribution\". That is, for any affine function formula_239 and any formula_246, define a morphism formula_247.\nThen, the Dirac delta measure defines a functor: formula_248, and the expectation defines another functor formula_249, and they are adjoint: formula_250. (Somewhat disconcertingly, formula_251 is the left adjoint, even though formula_251 is \"forgetful\" and formula_253 is \"free\".)\nAdjunctions in full.\nThere are hence numerous functors and natural transformations associated with every adjunction, and only a small portion is sufficient to determine the rest.\nAn \"adjunction\" between categories \"C\" and \"D\" consists of\nAn equivalent formulation, where \"X\" denotes any object of \"C\" and \"Y\" denotes any object of \"D\", is as follows:\nFor every \"C\"-morphism \"f\" : \"FY\" \u2192 \"X\", there is a unique \"D\"-morphism \u03a6\"Y\", \"X\"(\"f\") = \"g\" : \"Y\" \u2192 \"GX\" such that the diagrams below commute, and for every \"D\"-morphism \"g\" : \"Y\" \u2192 \"GX\", there is a unique \"C\"-morphism \u03a6\u22121\"Y\", \"X\"(\"g\") = \"f\" : \"FY\" \u2192 \"X\" in \"C\" such that the diagrams below commute:\nFrom this assertion, one can recover that:\nformula_254\nformula_255\nIn particular, the equations above allow one to define \u03a6, \u03b5, and \u03b7 in terms of any one of the three. However, the adjoint functors \"F\" and \"G\" alone are in general not sufficient to determine the adjunction. The equivalence of these situations is demonstrated below.\nUniversal morphisms induce hom-set adjunction.\nGiven a right adjoint functor \"G\" : \"C\" \u2192 \"D\"; in the sense of initial morphisms, one may construct the induced hom-set adjunction by doing the following steps.\nA similar argument allows one to construct a hom-set adjunction from the terminal morphisms to a left adjoint functor. (The construction that starts with a right adjoint is slightly more common, since the right adjoint in many adjoint pairs is a trivially defined inclusion or forgetful functor.)\ncounit\u2013unit adjunction induces hom-set adjunction.\nGiven functors \"F\" : \"D\" \u2192 \"C\", \"G\" : \"C\" \u2192 \"D\", and a counit\u2013unit adjunction (\u03b5, \u03b7) : \"F\" &amp;dashv; \"G\", we can construct a hom-set adjunction by finding the natural transformation \u03a6 : hom\"C\"(\"F\"\u2212,\u2212) \u2192 hom\"D\"(\u2212,\"G\"\u2212) in the following steps:\nformula_256\nThe transformations \u03a6 and \u03a8 are natural because \u03b7 and \u03b5 are natural.\nformula_257\nhence \u03a8\u03a6 is the identity transformation.\nformula_258\nhence \u03a6\u03a8 is the identity transformation. Thus \u03a6 is a natural isomorphism with inverse \u03a6\u22121 = \u03a8.\nHom-set adjunction induces all of the above.\nGiven functors \"F\" : \"D\" \u2192 \"C\", \"G\" : \"C\" \u2192 \"D\", and a hom-set adjunction \u03a6 : hom\"C\"(\"F\"\u2212,\u2212) \u2192 hom\"D\"(\u2212,\"G\"\u2212), one can construct a counit\u2013unit adjunction\nformula_136\u00a0,\nwhich defines families of initial and terminal morphisms, in the following steps:\nformula_264\nfor each \"f\": \"FY\" \u2192 \"X\" and \"g\": \"Y\" \u2192 \"GX\" (which completely determine \u03a6).\nformula_265,\nand substituting \"GX\" for \"Y\" and \u03b5X = \u03a6\u22121\"GX, X\"(1\"GX\") for \"f\" in the first formula gives the second counit\u2013unit equation\nformula_266.\nProperties.\nExistence.\nNot every functor \"G\" : \"C\" \u2192 \"D\" admits a left adjoint. If \"C\" is a complete category, then the functors with left adjoints can be characterized by the adjoint functor theorem of Peter J. Freyd: \"G\" has a left adjoint if and only if it is continuous and a certain smallness condition is satisfied: for every object \"Y\" of \"D\" there exists a family of morphisms\n\"f\"\"i\" : \"Y\" \u2192 \"G\"(\"X\"\"i\")\nwhere the indices \"i\" come from a \"set\" I, not a \"proper class\", such that every morphism\n\"h\" : \"Y\" \u2192 \"G\"(\"X\")\ncan be written as\n\"h\" = \"G\"(\"t\") formula_267 \"f\"\"i\"\nfor some \"i\" in I and some morphism\n\"t\" : \"X\"\"i\" \u2192 \"X\" \u2208 \"C\".\nAn analogous statement characterizes those functors with a right adjoint.\nAn important special case is that of locally presentable categories. If formula_268 is a functor between locally presentable categories, then\nUniqueness.\nIf the functor \"F\" : \"D\" \u2192 \"C\" has two right adjoints \"G\" and \"G\u2032\", then \"G\" and \"G\u2032\" are naturally isomorphic. The same is true for left adjoints.\nConversely, if \"F\" is left adjoint to \"G\", and \"G\" is naturally isomorphic to \"G\u2032\" then \"F\" is also left adjoint to \"G\u2032\". More generally, if \u3008\"F\", \"G\", \u03b5, \u03b7\u3009 is an adjunction (with counit\u2013unit (\u03b5,\u03b7)) and\n\u03c3 : \"F\" \u2192 \"F\u2032\"\n\u03c4 : \"G\" \u2192 \"G\u2032\"\nare natural isomorphisms then \u3008\"F\u2032\", \"G\u2032\", \u03b5\u2032, \u03b7\u2032\u3009 is an adjunction where\nformula_269\nHere formula_267 denotes vertical composition of natural transformations, and formula_271 denotes horizontal composition.\nComposition.\nAdjunctions can be composed in a natural fashion. Specifically, if \u3008\"F\", \"G\", \"\u03b5\", \"\u03b7\"\u3009 is an adjunction between \"C\" and \"D\" and \u3008\"F\u2032\", \"G\u2032\", \"\u03b5\u2032\", \"\u03b7\u2032\"\u3009 is an adjunction between \"D\" and \"E\" then the functor\nformula_272\nis left adjoint to\nformula_273\nMore precisely, there is an adjunction between \"F F\u2032\" and \"G\u2032 G\" with unit and counit given respectively by the compositions:\nformula_274\nThis new adjunction is called the composition of the two given adjunctions.\nSince there is also a natural way to define an identity adjunction between a category \"C\" and itself, one can then form a category whose objects are all small categories and whose morphisms are adjunctions.\nLimit preservation.\nThe most important property of adjoints is their continuity: every functor that has a left adjoint (and therefore \"is\" a right adjoint) is \"continuous\" (i.e. commutes with limits in the category theoretical sense); every functor that has a right adjoint (and therefore \"is\" a left adjoint) is \"cocontinuous\" (i.e. commutes with colimits).\nSince many common constructions in mathematics are limits or colimits, this provides a wealth of information. For example:\nAdditivity.\nIf \"C\" and \"D\" are preadditive categories and \"F\" : \"D\" \u2192 \"C\" is an additive functor with a right adjoint \"G\" : \"C\" \u2192 \"D\", then \"G\" is also an additive functor and the hom-set bijections\nformula_275\nare, in fact, isomorphisms of abelian groups. Dually, if \"G\" is additive with a left adjoint \"F\", then \"F\" is also additive.\nMoreover, if both \"C\" and \"D\" are additive categories (i.e. preadditive categories with all finite biproducts), then any pair of adjoint functors between them are automatically additive.\nRelationships.\nUniversal constructions.\nAs stated earlier, an adjunction between categories \"C\" and \"D\" gives rise to a family of universal morphisms, one for each object in \"C\" and one for each object in \"D\". Conversely, if there exists a universal morphism to a functor \"G\" : \"C\" \u2192 \"D\" from every object of \"D\", then \"G\" has a left adjoint.\nHowever, universal constructions are more general than adjoint functors: a universal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to an adjoint pair if and only if this problem has a solution for every object of \"D\" (equivalently, every object of \"C\").\nEquivalences of categories.\nIf a functor \"F\" : \"D\" \u2192 \"C\" is one half of an equivalence of categories then it is the left adjoint in an adjoint equivalence of categories, i.e. an adjunction whose unit and counit are isomorphisms.\nEvery adjunction \u3008\"F\", \"G\", \u03b5, \u03b7\u3009 extends an equivalence of certain subcategories. Define \"C\"1 as the full subcategory of \"C\" consisting of those objects \"X\" of \"C\" for which \u03b5\"X\" is an isomorphism, and define \"D\"1 as the full subcategory of \"D\" consisting of those objects \"Y\" of \"D\" for which \u03b7\"Y\" is an isomorphism. Then \"F\" and \"G\" can be restricted to \"D\"1 and \"C\"1 and yield inverse equivalences of these subcategories.\nIn a sense, then, adjoints are \"generalized\" inverses. Note however that a right inverse of \"F\" (i.e. a functor \"G\" such that \"FG\" is naturally isomorphic to 1\"D\") need not be a right (or left) adjoint of \"F\". Adjoints generalize \"two-sided\" inverses.\nMonads.\nEvery adjunction \u3008\"F\", \"G\", \u03b5, \u03b7\u3009 gives rise to an associated monad \u3008\"T\", \u03b7, \u03bc\u3009 in the category \"D\". The functor\nformula_276\nis given by \"T\" = \"GF\". The unit of the monad\nformula_277\nis just the unit \u03b7 of the adjunction and the multiplication transformation\nformula_278\nis given by \u03bc = \"G\"\u03b5\"F\". Dually, the triple \u3008\"FG\", \u03b5, \"F\"\u03b7\"G\"\u3009 defines a comonad in \"C\".\nEvery monad arises from some adjunction\u2014in fact, typically from many adjunctions\u2014in the above fashion. Two constructions, called the category of Eilenberg\u2013Moore algebras and the Kleisli category are two extremal solutions to the problem of constructing an adjunction that gives rise to a given monad.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53993", "revid": "2", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53993", "title": "Sylow theorems", "text": "Theorems that help decompose a finite group based on prime factors of its order\nIn mathematics, specifically in the field of finite group theory, the Sylow theorems are a collection of theorems named after the Norwegian mathematician Peter Ludwig Sylow that give detailed information about the number of subgroups of fixed order that a given finite group contains. The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the classification of finite simple groups.\nFor a prime number formula_1, a \"p\"-group is a group whose cardinality is a power of formula_2 or equivalently, the order of each group element is some power of formula_1. A Sylow \"p\"-subgroup (sometimes \"p\"-Sylow subgroup) of a finite group formula_4 is a maximal formula_1-subgroup of formula_4, i.e., a subgroup of formula_4 that is a \"p\"-group and is not a proper subgroup of any other formula_1-subgroup of formula_4. The set of all Sylow formula_1-subgroups for a given prime formula_1 is sometimes written formula_12.\nThe Sylow theorems assert a partial converse to Lagrange's theorem. Lagrange's theorem states that for any finite group formula_4 the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of formula_4 divides the order of formula_4. The Sylow theorems state that for every prime factor \"formula_1\" of the order of a finite group formula_4, there exists a Sylow formula_1-subgroup of formula_4 of order formula_20, the highest power of formula_1 that divides the order of formula_4. Moreover, every subgroup of order \"formula_20\" is a Sylow \"formula_1\"-subgroup of formula_4, and the Sylow formula_1-subgroups of a group (for a given prime formula_1) are conjugate to each other. Furthermore, the number of Sylow formula_1-subgroups of a group for a given prime formula_1 is congruent to 1 (mod formula_1).\nTheorems.\nMotivation.\nThe Sylow theorems are a powerful statement about the structure of groups in general, but are also powerful in applications of finite group theory. This is because they give a method for using the prime decomposition of the cardinality of a finite group formula_4 to give statements about the structure of its subgroups: essentially, it gives a technique to transport basic number-theoretic information about a group to its group structure. From this observation, classifying finite groups becomes a game of finding which combinations/constructions of groups of smaller order can be applied to construct a group. For example, a typical application of these theorems is in the classification of finite groups of some fixed cardinality, e.g. formula_32.\nStatement.\nCollections of subgroups that are each maximal in one sense or another are common in group theory. The surprising result here is that in the case of formula_33, all members are actually isomorphic to each other and have the largest possible order: if formula_34 with formula_35 where p does not divide m, then every Sylow p-subgroup P has order formula_36. That is, P is a p-group and formula_37. These properties can be exploited to further analyze the structure of G.\nThe following theorems were first proposed and proven by Ludwig Sylow in 1872, and published in \"Mathematische Annalen\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe following weaker version of theorem 1 was first proved by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and is known as Cauchy's theorem.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u00a0(3)\u2014G:N_G(P)\nConsequences.\nIf formula_38is any prime power dividing the order of formula_4, then there exists a subgroup of formula_4 of order formula_38. This is easily shown to be true for \"p\"-groups, and the first Sylow theorem guarantees the existence of a large enough \"p-\"subgroup of formula_4.\nThe Sylow theorems imply that for a prime number formula_1 all Sylow formula_1-subgroups of formula_4 have the same order, formula_20, the highest power of \"formula_1\" dividing the order of formula_4. Conversely, all subgroups of order formula_20are Sylow formula_1-subgroup, and so they are all conjugate to each other. Further, due to the maximality condition, any formula_1-subgroup of formula_4 is subgroup of a formula_1-subgroup of formula_4 of order formula_20.\nAn important consequence of Theorem 2 is that the condition formula_56 is equivalent to the condition that the Sylow formula_1-subgroup of formula_4 is a normal subgroup (Theorem 3 can often be used to show formula_56). However, there are groups that have proper, non-trivial normal subgroups but no normal Sylow subgroups, such as formula_60. Groups that are of prime-power order have no proper Sylow formula_1-subgroups.\nThe third bullet point of the third theorem has as an immediate consequence that formula_62 divides formula_63.\nSylow theorems for infinite groups.\nThere is an analogue of the Sylow theorems for infinite groups. One defines a Sylow p-subgroup in an infinite group to be a \"p\"-subgroup (that is, every element in it has p-power order) that is maximal for inclusion among all p-subgroups in the group. Let formula_64 denote the set of conjugates of a subgroup formula_65.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u2014\\operatorname{Cl}(K)\nExamples.\nA simple illustration of Sylow subgroups and the Sylow theorems are the dihedral group of the \"n\"-gon, \"D\"2\"n\". For \"n\" odd, 2 = 21 is the highest power of 2 dividing the order, and thus subgroups of order 2 are Sylow subgroups. These are the groups generated by a reflection, of which there are \"n\", and they are all conjugate under rotations; geometrically the axes of symmetry pass through a vertex and a side.\nBy contrast, if \"n\" is even, then 4 divides the order of the group, and the subgroups of order 2 are no longer Sylow subgroups, and in fact they fall into two conjugacy classes, geometrically according to whether they pass through two vertices or two faces. These are related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation through \u03c0/\"n\", half the minimal rotation in the dihedral group.\nAnother example are the Sylow p-subgroups of \"GL\"2(\"F\"\"q\"), where \"p\" and \"q\" are primes\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 and \"p\"\u00a0\u2261\u00a01\u00a0(mod\u00a0\"q\") , which are all abelian. The order of \"GL\"2(\"F\"\"q\") is (\"q\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)(\"q\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"q\") = (\"q\")(\"q\"\u00a0+\u00a01)(\"q\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)2. Since \"q\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"p\"\"n\"\"m\"\u00a0+\u00a01, the order of \"GL\"2(\"F\"\"q\") =\u00a0\"p\"2\"n\" \"m\"\u2032. Thus by Theorem\u00a01, the order of the Sylow \"p\"-subgroups is \"p\"2\"n\".\nOne such subgroup \"P\", is the set of diagonal matrices formula_66, \"x\" is any primitive root of \"F\"\"q\". Since the order of \"F\"\"q\" is \"q\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, its primitive roots have order \"q\" \u2212 1, which implies that \"x\"(\"q\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)/\"p\"\"n\" or \"x\"\"m\" and all its powers have an order which is a power of\u00a0\"p\". So, \"P\" is a subgroup where all its elements have orders which are powers of\u00a0\"p\". There are \"pn\" choices for both \"a\" and \"b\", making |\"P\"| =\u00a0\"p\"2\"n\". This means \"P\" is a Sylow \"p\"-subgroup, which is abelian, as all diagonal matrices commute, and because Theorem 2 states that all Sylow \"p\"-subgroups are conjugate to each other, the Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of \"GL\"2(\"F\"\"q\") are all abelian.\nExample applications.\nSince Sylow's theorem ensures the existence of p-subgroups of a finite group, it is worthwhile to study groups of prime power order more closely. Most of the examples use Sylow's theorem to prove that a group of a particular order is not simple. For groups of small order, the congruence condition of Sylow's theorem is often sufficient to force the existence of a normal subgroup. Burnside's \"pa qb\" theorem states that if the order of a group is the product of one or two prime powers, then it is solvable, hence not not simple (except if it is cyclic of prime order). \nCyclic group orders.\nSome non-prime numbers \"n\" are such that every group of order \"n\" is cyclic. One can show that \"n\" = 15 is such a number using the Sylow theorems: Let \"G\" be a group of order 15 = 3 \u00b7 5 and \"n\"3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. Then \"n\"3 formula_67 5 and \"n\"3 \u2261 1 (mod 3). The only value satisfying these constraints is 1; therefore, there is only one subgroup of order 3, and it must be normal (since it has no distinct conjugates). Similarly, \"n\"5 must divide 3, and \"n\"5 must equal 1 (mod 5); thus it must also have a single normal subgroup of order 5. Since 3 and 5 are coprime, the intersection of these two subgroups is trivial, and so \"G\" must be the internal direct product of groups of order 3 and 5, that is the cyclic group of order 15. Thus, there is only one group of order 15 (up to isomorphism). \nMore generally, one can show with a similar argument that if \"n\" = \"pq\", where \"p\" and \"q\" are distinct prime numbers such that \"p\" does not divide \"q-1\", then every group of order \"n\" is cyclic. The condition of \"p\" not dividing \"q-1\" is necessary: as an example, the dihedral group \"D\"p, where \"p\" is an odd prime, has order \"2p\" but is not cyclic.\nSmall groups are not simple.\nA more complicated application is to find the order of the smallest simple group that is not cyclic. Burnside's \"pa qb\" theorem rules out every group up to order 30 \n 2 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 5.\nIf |\"G\"| = 30 and \"G\" were simple, then \"n\"3 &gt; 1 to avoid a normal 3-subgroup, and \"n\"3 must both divide 10 = 2 \u00b7 5 and equal 1 (mod 3), hence \"n\"3 = 10. The group then has 10 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 3, each with 2 elements of order 3. This means \"G\" has at least 20 distinct elements of order 3. Similarly, \"n\"5 = 6, since \"n\"5 &gt; 1 must divide 6 = 2 \u00b7 3, and \"n\"5 must equal 1 (mod 5). Thus \"G\" also has 24 distinct elements of order 5. But the order of \"G\" is only 30, so a simple group of order 30 cannot exist.\nNext suppose |\"G\"| = 42 = 2 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 7 and \"G\" were simple. Here \"n\"7 &gt; 1 must divide 6 = 2 \u00b7 3 and \"n\"7 must equal 1 (mod 7), which is impossible.\nOn the other hand, if |\"G\"| = 60 = 22 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 5, then \"n\"3 = 10 and \"n\"5 = 6 is perfectly possible. In fact, the smallest simple non-cyclic group is \"A\"5, the alternating group over 5 elements. It has order 60, and has 24 cyclic permutations of order 5, and 20 of order 3. In fact, if |\"G\"| = 60 and \"n\"5 &gt; 1, then G is simple.\nWilson's theorem.\nPart of Wilson's theorem states that\nformula_68\nfor every prime \"p\". One may easily prove this theorem by Sylow's third theorem. Indeed, \nobserve that the number \"np\" of Sylow's \"p\"-subgroups \nin the symmetric group \"Sp\" is times the number of p-cycles in \"Sp\", ie. (\"p\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02)!. On the other hand, \"n\"\"p\" \u2261 1 (mod\u00a0\"p\"). Hence, (\"p\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02)! \u2261 1 (mod\u00a0\"p\"). So, (\"p\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)! \u2261 \u22121 (mod\u00a0\"p\").\nFusion results.\nFrattini's argument shows that a Sylow subgroup of a normal subgroup provides a factorization of a finite group. A slight generalization known as Burnside's fusion theorem states that if \"G\" is a finite group with Sylow \"p\"-subgroup \"P\" and two subsets \"A\" and \"B\" normalized by \"P\", then \"A\" and \"B\" are \"G\"-conjugate if and only if they are \"NG\"(\"P\")-conjugate. The proof is a simple application of Sylow's theorem: If \"B\"=\"Ag\", then the normalizer of \"B\" contains not only \"P\" but also \"Pg\" (since \"Pg\" is contained in the normalizer of \"Ag\"). By Sylow's theorem \"P\" and \"Pg\" are conjugate not only in \"G\", but in the normalizer of \"B\". Hence \"gh\"\u22121 normalizes \"P\" for some \"h\" that normalizes \"B\", and then \"A\"\"gh\"\u22121 = \"B\"h\u22121 = \"B\", so that \"A\" and \"B\" are \"NG\"(\"P\")-conjugate. Burnside's fusion theorem can be used to give a more powerful factorization called a semidirect product: if \"G\" is a finite group whose Sylow \"p\"-subgroup \"P\" is contained in the center of its normalizer, then \"G\" has a normal subgroup \"K\" of order coprime to \"P\", \"G\" = \"PK\" and \"P\"\u2229\"K\" = {1}, that is, \"G\" is \"p\"-nilpotent.\nLess trivial applications of the Sylow theorems include the focal subgroup theorem, which studies the control a Sylow \"p\"-subgroup of the derived subgroup has on the structure of the entire group. This control is exploited at several stages of the classification of finite simple groups, and for instance defines the case divisions used in the Alperin\u2013Brauer\u2013Gorenstein theorem classifying finite simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroup is a quasi-dihedral group. These rely on J. L. Alperin's strengthening of the conjugacy portion of Sylow's theorem to control what sorts of elements are used in the conjugation.\nProof of the Sylow theorems.\nThe Sylow theorems have been proved in a number of ways, and the history of the proofs themselves is the subject of many papers, including Waterhouse, Scharlau, Casadio and Zappa, Gow, and to some extent Meo.\nOne proof of the Sylow theorems exploits the notion of group action in various creative ways. The group G acts on itself or on the set of its \"p\"-subgroups in various ways, and each such action can be exploited to prove one of the Sylow theorems. The following proofs are based on combinatorial arguments of Wielandt. In the following, we use formula_69 as notation for \"a divides b\" and formula_70 for the negation of this statement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nG\u00a0(1)\u2014&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by a prime power \"pk\" has a subgroup of order \"pk\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\n\\Omega\nand no power of \"p\" remains in any of the factors inside the product on the right.

In particular, all Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other (and therefore isomorphic), that is, if \"H\" and \"K\" are Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of G, then there exists an element \"g\" in G with \"g\"\u22121\"Hg\" = \"K\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\n\\Omega_0\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u00a0(3)\u2014 Let \"q\" denote the order of any Sylow \"p\"-subgroup \"P\" of a finite group G. Let \"np\" denote the number of Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of G. Then (a) \"np\" = [G : \"NG\"(\"P\")] (where \"NG\"(\"P\") is the normalizer of \"P\"), (b) \"np\" divides |\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0|/\"q\", and (c) \"np\" \u2261 1 (mod\u00a0\"p\").\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\nLet \u03a9 be the set of all Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of G and let G act on \u03a9 by conjugation. Let \"P\" \u2208 \u03a9 be a Sylow \"p\"-subgroup. By Theorem 2, the orbit of \"P\" has size \"np\", so by the orbit-stabilizer theorem \"np\" = [G : G\"P\"]. For this group action, the stabilizer G\"P\" is given by {g \u2208 G | \"gPg\"\u22121 = \"P\"} = \"N\"G(\"P\"), the normalizer of \"P\" in G. Thus, \"np\" = [G : \"NG\"(\"P\")], and it follows that this number is a divisor of [G : \"P\"] = |\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0|/\"q\".\nNow let \"P\" act on \u03a9 by conjugation, and again let \u03a90 denote the set of fixed points of this action. Let \"Q\" \u2208 \u03a90 and observe that then \"Q\" = \"xQx\"\u22121 for all \"x\" \u2208 \"P\" so that \"P\" \u2264 \"NG\"(\"Q\"). By Theorem 2, \"P\" and \"Q\" are conjugate in \"NG\"(\"Q\") in particular, and \"Q\" is normal in \"NG\"(\"Q\"), so then \"P\" = \"Q\". It follows that \u03a90 = {\"P\"} so that, by the Lemma, |\u03a9| \u2261 |\u03a90| = 1 (mod\u00a0\"p\").\nAlgorithms.\nThe problem of finding a Sylow subgroup of a given group is an important problem in computational group theory.\nOne proof of the existence of Sylow \"p\"-subgroups is constructive: if \"H\" is a \"p\"-subgroup of \"G\" and the index [\"G\":\"H\"] is divisible by \"p\", then the normalizer \"N\" = \"NG\"(\"H\") of \"H\" in \"G\" is also such that [\"N\" : \"H\"] is divisible by \"p\". In other words, a polycyclic generating system of a Sylow \"p\"-subgroup can be found by starting from any \"p\"-subgroup \"H\" (including the identity) and taking elements of \"p\"-power order contained in the normalizer of \"H\" but not in \"H\" itself. The algorithmic version of this (and many improvements) is described in textbook form in Butler, including the algorithm described in Cannon. These versions are still used in the GAP computer algebra system.\nIn permutation groups, it has been proven, in Kantor and Kantor and Taylor, that a Sylow \"p\"-subgroup and its normalizer can be found in polynomial time of the input (the degree of the group times the number of generators). These algorithms are described in textbook form in Seress, and are now becoming practical as the constructive recognition of finite simple groups becomes a reality. In particular, versions of this algorithm are used in the Magma computer algebra system.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Scientists in this field conduct research concerned with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis, as well as how these interactions are regulated. A great variety of techniques are used to answer these questions.\nBiophysics covers all scales of biological organization, from molecular to organismic and populations. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, molecular biology, physical chemistry, physiology, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology, biomechanics, developmental biology and systems biology.\nFluorescent imaging techniques, as well as electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and small-angle scattering (SAS).\nSmall-angle X-ray scattering and small-angle neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) are often used to visualize structures of biological significance. Protein dynamics can be observed by neutron spin echo spectroscopy. Conformational changes in structure can be measured using techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry, circular dichroism, SAXS and SANS. Direct manipulation of molecules using optical tweezers or AFM, can also be used to monitor biological events where forces and distances are at the nanoscale. Molecular biophysicists often consider complex biological events as systems of interacting entities which can be understood e.g. through statistical mechanics, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. By drawing knowledge and experimental techniques from a wide variety of disciplines, biophysicists are often able to directly observe, model or even manipulate the structures and interactions of individual molecules or complexes of molecules.\nMedical physics, a branch of biophysics, is any application of physics to medicine or healthcare, ranging from radiology to microscopy and nanomedicine. For example, physicist Richard Feynman theorized about the future of nanomedicine. He wrote about the idea of a \"medical\" use for biological machines (see nanomachines). Feynman and Albert Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"swallow the doctor\". The idea was discussed in Feynman's 1959 essay \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\".\nThe term \"biophysics\" is also regularly used in academia to indicate the study of the physical quantities (e.g. electric current, temperature, stress, entropy) in biological systems. Other biological sciences also perform research on the biophysical properties of living organisms including molecular biology, cell biology, chemical biology, and biochemistry.\nIn addition to traditional (i.e. molecular and cellular) biophysical topics like structural biology or enzyme kinetics, modern biophysics encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of research, from bioelectronics to quantum biology involving both experimental and theoretical tools. It is becoming increasingly common for biophysicists to apply the models and experimental techniques derived from physics, as well as mathematics and statistics, to larger systems such as tissues, organs, populations and ecosystems. Biophysical models are used extensively in the study of electrical conduction in single neurons, as well as neural circuit analysis in both tissue and whole brain.\nHistory.\nThe studies of Luigi Galvani (1737\u20131798) laid groundwork for the later field of biophysics. Some of the earlier studies in biophysics were conducted in the 1840s by a group known as the Berlin school of physiologists. Among its members were pioneers such as Hermann von Helmholtz, Ernst Heinrich Weber, Carl F. W. Ludwig, and Johannes Peter M\u00fcller. \nThe term \"biophysics\" was originally introduced by Karl Pearson in 1892. \nWilliam T. Bovie (1882\u20131958) is credited as a leader of the field's further development in the mid-20th century. He was a leader in developing electrosurgery.\nThe popularity of the field rose when the book \"What Is Life?\" by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was published. Since 1957, biophysicists have organized themselves into the Biophysical Society which now has about 9,000 members over the world.\nSome authors such as Robert Rosen criticize biophysics on the ground that the biophysical method does not take into account the specificity of biological phenomena.\nFocus as a subfield.\nWhile some colleges and universities have dedicated departments of biophysics, usually at the graduate level, many do not have university-level biophysics departments, instead having groups in related departments such as biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, molecular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, physics, and physiology. Depending on the strengths of a department at a university differing emphasis will be given to fields of biophysics. What follows is a list of examples of how each department applies its efforts toward the study of biophysics. This list is hardly all inclusive. Nor does each subject of study belong exclusively to any particular department. Each academic institution makes its own rules and there is much overlap between departments.\nMany biophysical techniques are unique to this field. Research efforts in biophysics are often initiated by scientists who were biologists, chemists or physicists by training.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
