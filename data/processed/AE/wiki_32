Reservoirs of such compound mixtures, such as coal, petroleum and natural gas, can be extracted and burnt as fuel for human consumption to provide energy for direct use (such as for cooking, heating or lighting), to power heat engines (such as steam or internal combustion engines) that can propel vehicles, or to generate electricity via steam turbine generators. Some fossil fuels are further refined into derivatives such as kerosene, gasoline and diesel, or converted into petrochemicals such as polyolefins (plastics), aromatics and synthetic resins.\nThe origin of fossil fuels is the anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms. The conversion from these organic materials to high-carbon fossil fuels is typically the result of a geological process of millions of years. Due to the length of time it takes for them to form, fossil fuels are considered non-renewable resources.\nIn 2023, 77% of primary energy consumption in the world and over 60% of its electricity supply were from fossil fuels. The large-scale burning of fossil fuels causes serious environmental damage. Over 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions due to human activity in 2022 was carbon dioxide (CO2) released from burning fossil fuels. Natural carbon cycle processes on Earth, mostly absorption by the ocean, can remove only a small part of this, and terrestrial vegetation loss due to deforestation, land degradation and desertification further compounds this deficiency. Therefore, there is a net increase of many billion tonnes of atmospheric CO2 per year. Although methane leaks are significant,52 the burning of fossil fuels is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming and ocean acidification. Additionally, most air pollution deaths are due to fossil fuel particulates and noxious gases, and it is estimated that this costs over 3% of the global gross domestic product and that fossil fuel phase-out will save millions of lives each year.\nRecognition of the climate crisis, pollution and other negative effects caused by fossil fuels has led to a widespread policy transition and activist movement focused on ending their use in favor of renewable and sustainable energy. Because the fossil-fuel industry is so heavily integrated in the global economy and heavily subsidized, this transition is expected to have significant economic consequences. Many stakeholders argue that this change needs to be a just transition and create policy that addresses the societal burdens created by the stranded assets of the fossil fuel industry. International policy, in the form of United Nations' sustainable development goals for affordable and clean energy and climate action, as well as the Paris Climate Agreement, is designed to facilitate this transition at a global level. In 2021, the International Energy Agency concluded that no new fossil fuel extraction projects could be opened if the global economy and society wants to avoid the worst effects of climate change and meet international goals for climate change mitigation.\nOrigin.\nThe theory that fossil fuels formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in Earth's crust over millions of years was first introduced by Andreas Libavius \"in his 1597 Alchemia [Alchymia]\" and later by Mikhail Lomonosov \"as early as 1757 and certainly by 1763\". The first recorded use of the term \"fossil fuel\" occurs in the work of the German chemist Caspar Neumann, in English translation in 1759. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" notes that, in the phrase \"fossil fuel\", the adjective \"fossil\" means \"[o]btained by digging; found buried in the earth\", which dates to at least 1652, before the English noun \"fossil\" came to refer primarily to long-dead organisms in the early 18th century.\nAquatic phytoplankton and zooplankton that died and sedimented in large quantities under anoxic conditions millions of years ago began forming petroleum and natural gas as a result of anaerobic decomposition. Over geological time this organic matter, mixed with mud, became buried under further heavy layers of inorganic sediment. The resulting high temperature and pressure caused the organic matter to chemically alter, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, which is found in oil shales, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis. Despite these heat-driven transformations, the energy released in combustion is still photosynthetic in origin.\nTerrestrial plants tend to form coal and methane. Many of the coal fields date to the Carboniferous period of Earth's history. Terrestrial plants also form , a source of natural gas. Although fossil fuels are continually formed by natural processes, they are classified as non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are generated.\nImportance.\nFossil fuels have been important to human development because they can be readily burned in the open atmosphere to produce heat. The use of peat as a domestic fuel predates recorded history. Coal was burned in some early furnaces for the smelting of metal ore, while semi-solid hydrocarbons from oil seeps were also burned in ancient times, they were mostly used for waterproofing and embalming.\nCommercial exploitation of petroleum began in the 19th century.\nNatural gas, once flared-off as an unneeded byproduct of petroleum production, is now considered a very valuable resource. Natural gas deposits are also the main source of helium.\nHeavy crude oil, which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil, and oil sands, where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, began to become more important as sources of fossil fuel in the early 2000s. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen, a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield synthetic crude oil when heated (pyrolyzed). With additional processing, they can be employed instead of other established fossil fuels. During the 2010s and 2020s there was disinvestment from exploitation of such resources due to their high carbon cost relative to more easily-processed reserves.\nPrior to the latter half of the 18th century, windmills and watermills provided the energy needed for work such as milling flour, sawing wood or pumping water, while burning wood or peat provided domestic heat. The wide-scale use of fossil fuels, coal at first and petroleum later, in steam engines enabled the Industrial Revolution. At the same time, gas lights using natural gas or coal gas were coming into wide use. The invention of the internal combustion engine and its use in automobiles and trucks greatly increased the demand for gasoline and diesel oil, both made from fossil fuels. Other forms of transportation, railways and aircraft, also require fossil fuels. The other major use for fossil fuels is in generating electricity and as feedstock for the petrochemical industry. Tar, a leftover of petroleum extraction, is used in the construction of roads.\nThe energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation. The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth; it has been estimated that almost half of the Earth's population are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use. According to head of a fertilizers commodity price agency, \"50% of the world's food relies on fertilisers.\"\nEnvironmental effects.\nThe burning of fossil fuels has a number of negative externalities\u00a0\u2013 harmful environmental consequences where the effects extend beyond the people using the fuel. These effects vary between different fuels. All fossil fuels release CO2 when they burn, thus accelerating climate change. Burning coal, and to a lesser extent oil and its derivatives, contributes to atmospheric particulate matter, smog and acid rain.\nAir pollution from fossil fuels in 2018 has been estimated to cost US$2.9 trillion, or 3.3% of the global gross domestic product (GDP).\nClimate change is largely driven by the release of greenhouse gases like CO2, and the burning of fossil fuels is the main source of these emissions. In most parts of the world climate change is negatively impacting ecosystems. This includes contributing to the extinction of species and reducing people's ability to produce food, thus adding to the problem of world hunger. Continued rises in global temperatures will lead to further adverse effects on both ecosystems and people; the World Health Organization has said that climate change is the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century.\nCombustion of fossil fuels generates sulfuric and nitric acids, which fall to Earth as acid rain, impacting both natural areas and the built environment. Monuments and sculptures made from marble and limestone are particularly vulnerable, as the acids dissolve calcium carbonate.\nFossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly uranium and thorium, which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 tonnes of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal. It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island accident.\nBurning coal also generates large amounts of bottom ash and fly ash. These materials are used in a wide variety of applications (see Fly ash reuse), utilizing, for example, about 40% of the United States production.\nIn addition to the effects that result from burning, the harvesting, processing, and distribution of fossil fuels also have environmental effects. Coal mining methods, particularly mountaintop removal and strip mining, have negative environmental impacts, and offshore oil drilling poses a hazard to aquatic organisms. Fossil fuel wells can contribute to methane release via fugitive gas emissions. Oil refineries also have negative environmental impacts, including air and water pollution. Coal is sometimes transported by diesel-powered locomotives, while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships, requiring the combustion of additional fossil fuels.\nA variety of mitigating efforts have arisen to counter the negative effects of fossil fuels. This includes a movement to use alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy. Environmental regulation uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions; for example, rules against releasing waste products like fly ash into the atmosphere.\nIn December 2020, the United Nations released a report saying that despite the need to reduce greenhouse emissions, various governments are \"doubling down\" on fossil fuels, in some cases diverting over 50% of their COVID-19 recovery stimulus funding to fossil fuel production rather than to alternative energy. The UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres declared that \"Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back\u00a0\u2013 and it is already doing so with growing force and fury.\" He also claimed there is still cause for hope, anticipating the US plan to join other large emitters like China and the EU in adopting targets to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\nInflation effects.\nFossilflation is a term that describes the impact of fossil fuels on inflation.\nAccording to \"Vox\" in August 2022\",\" \"Economists have pointed to energy prices as the main reason for high inflation\", noting that \"energy prices indirectly affect virtually every part of the economy\". Sectors that raise prices significantly as a result of higher fossil fuel prices include transportation, food, and shipping.\nHistory.\nMark Zandi of \"Moody's\" says that fossil fuel prices have driven every big episode of inflation since WWII.\nThe economic impact of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was a major recent example of fossil fuels causing inflation. Some economists, including Isabel Schnabel, believe that dependence on fossil fuels is the main driver of the 2021\u20132022 inflation spike.\nEfforts to combat fossilflation.\nGernot Wagner argues that commodities are undesirable energy sources because they are susceptible to volatile price swings that technologies like renewable energy are not. He also argues that technologies improve and get relatively cheaper over time. Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, some argued for the possibility of a base effect phenomenon due to cheaper than normal prices, such as for oil, at the onset of the pandemic, followed by above-average prices which exacerbated the perceived inflation.\nInflation Reduction Act.\nWhile not expected to provide much short-term relief, the Inflation Reduction Act seeks to make the United States less dependent on fossil fuels and their ability to cause inflation in the economy. Moody's estimates that by 2030, the bill could reduce the typical American household's spending on energy by more than $300 each year, in 2022 dollars.\nIllness and deaths.\nEnvironmental pollution from fossil fuels impacts humans because particulates and other air pollution from fossil fuel combustion may cause illness and death when inhaled. These health effects include premature death, acute respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. The poor, undernourished, very young and very old, and people with preexisting respiratory disease and other ill health are more at risk. Global air pollution deaths due to fossil fuels have been estimated at over 8 million people (2018, nearly 1 in 5 deaths worldwide) at 10.2 million (2019), and 5.13 million excess deaths from ambient air pollution from fossil fuel use (2023).\nWhile all energy sources inherently have adverse effects, the data show that fossil fuels cause the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions and are the most dangerous for human health. In contrast, modern renewable energy sources appear to be safer for human health and cleaner. The death rates from accidents and air pollution in the EU are as follows per terawatt-hour (TWh):\n As the data shows, coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass cause higher death rates and higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions than hydropower, nuclear energy, wind, and solar power. Scientists propose that 1.8 million lives have been saved by replacing fossil fuel sources with nuclear power.\nIndustrial sector.\nIn 2019, Saudi Aramco was listed and it reached a US$2 trillion valuation on its second day of trading, after the world's largest initial public offering.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48147", "revid": "42536815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48147", "title": "Art rock", "text": "Subgenre of rock music\nArt rock is a subgenre of rock music that aims to separate the genre from popular entertainment, with the term typically being applied as the middle ground between mainstream and experimental rock. Art rock primarily draws influences from the wider art world and academia which includes contemporary art, art music, avant-garde art, experimental music, avant-garde music, alongside classical music and jazz.\nCritics have defined art rock as a \"rejection\" of rock music intended solely for the purpose of popular entertainment or dancing. The term was closely associated with a specific period beginning in 1966\u201367, which became influential to the development of progressive rock.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nCritic John Rockwell described the term art rock as referring to wide-ranging and eclectic tendencies in rock music. In the rock music of the 1970s, the application of the \"art\" descriptor by music critics and journalists was taken derogatorily, understood by musicians and fans as meaning that it was \"aggressively avant-garde\" or \"pretentiously progressive\". \"Art rock\" is often used synonymously with progressive rock. Historically, the term has been used to describe at least two related, but distinct, types of rock music. The first is progressive rock, while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favour of a modernist, avant-garde approach defined by the Velvet Underground. Essayist Ellen Willis compared these two types:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From the early sixties ... there was a counter-tradition in rock and roll that had much more in common with high art\u2014in particular avant-garde art\u2014than the ballyhooed art-rock synthesis [progressive rock]; it involved more or less consciously using the basic formal canons of rock and roll as material (much as pop artists used mass art in general) and refining, elaborating, playing off that material to produce ... rockand-roll art. While art rock was implicitly based on the claim that rock and roll was or could be as worthy as more established art forms, rock-and-roll art came out of an obsessive commitment to the language of rock and roll and an equally obsessive disdain for those who rejected that language or wanted it watered down, made easier ... the new wave has inherited the counter-tradition.\nArt rock has been described as emphasizing Romantic and autonomous traditions, in distinction to the aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable embodied by art pop. Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman's \"American Popular Music\" defines art rock as a \"form of rock music that blended elements of rock and European classical music\", citing the English progressive rock bands King Crimson, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, and Pink Floyd as examples. Common characteristics include album-oriented music divided into compositions rather than songs, with usually complicated and long instrumental sections and symphonic orchestration. Its music was traditionally used within the context of concept records, and its lyrical themes tended to be \"imaginative\" and politically oriented. Art rock has also been noted for frequently intertwining with \"serious music\".\nArt rock has been described as \"more challenging, noisy and unconventional\" and \"less classically influenced\", with more of an emphasis on avant-garde music, depending on what was considered \"avant-garde\" at the time of the term's use. Similarities between it and progressive rock are that they both describe a mostly British attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility, and became the instrumental analogue to concept albums and rock operas, which were typically more vocal oriented.\nArt rock can also refer to either classically driven rock, or to a progressive rock-folk fusion. Bruce Eder's essay \"The Early History of Art-Rock/Prog Rock\" states that \"'progressive rock,' also sometimes known as 'art rock,' or 'classical rock'\" is music in which the \"bands [are] playing suites, not songs; borrowing riffs from Bach, Beethoven, and Wagner instead of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley; and using language closer to William Blake or T. S. Eliot than to Carl Perkins or Willie Dixon.\"\nHistory.\n1960s.\nBackground.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the late sixties and early seventies, rock both co-opted and challenged the prevailing view of musical art, often at the same time. This is evident in a diverse body of music that includes the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\" and the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper\"; Frank Zappa's \"Freak Out\" ... the Who's rock opera \"Tommy\"; Pink Floyd's technologically advanced concept album \"Dark Side of the Moon\"; and Miles Davis's jazz/rock fusion.\n\u2014Michael Campbell, \"Popular Music in America\", 2012\nIn the academic perspective of music critics, such as those for \"The New York Times\", high art and pop music increasingly engaged with each other throughout the second half of the 20th century. The first usage of the term \"art rock\", according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, was in 1968. As pop music's dominant format transitioned from singles to albums, many rock bands created works that aspired to make grand artistic statements, where art rock would flourish. As it progressed in the late 1960s \u2013 in tandem with the development of progressive rock \u2013 art rock acquired notoriety alongside experimental rock.\nProponents.\nThe earliest figure of art rock has been assumed to be record producer and songwriter Phil Spector, who became known as an auteur for his Wall of Sound productions that aspired to a \"classical grandiosity\". According to biographer Richard Williams, \"[Spector] created a new concept: the producer as the overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label.\" Williams also says that Spector transformed rock music from a performing art into an art that could only exist in the recording studio, which \"paved the way for art rock\".\nThe Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is also cited as one of the first examples of the auteur music producer. Like Spector, Wilson was known as a reclusive studio obsessive who laboriously produced fantastical soundscapes through his mastery of recording technology. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that Wilson was the forerunner of \"a new kind of art-rock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music\". Drawing from the influence of Wilson's work and the work of the Beatles' producer George Martin, music producers after the mid-1960s began to view the recording studio as a musical instrument used to aid the process of composition. Critic Stephen Holden says that mid-1960s recordings by the Beatles, Spector and Wilson are often identified as marking the start of art pop, which preceded the \"bombastic, classically inflected\" art rock that started in the late 1960s.\nMany of the top British groups during the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 including members of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who, 10cc, the Move, the Yardbirds and Pink Floyd \u2013 came to music via art school. This institution differed from its US counterpart in terms of having a less industry-applicable syllabus and in its focus on furthering eccentric talent. By the mid-1960s, several of these acts espoused an approach based on art and originality, where previously they had been absorbed solely in authentic interpretation of US-derived musical styles, such as rock 'n' roll and R&amp;B.\nAccording to journalist Richard Goldstein, many popular musicians from California (like Wilson) desired to be acknowledged as artists, and struggled with this aspiration. Goldstein says that the line between violating musical conventions and making \"truly popular music\" caused those who lacked self-confidence (in contrast to Bob Dylan and the Beatles) to be \"doomed to a respectful rejection, and a few albums with disappointing sales usually meant silence. ... They yearned for fame, as only needy people can, but they also wanted to make art, and when both of those impulses couldn't be achieved they recoiled in a ball of frantic confusion.\"\nAuthor Matthew Bannister traces \"the more self-conscious, camp aesthetic of art rock\" to pop artist Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, who emulated Warhol's art/pop synthesis. Accordingly, \"Warhol took Spector's combination of the disembodiment, 'distance' and refinement of high culture with the 'immediacy' of mass cultural forms like rock and roll several stages further ... But Warhol's aesthetic was more thoroughly worked out than Spector's, which represented a transitional phase between old-fashioned auteurism and the thoroughly postmodern, detached tenets of pop art. ... Warhol's approach reverberates throughout art rock, most obviously in his stance of distance and disengagement.\"\nInfluential albums.\n1965\u201366.\nIn 1965, Bob Dylan shifted from the folk music of the American folk revival movement, which he had spearheaded in Greenwich Village, towards that of contemporary rock music, a style described by the press as \"folk rock\". This event was met with controversy, though marked the beginning of a sequence of influential albums later dubbed the \"Electric Trilogy\": \"Bringing It All Back Home\" (March 1965), \"Highway 61 Revisited\" (August 1965), and later \"Blonde on Blonde\" (June 1966). Writing in 1972, Nat Freedland of \"Billboard\" magazine, stated \"during the golden period of the mid '60s, Bob Dylan and the Beatles led the way to an expansion of rock into an area of art songs with a beat\".\nThe December 1965 release of the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\" has been regarded as signifying a watershed for the form of the pop album. The album garnered recognition for the Beatles as artists from the American mainstream press due to the use of unconventional studio techniques and instruments which were not popular in rock music at the time. Writing in 1968, Gene Sculatti of \"Jazz &amp; Pop\" recognised \"Rubber Soul\" as \"the definitive 'rock as art' album\" and \"the necessary prototype\" that major artists such as the Rolling Stones (with \"Aftermath\") and the Beach Boys had felt compelled to follow.\nAcademic Michael Johnson associates \"the first documented moments of ascension in rock music\" to the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds.\" Released in May 1966, \"Pet Sounds\" came from Wilson's desire to make a \"complete statement\", as he believed the Beatles had previously done with \"Rubber Soul\". In 1978, biographer David Leaf wrote that the album heralded art rock, while according to \"The New York Observer\", \"\"Pet Sounds\" proved that a pop group could make an album-length piece comparable with the greatest long-form works of Bernstein, Copland, Ives, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.\" \"Pet Sounds\" is also noted as the first rock concept album. In 1971, \"Cue\" magazine described the Beach Boys as having been \"among the vanguard\" with regard to art rock, among many other aspects relating to the counterculture, over the period up to late 1967.\nThe period when rock music became most closely aligned with the contemporary art world began in 1966 and continued until the mid-1970s. Jacqueline Edmondson's 2013 encyclopaedia \"Music in American Life\" states that, although it was preceded by earlier examples, Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention's debut album \"Freak Out!\" (June 1966) came to be seen as \"the first successful incorporation of art music in a pop context\". With Los Angeles as his base since the early 1960s, Zappa was able to work in an environment where student radicalism was closely aligned with an active avant-garde scene, a setting that placed the city ahead of other countercultural centres at the time and would continue to inform his music. Writer and pianist Michael Campbell comments that the album \"contains a long noncategorical list of Zappa's influences, from classical avant-garde composers to obscure folk musicians\".\nBy August, the Beatles' \"Revolver\" furthered the rock album-as-art perspective and continued pop music's evolution. Led by the art-rock single \"Eleanor Rigby\", it expanded the genre's scope in terms of the range of musical styles, which included Indian, avant-garde and classical, and the lyrical content of the album, and also in its departure from previous notions of melody and structure in pop songwriting. According to \"Rolling Stone\", \"\"Revolver\" signaled that in popular music, anything \u2013 any theme, any musical idea \u2013 could now be realized.\" As with \"Rubber Soul\", the album inspired many of the progressive rock artists of the 1970s, and each of its songs has been recognised as anticipating a new subgenre or style.\n1967.\n\"Clash Music\" names the Velvet Underground's debut March 1967 album \"The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico\" \"the original art-rock record\". Bannister writes of the Velvet Underground: \"no other band exerted the same grip on the minds of 1970s/1980s art/alternative rock artists, writers and audiences.\" Their influence would recur from the 1970s onwards to various worldwide indie scenes, and in 2006, \"The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico\" was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry, who commented: \"For decades [it] has cast a huge shadow over nearly every sub-variety of avant-garde rock, from 70s art-rock to no-wave, new-wave, and punk.\" However, when the Velvet Underground first appeared in the mid-1960s, they faced rejection and were commonly dismissed as a \"fag\" band. In 1982, musician Brian Eno famously stated that while \"The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico\" initially sold just 30,000 copies, \"everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band.\"\nThe Beatles' Paul McCartney deemed \"Pet Sounds\" \"the record of the time\", and in May 1967, the band responded with their own album: \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", which was influenced by the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\" and Frank Zappa's \"Freak Out!\" AllMusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by \"Sgt. Pepper's\" and believed that for rock music to grow artistically, they should incorporate elements of European and classical music to the genre. Many British groups flowered in the album's wake; those who are listed in \"Music in American Life\" include the Moody Blues, the Strawbs, Genesis, and \"most notably\", Pink Floyd. This has been used, among other connections, to suggest a cohesion between acts described as art rock in the 1960s. The band's bassist, Roger Waters later stated that both \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Pet Sounds\" \"completely changed everything about records\" for him.\n1970s.\nIn 1970, Pink Floyd released \"Atom Heart Mother\", with the 23-minute title track taking up the entire first side of the LP. This experiment with collaborator Ron Geesin yielded the longest unbroken Pink Floyd song on record, a suite divided into six parts, which required the band at times to utilise a choir and brass section on tour. The album was a commercial success, giving the band to its first number one record in the UK. It signalled a shift in their music from the psychedelic forays of their late '60s albums and into a period of renewed creativity in the form of longer and more progressive rock music.\nEnglish band Roxy Music reinvented the sound of art rock, emphasising artistic expression and experimental sounds to push boundaries within pop music. Notably, their use of synthesizers and visual aesthetics, inspired later genres, including synth-pop and new wave.\nEnthusiasm for usage of the term in music criticism and journalism waned in the mid-1970s. From then to the 1990s, art rock was infused within various popular music genres. \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" states that its genre's tendencies were continued by some British and American hard rock and pop rock artists, and that Brian Eno's late 1970s and early 1980s collaborations with David Bowie and Talking Heads are exemplary of \"the successful infusion of art rock tendencies into other popular music genres\". Bowie and Eno collaborated on a series of consecutive albums called the \"Berlin Trilogy\", characterised as an \"art rock trifecta\" by \"Consequence of Sound\", who noted that at the time of their release, \"The experimental records weren't connecting with audiences on the scale Bowie was used to... New Wave had exploded, and a generation of Bowie descendants had taken the stage.\"\nThe then-emerging post-punk and new wave movements were described as art rock, as bands incorporated experimental and avant-garde elements that were hallmarks of art rock. This new form of art rock music was later labelled \"art punk\". Television's landmark debut album \"Marquee Moon\" released in 1977 became an influential contemporary art rock album, with \"Pitchfork\" later stating \"[Television] harnessed the energy you associate with punk, even as they crossed it with art-rock and the poetic urges of frontman Tom Verlaine\". Additionally, Television had initially worked with art rock musician Brian Eno though due to internal conflicts did not hire him to produce their debut album.\n1980s\u20132020s.\nDuring the 1980s, bands such as Talk Talk developed a new style of art rock music that differed from the 1970s style. At the time, many of the original art rock artists of the 1970s had abandoned their experimental sound. Writing in 1981, journalist Roy Trakin stated: \"Of course, these stalwarts can still fill Madison Square Garden and sell a great many records, as they always have, but their days of adventurous risk-taking and musical innovation are long gone \u2013 replaced by the smug satisfaction of commercial success.\"\nDuring the 1990s into the turn of the century, alternative rock bands such as Radiohead and Arcade Fire aimed to create studio-focused albums which merged the sounds of the original art rock era with that of contemporaneous alternative music influences, this sound was indebted to the sound of classic art rock bands like Pink Floyd and David Bowie, with Arcade Fire's 2022 album \"We\" being described as \"an old-fashioned, 1970s-style art-rock album.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Commodity money consists of objects having value or use in themselves (intrinsic value) as well as their value in buying goods.\nThis is in contrast to representative money, which has no intrinsic value but represents something of value such as gold or silver, for which it can be exchanged, and fiat money, which derives its value from having been established as money by government regulation.\nExamples of commodities that have been used as media of exchange include precious metals and stones, grain, animal parts (such as beaver pelts), tobacco, fuel, and others. Sometimes several types of commodity money were used together, with fixed relative values, in various commodity valuation or price system economies.\nAspects.\nCommodity money is to be distinguished from representative money, which is a certificate or token which can be exchanged for the underlying commodity, but only by a formal process. A key feature of commodity money is that the value is directly perceived by its users, who recognize the utility or beauty of the tokens as goods in themselves. Since payment by commodity generally provides a useful good, commodity money is similar to barter, but is distinguishable from it in having a single recognized unit of exchange. Radford (1945) described the establishment of commodity money in P.O.W camps.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;People left their surplus clothing, toilet requisites and food there until they were sold at a fixed price in cigarettes.

Thus the cigarette attained its fullest currency status, and the market was almost completely unified.\nRadford documented the way that this 'cigarette currency' was subject to Gresham's law, inflation, and especially deflation.\nIn another example, in US prisons after smoking was banned circa 2003, commodity money has switched in many places to containers of mackerel fish fillets, which have a fairly standard cost (typically $1 per tin), have a long shelf-life, are easy to store and are popular as food for their high protein content. These may be exchanged for many services in prisons where currency is prohibited.\nMetals.\nIn metallic currencies, a government mint will coin money by placing a mark on metal tokens, typically gold or silver, which serves as a guarantee of their weight and purity. In issuing this coinage at a face value higher than its costs, the government gains a profit known as seigniorage.\nThe role of a mint and of coin differs between commodity money and fiat money. In commodity money, the coin retains its value if it is melted and physically altered, while in a fiat money it does not. Usually, in a fiat money the value drops if the coin is converted to metal, but in a few cases the value of metals in fiat moneys have been allowed to rise to values larger than the face value of the coin. In India, for example, fiat rupees disappeared from the market after 2007 when their content of stainless steel became larger than the fiat or face value of the coins. In the US, the metal in pennies (97.5% zinc since 1982, 95% copper in 1982 and before) and nickels (75% copper, 25% nickel) has a value close to, and sometimes exceeding, the fiat face value of the coin.\nHistory.\nCommodities often come into being in situations where other forms of money are not available or not trusted, and these are social norms.\nVarious commodities were used in pre-Revolutionary America including wampum (shell beads), maize (corn), iron nails, beaver pelts, and tobacco.\nIn Canada, where the Hudson's Bay Company and other fur trading companies controlled most of the country, fur traders quickly realized that gold and silver were of no interest to the First Nations. They wanted goods such as metal knives and axes. Rather than use a barter system, the fur traders established the made beaver (representing a single beaver pelt) as the standard currency, and created a price list for goods:\nOther animal furs were convertible into beaver pelts at a standard rate as well, so this created a viable currency in an economy where precious metals were not valued. However, for convenience, Hudson's Bay post managers exchanged made beaver coins, which were stamped pieces of copper or brass.\nLong after gold coins became rare in commerce, the Fort Knox gold repository of the United States functioned as a theoretical backing for Federal Reserve. Between 1933 and 1970 (when the U.S. officially left the gold standard), one U.S. dollar was technically worth exactly 1/35 of a troy ounce (889\u00a0mg) of gold. However, actual trade in gold bullion as a precious metal within the United States was banned after 1933, with the explicit purpose of preventing the \"hoarding\" of private gold during an economic depression period in which maximal circulation of money was desired by government policy. This was a fairly typical transition from commodity to representative to fiat money, with people trading in other goods being forced to trade in gold, then to receive paper money that purported to be \"as good as gold,\" and finally a fiat currency backed by government authority and social perceptions of value.\nCigarettes and gasoline were used as a form of commodity money in some parts of Europe, including Germany, France and Belgium, in the immediate aftermath of World War II. They have continued to be used as currency in war-torn locations experiencing inadequate supply of common goods and monetary collapse, such as during the Siege of Sarajevo in 1993 or in Russian-occupied Kherson in 2022.\nFunctions.\nAlthough grains such as barley have been used historically in relations of trade and barter (Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC), they can be inconvenient as a medium of exchange or a standard of deferred payment due to transport and storage concerns and eventual spoilage. Gold or other metals are sometimes used in a price system as a durable, easily warehoused store of value.\nThe use of barter-like methods using commodity money may date back to at least 100,000 years ago. Trading in red ochre is attested in Eswatini, shell jewellery in the form of strung beads also dates back to this period, and had the basic attributes needed of commodity money. To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, before market economies existed, people relied on tradition, top-down command, or community cooperation. Relations of reciprocity, and/or redistribution, substituted for market exchange.\nThe city-states of Sumer developed a trade and market economy based originally on the commodity money of the Shekel, which was a certain weight measure of barley, while the Babylonians and their city-state neighbors later developed the earliest system of economics using a metric of various commodities, that was fixed in a legal code.\nSeveral centuries after the invention of cuneiform script, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to codified amounts of commodity money being used in contract law, such as buying property and paying legal fines.\nLegal tender issues.\nToday, the face value of specie and base-metal coins is set by government fiat, and it is only this value which must be legally accepted as payment for debt, in the jurisdiction of the government which declares the coin to be legal tender. The value of the precious metal in the coin may give it another value, but this varies over time. The value of the metal is subject to bilateral agreement, just as is the case with pure metals or commodities which had not been monetized by any government. As an example, gold and silver coins from other non-U.S. countries are specifically exempted in U.S. law from being legal tender for the payment of debts in the United States, so that a seller who refuses to accept them cannot be sued by the payer who offers them to settle a debt. However, nothing prevents such arrangements from being made if both parties agree on a value for the coins.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is widely considered the greatest checkers player ever. Tinsley was world champion from 1955\u20131958 and 1975\u20131991 and never lost a world championship match. He lost only seven games (two to the Chinook computer program, one in a simultaneous exhibition) from 1950 until his death in 1995. He withdrew from championship play between 1958\u20131975, relinquishing the title during that time. Derek Oldbury, sometimes considered the second-best player of all time, thought Tinsley was \"to checkers what Leonardo da Vinci was to science, what Michelangelo was to art and what Beethoven was to music.\"\nEarly life and education.\nTinsley was born in Ironton, Ohio, but spent his early life in Greenup County. Tinsley was the son of a school teacher and a farmer who became a sheriff. He had a sister and \"felt unloved\" by his parents. To gain the affection of his parents, he competed in math and spelling bees as a child. He said of his parents' disapproval: \"And as a twig is bent, it grows: As I grew up, I still kept feeling that way.\"\nHe skipped four of his first eight grades. He graduated from a Columbus high school at fifteen. Tinsley had a doctorate from Ohio State University in the mathematical discipline of combinatorial analysis. He worked as a professor of mathematics at Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University. Tinsley once claimed to have spent approximately 10,000 hours studying checkers while in graduate school. Tinsley also served as a lay preacher in the Disciples of Christ church.\nCheckers career.\nAfter reading a book by Millard Hopper, Tinsley became interested in the game.\nTinsley enlisted in the Navy in 1945 and was stationed at Gulfport, Mississippi, where he won the Southern Louisiana Open. In 1946, he finished second behind William F. Ryan at the Newark National Tourney, losing the finals 2\u20131\u201311. Tinsley won four Ohio State Opens (1946, 1947, 1948, 1949), six Cedar Point Tourneys (1946, 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1952), and two Canadian Opens (1949 and 1950).\nTinsley was an eight-time three-move world champion (1954, 1955, 1958, 1979, 1981, 1985, 1987 and 1989) and once in two-move checkers (1952).\nHis 1951\u20131995 tournament record, excluding the Chinook games:\nChinook games.\nTinsley retired from championship play in 1991. In August 1992, he defeated the Chinook computer program 4\u20132 (with 33 draws) in a match. Chinook had placed second at the U.S. Nationals in 1990 after Tinsley, which usually qualifies one to compete for the World Championships. However, the American Checkers Federation and the English Draughts Association refused to allow a computer to play for the title. Unable to appeal their decision, Tinsley resigned his title as World Champion and immediately indicated his desire to play against Chinook. The unofficial yet highly publicized match was quickly organized, and Tinsley won.\nIn one game from their match in 1990, Chinook, playing with white pieces, made a mistake on the tenth move. Tinsley remarked, \"You're going to regret that.\" Chinook resigned after move 36, only 26 moves later. The lead programmer Jonathan Schaeffer looked back into the database and discovered that Tinsley picked the only strategy that could have defeated Chinook from that point and Tinsley was able to see the win 64 moves into the future.\nThe ACF and the EDA were placed in the awkward position of naming a new world champion, a title which would be worthless as long as Tinsley was alive. The ACF granted Tinsley the title of World Champion Emeritus as a solution.\nIn August 1994, a second match with Chinook was organized, but Tinsley withdrew after only six games (all draws) for health reasons. Don Lafferty, rated the number two player in the world, replaced Tinsley and fought Chinook to a drawn match at game 20. Tinsley was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a week after the match, and died seven months later.\nDeath.\nTinsley died in Humble, Texas, on April 3, 1995, at the age of 68. He lived in Conyers, Georgia, but was visiting his sister in Texas when he died of cancer. He was survived by a twin sister, Mary Clark, who lives in Humble, Texas, and by two brothers, Ed, of Sarasota, Fla., and Joe, of Thornville, Ohio. He is buried at Greenlawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio, next to his father, Edward H. Tinsley and his mother, Viola Mae Tinsley. His brother, Harold Edward Tinsley is also buried there.\nTelevision appearances.\nIn 1957, Tinsley appeared as a guest challenger on the television game show \"To Tell the Truth\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In other words, \"I\" is a maximal ideal of a ring \"R\" if there are no other ideals contained between \"I\" and \"R\".\nMaximal ideals are important because the quotients of rings by maximal ideals are simple rings, and in the special case of unital commutative rings they are also fields. The set of maximal ideals of a unital commutative ring \"R\", typically equipped with the Zariski topology, is known as the maximal spectrum of \"R\" and is variously denoted m-Spec \"R\", Specm \"R\", MaxSpec \"R\", or Spm \"R\". \nIn noncommutative ring theory, a maximal right ideal is defined analogously as being a maximal element in the poset of proper right ideals, and similarly, a maximal left ideal is defined to be a maximal element of the poset of proper left ideals. Since a one-sided maximal ideal \"A\" is not necessarily two-sided, the quotient \"R\"/\"A\" is not necessarily a ring, but it is a simple module over \"R\". If \"R\" has a unique maximal right ideal, then \"R\" is known as a local ring, and the maximal right ideal is also the unique maximal left and unique maximal two-sided ideal of the ring, and is in fact the Jacobson radical J(\"R\").\nIt is possible for a ring to have a unique maximal two-sided ideal and yet lack unique maximal one-sided ideals: for example, in the ring of 2 by 2 square matrices over a field, the zero ideal is a maximal two-sided ideal, but there are many maximal right ideals.\nDefinition.\nThere are other equivalent ways of expressing the definition of maximal one-sided and maximal two-sided ideals. Given a ring \"R\" and a proper ideal \"I\" of \"R\" (that is \"I\" \u2260 \"R\"), \"I\" is a maximal ideal of \"R\" if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:\nThere is an analogous list for one-sided ideals, for which only the right-hand versions will be given. For a right ideal \"A\" of a ring \"R\", the following conditions are equivalent to \"A\" being a maximal right ideal of \"R\":\nMaximal right/left/two-sided ideals are the dual notion to that of minimal ideals.\nGeneralization.\nFor an \"R\"-module \"A\", a maximal submodule \"M\" of \"A\" is a submodule \"M\" \u2260 \"A\" satisfying the property that for any other submodule \"N\", \"M\" \u2286 \"N\" \u2286 \"A\" implies \"N\" = \"M\" or \"N\" = \"A\". Equivalently, \"M\" is a maximal submodule if and only if the quotient module \"A\"/\"M\" is a simple module. The maximal right ideals of a ring \"R\" are exactly the maximal submodules of the module \"R\"\"R\".\nUnlike rings with unity, a nonzero module does not necessarily have maximal submodules. However, as noted above, \"finitely generated\" nonzero modules have maximal submodules, and also projective modules have maximal submodules.\nAs with rings, one can define the radical of a module using maximal submodules. Furthermore, maximal ideals can be generalized by defining a maximal sub-bimodule \"M\" of a bimodule \"B\" to be a proper sub-bimodule of \"M\" which is contained in no other proper sub-bimodule of \"M\". The maximal ideals of \"R\" are then exactly the maximal sub-bimodules of the bimodule \"R\"\"R\"\"R\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population density was . There were 1,299 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 97.93% White, 0.27% African American, 0.06% Native American, 0.47% Asian, 0.30% from other races, and 0.97% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.36% of the population.\nThere were 1,250 households, out of which 37.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.1% were married couples living together, 10.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.6% were non-families. 22.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.67 and the average family size was 3.17.\nIn the village, the population was spread out, with 27.9% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 23.2% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.7 males.\nThe median income for a household in the village was $56,404, and the median income for a family was $61,768. Males had a median income of $47,500 versus $26,636 for females. The per capita income for the village was $23,415. About 0.7% of families and 0.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 0.9% of those under age 18 and 3.5% of those age 65 or over.\nEducation.\nAll of Peotone is in the Peotone Community Unit School District 207U.\nPeotone Elementary School (PES), located in town Peotone, serves kindergarten through 3rd grade. Peotone Intermediate Center (PIC), formerly Green Garden Elementary School in Green Garden Township, serves 4th and 5th grades. The Connor Shaw Center is home to the district offices and the Pre-K Center.\nPeotone Junior High School serves grades six through eight, and has been located in the former Peotone Junior Senior High School building since the 2001\u20132002 school year; the high school continues to use some of the outdoor sports facilities at the junior high. Several referendums have been orchestrated to build a new sports complex at the new high school, but have failed; these have also included plans to build on to the existing high school and junior high in order to resolve overcrowding.\nIn 2001, a new high school was built on the northwest side of Peotone. It's named Peotone High School While the school was designed for a capacity of 600 students, its student enrollment for the 2010-2011 fiscal year was approximately 687. The school mascot of all schools, from elementary through high school, is the Blue Devil.\nAs of 2007, Peotone schools had a total enrollment of 2,107 students in kindergarten through 12th grade.\nIn 2014, the Peotone School Board, in a 4\u20133 vote, decided to close the Wilton Center Elementary School in Wilton Township. The remaining elementary schools were reformatted to grade centers.\nProposed south suburban airport.\nPeotone has long been the proposed site of a new airport to serve the Chicago area. As is often the case with the construction of airports, the proposal is controversial. In 1967, the \"Chicago Tribune\" ran several editorials regarding the need for a third airport in Peotone.\nProponents point out that the existing facilities at O'Hare and Midway airports cannot meet the transportation needs of the Chicago area, and that the development will bring economic prosperity to Chicago Southland, an area deprived of economic development, as well as the rest of the state. Politicians backing plans include former Governor Rod Blagojevich; former Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Congressman Jerry Weller, the former representative of the district in which the airport would be located, and Will County Executive Larry Walsh. The efforts were also supported by then-state senator Barack Obama.\nOpponents to the plan are concerned about the environmental disruption that would be caused by new airport construction and the roads that would be needed to support it. They also point out that Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary, Indiana already exists, is closer to Chicago than Peotone, and is already undergoing expansion to support heavier use with minimal environmental impact. Politicians opposing the Peotone airport plan include former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, former Gary Mayor Scott King, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, and Representative Pete Visclosky from Indiana.\nFormer Representative Jesse Jackson, jr. was the head of a private group in Cook County looking to take ownership of the proposed airport. A state-backed IDOT plan is more friendly to the citizens of the actual footprint of the proposed airport by giving local control of the airport to Will County officials instead.\nIn the science-fiction novel \"The Boy Who Would Live Forever\" (2004), which was the fifth in the Gateway series, Frederik Pohl has a character fly out of \"Peotone International Airport\".

{"id": "48167", "revid": "239080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48167", "title": "Congruence relation", "text": "Equivalence relation in algebra\nIn abstract algebra, a congruence relation (or simply congruence) is an equivalence relation on an algebraic structure (such as a group, ring, or vector space) that is compatible with the structure in the sense that algebraic operations done with equivalent elements will yield equivalent elements. Every congruence relation has a corresponding quotient structure, whose elements are the equivalence classes (or congruence classes) for the relation.\nDefinition.\nThe definition of a congruence depends on the type of algebraic structure under consideration. Particular definitions of congruence can be made for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, semigroups, lattices, and so forth. The common theme is that a congruence is an equivalence relation on an algebraic object that is compatible with the algebraic structure, in the sense that the operations are well-defined on the equivalence classes.\nGeneral.\nThe general notion of a congruence relation can be formally defined in the context of universal algebra, a field which studies ideas common to all algebraic structures. In this setting, a relation formula_1 on a given algebraic structure is called compatible if for each formula_2 and each formula_2-ary operation formula_4 defined on the structure: whenever formula_5 and ... and formula_6, then formula_7.\nA congruence relation on the structure is then defined as an equivalence relation that is also compatible.\nExamples.\nBasic example.\nThe prototypical example of a congruence relation is congruence modulo formula_2 on the set of integers. For a given positive integer formula_2, two integers formula_10 and formula_11 are called congruent modulo formula_2, written\n formula_13\nif formula_14 is divisible by formula_2 (or equivalently if formula_10 and formula_11 have the same remainder when divided by formula_2).\nFor example, formula_19 and formula_20 are congruent modulo formula_21,\n formula_22\nsince formula_23 is a multiple of 10, or equivalently since both formula_19 and formula_20 have a remainder of formula_26 when divided by formula_21.\nCongruence modulo formula_2 (for a fixed formula_2) is compatible with both addition and multiplication on the integers. That is,\nif\n formula_30 and formula_31 \nthen\n formula_32 and formula_33\nThe corresponding addition and multiplication of equivalence classes is known as modular arithmetic. From the point of view of abstract algebra, congruence modulo formula_2 is a congruence relation on the ring of integers, and arithmetic modulo formula_2 occurs on the corresponding quotient ring.\nExample: Groups.\nFor example, a group is an algebraic object consisting of a set together with a single binary operation, satisfying certain axioms. If formula_36 is a group with operation formula_37, a congruence relation on formula_36 is an equivalence relation formula_39 on the elements of formula_36 satisfying\nformula_41 and formula_42 \nfor all formula_43. For a congruence on a group, the equivalence class containing the identity element is always a normal subgroup, and the other equivalence classes are the other cosets of this subgroup. Together, these equivalence classes are the elements of a quotient group.\nExample: Rings.\nWhen an algebraic structure includes more than one operation, congruence relations are required to be compatible with each operation. For example, a ring possesses both addition and multiplication, and a congruence relation on a ring must satisfy\n formula_44 and formula_45\nwhenever formula_46 and formula_47. For a congruence on a ring, the equivalence class containing 0 is always a two-sided ideal, and the two operations on the set of equivalence classes define the corresponding quotient ring.\nRelation with homomorphisms.\nIf formula_48 is a homomorphism between two algebraic structures (such as homomorphism of groups, or a linear map between vector spaces), then the relation formula_1 defined by\n formula_50 if and only if formula_51 \nis a congruence relation on formula_52. By the first isomorphism theorem, the image of \"A\" under formula_53 is a substructure of \"B\" isomorphic to the quotient of \"A\" by this congruence.\nOn the other hand, the congruence relation formula_1 induces a unique homomorphism formula_55 given by\n formula_56.\nThus, there is a natural correspondence between the congruences and the homomorphisms of any given algebraic structure.\nCongruences of groups, and normal subgroups and ideals.\nIn the particular case of groups, congruence relations can be described in elementary terms as follows:\nIf \"G\" is a group (with identity element \"e\" and operation *) and ~ is a binary relation on \"G\", then ~ is a congruence whenever:\nConditions 1, 2, and 3 say that ~ is an equivalence relation.\nA congruence ~ is determined entirely by the set {\"a\" \u2208 \"G\"|\"a\" ~ \"e\"} of those elements of \"G\" that are congruent to the identity element, and this set is a normal subgroup.\nSpecifically, \"a\" ~ \"b\" if and only if \"b\"\u22121 * \"a\" ~ \"e\".\nSo instead of talking about congruences on groups, people usually speak in terms of normal subgroups of them; in fact, every congruence corresponds uniquely to some normal subgroup of \"G\".\nIdeals of rings and the general case.\nA similar trick allows one to speak of kernels in ring theory as ideals instead of congruence relations, and in module theory as submodules instead of congruence relations.\nA more general situation where this trick is possible is with Omega-groups (in the general sense allowing operators with multiple arity). But this cannot be done with, for example, monoids, so the study of congruence relations plays a more central role in monoid theory.\nUniversal algebra.\nThe general notion of a congruence is particularly useful in universal algebra. An equivalent formulation in this context is the following:\nA congruence relation on an algebra \"A\" is a subset of the direct product \"A\" \u00d7 \"A\" that is both an equivalence relation on \"A\" and a subalgebra of \"A\" \u00d7 \"A\".\nThe kernel of a homomorphism is always a congruence. Indeed, every congruence arises as a kernel.\nFor a given congruence ~ on \"A\", the set \"A\" / ~ of equivalence classes can be given the structure of an algebra in a natural fashion, the quotient algebra.\nThe function that maps every element of \"A\" to its equivalence class is a homomorphism, and the kernel of this homomorphism is ~.\nThe lattice Con(\"A\") of all congruence relations on an algebra \"A\" is algebraic.\nJohn M. Howie described how semigroup theory illustrates congruence relations in universal algebra:\n In a group a congruence is determined if we know a single congruence class, in particular if we know the normal subgroup which is the class containing the identity. Similarly, in a ring a congruence is determined if we know the ideal which is the congruence class containing the zero. In semigroups there is no such fortunate occurrence, and we are therefore faced with the necessity of studying congruences as such. More than anything else, it is this necessity that gives semigroup theory its characteristic flavour. Semigroups are in fact the first and simplest type of algebra to which the methods of universal algebra must be applied\u00a0...\nCategory theory.\nIn category theory, a congruence relation \"R\" on a category \"C\" is given by: for each pair of objects \"X\", \"Y\" in \"C\", an equivalence relation \"R\"\"X\",\"Y\" on Hom(\"X\",\"Y\"), such that the equivalence relations respect composition of morphisms.

She was called \"one of the most widely read and influential poets of the second half of the 20th century\", and was credited with bringing \"the oppression of women and lesbians to the forefront of poetic discourse\". Rich criticized the rigid identities that are sometimes created by feminism, called for feminism that is flexible and open to being transformed, and drew attention to the existing current of solidarity and creativity among women, which she named the \"lesbian continuum\".\nHer first collection of poetry, \"A Change of World\", was selected by W. H. Auden for the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award. Auden went on to write the introduction to the book. Rich famously declined the National Medal of Arts to protest House Speaker Newt Gingrich's vote to end funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.\nEarly life and education.\nAdrienne Cecile Rich was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 16, 1929, the elder of two sisters. Her father, pathologist Arnold Rice Rich, was the chairman of pathology at The Johns Hopkins Medical School. Her mother, Helen Elizabeth (Jones) Rich, was a concert pianist and a composer. Her father was from a Jewish family, and her mother was a Southern Protestant; the girls were raised as Christians. Her paternal grandfather Samuel Rice was an Ashkenazi immigrant from Ko\u0161ice in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (present day Slovakia), while her paternal grandmother was a Sephardic Jew from Vicksburg, Mississippi. Samuel Rice owned a successful shoe store in Birmingham, Alabama. \nAdrienne Rich's early poetic influence stemmed from her father, who encouraged her to read but also to write poetry. Her interest in literature was sparked within her father's library, where she read the work of writers such as Ibsen, Arnold, Blake, Keats, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Tennyson. Her father was ambitious for Adrienne and \"planned to create a prodigy\". Adrienne Rich and her younger sister were home schooled by their mother until Adrienne commenced public education in the fourth grade. The poems \"Sources\" and \"After Dark\" document her relationship with her father, describing how she worked hard to fulfill her parents' ambitions\u2014moving into a world in which excellence was expected.\nIn later years, Rich went to Roland Park Country School, which she described as a \"good old fashioned girls' school [that] gave us fine role models of single women who were intellectually impassioned.\" After graduating from high school, Rich earned her diploma at Radcliffe College of Harvard University, where she focused on poetry and learning the writing craft, encountering no women teachers at all. \nIn 1951, her senior year at college, Rich's first collection of poetry, \"A Change of World\", was chosen by the poet W. H. Auden for the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award. He went on to write the introduction to the published volume. Following graduation, Rich received a Guggenheim Fellowship to study at Oxford for a year. After visiting Florence, she chose not to return to Oxford, and spent her remaining time in Europe writing and exploring Italy.\nEarly career: 1953\u20131975.\nIn 1953, Rich married Alfred Haskell Conrad, an economics professor at Harvard University she had met as an undergraduate. She said of the match: \"I married in part because I knew no better way to disconnect from my first family. I wanted what I saw as a full woman's life, whatever was possible.\" They settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and had three sons. In 1955, she published her second volume, \"The Diamond Cutters\", a collection she said she wished had not been published, saying \"a lot of the poems are incredibly derivative\", and citing a \"pressure to produce again... to make sure I was still a poet\". That year she received the Ridgely Torrence Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. Her three children were born in 1955 (David), 1957 (Pablo) and 1959 (Jacob).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \u2014From \"Diving into the Wreck\" \"\" (1973)\nThe 1960s began a period of change in Rich's life: she received the National Institute of Arts and Letters award (1960), her second Guggenheim Fellowship to work at the Netherlands Economic Institute (1961), and the Bollingen Foundation grant for the translation of Dutch poetry (1962). \nIn 1963, Rich published her third collection, \"Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law\", which was a much more personal work examining her female identity, reflecting the increasing tensions she experienced as a wife and mother in the 1950s, marking a substantial change in Rich's style and subject matter. In her 1982 essay \"\", Rich states: \"The experience of motherhood was eventually to radicalize me.\" The book met with harsh reviews. She comments, \"I was seen as 'bitter' and 'personal'; and to be personal was to be disqualified, and that was very shaking because I'd really gone out on a limb ... I realised I'd gotten slapped over the wrist, and I didn't attempt that kind of thing again for a long time.\"\nMoving her family to New York in 1966, Rich became involved with the New Left and became heavily involved in anti-war, civil rights, and feminist activism. Her husband took a teaching position at City College of New York. \nIn 1968, she signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. Her collections from this period include \"Necessities of Life\" (1966), \"Leaflets\" (1969), and \"The Will to Change\" (1971), which reflect increasingly radical political content and interest in poetic form.\nFrom 1967 to 1969, Rich lectured at Swarthmore College and taught at Columbia University School of the Arts as an adjunct professor in the Writing Division. Additionally, in 1968, she began teaching in the SEEK program in City College of New York, a position she continued until 1975. During this time, Rich also received the Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize from \"Poetry Magazine\". Rich and Conrad hosted anti-war and Black Panther fundraising parties at their apartment. Rising tensions began to split the marriage, and Rich moved out in mid-1970, getting herself a small studio apartment nearby. Shortly afterward, in October, Conrad drove into the woods and shot himself, widowing Rich.\nIn 1971, she was the recipient of the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America and spent the next year and a half teaching at Brandeis University as the Hurst visiting professor of creative writing. \"Diving into the Wreck\", a collection of exploratory and often angry poems, split the 1974 National Book Award for Poetry with Allen Ginsberg, \"The Fall of America\". Declining to accept it individually, Rich was joined by the two other feminist poets nominated, Alice Walker and Audre Lorde, to accept it on behalf of all women \"whose voices have gone and still go unheard in a patriarchal world.\" The following year, Rich took up the position of the Lucy Martin Donnelly Fellow at Bryn Mawr College.\nLater life: 1976\u20132012.\nIn 1976, Rich began her same-sex partnership with Jamaican-born novelist and editor Michelle Cliff, which lasted until her death. In her controversial work \"Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution\", published the same year, Rich acknowledged that, for her, lesbianism was a political as well as a personal issue, writing, \"The suppressed lesbian I had been carrying in me since adolescence began to stretch her limbs.\" The pamphlet \"Twenty-One Love Poems\" (1977), which was incorporated into the following year's \"Dream of a Common Language\" (1978), marked the first direct treatment of lesbian desire and sexuality in her writing, themes which run throughout her work afterwards, especially in \"A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far\" (1981) and some of her late poems in \"The Fact of a Doorframe\" (2001). In her analytical work \"Adrienne Rich: the moment of change\", Langdell suggests these works represent a central rite of passage for the poet, as she (Rich) crossed a threshold into a newly constellated life and a \"new relationship with the universe\". During this period, Rich also wrote a number of key socio-political essays, including \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\", one of the first to address the theme of lesbian existence. In this essay, she asks \"how and why women's choice of women as passionate comrades, life partners, co-workers, lovers, community, has been crushed, invalidated, forced into hiding\". Some of the essays were republished in \"On Lies, Secrets and Silence: Selected Prose, 1966\u20131978\" (1979). In integrating such pieces into her work, Rich claimed her sexuality and took a role in leadership for sexual equality.\nFrom 1976 to 1979, Rich taught at City College and Rutgers University as an English professor. In 1979, she received an honorary doctorate from Smith College and moved with Cliff to Montague, MA. Ultimately, they moved to Santa Cruz, where Rich continued her career as a professor, lecturer, poet, and essayist. Rich and Cliff took over editorship of the lesbian arts journal \"Sinister Wisdom\" (1981\u20131983). Rich taught and lectured at UC Santa Cruz, Scripps College, San Jose State University, and Stanford University during the 1980s and 1990s. From 1981 to 1987, Rich served as an A.D. White Professor-At-Large for Cornell University. Rich published several volumes in the next few years: \"Your Native Land, Your Life\" (1986), \"Blood, Bread, and Poetry\" (1986), and \"Time's Power: Poems 1985\u20131988\" (1989). She also was awarded the Ruth Paul Lilly Poetry Prize (1986), the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in Arts and Letters from NYU, and the National Poetry Association Award for Distinguished Service to the Art of Poetry (1989).\nIn 1977, Rich became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.\nJanice Raymond, in the foreword of her 1979 book \"The Transsexual Empire\", thanked Rich for \"constant encouragement\" and cited her in the book's chapter \"Sappho by Surgery.\" The book has been criticized by a number of LGBT and feminist writers for its anti-trans stance, and many have criticized Rich for her involvement in and support of its production. While Rich never explicitly disavowed her support for Raymond's work, Leslie Feinberg cites Rich as having been supportive during Feinberg's writing of \"Transgender Warriors\".\nBy the early 1980s, Rich was using canes and wheelchairs due to rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosed with the condition at age 22, Rich kept her disability quiet for decades. The cold air in New England motivated Rich and Cliff to settle in California. A 1992 spinal operation required Rich to wear a metal halo screwed into her head.\nIn June 1984, Rich presented a speech at the International Conference of Women, Feminist Identity, and Society in Utrecht, Netherlands titled \"Notes Toward a Politics of Location.\" Her keynote speech is a major document on politics of location and the birth of the concept of female \"locatedness\". In discussing the locations from which women speak, Rich attempts to reconnect female thought and speech with the female body, with an intent to reclaim the body through verbalizing self-representation. Rich begins the speech by noting that while she speaks the words in Europe, she has searched for them in the United States. By acknowledging her location in an essay on the progression of the women's movement, she expresses her concern for all women, not just women in Providence. Through widening her audience to women across the world Rich not only influences a larger movement but she invites all women to consider their existence. Through imagining geographical locations on a map as history and as places where women are created, and further focusing on those locations, Rich asks women to examine where they were created. In an attempt to try to find a sense of belonging in the world, Rich asks the audience not to begin with a continent, country, or house, but to start with the geography closest to themselves \u2013which is their body. Rich, therefore, challenges members of the audience and readers to form their own identity by refusing to be defined by the parameters of government, religion, and home. The essay hypothesizes the women's movement at the end of the 20th century. In an encouraging call for the women's movement, Rich discusses how the movement for change is an evolution in itself. Through de-masculinizing and de-Westernizing itself, the movement becomes a critical mass of many different voices, languages and overall actions. She pleads for the movement to change in order to experience change. She further insists that women must change it. In her essay, Rich considers how one's background might influence their identity. She furthers this notion by noting her own exploration of the body, her body, as female, as white, as Jewish and as a body in a nation. Rich is careful to define the location in which her writing takes place. Throughout her essay, Rich refers back to the concept of location. She recounts her growth towards understanding how the women's movement grounded in Western culture and limited to the concerns of white women, then incorporated verbal and written expression of black United States citizens. Such professions have allowed her to experience the meaning of her whiteness as a point of location for which she needed to take responsibility. In 1986, she published the essay in her prose collection \"Blood, Bread, and Poetry\".\nRich's work with the New Jewish Agenda led to the founding of \"Bridges: A Journal for Jewish Feminists and Our Friends\" in 1990, a journal for which Rich served as editor. This work explored the relationship between private and public histories, especially in the case of Jewish women's rights. Her next published piece, \"An Atlas of the Difficult World\" (1991), won both the \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Award in Poetry and the Lenore Marshall/\"Nation\" Award as well as the Poet's Prize in 1993 and Commonwealth Award in Literature in 1991. During the 1990s Rich joined advisory boards such as the Boston Woman's Fund, National Writers Union and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa. On the role of the poet, she wrote, \"We may feel bitterly how little our poems can do in the face of seemingly out-of-control technological power and seemingly limitless corporate greed, yet it has always been true that poetry can break isolation, show us to ourselves when we are outlawed or made invisible, remind us of beauty where no beauty seems possible, remind us of kinship where all is represented as separation.\" In July 1994, Rich won the MacArthur Fellowship, the \"Genius Grant\" for her work as a poet and writer. Also in 1992, Rich became a grandmother to Julia Arden Conrad and Charles Reddington Conrad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014From \"What kinds of times are these?\"\nIn 1997, Rich declined the National Medal of Arts in protest against the House of Representatives' vote to end the National Endowment for the Arts as well as policies of the Clinton Administration regarding the arts generally, and literature in particular, stating that \"I could not accept such an award from President Clinton or this White House because the very meaning of art, as I understand it, is incompatible with the cynical politics of this administration ... [Art] means nothing if it simply decorates the dinner table of the power which holds it hostage\". Her next few volumes were a mix of poetry and essays: \"Midnight Salvage: Poems 1995\u20131998\" (1999), \"The Art of the Possible: Essays and Conversations\" (2001), and \"Fox: Poems 1998\u20132000\" (2001).\nIn the early 2000s, Rich participated in anti-war activities, protesting against the threat of war in Iraq, both through readings of her poetry and other activities. In 2002, she was appointed a chancellor of the newly augmented board of the Academy of American Poets, along with Yusef Komunyakaa, Lucille Clifton, Jay Wright (who declined the honor), Louise Gl\u00fcck, Heather McHugh, Rosanna Warren, Charles Wright, Robert Creeley, and Michael Palmer. She won the 2003 Yale Bollingen Prize for American Poetry and was applauded by the panel of judges for her \"honesty at once ferocious, humane, her deep learning, and her continuous poetic exploration and awareness of multiple selves.\" In October 2006, Equality Forum honored Rich's work, featuring her as an icon of LGBT history.\nIn 2009, despite initially having reservations about the movement, Rich endorsed the call for a cultural and academic boycott of Israel, denouncing \"the Occupation's denial of Palestinian humanity, destruction of Palestinian lives and livelihoods, the \"settlements\", the state's physical and psychological walls against dialogue.\"\nRich died on March 27, 2012, at the age of 82 in her Santa Cruz, California, home. Her son, Pablo Conrad, reported that her death resulted from long-term rheumatoid arthritis. Her last collection was published the year before her death. Rich was survived by her sons, two grandchildren and her partner Michelle Cliff.\nViews.\nOn feminism.\nAdrienne Rich wrote several pieces that address the rights of women in society. In \"Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law\" she offered a critical analysis of the life of being both a mother and a daughter-in-law, and the impact of their gender in their lives. \"Diving Into the Wreck\" was written in the early 1970s when her tone began to darken as she wrote about feminism and other social issues. In particular, she wrote openly about her outrage at the patriarchal nature of the greater society. In doing so, she became an example for other women to follow in the hope that continued work against sexism would eventually counteract it.\nHer poems are also known for their feminist elements. One such poem is \"Power\", about Marie Curie (a female icon of the 20th century) and her relationship to power and feminism. Curie was slowly succumbing to the radiation that she absorbed in her research; Rich refers to that radiation as Curie's source of power, while exploring the concept of power from a woman's particular point of view.\nBesides poems and novels, Rich also wrote nonfiction books that tackled feminist issues, including \"Of Woman Born\", \"Motherhood as Experience and Institution\", and \"Blood, Bread and Poetry\". \"Blood, Bread, and Poetry\" is a collection of essays, including \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\". Some of Rich's writing is included and discussed in \"Feminism and Community\", edited by Penny A. Weiss and Marilyn Friedman.\nHer works, interviews, and documentaries demonstrated Rich's in-depth perspective on feminism and society.\nRich commented on the use of the term \"feminism\". She preferred \"women's liberation\", thinking that \"feminism\" was more likely to induce resistance from women of the next generation. She also feared that the term would amount to nothing more than a label if used extensively. She viewed \"women's liberation\" as finally being free from factors that can be seen as oppressive to women's rights.\nRich also wrote in depth about \"white feminism\" and the need for intersectionality within the feminist movement. In \"Blood, Bread, and Poetry\", Rich wrote that \"feminism became a political and spiritual base from which I could move to examine rather than try to hide my own racism, recognize that I have anti-racist work to do continuously within myself\". She went on to write that \"so long as [feminists] identify only with white women, we are still connected to that system of objectification and callousness and cruelty called racism\". Rich implored white feminists to consider the fact that \"[they], as victims of objectification, have objectified other women\" through their role as the oppressor, and through the white privilege they inherently possess under a racist regime.\nRich's views on feminism are evident in her works. She says in \"Of Woman Born\" that \"we need to understand the power and powerlessness embodied in motherhood in patriarchal culture\". She also speaks regarding the need for women to unite in \"On Lies, Secrets and Silence\":\n\"Women have often felt insane when cleaving to the truth of our experience. Our future depends on the sanity of each of us, and we have a profound stake, beyond the personal, in the project of describing our reality as candidly and fully as we can to each other.\"\nGiven the conditions for feminism from the 1950s through the 1970s, it can be said that Rich's works on feminism were revolutionary. Her views on equality and the need for women to maximize their potential can be seen as progressive for the time. Her views strongly coincided with feminist thinking during that period. According to Rich, society was founded on patriarchy, and limits the rights of women. She believed that for equality to be achieved between the sexes, the prevailing notions must be readjusted to accommodate the female perspective.\nOn racism.\nRich wrote at length on the topic of white feminism and intersectionality within the feminist movement. Citing such prominent black feminist activists and academics as Gloria T. Hull, Michele Russel, Lorraine Bethel, and Toni Morrison in her works, Rich dedicated several chapters of her book \"Blood, Bread, and Poetry\" to the subject of racism. Of her essay \"Of Woman Born,\" Rich wrote that it \"could have been stronger had it drawn on more of the literature by Black women toward which Toni Morrison's \"Sula\" inevitably pointed me.\"\nTouching on the privilege conferred to her as a white feminist author, Rich wrote in \"Blood, Bread, and Poetry\" that she \"is probably going to be taken more seriously in some quarters than the Black woman scholar whose combined experience and research give her far more penetrating knowledge and awareness than mine. I will be taken more seriously because I am white, [..] and because the invisibility of the woman of color who is the scholar/critic \"or\" the poet \"or\" the novelist is part of the structure of \"my\" privilege, even my credibility.\"\nIn 1981, Rich co-presented the keynote address for the National Women's Studies Association Convention in Storrs, Connecticut, along with Audre Lorde, delivering her speech entitled \"Disobedience is What NWSA is Potentially About.\" The theme of the convention was \"Women Respond to Racism\", and Rich noted the homophobia and racism that still existed \"in the enclave of Women's studies itself, where lesbians are still feared and women of color are still ignored\". Rich went on to say that \"women of color who are found in the wrong place as defined at any given time by the white fathers will receive their retribution unseen: if they are beaten, raped, insulted, harassed, mutilated, murdered, these events will go unreported, unpunished, unconnected; and white women are not even supposed to know they occur, let alone identify with the sufferings endured.\" Rich asked the audience: \"how disobedient will Women's Studies be in the 1980s; how will this Association address the racism, misogyny, homophobia of the university and of the corporate and militist society in which it is embedded; how will white feminist scholars and teachers and students practice disobedience to patriarchy?\" Rich implored the audience to rid themselves of the idea that \"by opposing racist violence, by doing anti-racist work, or by becoming feminists white women somehow cease to carry racism within them\", asserting that white women are never absolved of their white privilege and must continually commit to anti-racist work while they are still in the role of the oppressor.\nIn 2009, Rich came forward with a statement in support of the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI), criticizing Israeli occupation and expressing her \u201ccontinued solidarity with the Palestinian people\u2019s long resistance.\u201d\nSelected awards and honors.\nEach year links to its corresponding \"[year]() in poetry\" article:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments and working alongside humans, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body. Androids are humanoid robots built to more closely resemble the human physique. (The term Gynoid is sometimes used for those that resemble women.)\nHistory.\nThe concept of a humanoid robot originated in many different cultures around the world. Some of the earliest accounts of the idea of humanoid automata date to the 4th century BCE in Greek mythologies and various religious and philosophical texts from China. Physical prototypes of humanoid automata were later created in the Middle East, Italy, Japan, France and South Korea.\nGreece.\nThe Greek god of blacksmiths, Hephaestus, created several different humanoid automata in various myths. In Homer's \"Iliad,\" Hephaestus created golden handmaidens and imbued them with human-like voices to serve as speaking tools or instruments. Another Greek myth details how Hephaestus crafted a giant bronze automaton named Talos to protect the island of Crete from invaders.\nChina.\nIn the 3rd century BCE, a Taoist philosophical text called the \"Liezi\", written by Chinese philosopher Lie Yukou, detailed the idea of a humanoid automaton. The text includes mention of an engineer named Yan Shi who created a life-size, human-like robot for the fifth king of the Chinese Zhou Dynasty, King Mu. The robot was primarily constructed of leather and wood. It was capable of walking, singing, and moving all parts of its body.\nMiddle East.\nIn the 13th century, a Muslim engineer named Ismail al-Jazari designed various humanoid automata. He created a waitress robot that would dispense drinks from a liquid reservoir and appear out of an automatic door to serve them. Another automaton he created was used for hand washing to refill a basin with water after being drained.\nItaly.\nIn the 1400s, Leonardo da Vinci conceptualized a complex mechanical robot clad in a suit of armor, capable of sitting, standing, and independently moving its arms. The entire robot was operated by a system of pulleys and cables.\nJapan.\nFrom the 17th to 19th centuries, the Japanese built humanoid automata called \"karakuri\" puppets. These puppets resembled dolls and were used for entertainment in theatre, homes, and religious festivals. \"Karakuri\" puppets that were used for theater plays were called \"butai karakuri\". Small \"karakuri puppets\" found in homes, called \"zashiki kurakuri\", were placed on tables to dance, beat drums, or serve drinks. The puppets used in religious festivals were known as \"Dashi karakuri\", and they served to reenact myths and legends.\nFrance.\nIn the 18th century, French inventor Jacques de Vaucanson created a significant humanoid automaton called \"The Flute Player\". This wooden, human-sized robot was capable of playing various melodies with the flute. It consisted of a system of bellows, pipes, weights, and other mechanical components to simulate to the muscles necessary to play the flute.\nSouth Korea.\nKAIST's research team developed Hubo, South Korea's first humanoid robot, and Professor Oh Jun-ho, who led the team, founded Rainbow Robotics in 2011. In 2025, South Korean government formed the K-Humanoid Alliance, an alliance of the companies, researchers, and talents.\nApplications.\nHumanoid robots are now used as research tools in several scientific areas. Researchers study the human body structure and behavior (biomechanics) to build humanoid robots. On the other side, the attempt to simulate the human body leads to a better understanding of it. Human cognition is a field of study which is focused on how humans learn from sensory information in order to acquire perceptual and motor skills. This knowledge is used to develop computational models of human behavior, and it has been improving over time.\nIt has been suggested that very advanced robotics will facilitate the enhancement of ordinary humans. See transhumanism.\nMedical and research.\nHumanoid robots are a valuable resource in the world of medicine and biotechnology, as well as other fields of research such as biomechanics and cognitive science. Humanoid robots are being used to develop complex prosthetics for individuals with physical disabilities such as missing limbs. The WABIAN-2 is a new medical humanoid robot created to help patients in the rehabilitation of their lower limbs.\nAlthough the initial aim of humanoid research was to build better orthosis and prosthesis for human beings, knowledge has been transferred between both disciplines. A few examples are powered leg prosthesis for the neuromuscularly impaired, ankle-foot orthosis, biological realistic leg prosthesis, and forearm prosthesis.\nHumanoid robots can be used as test subjects for the practice and development of personalized healthcare aids, essentially performing as robotic nurses for demographics such as the elderly. Humanoids are also suitable for some procedurally-based vocations, such as reception-desk administrators and automotive manufacturing line workers. In essence, since they can use tools and operate equipment and vehicles designed for the human form, humanoids could theoretically perform any task a human being can, so long as they have the proper software. However, the complexity of doing so is immense.\nEntertainment.\nHumanoid robots have long appeared in entertainment and fiction, from mythological figures such as Prometheus to mechanical characters in early automata and science fiction films. In contemporary theme parks, humanoid machines are widely used as sophisticated animatronics that mimic human motion, facial expressions and speech. Research groups at Walt Disney Imagineering have developed \"stuntronics\", free-flying humanoid stunt doubles that use onboard sensing and control to perform aerial flips and poses during live shows, allowing characters such as superheroes to execute stunts that would be dangerous for human performers.\nOutside of theme parks, humanoid robots increasingly appear in live sports-style events and competitions. In 2025 the Chinese robotics company Unitree live-streamed what it billed as the first boxing tournament between humanoid robots, with four G1 robots taking part in a small-ring event that combined remote control with short autonomous sequences. The same year, Beijing hosted the inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games, where more than 500 robots from 280 teams competed in events such as soccer, running and boxing and performed choreographed routines including hip-hop and martial arts during the opening ceremony. Exhibition matches and tournaments with humanoid robot football teams have also been promoted as trials for future multi-sport robot events.\nHumanoid robots have also been used as performers in concerts and televised shows. At the 2025 VOYAGEX music festival in Changchun, the PNDbotics humanoid Adam appeared on stage as a keytar player as part of a live band performance. Earlier that year, a Chinese Spring Festival television gala featured a choreographed routine in which sixteen Unitree H1 humanoid robots danced alongside human performers, presented as a demonstration of the country's progress in humanoid robotics. These and similar appearances at music events and public festivals have been described as ways to familiarise audiences with humanoid robots while showcasing advances in dynamic control, balance and human\u2013robot interaction.\nVarious humanoid robots and their possible applications in daily life, including service and companion roles, are featured in the independent documentary film \"Plug &amp; Pray\", released in 2010.\nDemonstrative.\nThough many real-world applications for humanoid robots are unexplored, their primary use is to demonstrate up-and-coming technologies. Modern examples of humanoid robots, such as the Honda Asimo, are revealed to the public in order to demonstrate new technological advancements in motor skills, such as walking, climbing, and playing an instrument. Other humanoid robots have been developed for household purposes, however excel only in single purpose skills and are far from autonomous. Humanoid robots, especially those with artificial intelligence algorithms, could be useful for future dangerous and/or distant space exploration missions, without having the need to turn back around again and return to Earth once the mission is completed.\nSensors.\nA sensor is a device that measures some attribute of the world. Being one of the three primitives of robotics (besides planning and control), sensing plays an important role in robotic paradigms.\nSensors can be classified according to the physical process with which they work or according to the type of measurement information that they give as output. In this case, the second approach was used.\nProprioceptive.\nProprioceptive sensors sense the position, orientation, and speed of the humanoid's body and joints, along with other internal values.\nIn human beings, the otoliths and semi-circular canals (in the inner ear) are used to maintain balance and orientation. Additionally, humans use their own proprioceptive sensors (e.g. touch, muscle extension, limb position) to help with their orientation. Humanoid robots use accelerometers to measure the acceleration, from which velocity can be calculated by integration; tilt sensors to measure inclination; force sensors placed in robot's hands and feet to measure contact force with environment; position sensors that indicate the actual position of the robot (from which the velocity can be calculated by derivation); and even speed sensors.\nExteroceptive.\nArrays of tactels can be used to provide data on what has been touched. The Shadow Hand uses an array of 34 tactels arranged beneath its polyurethane skin on each finger tip. Tactile sensors also provide information about forces and torques transferred between the robot and other objects.\nVision refers to processing data from any modality which uses the electromagnetic spectrum to produce an image. In humanoid robots it is used to recognize objects and determine their properties. Vision sensors work most similarly to the eyes of human beings. Most humanoid robots use CCD cameras as vision sensors.\nSound sensors allow humanoid robots to hear speech and environmental sounds, akin to the ears of the human being. Microphones are usually used for the robots to convey speech.\nActuators.\nActuators are the motors responsible for motion in the robot.\nHumanoid robots are constructed in such a way that they mimic the human body. They use actuators that perform like muscles and joints, though with a different structure. The actuators of humanoid robots can be either electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic. It is ideal for these actuators to have high power, low mass, and small dimensions.\nElectric.\nElectric actuators are the most popular types of actuators in humanoid robots. These actuators are smaller in size, and a single electric actuator may not produce enough power for a human-sized joint. Therefore, it is common to use multiple electric actuators for a single joint in a humanoid robot. An example of a humanoid robot using electric actuators is HRP-2.\nHydraulic.\nHydraulic actuators produce higher power than electric actuators and pneumatic actuators, and they have the ability to control the torque they produce better than other types of actuators. However, they can become very bulky in size. One solution to counter the size issue is electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA). The most popular example of a humanoid robot using hydraulic actuators is the ATLAS robot made by Boston Dynamics.\nPneumatic.\nPneumatic actuators operate on the basis of gas compressibility. As they are inflated, they expand along the axis, and as they deflate, they contract. If one end is fixed, the other will move in a linear trajectory. A popular example of a pneumatic actuator is the Mac Kibben muscle.\nPlanning and control.\nPlanning in robots is the process of planning out motions and trajectories for the robot to carry out. Control is the actual execution of these planned motions and trajectories. In humanoid robots, the planning must carry out biped motions, meaning that robots should plan motions similar to a human. Since one of the main uses of humanoid robots is to interact with humans, it is important for the planning and control mechanisms of humanoid robots to work in a variety of terrain and environments.\nThe question of walking biped robots stabilization on the surface is of great importance. Maintenance of the robot's gravity center over the center of bearing area for providing a stable position can be chosen as a goal of control.\nTo maintain dynamic balance during the walk, a robot needs information about contact force and its current and desired motion. The solution to this problem relies on a major concept, the Zero Moment Point (ZMP).\nAnother characteristic of humanoid robots is that they move, gather information (using sensors) on the \"real world\", and interact with it. They do not stay still like factory manipulators and other robots that work in highly structured environments. To allow humanoids to move in complex environments, planning and control must focus on self-collision detection, path planning and obstacle avoidance.\nHumanoid robots do not yet have some features of the human body. They include structures with variable flexibility, which provide safety (to the robot itself and to the people), and redundancy of movements, i.e. more degrees of freedom and therefore wide task availability. Although these characteristics are desirable to humanoid robots, they will bring more complexity and new problems to planning and control. The field of whole-body control deals with these issues and addresses the proper coordination of numerous degrees of freedom, e.g. to realize several control tasks simultaneously while following a given order of priority.\nIn science fiction.\nA common theme for the depiction of humanoid robots in science fiction pertains to how they can help humans in society or serve as threats to humanity. This theme essentially questions whether artificial intelligence is a force of good or bad for mankind. Humanoid robots that are depicted as good for society and benefit humans are Commander Data in \"Star Trek\" and C-3PO in \"Star Wars\". Opposite portrayals where humanoid robots are shown as scary and threatening to humans are the T-800 in \"Terminator\" and Megatron in \"Transformers.\" An Indian Tamil-language film which showed the pros and cons of a humanoid robot Chitti.\nAnother prominent theme found in science fiction regarding humanoid robots focuses on personhood. Certain films, particularly \"Blade Runner\" and \"Blade Runner 2049\", explore whether or not a constructed, synthetic being should be considered a person. In the films, androids called \"replicants\" are created indistinguishably from human beings, yet they are shunned and do not possess the same rights as humans. This theme incites audience sympathy while also sparking unease at the idea of humanoid robots mimicking humans too closely.\nThe term \"gynoid\" was first used by Isaac Asimov in a 1979 editorial, as a theoretical female equivalent of the word \"android\". \nCriticism.\nHumanoid robots, which are designed to resemble and mimic human form and behavior, have faced several criticisms:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Of the three municipalities, two have an ethnic Albanian majority, while Medve\u0111a has a significant minority of them.\nThe U\u00c7PMB's uniforms, procedures and tactics mirrored those of the then freshly disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The 1,500-strong paramilitary launched an insurgency in the Pre\u0161evo Valley from 1999 to 2001, with the goal of joining these municipalities to Kosovo. The EU condemned what it described as the \"extremism\" and use of \"illegal terrorist actions\" by the group.\nBackground.\nIn 1992 and 1993, ethnic Kosovar Albanians created the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which started attacking police forces and secret-service officials who abused Albanian civilians in 1995. Starting in 1998, the KLA was involved in frontal battle, with increasing numbers of Yugoslav security forces. Escalating tensions led to the Kosovo War in February 1998.\nHistory.\nAfter the end of the Kosovo War in 1999, a three-mile \"Ground Safety Zone\" (GSZ) was established between Kosovo (governed by the UN) and inner Serbia and Montenegro. Yugoslav Forces (VJ) units were not permitted there, and only the lightly armed Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs forces were left in the area.\nThe exclusion zone included the predominantly Albanian village of Dobrosin, but not Pre\u0161evo. Serbian police had to stop patrolling the area to avoid being ambushed. Ethnic Albanian politicians opposed to the KLA were attacked, including Zemail Mustafi, the vice-president of the Bujanovac branch of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's Socialist Party of Serbia who was later assassinated.\nBetween 21 June 1999 and 12 November 2000, 294 attacks were recorded. 246 in Bujanovac, 44 in Medve\u0111a and 6 in Pre\u0161evo. These attacks resulted in 14 people killed (of which six were civilians and eight were policemen), 37 people wounded (two UN observers, three civilians and 34 policemen) and five civilians kidnapped. In their attacks, U\u00c7PMB used mostly assault rifles, machine guns, mortars and sniper rifles, but occasionally also RPGs, hand grenades, and anti-tank and anti-personnel mines.\nThe U\u00c7PMB included child soldiers from their mid-teens.\nThe Liberation army of Pre\u0161evo, Medve\u0111a and Bujanovac aimed to create autonomy for the three Albanian municipalities within Serbia and drive Serbian institutions out and hold an election for unification with the Republic of Kosovo.\nOn 4 March 2000, around 500 U\u00c7PMB fighters attacked the city of Dobrosin. The battle resulted in one U\u00c7PMB and one Serb fighter killed, while another 175 were displaced. On 21 November 2000, members of the U\u00c7PMB attacked the city of Dobrosin and the surrounding villages. Heavy fighting resulted in the VJ retreating to Kon\u010dulj, Lu\u010dane, and Bujanovac. After four policemen were killed and two wounded by the U\u00c7PMB, the VJ retreated back to the GSZ.\nOn 6 January 2001, the U\u00c7PMB took control of Gornja \u0160u\u0161aja, and were well received by the locals. On 19 January, in command of Bardhyl Osmani, raided VJ positions near Crnotince. On 20 January, the VJ launched an attack against the U\u00c7PMB stronghold. The battle lasted for four days when VJ forces were forced to withdraw.\nOn 13 May 2001, the VJ and Serbian police launched an attack on the U\u00c7PMB in Oraovica before they entered Sector B. The fighting began at 6:10 am when Yugoslav troops entered the city. At 7:00 am, the U\u00c7PMB attacked Serbian police and fired three rockets towards Oraovica and VJ positions. Attacks from the U\u00c7PMB stopped at 8:00 am. On 14 May 2001, the Yugoslav troops captured the city after the U\u00c7PMB attacked again at 2:15 pm.&lt;ref name=\"RFE/RL\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn 21 May 2001, members of the U\u00c7PMB signed the Kon\u010dulj Agreement, which resulted in the full demilitarization, demobilization, and disarmament of the U\u00c7PMB. The agreement stated that the VJ was allowed to enter the GSZ by 31 May 2001. At the same time, the Serbian side agreed to sign the Statement on conditional amnesty for members of the U\u00c7PMB, which promised amnesty to U\u00c7PMB fighters on 23 May 2001.\nAs the situation escalated, NATO allowed the VJ to reclaim the GSZ on 24 May 2001, at the same time giving the U\u00c7PMB the opportunity to turn themselves over to the Kosovo Force (KFOR), which promised to only take their weapons and note their names before releasing them. More than 450 U\u00c7PMB members took advantage of KFOR's \"screen and release\" policy, among them commander Shefket Musliu, who turned himself over to KFOR at a checkpoint along the GSZ just after midnight of 26 May 2001.\nAftermath.\nWith the signing of the Kon\u010dulj Agreement in May 2001, the former KLA and U\u00c7PMB fighters next moved to western Macedonia where the NLA was established, which fought against the Macedonian government in 2001. Ali Ahmeti organized the NLA from former KLA and U\u00c7PMB fighters from Kosovo, Albanian insurgents from the U\u00c7PMB in Serbia, young Albanian radicals, nationalists from Macedonia, and foreign mercenaries. The acronym was the same as the KLA's in Albanian.\nAnother Albanian paramilitary organization Albanian National Army (ANA, AKSh) also had former U\u00c7PMB fighters. The group is associated with FBKSh (National Front for Reunification of Albanians), its political wing. The group participated in attacks against Macedonian forces with the NLA. After the NLA disbanded, the ANA later went and operated in the Pre\u0161evo Valley.\nOrganization.\nThe U\u00c7PMB was organized into five brigades, each with their own commanders:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After the two men identified argon, Ramsay investigated other atmospheric gases. His work in isolating argon, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon led to the development of a new section of the periodic table.\nEarly life.\nRamsay was born at 2 Clifton Street in Glasgow on 2 October 1852, the son of civil engineer and surveyor, William C. Ramsay, and his wife, Catherine Robertson. The family lived at 2 Clifton Street in the city centre, a three-storey and basement Georgian townhouse. The family moved to 1 Oakvale Place in the Hillhead district in his youth. He was a nephew of the geologist Sir Andrew Ramsay.\nHe was educated at Glasgow Academy and then apprenticed to Robert Napier, a shipbuilder in Govan. However, he instead decided to study Chemistry at the University of Glasgow, matriculating in 1866 and graduating in 1869. He then undertook practical training with the chemist Thomas Anderson and then went to study in Germany at the University of T\u00fcbingen with Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig where his doctoral thesis was entitled \"Investigations in the Toluic and Nitrotoluic Acids\".\nRamsay went back to Glasgow as Anderson's assistant at Anderson College. He was appointed as Professor of Chemistry at the University College of Bristol in 1879 and married Margaret Buchanan in 1881. In the same year he became the Principal of University College, Bristol, and somehow managed to combine that with active research both in organic chemistry and on gases.\nCareer.\nWilliam Ramsay formed pyridine in 1876 from acetylene and hydrogen cyanide in an iron-tube furnace in what was the first synthesis of a heteroaromatic compound. In 1887, he succeeded Alexander Williamson as the chair of Chemistry at University College London (UCL). It was here at UCL that his most celebrated discoveries were made. As early as 1885\u20131890, he published several notable papers on the oxides of nitrogen, developing the skills that he needed for his subsequent work. On the evening of 19 April 1894, Ramsay attended a lecture given by Lord Rayleigh. Rayleigh had noticed a discrepancy between the density of nitrogen made by chemical synthesis and nitrogen isolated from the air by removal of the other known components. After a short conversation, he and Ramsay decided to investigate this. In August Ramsay told Rayleigh he had isolated a new, heavy component of air, which did not appear to have any chemical reactivity. He named this inert gas \"argon\", from the Greek word meaning \"lazy\". In the following years, working with Morris Travers, he discovered neon, krypton, and xenon. He also isolated helium, which had only been observed in the spectrum of the sun, and had not previously been found on earth. In 1910 he isolated and characterised radon.\nDuring 1893\u20131902, Ramsay collaborated with Emily Aston, a British chemist, in experiments on mineral analysis and atomic weight determination. Their work included publications on the molecular surface energies of mixtures of non-associating liquids.\nRamsay was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1899.\nHe was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and invested as such by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.\nIn 1904, Ramsay received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nThat same year, he was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Ramsay's standing among scientists led him to become an adviser to the Indian Institute of Science. He suggested Bangalore as the location for the institute.\nRamsay endorsed the Industrial and Engineering Trust Ltd., a company that claimed it could extract gold from seawater, in 1905. It bought property on the English coast to begin its secret process. The company never produced any gold.\nRamsay was the president of the British Association in 1911\u20131912.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1881, Ramsay was married to Margaret Johnstone Marshall (n\u00e9e Buchanan), daughter of George Stevenson Buchanan. They had a daughter, Catherine Elizabeth (Elska) and a son, William George, who died at 40.\nRamsay lived in Hazlemere, Buckinghamshire, until his death. He died in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 23 July 1916 from nasal cancer at the age of 63 and was buried in Hazlemere parish church.\nLegacy.\nA blue plaque at number 12 Arundel Gardens, Notting Hill, commemorates his life and work.\nThe Sir William Ramsay School in Hazlemere and Ramsay grease are named after him.\nThere is a memorial to him by Charles Hartwell in the north aisle of the choir at Westminster Abbey.\nIn 1923, University College London named its new Chemical Engineering department and seat after Ramsay, which had been funded by the Ramsay Memorial Fund. One of Ramsay's former graduates, H. E. Watson was the third Ramsay professor of chemical engineering.\nOn 2 October 2019, Google celebrated his 167th birthday with a Google Doodle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bordered by Greater London to the northeast, Kent to the east, East and West Sussex to the south, and Hampshire and Berkshire to the west. The largest settlement is Woking.\nThe county has an area of and had an estimated population of 1,248,649 in 2024. The north of the county, which includes the towns of Staines-upon-Thames and Epsom, is densely populated and forms part of the Greater London conurbation. A second conurbation along the western border of the county includes Camberley and Farnham and extends into Hampshire and Berkshire. Woking is located in the north-west, and Guildford in the centre-west. The south of the county is rural, and its largest settlements are Horley in the south-east and Godalming in the south-west. For local government purposes Surrey is a non-metropolitan county with eleven districts. The county historically included much of south-west Greater London but did not include what is now the borough of Spelthorne, which was part of Middlesex. It is one of the home counties.\nThe defining geographical feature of the county is the North Downs, a chalk escarpment which runs from the south-west to north-east and divides the densely populated north from the more rural south; it is pierced by the rivers Wey and Mole, both tributaries of the Thames. The north of the county is a lowland, part of the Thames basin. The south-east is part of the Weald, and the south-west contains the Surrey Hills and Thursley, Hankley and Frensham Commons, an extensive area of heath. The county has the densest woodland cover in England, at 22.4 per cent.\nGeography.\nSurrey is divided in two by the chalk ridge of the North Downs, running east\u2013west. The ridge is pierced by the rivers Wey and Mole, tributaries of the Thames, which formed the northern border of the county before modern redrawing of county boundaries, which has left part of its north bank within the county. To the north of the Downs the land is mostly flat, forming part of the basin of the Thames. The geology of this area is dominated by London Clay in the east, Bagshot Sands in the west and alluvial deposits along the rivers.\nTo the south of the Downs in the western part of the county are the sandstone Surrey Hills, while further east is the plain of the Low Weald, rising in the extreme southeast to the edge of the hills of the High Weald. The Downs and the area to the south form part of a concentric pattern of geological deposits which also extends across southern Kent and most of Sussex, predominantly composed of Wealden Clay, Lower Greensand and the chalk of the Downs.\nMuch of Surrey is in the Metropolitan Green Belt. It contains valued reserves of mature woodland (reflected in the official logo of Surrey County Council, a pair of interlocking oak leaves). Among its many notable beauty spots are Box Hill, Leith Hill, Frensham Ponds, Newlands Corner and Puttenham &amp; Crooksbury Commons.\nSurrey is the most wooded county in England, with 22.4% coverage compared to a national average of 11.8% and as such is one of the few counties not to recommend new woodlands in the subordinate planning authorities' plans. In 2020 the Surrey Heath district had the highest proportion of tree cover in England at 41%. Surrey also contains England's principal concentration of lowland heath, on sandy soils in the west of the county.\nAgriculture not being intensive, there are many commons and access lands, together with an extensive network of footpaths and bridleways including the North Downs Way, a scenic long-distance path. Accordingly, Surrey provides many rural and semi-rural leisure activities, with a large horse population in modern terms.\nThe highest elevation in Surrey is Leith Hill near Dorking. It is above sea level and is the second highest point in southeastern England after Walbury Hill in West Berkshire which is .\nSurrey rivers.\nThe longest river to enter Surrey is the Thames, which historically formed the boundary between the county and Middlesex. As a result of the 1965 boundary changes, many of the Surrey boroughs on the south bank of the river were transferred to Greater London, shortening the length associated with the county. The Thames now forms the Surrey\u2013Berkshire border between Runnymede and Staines-upon-Thames, before flowing wholly within Surrey to Sunbury, from which point it marks the Surrey\u2013Greater London border as far as Surbiton.\nThe River Wey is the longest tributary of the Thames above London. Other tributaries of the Thames with their courses partially in Surrey include the Mole, the Addlestone branch and Chertsey branch of the River Bourne (which merge shortly before joining the Thames), and the Hogsmill River, which drains Epsom and Ewell.\nThe upper reaches of the River Eden, a tributary of the Medway, are in Tandridge District, in east Surrey.\nThe River Colne and its anabranch, the Wraysbury River, make a brief appearance in the north of the county to join the Thames at Staines.\nClimate.\nLike the rest of the British Isles, Surrey has a maritime climate with warm summers and cool winters. The Met Office weather station at Wisley, about to the north-east of Guildford, has recorded temperatures between (August 2003) and (January 1982). From 2006 until 2015, the Wisley weather station held the UK July record high of .\nSettlements.\nSurrey has a population of approximately 1.1\u00a0million people. Its largest town is Woking with a population of 105,367, followed by Guildford with 77,057, and Walton-on-Thames with 66,566. Towns of between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants include Ewell, and Camberley.\nMuch of the north of the county, extending to Guildford, is within the Greater London Built-up Area. This is an area of continuous urban sprawl linked without significant interruption of rural area to Greater London. In the west, there is a developing conurbation straddling the Hampshire/Surrey border, including the Surrey towns of Camberley and Farnham.\nGuildford is often regarded as the historic county town, although the county administration was moved to Newington in 1791 and to Kingston upon Thames in 1893. The county council's headquarters were outside the county's boundaries from 1 April 1965, when Kingston and other areas were included within Greater London by the London Government Act 1963, until the administration moved to Reigate at the start of 2021.\nHistory.\nAncient British and Roman periods.\nBefore Roman times the area today known as Surrey was probably largely occupied by the Atrebates tribe, centred at Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester), in the modern county of Hampshire, but eastern parts of it may have been held by the Cantiaci, based largely in Kent. The Atrebates are known to have controlled the southern bank of the Thames from Roman texts describing the tribal relations between them and the powerful Catuvellauni on the north bank.\nIn about AD 42 King Cunobelinus (in Welsh legend Cynfelin ap Tegfan) of the Catuvellauni died and war broke out between his sons and King Verica of the Atrebates. The Atrebates were defeated, their capital captured and their lands made subject to Togodumnus, king of the Catuvellauni, ruling from Camulodunum (Colchester). Verica fled to Gaul and appealed for Roman aid. The Atrebates were allied with Rome during the invasion of Britain in AD\u00a043.\nDuring the Roman era, the only important settlement within the historic area of Surrey was the London suburb of Southwark (now part of Greater London), but there were small towns at Staines, Ewell, Dorking, Croydon and Kingston upon Thames.Remains of Roman rural temples have been excavated on Farley Heath and near Wanborough and Titsey, and possible temple sites at Chiddingfold, Betchworth and Godstone. The site of a Roman villa was discovered in 1892 on Broad Street Common by a local farmer; subsequent excavations discovered traces of a second villa nearby. The area was traversed by Stane Street and other Roman roads.\nFormation of Surrey.\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries Surrey was conquered and settled by Saxons. The names of possible tribes inhabiting the area have been conjectured on the basis of place names. These include the (around Godalming) and (between Woking and Wokingham in Berkshire). It has also been speculated that the entries for the and peoples in the Tribal Hidage may refer to two groups living in the vicinity of Surrey. Together their lands were assessed at a total of 7,000 hides, equal to the assessment for Sussex or Essex.\nSurrey may have formed part of a larger Middle Saxon kingdom or confederacy, also including areas north of the Thames. The name Surrey is derived from (or ), meaning \"southern region\" (while Bede refers to it as ) and this may originate in its status as the southern portion of the Middle Saxon territory.\nIf it ever existed, the Middle Saxon kingdom had disappeared by the 7th century, and Surrey became a frontier area disputed between the kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Sussex, Wessex and Mercia, until its permanent absorption by Wessex in 825. Despite this fluctuating situation it retained its identity as an enduring territorial unit. During the 7th century Surrey became Christian and initially formed part of the East Saxon diocese of London, indicating that it was under East Saxon rule at that time, but was later transferred to the West Saxon diocese of Winchester. Its most important religious institution throughout the Anglo-Saxon period and beyond was Chertsey Abbey, founded in 666. At this point Surrey was evidently under Kentish domination, as the abbey was founded under the patronage of King Ecgberht of Kent. However, a few years later at least part of it was subject to Mercia, since in 673\u2013675 further lands were given to Chertsey Abbey by Frithuwald, a local sub-king () ruling under the sovereignty of Wulfhere of Mercia. A decade later Surrey passed into the hands of King Caedwalla of Wessex, who also conquered Kent and Sussex, and founded a monastery at Farnham in 686.\nThe region remained under the control of Caedwalla's successor Ine in the early 8th century. Its political history for most of the 8th century is unclear, although West Saxon control may have broken down around 722, but by 784\u2013785 it had passed into the hands of King Offa of Mercia. Mercian rule continued until 825, when following his victory over the Mercians at the Battle of Ellandun, King Egbert of Wessex seized control of Surrey, along with Sussex, Kent and Essex. It was incorporated into Wessex as a shire and continued thereafter under the rule of the West Saxon kings, who eventually became kings of all of England.\nWest Saxon and English shire.\nIn the 9th century England was afflicted, along with the rest of northwestern Europe, by the attacks of Scandinavian Vikings. Surrey's inland position shielded it from coastal raiding, so that it was not normally troubled except by the largest and most ambitious Scandinavian armies.\nIn 851 an exceptionally large invasion force of Danes arrived at the mouth of the Thames in a fleet of about 350 ships, which would have carried over 15,000 men. Having sacked Canterbury and London and defeated King Beorhtwulf of Mercia in battle, the Danes crossed the Thames into Surrey, but were slaughtered by a West Saxon army led by King \u00c6thelwulf in the Battle of Aclea, bringing the invasion to an end.\nTwo years later the men of Surrey marched into Kent to help their Kentish neighbours fight a raiding force at Thanet, but suffered heavy losses including their ealdorman, Huda. In 892 Surrey was the scene of another major battle when a large Danish army, variously reported at 200, 250 and 350 ship-loads, moved west from its encampment in Kent and raided in Hampshire and Berkshire. Withdrawing with their loot, the Danes were intercepted and defeated at Farnham by an army led by Alfred the Great's son Edward, the future King Edward the Elder, and fled across the Thames towards Essex.\nSurrey remained safe from attack for over a century thereafter, due to its location and to the growing power of the West Saxon, later English, kingdom. Kingston was the scene for the coronations of \u00c6thelstan in 924 and of \u00c6thelred the Unready in 978, and, according to later tradition, also of other 10th-century Kings of England. The renewed Danish attacks during the disastrous reign of \u00c6thelred led to the devastation of Surrey by the army of Thorkell the Tall, which ravaged all of southeastern England in 1009\u20131011. The climax of this wave of attacks came in 1016, which saw prolonged fighting between the forces of King Edmund Ironside and the Danish king Cnut, including an English victory over the Danes somewhere in northeastern Surrey, but ended with the conquest of England by Cnut.\nCnut's death in 1035 was followed by a period of political uncertainty, as the succession was disputed between his sons. In 1036 Alfred, son of King \u00c6thelred, returned from Normandy, where he had been taken for safety as a child at the time of Cnut's conquest of England. It is uncertain what his intentions were, but after landing with a small retinue in Sussex he was met by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who escorted him in apparently friendly fashion to Guildford. Having taken lodgings there, Alfred's men were attacked as they slept and killed, mutilated or enslaved by Godwin's followers, while the prince himself was blinded and imprisoned, dying shortly afterwards. This must have contributed to the antipathy between Godwin and Alfred's brother Edward the Confessor, who came to the throne in 1042.\nThis hostility peaked in 1051, when Godwin and his sons were driven into exile; returning the following year, the men of Surrey rose to support them, along with those of Sussex, Kent, Essex and elsewhere, helping them secure their reinstatement and the banishment of the king's Norman entourage. The repercussions of this antagonism helped bring about the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.\nThe Domesday Book records that the largest landowners in Surrey (then \"Sudrie\") at the end of Edward's reign were Chertsey Abbey and Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex and later king, followed by the estates of King Edward himself. Apart from the abbey, most of whose lands were within the shire, Surrey was not the principal focus of any major landowner's holdings, a tendency which was to persist in later periods. Given the vast and widespread landed interests and the national and international preoccupations of the monarchy and the earldom of Wessex, the Abbot of Chertsey was therefore probably the most important figure in the local elite.\nThe Anglo-Saxon period saw the emergence of the shire's internal division into 14 hundreds, which continued until Victorian times. These were the hundreds of Blackheath, Brixton, Copthorne, Effingham Half-Hundred, Elmbridge, Farnham, Godalming (hundred)|Godalming, Godley, Kingston, Reigate, Tandridge, Wallington, Woking and Wotton.\nLater Medieval Surrey.\nAfter the Battle of Hastings, the Norman army advanced through Kent into Surrey, where they defeated an English force which attacked them at Southwark and then burned that suburb. Rather than try to attack London across the river, the Normans continued west through Surrey, crossed the Thames at Wallingford in Berkshire and descended on London from the north-west. As was the case across England, the native ruling class of Surrey was virtually eliminated by Norman seizure of land. Only one significant English landowner, the brother of the last English Abbot of Chertsey, remained by the time the Domesday survey was conducted in 1086. At that time the largest landholding in Surrey, as in many other parts of the country, was the expanded royal estate, while the next largest holding belonged to Richard fitz Gilbert, founder of the de Clare family.\nIn 1088, King William II granted William de Warenne the title of Earl of Surrey as a reward for Warenne's loyalty during the rebellion that followed the death of William I. When the male line of the Warennes became extinct in the 14th century, the earldom was inherited by the Fitzalan Earls of Arundel. The Fitzalan line of Earls of Surrey died out in 1415, but after other short-lived revivals in the 15th century the title was conferred in 1483 on the Howard family, who still hold it. However, Surrey was not a major focus of any of these families' interests.\nGuildford Castle, one of many fortresses originally established by the Normans to help them subdue the country, was rebuilt in stone and developed as a royal palace in the 12th century. Farnham Castle was built during the 12th century as a residence for the Bishop of Winchester, while other stone castles were constructed in the same period at Bletchingley by the de Clares and at Reigate by the Warennes.\nDuring King John's struggle with the barons, Magna Carta was issued in June 1215 at Runnymede near Egham. John's efforts to reverse this concession reignited the war, and in 1216 the barons invited Prince Louis of France to take the throne. Having landed in Kent and been welcomed in London, he advanced across Surrey to attack John, then at Winchester, occupying Reigate and Guildford castles along the way.\nGuildford Castle later became one of the favourite residences of King Henry III, who considerably expanded the palace there. During the baronial revolt against Henry, in 1264 the rebel army of Simon de Montfort passed southwards through Surrey on their way to the Battle of Lewes in Sussex. Although the rebels were victorious, soon after the battle royal forces captured and destroyed Bletchingley Castle, whose owner Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester, was de Montfort's most powerful ally.\nBy the 14th century, castles were of dwindling military importance, but remained a mark of social prestige, leading to the construction of castles at Starborough near Lingfield by Lord Cobham, and at Betchworth by John Fitzalan, whose father had recently inherited the Earldom of Surrey. Though Reigate and Bletchingley remained modest settlements, the role of their castles as local centres for the two leading aristocratic interests in Surrey had enabled them to gain borough status by the early 13th century. As a result, they gained representation in Parliament when it became established towards the end of that century, alongside the more substantial urban settlements of Guildford and Southwark. Surrey's third sizeable town, Kingston, despite its size, borough status and historical association with the monarchy, did not gain parliamentary representation until 1832.\nSurrey had little political or economic significance in the Middle Ages. Its agricultural wealth was limited by the infertility of most of its soils, and it was not the main power-base of any important aristocratic family, nor the seat of a bishopric. The London suburb of Southwark was a major urban settlement, and the proximity of the capital boosted the wealth and population of the surrounding area, but urban development elsewhere was sapped by the overshadowing predominance of London and by the lack of direct access to the sea. Population pressure in the 12th and 13th centuries initiated the gradual clearing of the Weald, the forest spanning the borders of Surrey, Sussex and Kent, which had hitherto been left undeveloped due to the difficulty of farming on its heavy clay soil.\nSurrey's most significant source of prosperity in the later Middle Ages was the production of woollen cloth, which emerged during that period as England's main export industry. The county was an early centre of English textile manufacturing, benefiting from the presence of deposits of fuller's earth, the rare mineral composite important in the process of finishing cloth, around Reigate and Nutfield. The industry in Surrey was focused on Guildford, which gave its name to a variety of cloth, \"gilforte\", which was exported widely across Europe and the Middle East and imitated by manufacturers elsewhere in Europe. However, as the English cloth industry expanded, Surrey was outstripped by other growing regions of production.\nThough Surrey was not the scene of serious fighting in the various rebellions and civil wars of the period, armies from Kent heading for London via Southwark passed through what were then the extreme north-eastern fringes of Surrey during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and Cade's Rebellion in 1450, and at various stages of the Wars of the Roses in 1460, 1469 and 1471. The upheaval of 1381 also involved widespread local unrest in Surrey, as was the case all across south-eastern England, and some recruits from Surrey joined the Kentish rebel army.\nIn 1082 a Cluniac abbey was founded at Bermondsey by Alwine, a wealthy English citizen of London. Waverley Abbey near Farnham, founded in 1128, was the first Cistercian monastery in England. Over the next quarter-century monks spread out from here to found new houses, creating a network of twelve monasteries descended from Waverley across southern and central England. The 12th and early 13th centuries also saw the establishment of Augustinian priories at Merton, Newark, Tandridge, Southwark and Reigate. A Dominican friary was established at Guildford by Henry III's widow Eleanor of Provence, in memory of her grandson who had died at Guildford in 1274. In the 15th century a Carthusian priory was founded by King Henry V at Sheen. These would all perish, along with the still important Benedictine abbey of Chertsey, in the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries.\nNow fallen into disuse, some English counties had nicknames for those raised there such as a 'tyke' from Yorkshire, or a 'yellowbelly' from Lincolnshire. In the case of Surrey, the term was a 'Surrey capon', from Surrey's role in the later Middle Ages as the county where chickens were fattened up for the London meat markets.\nEarly Modern Surrey.\nUnder the early Tudor kings, magnificent royal palaces were constructed in northeastern Surrey, conveniently close to London. At Richmond an existing royal residence was rebuilt on a grand scale under King Henry VII, who also founded a Franciscan friary nearby in 1499. The still more spectacular palace of Nonsuch was later built for Henry VIII near Ewell. The palace at Guildford Castle had fallen out of use long before, but a royal hunting lodge existed outside the town. All these have since been demolished.\nDuring the Cornish Rebellion of 1497, the rebels heading for London briefly occupied Guildford and fought a skirmish with a government detachment on Guildown outside the town, before marching on to defeat at Blackheath in Kent. The forces of Wyatt's Rebellion in 1554 passed through what was then northeastern Surrey on their way from Kent to London, briefly occupying Southwark and then crossing the Thames at Kingston after failing to storm London Bridge.\nSurrey's cloth industry declined in the 16th century and collapsed in the 17th, harmed by falling standards and competition from more effective producers in other parts of England. The iron industry in the Weald, whose rich deposits had been exploited since prehistoric times, expanded and spread from its base in Sussex into Kent and Surrey after 1550. New furnace technology stimulated further growth in the early 17th century, but this hastened the extinction of the business as the mines were worked out. However, this period also saw the emergence of important new industries, centred on the valley of the Tillingbourne, south-east of Guildford, which often adapted watermills originally built for the now moribund cloth industry. The production of brass goods and wire in this area was relatively short-lived, falling victim to competitors in the Midlands in the mid-17th century, but the manufacture of paper and gunpowder proved more enduring. For a time in the mid-17th century the Surrey mills were the main producers of gunpowder in England.\nA glass industry also developed in the mid-16th century on the southwestern borders of Surrey, but had collapsed by 1630, as the wood-fired Surrey glassworks were surpassed by emerging coal-fired works elsewhere in England. The Wey Navigation, opened in 1653, was one of England's first canal systems.\nGeorge Abbot, the son of a Guildford clothworker, served as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1611\u20131633. In 1619 he founded Abbot's Hospital, an almshouse in Guildford, which is still operating. He also made unsuccessful efforts to revitalise the local cloth industry. One of his brothers, Robert, became Bishop of Salisbury, while another, Maurice, was a founding shareholder of the East India Company who became the company's Governor and later Lord Mayor of London.\nSouthwark expanded rapidly in this period, and by 1600, if considered as a separate entity, it was the second-largest urban area in England, behind only London itself. Parts of it were outside the jurisdiction of the government of the City of London, and as a result the area of Bankside became London's principal entertainment district, since the social control exercised there by the local authorities of Surrey was less effective and restrictive than that of the City authorities. Bankside was the scene of the golden age of Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre, with the work of playwrights including William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson and John Webster performed in its playhouses. The leading actor and impresario Edward Alleyn founded the College of God's Gift in Dulwich with an endowment including an art collection, which was later expanded and opened to the public in 1817, becoming Britain's first public art gallery.\nSurrey almost entirely escaped the direct impact of fighting during the main phase of the English Civil War in 1642\u20131646. The local Parliamentarian gentry led by Sir Richard Onslow were able to secure the county without difficulty on the outbreak of war. Farnham Castle was briefly occupied by the advancing Royalists in late 1642, but was easily stormed by the Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller. A new Royalist offensive in late 1643 saw skirmishing around Farnham between Waller's forces and Ralph Hopton's Royalists, but these brief incursions into the western fringes of Surrey marked the limits of Royalist advances on the county. At the end of 1643 Surrey combined with Kent, Sussex and Hampshire to form the South-Eastern Association, a military federation modelled on Parliament's existing Eastern Association.\nIn the uneasy peace that followed the Royalists' defeat, a political crisis in summer 1647 saw Sir Thomas Fairfax's New Model Army pass through Surrey on their way to occupy London, and subsequent billeting of troops in the county caused considerable discontent. During the brief Second Civil War of 1648, the Earl of Holland entered Surrey in July, hoping to ignite a Royalist revolt. He raised his standard at Kingston and advanced south, but found little support. After confused manoeuvres between Reigate and Dorking as Parliamentary troops closed in, his force of 500 men fled northwards and was overtaken and routed at Kingston.\nSurrey had a central role in the history of the radical political movements unleashed by the civil war. In October 1647 the first manifesto of the movement that became known as the Levellers, \"The Case of the Armie Truly Stated\", was drafted at Guildford by the elected representatives of army regiments and civilian radicals from London. This document combined specific grievances with wider demands for constitutional change on the basis of popular sovereignty. It formed the template for the more systematic and radical \"Agreement of the People\", drafted by the same men later that month. It also led to the Putney Debates shortly afterwards, in which its signatories met with Oliver Cromwell and other senior officers in the Surrey village of Putney, where the army had established its headquarters, to argue over the future political constitution of England. In 1649 the Diggers, led by Gerrard Winstanley, established their communal settlement at St. George's Hill near Weybridge to implement egalitarian ideals of common ownership, but were eventually driven out by the local landowners through violence and litigation. A smaller Digger commune was then established near Cobham, but suffered the same fate in 1650.\nModern history.\nPrior to the Reform Act 1832, Surrey returned fourteen Members of Parliament (MPs), two representing the county and two each from the six boroughs of Bletchingley, Gatton, Guildford, Haslemere, Reigate and Southwark. For two centuries before the Reform Act, the dominant political network in Surrey was that of the Onslows of Clandon Park, a gentry family established in the county from the early 17th century, who were raised to the peerage in 1716. Members of the family won at least one of Surrey's two county seats in all but three of the 30 general elections between 1628 and 1768, while they took one or both of the seats for their local borough of Guildford in every election from 1660 to 1830, usually representing the Whig Party after its emergence in the late 1670s. Successive heads of the family held the post of Lord Lieutenant of Surrey continuously from 1716 to 1814.\nOne of the principal residences of the British monarchy in the 18th century was Kew Palace in north Surrey, leased by Queen Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach in 1728 and inhabited by her son Frederick, Prince of Wales, and later by King George III and Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. After the latter's death at the palace in 1818 it was sold. The White House was demolished about this time, but the Dutch House survives and is now a museum.\nIn 1765 the Richmond Theatre was built in Surrey under the supervision of David Garrick. It was modelled after the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and served as one of Surrey's main theatre's until it was demolished in 1884.\nUntil the modern era Surrey, apart from its northeastern corner, was quite sparsely populated in comparison with many parts of southern England, and remained somewhat rustic despite its proximity to the capital. Communications began to improve, and the influence of London to increase, with the development of turnpike roads and a stagecoach system in the 18th century. A far more profound transformation followed with the arrival of the railways, beginning in the late 1830s. The availability of rapid transport enabled prosperous London workers to settle all across Surrey and travel daily to work in the capital. This phenomenon of commuting brought explosive growth to Surrey's population and wealth, and tied its economy and society inextricably to London.\nThere was rapid expansion in existing towns like Guildford, Farnham, and most spectacularly Croydon, while new towns such as Woking and Redhill emerged beside the railway lines. The huge numbers of incomers to the county and the transformation of rural, farming communities into a \"commuter belt\" contributed to a decline in the traditional local culture, including the gradual demise of the distinctive Surrey dialect. This may have survived among the \"Surrey Men\" into the late 19th century, but is now extinct.\nMeanwhile, London itself spread swiftly across north-eastern Surrey. In 1800 it extended only to Vauxhall; a century later the city's growth had reached as far as Putney and Streatham. This expansion was reflected in the creation of the County of London in 1889, detaching the areas subsumed by the city from Surrey. The expansion of London continued in the 20th century, engulfing Croydon, Kingston and many smaller settlements. This led to a further contraction of Surrey in 1965 with the creation of Greater London, under the London Government Act 1963; however, Staines and Sunbury-on-Thames, previously in Middlesex, were transferred to Surrey, extending the county across the Thames. Surrey's boundaries were altered again in 1974 when Gatwick Airport was transferred to West Sussex.\nIn 1849 Brookwood Cemetery was established near Woking to serve the population of London, connected to the capital by its own railway service. It soon developed into the largest burial ground in the world. Woking was also the site of Britain's first crematorium, which opened in 1878, and its first mosque, founded in 1889. In 1881 Godalming became the first town in the world with a public electricity supply.\nThe eastern part of Surrey was transferred from the Diocese of Winchester to that of Rochester in 1877. In 1905 this area was separated to form a new Diocese of Southwark. The rest of the county, together with part of eastern Hampshire, was separated from Winchester in 1927 to become the Diocese of Guildford, whose cathedral was consecrated in 1961.\nDuring the later 19th century Surrey became important in the development of architecture in Britain and the wider world. Its traditional building forms made a significant contribution to the vernacular revival architecture associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, and would exert a lasting influence. The prominence of Surrey peaked in the 1890s, when it was the focus for globally important developments in domestic architecture, in particular the early work of Edwin Lutyens, who grew up in the county and was greatly influenced by its traditional styles and materials.\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the demise of Surrey's long-standing industries manufacturing paper and gunpowder. Most of the county's paper mills closed in the years after 1870, and the last survivor shut in 1928. Gunpowder production fell victim to the First World War, which brought about a huge expansion of the British munitions industry, followed by sharp contraction and consolidation when the war ended, leading to the closure of the Surrey powder mills.\nNew industrial developments included the establishment of the vehicle manufacturers Dennis Brothers in Guildford in 1895. Beginning as a maker of bicycles and then of cars, the firm soon shifted into the production of commercial and utility vehicles, becoming internationally important as a manufacturer of fire engines and buses. Though much reduced in size and despite multiple changes of ownership, this business continued to operate in Guildford until 2020. Kingston and nearby Ham became a centre of aircraft manufacturing, with the establishment in 1912 of the Sopwith Aviation Company and in 1920 of its successor H.G. Hawker Engineering, which later became Hawker Aviation and then Hawker Siddeley.\nDuring the Second World War a section of the GHQ Stop Line, a system of pillboxes, gun emplacements, anti-tank obstacles and other fortifications, was constructed along the North Downs. This line, running from Somerset to Yorkshire, was intended as the principal fixed defence of London and the industrial core of England against the threat of invasion. German invasion plans envisaged that the main thrust of their advance inland would cross the North Downs at the gap in the ridge formed by the Wey valley, thus colliding with the defence line around Guildford.\nBetween the wars Croydon Airport, opened in 1920, served as the main airport for London, but it was superseded after the Second World War by Heathrow, and closed in 1959. Gatwick Airport, where commercial flights began in 1933, expanded greatly in the 1950s and 1960s, but the area occupied by the airport was transferred from Surrey to West Sussex in 1974.\nIn June 1972, British European Airways Flight 548 crashed near Staines just after taking off from Heathrow Airport. This remains the worst air accident in the UK.\nHistoric architecture and monuments.\nFew traces of the ancient British and Roman periods survive in Surrey. There are a number of round barrows and bell barrows in various locations, mostly dating to the Bronze Age. Remains of Iron Age hillforts exist at Holmbury Hill, Hascombe Hill, Anstiebury (near Capel), Dry Hill (near Lingfield), St Ann's Hill (Chertsey) and St George's Hill (Weybridge). Most of these sites were created in the 1st century BC and many were re-occupied during the middle of the 1st century AD. Only fragments of Stane Street and Ermine Street, the Roman roads which crossed the county, remain.\nAnglo-Saxon elements survive in a number of Surrey churches, notably at Guildford (St Mary), Godalming (St Peter &amp; St Paul), Stoke D'Abernon (St Mary), Thursley, Witley, Compton and Albury (in \"Old Albury\").\nNumerous medieval churches exist in Surrey, but the county's parish churches are typically relatively small and simple, and experienced particularly widespread destruction and remodelling of their form in the course of Victorian restoration. Important medieval church interiors survive at Chaldon, Lingfield, Stoke D'Abernon, Compton and Dunsfold. Large monastic churches fell into ruin after their institutions were dissolved, although fragments of Waverley Abbey and Newark Priory survive. Southwark Priory, no longer in Surrey has survived, though much altered, and is now Southwark Cathedral. Farnham Castle largely retains its medieval structure, while the keep and fragments of the curtain walls and palace buildings survive at Guildford Castle.\nVery little non-military secular architecture survives in Surrey from earlier than the 15th century. Wholly or partially surviving houses and barns from that century, with considerable later modifications, include those at Wanborough Manor, Bletchingley, Littleton, East Horsley, Ewhurst, Dockenfield, Lingfield, Limpsfield, Oxted, Crowhurst Place, Haslemere and Old Surrey Hall.\nMajor examples of 16th-century architecture include the grand mid-century country houses of Loseley Park and Sutton Place and the old building of the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, founded in 1509. A considerable number of smaller houses and public houses of the 16th century are also still standing. From the 17th century the number of surviving buildings proliferates further. Abbot's Hospital, founded in 1619, is a grand edifice built in the Tudor style, despite its date. More characteristic examples of major 17th-century building include West Horsley Place, Slyfield Manor, and the Guildhall in Guildford.\nLocal government.\nHistory.\nThe Local Government Act 1888 reorganised county-level local government throughout England and Wales. Accordingly, the administrative county of Surrey was formed in 1889 when the Provisional Surrey County Council first met, consisting of 19 aldermen and 57 councillors. The county council assumed the administrative responsibilities previously exercised by the county's justices in quarter sessions. The county had revised boundaries, with the north east of the historic county bordering the City of London becoming part of a new County of London. These areas now form the London Boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark and Wandsworth, and the Penge area of the London Borough of Bromley. At the same time, the borough of Croydon became a county borough, outside the jurisdiction of the county council.\nFor purposes other than local government the administrative county of Surrey and county borough of Croydon continued to form a \"county of Surrey\" to which a Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum (chief magistrate) and a High Sheriff were appointed.\nSurrey had been administered from Newington since the 1790s, and the county council was initially based in the sessions house there. As Newington was included in the County of London, it lay outside the area administered by the council, and a site for a new county hall within the administrative county was sought. By 1890 six towns were being considered: Epsom, Guildford, Kingston, Redhill, Surbiton and Wimbledon. In 1891 it was decided to build the new County Hall at Kingston, and the building opened in 1893, but this site was also overtaken by the growing London conurbation, and by the 1930s most of the north of the county had been built over, becoming outer suburbs of London, although continuing to form part of Surrey administratively.\nIn 1960 the report of the Herbert Commission recommended that much of north Surrey (including Kingston and Croydon) be included in a new \"Greater London\". These recommendations were enacted in highly modified form in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963. The areas that now form the London Boroughs of Croydon, Kingston, Merton, and Sutton and that part of Richmond south of the River Thames, were transferred from Surrey to Greater London. At the same time part of the county of Middlesex, which had been abolished by the legislation, was added to Surrey. This area now forms the borough of Spelthorne.\nFurther local government reform under the Local Government Act 1972 took place in 1974. The 1972 Act abolished administrative counties and introduced non-metropolitan counties in their place. The boundaries of the non-metropolitan county of Surrey were similar to those of the administrative county with the exception of Gatwick Airport and some surrounding land which was transferred to West Sussex. It was originally proposed that the parishes of Horley and Charlwood would become part of West Sussex; however this met fierce local opposition and it was reversed by the Charlwood and Horley Act 1974.\nToday.\nFollowing the elections of May 2021 the County Councillors' party affiliations were as follows:\nAs of 2 May 2019, the Conservative local councillors controlled 4 out of 11 councils in Surrey, the Liberal Democrats controlled Mole Valley, the Residents Associations of Epsom and Ewell controlled Epsom and Ewell, and the remaining 5 are in No Overall Control. Of the five No Overall Control councils, Elmbridge and Waverley were both run by coalitions of Residents and Liberal Democrats, Guildford was run by a Liberal Democrats minority administration, and Tandridge and Woking were both run by Conservative minority administrations.\nAs part of the proposed local government reorganisation in 2026, the existing twelve councils would be amalgamated into two unitary councils, East and West Surrey. East Surrey would consist of the former boroughs of Elmbridge, Mole Valley, Epsom and Ewell, Reigate and Banstead, and Tandridge. West Surrey would comprise Spelthorne, Surrey Heath, Runnymede, Woking, Guildford and Waverley. The change, once brought into law by parliament, would take effect in April 2027.\nAt Westminster the county is represented by 13 Parliamentary constituencies within the county borders. The Conservative Party holds seven seats and the Liberal Democrats hold six.\nEconomy.\nSurrey has a number of organisational and company headquarters, including electronics manufacturers Canon, Toshiba, Samsung and Philips distributors Burlodge, Future Electronics, Kia Motors and Toyota UK, the medico-pharma companies Pfizer and Sanofi-Aventis and oil giant Esso. Some of the largest fast-moving consumer goods multinationals in the world have their UK and/or European headquarters here, including Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, Superdrug, Nestl\u00e9, SC Johnson, Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive. NGOs including WWF UK &amp; Compassion in World Farming are also based here.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nThree major motorways pass through the county. These are:\nOther major roads include:\nRail.\nMuch of Surrey lies within the London commuter belt with regular services into Central London. South Western Railway is the sole train operator in Elmbridge, Runnymede, Spelthorne, Surrey Heath, Woking and Waverley, and the main train operator in the Borough of Guildford, running regular services into London Waterloo and regional services towards the south coast and South west. Southern is the main train operator in Mole Valley, Epsom and Ewell and Reigate and Banstead and the sole train operator in Tandridge, providing services into London Bridge and London Victoria.\nThere are many railway lines in the county, those of note include the Waterloo to Reading Line, South West Main Line, Portsmouth Direct Line, Sutton and Mole Valley Lines (from Horsham, West Sussex itself on the Arun Valley Line from Littlehampton) and the Brighton Main Line.\nThe Waterloo to Reading Line calls at Virginia Water, Egham, and Staines in Surrey. The South West Main Line calls at Woking and up to six other Surrey stops including Walton-on-Thames. The Portsmouth Direct Line is significant in linking Haslemere, Godalming and Guildford to the South West Main Line at Woking. The Sutton and Mole Valley Lines link Dorking, Leatherhead, Ashtead, Epsom to Waterloo via Ewell West or London Victoria via Ewell East. The Brighton Main Line calls at Horley and Redhill before reaching either London Bridge or London Victoria. Reigate is on the east\u2013west North Downs Line.\nConsequently, the towns Staines, Woking, Guildford, Walton-on-Thames, Epsom and Ewell and Reigate and Redhill, statistically the largest examples, are established rapid-transit commuter towns for Central London. The above routes have had a stimulative effect. The relative development of Surrey at the time of the Beeching cuts led to today's retention of numerous other commuter routes except the Cranleigh Line, all with direct services to London, including:\nThe only diesel route is the east\u2013west North Downs Line, which runs from Reading via Guildford, Dorking Deepdene, Reigate and Redhill, thence to Gatwick Airport\nThe major stations in the county are Guildford (8.0\u00a0million passengers), Woking (7.4\u00a0million passengers), Epsom (3.6\u00a0million passengers), Redhill (3.6\u00a0million passengers) and Staines (2.9\u00a0million passengers).\nAir.\nBoth Heathrow (in the London Borough of Hillingdon) and Gatwick (in Crawley Borough, West Sussex) have a perimeter road in Surrey. First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley operates a RailAir coach service from Guildford and Woking to Heathrow Airport and there are early-until-late buses to nearby Surrey towns.\nFairoaks Airport on the edge of Chobham and Ottershaw is from Woking town centre and operates as a private airfield with two training schools and is home to other aviation businesses.\nRedhill Aerodrome is also in Surrey.\nEducation.\nThe UK has a comprehensive, state-funded education system, accordingly Surrey has 37 state secondary schools, 17 Academies, 7 sixth form colleges and 55 state primaries. The county has 41 independent schools, including Charterhouse (one of the nine independent schools mentioned in the Public Schools Act 1868) and the Royal Grammar School, Guildford. More than half the state secondary schools in Surrey have sixth forms. Brooklands (twinned with a site in Ashford, Surrey), Reigate, Esher, Egham, Woking and Waverley host sixth-form equivalent colleges each with technical specialisations and standard sixth-form study courses. Brooklands College offers aerospace and automotive design, engineering and allied study courses reflecting the aviation and motor industry leading UK research and maintenance hubs nearby.\nEmergency services.\nSurrey is served by the following emergency services:\nPlaces of interest.\nSignificant landscapes in Surrey include Box Hill just north of Dorking; the Devil's Punch Bowl at Hindhead and Frensham Common. Leith Hill southwest of Dorking in the Greensand Ridge is the second highest point in southeast England. Witley Common and Thursley Common are expansive areas of ancient heathland south of Godalming run by the National Trust and Ministry of Defence. The [Surrey Hills are an area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB).\nMore manicured landscapes can be seen at Claremont Landscape Garden, south of Esher (dating from 1715). There is also Winkworth Arboretum southeast of Godalming and Windlesham Arboretum near Lightwater created in the 20th century. Wisley is home to the Royal Horticultural Society gardens. Kew, historically part of Surrey but now in Greater London, features the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, as well as The National Archives for England &amp; Wales.\nThere are 80 Surrey Wildlife Trust reserves with at least one in all 11 non-metropolitan districts.\nSurrey's important country houses include the Tudor mansion of Loseley Park, built in the 1560s and Clandon House, an 18th-century Palladian mansion in West Clandon to the east of Guildford. Nearby Hatchlands Park in East Clandon, was built in 1758 with Robert Adam interiors and a collection of keyboard instruments. Polesden Lacey south of Great Bookham is a regency villa with extensive grounds. On a smaller scale, Oakhurst Cottage in Hambledon near Godalming is a restored 16th-century worker's home. Shalford Mill, on the Tillingbourne, is an 18th-century water-mill.\nA canal system, the Wey and Godalming Navigations is administered at Dapdune Wharf in Guildford, where an exhibition commemorates the work of the canal system and is home to a restored Wey barge, the Reliance. The Wey and Arun Canal is being restored by volunteers with hopes of a future full reopening.\nRunnymede at Egham is the site of the sealing of Magna Carta in 1215.\nGuildford Cathedral is a 20th-century cathedral built from bricks made from the clay of the hill on which it stands.\nBrooklands Museum recognises the motoring and aeronautical past of Surrey. The county is also home to the Thorpe Park theme park.\nSport.\nSurrey football clubs.\nThe county has numerous football teams. In the Combined Counties League can be found the likes of Ash United, Badshot Lea, Banstead Athletic, Camberley Town, Chessington &amp; Hook United, Cobham, Epsom &amp; Ewell, Epsom Athletic, Farleigh Rovers, Farnham Town, Frimley Green, Horley Town, Knaphill, Mole Valley SCR, Molesey, Sheerwater, Spelthorne Sports and Westfield; Lingfield play at the same level but in the Southern Combination; Ashford Town, Chertsey Town, Godalming Town and Guildford City play higher in the Southern League; equally Leatherhead, Merstham, Redhill, South Park, Staines Town, Walton Casuals and Walton and Hersham are in the Isthmian; Dorking Wanderers and Woking are currently the highest ranked Surrey based clubs, playing in the National League.\nChelsea F.C. practice at the Cobham Training Centre located in the village of Stoke d'Abernon near Cobham, Surrey. The training ground was built in 2004 and officially opened in 2007.\nIn popular culture.\nThe opening of H. G. Wells 1898 novel \"War of the Worlds\" is set on Horsell Common near Woking, the author's home town.\nA key scene of Jane Austen's 1815 novel \"Emma\" takes place on Box Hill.\nThe county is the setting of the fictional town of Little Whinging, where Harry Potter was raised in the books by J.K. Rowling.\nThe county has also been used as a film location. In the 1976 film \"The Omen\", the scenes at the cathedral were filmed at Guildford Cathedral.\nNotable people.\nLiterature.\nBesides its role in Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre, many important writers have lived and worked in Surrey.\nPopular music.\nThe \"Surrey Delta\" produced many of the musicians in 1960s British blues movements. The Rolling Stones developed their music at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48190", "revid": "49851864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48190", "title": "Commodity market", "text": "Physical or virtual transactions of buying and selling involving raw or primary commodities\nA commodity market is a market that trades in the primary economic sector rather than manufactured products. The primary sector includes agricultural products, energy products, and metals. Soft commodities may be perishable and harvested, while hard commodities are usually mined, such as gold and oil. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodities market for centuries for price risk management.\nA financial derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from a commodity termed an underlier. Derivatives are either exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC). An increasing number of derivatives are traded via clearing houses some with central counterparty clearing, which provide clearing and settlement services on a futures exchange, as well as off-exchange in the OTC market.\nDerivatives such as futures contracts, Swaps (1970s\u2013), and Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003\u2013) have become the primary trading instruments in commodity markets. Futures are traded on regulated commodities exchanges. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are \"privately negotiated bilateral contracts entered into between the contracting parties directly\".\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) began to feature commodities in 2003. Gold ETFs are based on \"electronic gold\" that does not entail the ownership of physical bullion, with its added costs of insurance and storage in repositories such as the London bullion market. According to the World Gold Council, ETFs allow investors to be exposed to the gold market without the risk of price volatility associated with gold as a physical commodity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nCommodity-based money and commodity markets in a crude early form are believed to have originated in Sumer between 4500 BC and 4000 BC. Sumerians first used clay tokens sealed in a clay vessel, then clay writing tablets to represent the amount\u2014for example, the number of goats, to be delivered. These promises of time and date of delivery resemble futures contract.\nEarly civilizations variously used pigs, rare seashells, or other items as commodity money. Since that time traders have sought ways to simplify and standardize trade contracts.\nGold and silver markets evolved in classical civilizations. At first, the precious metals were valued for their beauty and intrinsic worth and were associated with royalty. In time, they were used for trading and were exchanged for other goods and commodities, or for payments of labor. Gold, measured out, then became money. Gold's scarcity, its unique density and the way it could be easily melted, shaped, and measured made it a natural trading asset.\nBeginning in the late 10th century, commodity markets grew as a mechanism for allocating goods, labor, land and capital across Europe. Between the late 11th and the late 13th century, English urbanization, regional specialization, expanded and improved infrastructure, the increased use of coinage and the proliferation of markets and fairs were evidence of commercialization. The spread of markets is illustrated by the 1466 installation of reliable scales in the villages of Sloten and Osdorp so villagers no longer had to travel to Haarlem or Amsterdam to weigh their locally produced cheese and butter.\nThe Amsterdam Stock Exchange, often cited as the first stock exchange, originated as a market for the exchange of commodities. Early trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange often involved the use of very sophisticated contracts, including short sales, forward contracts, and options. \"Trading took place at the Amsterdam Bourse, an open aired venue, which was created as a commodity exchange in 1530 and rebuilt in 1608. Commodity exchanges themselves were a relatively recent invention, existing in only a handful of cities.\"\nIn 1864, in the United States, wheat, corn, cattle, and pigs were widely traded using standard instruments on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world's oldest futures and options exchange. Other food commodities were added to the Commodity Exchange Act and traded through CBOT in the 1930s and 1940s, expanding the list from grains to include rice, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Irish potatoes and soybeans. Successful commodity markets require broad consensus on product variations to make each commodity acceptable for trading, such as the purity of gold in bullion. Classical civilizations built complex global markets trading gold or silver for spices, cloth, wood and weapons, most of which had standards of quality and timeliness.\nThrough the 19th century \"the exchanges became effective spokesmen for, and innovators of, improvements in transportation, warehousing, and financing, which paved the way to expanded interstate and international trade.\"\nReputation and clearing became central concerns, and states that could handle them most effectively developed powerful financial centers.\nCommodity price index.\nIn 1934, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began the computation of a daily Commodity price index that became available to the public in 1940. By 1952, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a Spot Market Price Index that measured the price movements of \"22 sensitive basic commodities whose markets are presumed to be among the first to be influenced by changes in economic conditions. As such, it serves as one early indication of impending changes in business activity.\"\nCommodity index fund.\nA commodity index fund is a fund whose assets are invested in financial instruments based on or linked to a commodity index. In just about every case the index is in fact a Commodity Futures Index. The first such index was the Dow Jones Commodity Index, which began in 1933. The first practically investable commodity futures index was the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, created in 1991, and known as the \"GSCI\". The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After AIG's financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to UBS and it is now known as the DJUBS index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / CRB index (which is the old CRB Index as re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.\nCash commodity.\nCash commodities or \"actuals\" refer to the physical goods\u2014e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, crude oil, gold, silver\u2014that someone is buying/selling/trading as distinguished from derivatives.\nElectronic commodities trading.\nIn traditional stock market exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), most trading activity took place in the trading pits in face-to-face interactions between brokers and dealers in open outcry trading. In 1992 the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol was introduced, allowing international real-time exchange of information regarding market transactions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ordered U.S. stock markets to convert from the fractional system to a decimal system by April 2001. Metrification, conversion from the imperial system of measurement to the metrical, increased throughout the 20th century. Eventually FIX-compliant interfaces were adopted globally by commodity exchanges using the FIX Protocol. In 2001 the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (later merged into the CME group, the world's largest futures exchange company) launched their FIX-compliant interface.\nBy 2011, the alternative trading system (ATS) of electronic trading featured computers buying and selling without human dealer intermediation. High-frequency trading (HFT) algorithmic trading, had almost phased out \"dinosaur floor-traders\".\nComplexity and interconnectedness of global market.\nThe robust growth of emerging market economies (EMEs, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China), beginning in the 1990s, \"propelled commodity markets into a supercycle\". The size and diversity of commodity markets expanded internationally, and pension funds and sovereign wealth funds started allocating more capital to commodities, in order to diversify into an asset class with less exposure to currency depreciation.\nIn 2012, as emerging-market economies slowed down, commodity prices peaked and started to decline. From 2005 through 2013, energy and metals' real prices remained well above their long-term averages. In 2012, real food prices were their highest since 1982.\nThe price of gold bullion fell dramatically on 12 April 2013 and analysts frantically sought explanations. Rumors spread that the European Central Bank (ECB) would force Cyprus to sell its gold reserves in response to its financial crisis. Major banks such as Goldman Sachs began immediately to short gold bullion. Investors scrambled to liquidate their exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and margin call selling accelerated. George Gero, precious metals commodities expert at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) Wealth Management section reported that he had not seen selling of gold bullion as panicked as this in his forty years in commodity markets.\nThe earliest commodity exchange-traded fund (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares NYSE\u00a0Arca:\u00a0[ GLD] and iShares Silver Trust NYSE\u00a0Arca:\u00a0[ SLV], actually owned the physical commodities. Similar to these are NYSE\u00a0Arca:\u00a0[ PALL] (palladium) and NYSE\u00a0Arca:\u00a0[ PPLT] (platinum). However, most Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs) implement a futures trading strategy. At the time Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned that Russia could sink into recession. He argued that \"We live in a dynamic, fast-developing world. It is so global and so complex that we sometimes cannot keep up with the changes\". Analysts have claimed that Russia's economy is overly dependent on commodities.\nContracts in the commodity market.\nA Spot contract is an agreement where delivery and payment either takes place immediately, or with a short lag. Physical trading normally involves a visual inspection and is carried out in physical markets such as a farmers market. Derivatives markets, on the other hand, require the existence of agreed standards so that trades can be made without visual inspection.\nStandardization.\nUS soybean futures do not qualify as \"standard grade\" if they are \"GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)\". They are of \"deliverable grade\" if they are \"GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)\". Note the distinction between states, and the need to clearly mention their status as GMO (genetically modified organism) which makes them unacceptable to most organic food buyers.\nSimilar specifications apply for cotton, orange juice, cocoa, sugar, wheat, corn, barley, pork bellies, milk, feed stuffs, fruits, vegetables, other grains, other beans, hay, other livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, or any other commodity which is so traded.\nStandardization has also occurred technologically, as the use of the FIX Protocol by commodities exchanges has allowed trade messages to be sent, received and processed in the same format as stocks or equities. This process began in 2001 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched a FIX-compliant interface that was adopted by commodity exchanges around the world.\nDerivatives.\nDerivatives evolved from simple commodity future contracts into a diverse group of financial instruments that apply to every kind of asset, including mortgages, insurance and many more. Futures contracts, Swaps (1970s\u2013), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003\u2013), forward contracts, etc. are examples. They can be traded through formal exchanges or through Over-the-counter (OTC). Commodity market derivatives unlike credit default derivatives, for example, are secured by the physical assets or commodities.\nForward contracts.\nA forward contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange at a fixed future date a given quantity of a commodity for a specific price defined when the contract is finalized. The fixed price is also called forward price. Such forward contracts began as a way of reducing pricing risk in food and agricultural product markets. By agreeing in advance on a price for a future delivery, farmers were able protect their output against a possible fall of market prices and in contrast buyers were able to protect themselves against a possible rise of market prices.\nForward contracts, for example, were used for rice in seventeenth century Japan.\nFutures contract.\nFutures contracts are standardized forward contracts that are transacted through an exchange. In futures contracts the buyer and the seller stipulate product, grade, quantity and location and leaving price as the only variable.\nAgricultural futures contracts are the oldest, in use in the United States for more than 170 years. Modern futures agreements, began in Chicago in the 1840s, with the appearance of grain elevators. Chicago, centrally located, emerged as the hub between Midwestern farmers and east coast consumer population centers.\nCall options.\nIn a call option counterparties enter into a financial contract option where the buyer purchases the right but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price). The seller (or \"writer\") is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right.\nSwaps.\nA swap is a derivative in which counterparties exchange the cash flows of one party's financial instrument for those of the other party's financial instrument. They were introduced in the 1970s.\nExchange-traded commodities (ETCs).\nExchange-traded commodity is a term used for commodity ETFs (which are funds) or commodity exchange-traded notes (which are notes). These track the performance of an underlying commodity index including total return indices based on a single commodity. They are similar to ETFs and traded and settled exactly like stock funds. ETCs have market maker support with guaranteed liquidity, enabling investors to easily invest in commodities.\nThey were introduced in 2003.\nAt first, only professional institutional investors had access, but online exchanges opened some ETC markets to almost anyone. ETCs were introduced partly in response to the tight supply of commodities in 2000, combined with record low inventories and increasing demand from emerging markets such as China and India.\nPrior to the introduction of ETCs, by the 1990s ETFs pioneered by Barclays Global Investors (BGI) revolutionized the mutual funds industry. By the end of December 2009 BGI assets hit an all-time high of $1 trillion.\nGold was the first commodity to be securitised through an ETF in the early 1990s, but it was not available for trade until 2003. The idea of a Gold ETF was first officially conceptualised by Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd in India, when they filed a proposal with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in May 2002. The first gold exchange-traded fund was Gold Bullion Securities launched on the ASX in 2003, and the first silver exchange-traded fund was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in 2006. As of November 2010 a commodity ETF, namely SPDR Gold Shares, was the second-largest ETF by market capitalization.\nGenerally, commodity ETFs are index funds tracking non-security indices. Because they do not invest in securities, commodity ETFs are not regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the United States, although their public offering is subject to SEC review and they need an SEC no-action letter under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They may, however, be subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nThe earliest commodity ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares NYSE\u00a0Arca:\u00a0[ GLD] and iShares Silver Trust NYSE\u00a0Arca:\u00a0[ SLV], actually owned the physical commodity (e.g., gold and silver bars). Similar to these are NYSE\u00a0Arca:\u00a0[ PALL] (palladium) and NYSE\u00a0Arca:\u00a0[ PPLT] (platinum). However, most ETCs implement a futures trading strategy, which may produce quite different results from owning the commodity.\nCommodity ETFs trade provide exposure to an increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. Many commodity funds, such as oil roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This provides exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the \"term structure\", such as a high cost to roll.\nETCs in China and India gained in importance due to those countries' emergence as commodities consumers and producers. China accounted for more than 60% of exchange-traded commodities in 2009, up from 40% the previous year. The global volume of ETCs increased by a 20% in 2010, and 50% since 2008, to around 2.5 billion million contracts.\nOver-the-counter (OTC) commodities derivatives.\nOver-the-counter (OTC) commodities derivatives trading originally involved two parties, without an exchange. Exchange trading offers greater transparency and regulatory protections. In an OTC trade, the price is not generally made public. OTC commodities derivatives are higher risk but may also lead to higher profits.\nBetween 2007 and 2010, global physical exports of commodities fell by 2%, while the outstanding value of OTC commodities derivatives declined by two-thirds as investors reduced risk following a five-fold increase in the previous three years.\nMoney under management more than doubled between 2008 and 2010 to nearly $380 billion. Inflows into the sector totaled over $60 billion in 2010, the second-highest year on record, down from $72 billion the previous year. The bulk of funds went into precious metals and energy products. The growth in prices of many commodities in 2010 contributed to the increase in the value of commodities funds under management.\nCommodities exchange.\nA commodities exchange is an exchange where various commodities and derivatives are traded. Most commodity markets across the world trade in agricultural products and other raw materials (like wheat, barley, sugar, maize, cotton, cocoa, coffee, milk products, pork bellies, oil, metals, etc.) and contracts based on them. These contracts can include spot prices, forwards, futures and options on futures. Other sophisticated products may include interest rates, environmental instruments, swaps, or freight contracts.\nTraded commodity classes.\nSource: World's Top Exports\nEnergy.\nEnergy commodities include crude oil particularly West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and Brent crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, ethanol and purified terephthalic acid. Hedging is a common practice for these commodities.\nCrude oil and natural gas.\nBrent Crude serves as the world's leading crude oil benchmark, used to price more than 75% of globally traded oil cargoes due to its waterborne nature and broad market access. Brent Crude, assessed daily by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights as Dated Brent, reflects physical cargo loadings from the North Sea two weeks ahead. In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) functions as the primary benchmark; this light, sweet crude grades as the underlying commodity for futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), part of CME Group. WTI, with lower sulfur content than Brent, trades at a premium to heavier grades such as Dubai or Oman.\nCrude oil grades range from light to heavy, based on density and sulfur levels. As the first energy source to achieve widespread commodity trading status, oil prices remain sensitive to geopolitical events in producer nations, including Iraq, Iran, and Venezuela. However, trading volumes on major exchanges reflect broader market participation beyond regional politics.\nCrude oil and refined products trade in standard contracts of 1,000 barrels (42,000 US gallons; 160,000 L). WTI futures appear under symbol CL on NYMEX and WBS on Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Brent futures trade under BRN on ICE and BZ on CME. Refined products include Gulf Coast gasoline (symbol LR on NYMEX), reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending (RBOB; symbol RB on NYMEX), and propane (symbol PN on NYMEX, an ICE subsidiary since 2013).\nNatural gas trades in contracts of 10,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu). Henry Hub natural gas futures use symbol NG on NYMEX. Heating oil futures, symbol HO on NYMEX, represent ultra-low sulfur diesel equivalents in 42,000-gallon lots.\nOthers.\nPurified terephthalic acid (PTA) is traded through ZCE in units of 5 tons with the trading symbol of TA. Ethanol is traded at CBOT in units of 29,000 U.S. gal under trading symbols AC (Open Auction) and ZE (Electronic).\nMetals.\nPrecious metals.\nPrecious metals currently traded on the commodity market include gold, platinum, palladium and silver which are sold by the troy ounce. One of the main exchanges for these precious metals is COMEX.\nAccording to the World Gold Council, investments in gold are the primary driver of industry growth. Gold prices are highly volatile, driven by large flows of speculative money.\nIndustrial metals.\nIndustrial metals are sold by the metric ton through the London Metal Exchange and New York Mercantile Exchange. The London Metal Exchange trades include copper, aluminium, lead, tin, aluminium alloy, nickel, cobalt and molybdenum. In 2007, steel began trading on the London Metal Exchange.\nIron ore has been the latest addition to industrial metal derivatives. Deutsche Bank first began offering iron ore swaps in 2008, other banks quickly followed. Since then the size of the market has more than doubled each year between 2008 and 2012.\nAgriculture.\nAgricultural commodities include grains, food and fiber as well as livestock and meat, various regulatory bodies define agricultural products.\nIn 1900, corn acreage was double that of wheat in the United States. But from the 1930s through the 1970s soybean acreage surpassed corn. Early in the 1970s grain and soybean prices, which had been relatively stable, \"soared to levels that were unimaginable at the time\". There were a number of factors affecting prices including the \"surge in crude oil prices caused by the Arab Oil Embargo in October 1973 (U.S. inflation reached 11% in 1975)\".\nOn 21 July 2010, United States Congress passed the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with changes to the definition of agricultural commodity. The operational definition used by Dodd-Frank includes \"[a]ll other commodities that are, or once were, or are derived from, living organisms, including plant, animal and aquatic life, which are generally fungible, within their respective classes, and are used primarily for human food, shelter, animal feed, or natural fiber\". Three other categories were explained and listed.\nIn February 2013, Cornell Law School included lumber, soybeans, oilseeds, livestock (live cattle and hogs), dairy products. Agricultural commodities can include lumber (timber and forests), grains excluding stored grain (wheat, oats, barley, rye, grain sorghum, cotton, flax, forage, tame hay, native grass), vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, dry beans, dry peas, freezing and canning peas), fruit (citrus such as oranges, apples, grapes) corn, tobacco, rice, peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane, sunflowers, raisins, nursery crops, nuts, soybean complex, aquacultural fish farm species such as finfish, mollusk, crustacean, aquatic invertebrate, amphibian, reptile, or plant life cultivated in aquatic plant farms.\nDiamonds.\nAs of 2012, diamond was not traded as a commodity. Institutional investors were repelled by campaign against \"blood diamonds\", the monopoly structure of the diamond market and the lack of uniform standards for diamond pricing. In 2012 the SEC reviewed a proposal to create the \"first diamond-backed exchange-traded fund\" that would trade online in units of one-carat diamonds with a storage vault and delivery point in Antwerp, home of the Antwerp Diamond Bourse. The exchange fund was backed by a company based in New York City called IndexIQ. IndexIQ had already introduced 14 exchange-traded funds since 2008.\nAccording to Citigroup analysts, the annual production of polished diamonds is about $18 billion. Like gold, diamonds are easily authenticated and durable. Diamond prices have been more stable than the metals, as the global diamond monopoly De Beers once held almost 90% (by 2013 reduced to 40%) of the new diamond market.\nOther commodity markets.\nRubber trades on the Singapore Commodity Exchange in units of 1\u00a0kg priced in U.S. cents. Palm oil is traded on the Malaysian Ringgit (RM), Bursa Malaysia in units of 1\u00a0kg priced in U.S. cents. Wool is traded on the AUD in units of 1\u00a0kg. Polypropylene and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LL) did trade on the London Metal Exchange in units of 1,000\u00a0kg priced in USD but was dropped in 2011.\nImpact on inflation.\nFossil fuels and other commodities have been major drivers of inflationary periods, including the 2021-2022 inflation spike exacerbated by the Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Gernot Wagner argues that commodites are undesirable energy sources because of inflationary periods that come with commodity prices.\nIn 2025, primary commodity prices fell 2.6% from March to August, with gains in precious metals offset by declines in energy and agriculture, contributing to stalled inflation near 3% in major economies.\nRegulatory bodies and policies.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the principal regulator of commodity and futures markets is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The National Futures Association (NFA) was formed in 1976 and is the futures industry's self-regulatory organization. The NFA's first regulatory operations began in 1982 and fall under the Commodity Exchange Act of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act.\nDodd\u2013Frank was enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. It called for \"strong measures to limit speculation in agricultural commodities\" calling upon the CFTC to further limit positions and to regulate over-the-counter trades.\nEuropean Union.\nMarkets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) is the cornerstone of the European Commission's Financial Services Action Plan that regulate operations of the EU financial service markets. It was reviewed in 2012 by the European Parliament (EP) and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). The European Parliament adopted a revised version of Mifid II on 26 October 2012 which include \"provisions for position limits on commodity derivatives\", aimed at \"preventing market abuse\" and supporting \"orderly pricing and settlement conditions\".\nThe European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma), based in Paris and formed in 2011, is an \"EU-wide financial markets watchdog\". Esma sets position limits on commodity derivatives as described in Mifid II.\nThe EP voted in favor of stronger regulation of commodity derivative markets in September 2012 to \"end abusive speculation in commodity markets\" that were \"driving global food prices increases and price volatility\". In July 2012, \"food prices globally soared by 10 percent\" (World Bank 2012). Senior British MEP Arlene McCarthy called for \"putting a brake on excessive food speculation and speculating giants profiting from hunger\" ending immoral practices that \"only serve the interests of profiteers\". In March 2012, EP Member Markus Ferber suggested amendments to the European Commission's proposals, intended to strengthen restrictions on high-frequency trading and commodity price manipulation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48193", "revid": "1317727184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48193", "title": "Camera obscura", "text": "Optical device\nA camera obscura (pl.\u2009camerae obscurae or camera obscuras; from la\u00a0'dark chamber') is the natural phenomenon in which light passing through the small hole of a dark chamber or box will project an image of a scene outside the chamber (box) onto the surface opposite to the hole, resulting in an inverted (upside down) and reversed (left to right) projection of the view outside.\n\"Camera obscura\" refers to analogous constructions such as a darkened room, box or tent in which an exterior image is projected inside or onto a translucent screen viewed from outside. \"Camera obscuras\" with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as aids for drawing and painting. The technology was developed further into the photographic camera in the first half of the 19th century, when \"camera obscura\" boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.\nThe image (or the principle of its projection) of a lensless \"camera obscura\" is also referred to as a \"pinhole image\".\nThe \"camera obscura\" was used to study eclipses without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking directly into the Sun. As a drawing aid, it allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, and was especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve proper graphical perspective.\nBefore the term \"camera obscura\" was first used in 1604, other terms were used to refer to the devices: \"cubiculum obscurum\", \"cubiculum tenebricosum\", \"conclave obscurum\", and \"locus obscurus\".\nA \"camera obscura\" without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a \"pinhole camera\", although this more often refers to simple (homemade) lensless cameras where photographic film or photographic paper is used.\nPhysical explanation.\nRays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lighted objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a barrier admits only the rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, and these rays form an image of that scene where they reach a surface opposite from the opening.\nThe human eye (and that of many other animals) works much like a \"camera obscura\", with rays of light entering an opening (pupil), getting focused through a convex lens and passing a dark chamber before forming an inverted image on a smooth surface (retina). The analogy appeared early in the 16th century and would in the 17th century find common use to illustrate Western theological ideas about God creating the universe as a machine, with a predetermined purpose (just like humans create machines). This had a huge influence on behavioral science, especially on the study of perception and cognition. In this context, it is noteworthy that the projection of inverted images is actually a physical principle of optics that predates the emergence of life (rather than a biological or technological invention) and is not characteristic of all biological vision.\nTechnology.\nA \"camera obscura\" consists of a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side or the top. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted (upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and perspective preserved.\nTo produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture is typically smaller than 1/100 the distance to the screen.\nAs the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but dimmer. With too small of a pinhole, sharpness is lost because of diffraction. Optimum sharpness is attained with an aperture diameter approximately equal to the geometric mean of the wavelength of light and the distance to the screen.\nIn practice, \"camera obscuras\" use a lens rather than a pinhole because it allows a larger aperture, giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.\nIf the image is caught on a translucent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down). Using mirrors, it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be displayed on a horizontal surface (e.g., a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent.\nThe box-type \"camera obscura\" often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto tracing paper placed on its glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is reversed by the mirror.\nHistory.\nPrehistory to 500 BC: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomons.\nThere are theories that occurrences of \"camera obscura\" effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired paleolithic cave paintings. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.\nIt is also suggested that \"camera obscura\" projections could have played a role in Neolithic structures.\nPerforated gnomons projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese \"Zhoubi Suanjing\" writings (1046 BC\u2013256 BC with material added until c.\u2009220 AD). The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year. In Middle Eastern and European cultures its invention was much later attributed to Egyptian astronomer and mathematician Ibn Yunus around 1000 AD.\n500 BC to 500 AD: Earliest written observations.\nOne of the earliest known written records of a pinhole image is found in the Chinese text called \"Mozi\", dated to the 4th century BC, traditionally ascribed to and named for Mozi (c.\u2009470 BC\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009391 BC), a Chinese philosopher and the founder of Mohist School of Logic. These writings explain how the image in a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\" is inverted by an intersecting point (pinhole) that collects the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person gets partly hidden below (i.e., strikes below the pinhole) and partly forms the top of the image. Rays from the head are partly hidden above (i.e., strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image.\nAnother early account is provided by Greek philosopher Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC), or possibly a follower of his ideas. Similar to the later 11th-century Middle Eastern scientist Alhazen, Aristotle is also thought to have used \"camera obscura\" for observing solar eclipses. The formation of pinhole images is touched upon as a subject in the work \"Problems \u2013 Book XV\", asking: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Why is it that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular? and further on: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Why is it that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?\nIn an attempt to explain the phenomenon, the author described how the light formed two cones; one between the Sun and the aperture and one between the aperture and the Earth. However, the roundness of the image was attributed to the idea that parts of the rays of light (assumed to travel in straight lines) are cut off at the angles in the aperture become so weak that they cannot be noticed.\nMany philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder the contradiction between light travelling in straight lines and the formation of round spots of light behind differently shaped apertures, until it became generally accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in the \"problem\" were pinhole image projections of the sun.\nIn his book \"Optics\" (c.\u2009300 BC, surviving in later manuscripts from around 1000 AD), Euclid proposed mathematical descriptions of vision with \"lines drawn directly from the eye pass through a space of great extent\" and \"the form of the space included in our vision is a cone, with its apex in the eye and its base at the limits of our vision.\" Later versions of the text, like Ignazio Danti's 1573 annotated translation, would add a description of the \"camera obscura\" principle to demonstrate Euclid's ideas.\n500 to 1000: Earliest experiments, study of light.\nIn the 6th century, the Byzantine-Greek mathematician and architect Anthemius of Tralles (most famous as a co-architect of the Hagia Sophia) experimented with effects related to the \"camera obscura\". Anthemius had a sophisticated understanding of the involved optics, as demonstrated by a light-ray diagram he constructed in 555 AD.\nIn his optical treatise \"De Aspectibus\", Al-Kindi (c.\u2009801\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009873) wrote about pinhole images to prove that light travels in straight lines.\nIn the 10th century Yu Chao-Lung supposedly projected images of pagoda models through a small hole onto a screen to study directions and divergence of rays of light.\n1000 to 1400: Optical and astronomical tool.\nMiddle Eastern physicist Ibn al-Haytham (known in the West by the Latinised Alhazen) (965\u20131040) extensively studied the \"camera obscura\" phenomenon in the early 11th century.\nIn his treatise \"On the shape of the eclipse\" he provided the first experimental and mathematical analysis of the phenomenon. \nHe understood the relationship between the focal point and the pinhole.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moon-sickle. The image of the sun shows this peculiarity only when the hole is very small. When the hole is enlarged, the picture changes, and the change increases with the added width. When the aperture is very wide, the sickle-form image will disappear, and the light will appear round when the hole is round, square if the hole is square, and if the shape of the opening is irregular, the light on the wall will take on this shape, provided that the hole is wide and the plane on which it is thrown is parallel to it.\nIn his \"Book of Optics\" (circa 1027), Ibn al-Haytham explained that rays of light travel in straight lines and are distinguished by the body that reflected the rays, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Evidence that light and color do not mingle in air or (other) transparent bodies is (found in) the fact that, when several candles are at various distinct locations in the same area, and when they all face an aperture that opens into a dark recess, and when there is a white wall or (other white) opaque body in the dark recess facing that aperture, the (individual) lights of those candles appear individually upon that body or wall according to the number of those candles; and each of those lights (spots of light) appears directly opposite one (particular) candle along a straight line passing through that window. Moreover, if one candle is shielded, only the light opposite that candle is extinguished, but if the shielding object is lifted, the light will return.\nLatin translations of the \"Book of Optics\" from about 1200 onward seemed very influential in Europe. Among those Ibn al-Haytham is thought to have inspired are Witelo, John Peckham, Roger Bacon, Leonardo da Vinci, Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Johannes Kepler. However, \"On the shape of the eclipse\" remained exclusively available in Arabic until the 20th century and no comparable explanation was found in Europe before Kepler addressed it. It were actually al-Kindi's work and especially the widely circulated pseudo-Euclidean \"De Speculis\" that were cited by the early scholars who were interested in pinhole images.\nIn his 1088 book, \"Dream Pool Essays\", the Song dynasty Chinese scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) compared the focal point of a concave burning-mirror and the \"collecting\" hole of \"camera obscura\" phenomena to an oar in a rowlock to explain how the images were inverted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"When a bird flies in the air, its shadow moves along the ground in the same direction. But if its image is collected (\"shu\")(like a belt being tightened) through a small hole in a window, then the shadow moves in the direction opposite of that of the bird.[...] This is the same principle as the burning-mirror. Such a mirror has a concave surface, and reflects a finger to give an upright image if the object is very near, but if the finger moves farther and farther away it reaches a point where the image disappears and after that the image appears inverted. Thus the point where the image disappears is like the pinhole of the window. So also the oar is fixed at the rowlock somewhere at its middle part, constituting, when it is moved, a sort of 'waist' and the handle of the oar is always in the position inverse to the end (which is in the water).\"\nShen Kuo also responded to a statement of Duan Chengshi in \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\" written in about 840 that the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda tower beside a seashore, was inverted because it was reflected by the sea: \"This is nonsense. It is a normal principle that the image is inverted after passing through the small hole.\"\nEnglish statesman and scholastic philosopher Robert Grosseteste (c.\u20091175 \u2013 9 October 1253) was one of the earliest Europeans who commented on the \"camera obscura\".\nEnglish philosopher and Franciscan friar Roger Bacon (c.\u20091219/20 \u2013 c.\u20091292) falsely stated in his \"De Multiplicatione Specerium\" (1267) that an image projected through a square aperture was round because light would travel in spherical waves and therefore assumed its natural shape after passing through a hole. He is also credited with a manuscript that advised to study solar eclipses safely by observing the rays passing through some round hole and studying the spot of light they form on a surface.\nPolish friar, theologian, physicist, mathematician and natural philosopher Vitello wrote about the \"camera obscura\" in his influential treatise \"Perspectiva\" (circa 1270\u20131278), which was largely based on Ibn al-Haytham's work.\nEnglish archbishop and scholar John Peckham (circa 1230 \u2013 1292) wrote about the \"camera obscura\" in his \"Tractatus de Perspectiva\" (circa 1269\u20131277) and \"Perspectiva communis\" (circa 1277\u201379), falsely arguing that light gradually forms the circular shape after passing through the aperture. His writings were influenced by Bacon.\nFrench astronomer Guillaume de Saint-Cloud suggested in his 1292 work \"Almanach Planetarum\" that the eccentricity of the Sun could be determined with the \"camera obscura\" from the inverse proportion between the distances and the apparent solar diameters at apogee and perigee.\nKam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-F\u0101ris\u012b (1267\u20131319) described in his 1309 work \"Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir\" (\"The Revision of the Optics\") how he experimented with a glass sphere filled with water in a \"camera obscura\" with a controlled aperture and found that the colors of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light.\nFrench Jewish philosopher, mathematician, physicist and astronomer/astrologer Levi ben Gershon (1288\u20131344) (also known as Gersonides or Leo de Balneolis) made several astronomical observations using a \"camera obscura\" with a Jacob's staff, describing methods to measure the angular diameters of the Sun, the Moon and the bright planets Venus and Jupiter. He determined the eccentricity of the Sun based on his observations of the summer and winter solstices in 1334. Levi also noted how the size of the aperture determined the size of the projected image. He wrote about his findings in Hebrew in his treatise \"Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem\" (\"The Wars of the Lord\") Book V Chapters 5 and 9.\n1450 to 1600: Depiction, lenses, drawing aid, mirrors.\nItalian polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519), familiar with the work of Alhazen in Latin translation and having extensively studied the physics and physiological aspects of optics, wrote the oldest known clear description of the \"camera obscura\", in 1502 (found in the \"Codex Atlanticus\", translated from Latin):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the facade of a building, or a place, or a landscape is illuminated by the sun and a small hole is drilled in the wall of a room in a building facing this, which is not directly lighted by the sun, then all objects illuminated by the sun will send their images through this aperture and will appear, upside down, on the wall facing the hole.\nYou will catch these pictures on a piece of white paper, which placed vertically in the room not far from that opening, and you will see all the above-mentioned objects on this paper in their natural shapes or colors, but they will appear smaller and upside down, on account of crossing of the rays at that aperture. If these pictures originate from a place which is illuminated by the sun, they will appear colored on the paper exactly as they are. The paper should be very thin and must be viewed from the back.\nThese descriptions, however, would remain unknown until Venturi deciphered and published them in 1797.\nDa Vinci was clearly very interested in the \"camera obscura\": over the years he drew approximately 270 diagrams of the \"camera obscura\" in his notebooks. He systematically experimented with various shapes and sizes of apertures and with multiple apertures (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 24, 28 and 32). He compared the working of the eye to that of the \"camera obscura\" and seemed especially interested in its capability of demonstrating basic principles of optics: the inversion of images through the pinhole or pupil, the non-interference of images and the fact that images are \"all in all and all in every part\".\nThe oldest known published drawing of a \"camera obscura\" is found in Dutch physician, mathematician and instrument maker Gemma Frisius\u2019 1545 book \"De Radio Astronomica et Geometrica\", in which he described and illustrated how he used the \"camera obscura\" to study the solar eclipse of 24 January 1544\nItalian polymath Gerolamo Cardano described using a glass disc \u2013 probably a biconvex lens \u2013 in a \"camera obscura\" in his 1550 book \"De subtilitate, vol. I, Libri IV\". He suggested to use it to view \"what takes place in the street when the sun shines\" and advised to use a very white sheet of paper as a projection screen so the colours would not be dull.\nSicilian mathematician and astronomer Francesco Maurolico (1494\u20131575) answered Aristotle's problem how sunlight that shines through rectangular holes can form round spots of light or crescent-shaped spots during an eclipse in his treatise \"Photismi de lumine et umbra\" (1521\u20131554). However this wasn't published before 1611, after Johannes Kepler had published similar findings of his own.\nItalian polymath Giambattista della Porta described the \"camera obscura\", which he called \"camera obscura\", in the 1558 first edition of his book series \"Magia Naturalis\". He suggested to use a convex lens to project the image onto paper and to use this as a drawing aid. Della Porta compared the human eye to the \"camera obscura\": \"For the image is let into the eye through the eyeball just as here through the window\". The popularity of Della Porta's books helped spread knowledge of the \"camera obscura\".\nIn his 1567 work \"La Pratica della Perspettiva\" Venetian nobleman Daniele Barbaro (1513-1570) described using a \"camera obscura\" with a biconvex lens as a drawing aid and points out that the picture is more vivid if the lens is covered as much as to leave a circumference in the middle.\nIn his influential and meticulously annotated Latin edition of the works of Ibn al-Haytham and Witelo, (1572), German mathematician Friedrich Risner proposed a portable \"camera obscura\" drawing aid; a lightweight wooden hut with lenses in each of its four walls that would project images of the surroundings on a paper cube in the middle. The construction could be carried on two wooden poles. A very similar setup was illustrated in 1645 in Athanasius Kircher's influential book \"Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae\".\nAround 1575 Italian Dominican priest, mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer Ignazio Danti designed a \"camera obscura\" gnomon and a meridian line for the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, Florence, and he later had a massive gnomon built in the San Petronio Basilica in Bologna. The gnomon was used to study the movements of the Sun during the year and helped in determining the new Gregorian calendar for which Danti took place in the commission appointed by Pope Gregorius XIII and instituted in 1582.\nIn his 1585 book \"Diversarum Speculationum Mathematicarum\" Venetian mathematician Giambattista Benedetti proposed to use a mirror in a 45-degree angle to project the image upright. This leaves the image reversed, but would become common practice in later \"camera obscura\" boxes.\nGiambattista della Porta added a \"lenticular crystal\" or biconvex lens to the \"camera obscura\" description in the 1589 second edition of \"Magia Naturalis\". He also described use of the \"camera obscura\" to project hunting scenes, banquets, battles, plays, or anything desired on white sheets. Trees, forests, rivers, mountains \"that are really so, or made by Art, of Wood, or some other matter\" could be arranged on a plain in the sunshine on the other side of the \"camera obscura\" wall. Little children and animals (for instance handmade deer, wild boars, rhinos, elephants, and lions) could perform in this set. \"Then, by degrees, they must appear, as coming out of their dens, upon the Plain: The Hunter he must come with his hunting Pole, Nets, Arrows, and other necessaries, that may represent hunting: Let there be Horns, Cornets, Trumpets sounded: those that are in the Chamber shall see Trees, Animals, Hunters Faces, and all the rest so plainly, that they cannot tell whether they be true or delusions: Swords drawn will glister in at the hole, that they will make people almost afraid.\" \nDella Porta claimed to have shown such spectacles often to his friends. They admired it very much and could hardly be convinced by della Porta's explanations that what they had seen was really an optical trick.\n1600 to 1650: Name coined, \"camera obscura\" telescopy, portable drawing aid in tents and boxes.\nThe earliest use of the term \"camera obscura\" is found in the 1604 book \"Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena\" by German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer Johannes Kepler. Kepler discovered the working of the \"camera obscura\" by recreating its principle with a book replacing a shining body and sending threads from its edges through a many-cornered aperture in a table onto the floor where the threads recreated the shape of the book. He also realized that images are \"painted\" inverted and reversed on the retina of the eye and figured that this is somehow corrected by the brain. \nIn 1607, Kepler studied the Sun in his \"camera obscura\" and noticed a sunspot, but he thought it was Mercury transiting the Sun.\nIn his 1611 book \"Dioptrice\", Kepler described how the projected image of the \"camera obscura\" can be improved and reverted with a lens. It is believed he later used a telescope with three lenses to revert the image in the \"camera obscura\".\nIn 1611, Frisian/German astronomers David and Johannes Fabricius (father and son) studied sunspots with a \"camera obscura\", after realizing looking at the Sun directly with the telescope could damage their eyes. They are thought to have combined the telescope and the \"camera obscura\" into \"camera obscura\" telescopy.\nIn 1612, Italian mathematician Benedetto Castelli wrote to his mentor, the Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher, and mathematician Galileo Galilei about projecting images of the Sun through a telescope (invented in 1608) to study the recently discovered sunspots. Galilei wrote about Castelli's technique to the German Jesuit priest, physicist, and astronomer Christoph Scheiner.\nFrom 1612 to at least 1630, Christoph Scheiner would keep on studying sunspots and constructing new telescopic solar-projection systems. He called these \"Heliotropii Telioscopici\", later contracted to helioscope. For his helioscope studies, Scheiner built a box around the viewing/projecting end of the telescope, which can be seen as the oldest known version of a box-type \"camera obscura\". Scheiner also made a portable \"camera obscura\".\nIn his 1613 book \"Opticorum Libri Sex\" Belgian Jesuit mathematician, physicist, and architect Fran\u00e7ois d'Aguilon described how some charlatans cheated people out of their money by claiming they knew necromancy and would raise the specters of the devil from hell to show them to the audience inside a dark room. The image of an assistant with a devil's mask was projected through a lens into the dark room, scaring the uneducated spectators.\nBy 1620 Kepler used a portable \"camera obscura\" tent with a modified telescope to draw landscapes. It could be turned around to capture the surroundings in parts.\nDutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel is thought to have constructed a box-type \"camera obscura\" which corrected the inversion of the projected image. In 1622, he sold one to the Dutch poet, composer, and diplomat Constantijn Huygens who used it to paint and recommended it to his artist friends. Huygens wrote to his parents (translated from French):&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have at home Drebbel's other instrument, which certainly makes admirable effects in painting from reflection in a dark room; it is not possible for me to reveal the beauty to you in words; all painting is dead by comparison, for here is life itself or something more elevated if one could articulate it. The figure and the contour and the movements come together naturally therein and in a grandly pleasing fashion.\nGerman Orientalist, mathematician, inventor, poet, and librarian Daniel Schwenter wrote in his 1636 book \"Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae\" about an instrument that a man from Pappenheim had shown him, which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through a \"camera obscura\". It consisted of a ball as big as a fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two-halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the \"camera obscura\" (EF). This universal joint mechanism was later called a scioptic ball.\nIn his 1637 book \"Dioptrique\" French philosopher, mathematician and scientist Ren\u00e9 Descartes suggested placing an eye of a recently dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the eye of an ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.\nItalian Jesuit philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer Mario Bettini wrote about making a \"camera obscura\" with twelve holes in his \"Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae\" (1642). When a foot soldier would stand in front of the camera, a twelve-person army of soldiers making the same movements would be projected.\nFrench mathematician, Minim friar, and painter of anamorphic art Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Nic\u00e9ron (1613\u20131646) wrote about the \"camera obscura\" with convex lenses. He explained how the \"camera obscura\" could be used by painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the \"camera obscura\" to fool witless spectators and make them believe that the projections were magic or occult science. These writings were published in a posthumous version of \"La Perspective Curieuse\" (1652).\n1650 to 1800: Introduction of the magic lantern, popular portable box-type drawing aid, painting aid.\nThe use of the \"camera obscura\" to project special shows to entertain an audience seems to have remained very rare. A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet Jean Loret, who expressed how rare and novel it was. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this may have been a \"camera obscura\" show, rather than a very early magic lantern show, especially in the upside-down image and Loret's surprise that the energetic movements made no sound.\nGerman Jesuit scientist Gaspar Schott heard from a traveler about a small \"camera obscura\" device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box \"camera obscura\", which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 \"Magia universalis natur\u00e6 et artis\" (volume 1 \u2013 book 4 \"Magia Optica\" pages 199\u2013201).\nBy 1659 the magic lantern was introduced and partly replaced the \"camera obscura\" as a projection device, while the \"camera obscura\" mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be regarded as a (box-type) \"camera obscura\" device that projects images rather than actual scenes. In 1668, Robert Hooke described the difference for an installation to project the delightful \"various apparitions and disappearances, the motions, changes and actions\" by means of a broad convex-glass in a \"camera obscura\" setup: \"if the picture be transparent, reflect the rays of the sun so as that they may pass through it towards the place where it is to be represented; and let the picture be encompassed on every side with a board or cloth that no rays may pass beside it. If the object be a statue or some living creature, then it must be very much enlightened by casting the sun beams on it by refraction, reflexion, or both.\" For models that can't be inverted, like living animals or candles, he advised: \"let two large glasses of convenient spheres be placed at appropriate distances\".\nThe 17th century Dutch Masters, such as Johannes Vermeer, were known for their magnificent attention to detail. It has been widely speculated that they made use of the \"camera obscura\", but the extent of their use by artists at this period remains a matter of fierce contention, recently revived by the Hockney\u2013Falco thesis.\nGerman philosopher Johann Sturm published an illustrated article about the construction of a portable \"camera obscura\" box with a 45\u00b0 mirror and an oiled paper screen in the first volume of the proceedings of the Collegium Curiosum, \"Collegium Experimentale, sive Curiosum\" (1676).\nJohann Zahn's \"Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium\", published in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches of both the \"camera obscura\" and the magic lantern. A hand-held device with a mirror-reflex mechanism was first proposed by Johann Zahn in 1685, a design that would later be used in photographic cameras.\nThe scientist Robert Hooke presented a paper in 1694 to the Royal Society, in which he described a portable \"camera obscura\". It was a cone-shaped box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user.\nFrom the beginning of the 18th century, craftsmen and opticians would make \"camera obscura\" devices in the shape of books, which were much appreciated by lovers of optical devices.\nOne chapter in the Conte Algarotti's \"Saggio sopra Pittura\" (1764) is dedicated to the use of a \"camera obscura\" (\"optic chamber\") in painting.\nBy the 18th century, following developments by Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke, more easily portable models in boxes became available. These were extensively used by amateur artists while on their travels, but they were also employed by professionals, including Paul Sandby and Joshua Reynolds, whose camera (disguised as a book) is now in the Science Museum in London. Such cameras were later adapted by Joseph Nicephore Niepce, Louis Daguerre and William Fox Talbot for creating the first photographs.\nRole in the modern age.\nWhile the technical principles of the \"camera obscura\" have been known since antiquity, the broad use of the technical concept in producing images with a linear perspective in paintings, maps, theatre setups, and architectural, and, later, photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. Although Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed a pioneering theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested in producing images with it (compare Hans Belting 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare Aniconism in Islam) toward personal images.\nWestern artists and philosophers used the Middle Eastern findings in new frameworks of epistemic relevance. For example, Leonardo da Vinci used the \"camera obscura\" as a model of the eye, Ren\u00e9 Descartes for eye and mind, and John Locke started to use the \"camera obscura\" as a metaphor of human understanding per se. The modern use of the \"camera obscura\" as an epistemic machine had important side effects for science.\nWhile the use of the \"camera obscura\" has waxed and waned, one can still be built using a few simple items: a box, tracing paper, tape, foil, a box cutter, a pencil, and a blanket to keep out the light. Homemade \"camera obscura\" are popular primary- and secondary-school science or art projects.\nIn 1827, critic Vergnaud complained about the frequent use of \"camera obscura\" in producing many of the paintings at that year's Salon exhibition in Paris: \"Is the public to blame, the artists, or the jury, when history paintings, already rare, are sacrificed to genre painting, and what genre at that!... that of the \"camera obscura\".\" (translated from French)\nBritish photographer Richard Learoyd has specialized in making pictures of his models and motifs with a \"camera obscura\" instead of a modern camera, combining it with the ilfochrome process which creates large grainless prints.\nOther contemporary visual artists who have explicitly used \"camera obscura\" in their artworks include James Turrell, Abelardo Morell, Minnie Weisz, Robert Calafiore, Vera Lutter, Marja Piril\u00e4, and Shi Guorui.\nDigital cameras.\nCamera obscura principle pinhole objectives machined out of aluminium are commercially available. As the luminosity of the image is very weak in the phenomenon, long exposure times or high sensitivity must be used in digital photography. The resulting image appears hazy and the image is not that sharp, even if the objective is attached to a state of the art camera body.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

U\u00c7K; , abbr. ONA), also known as the Macedonian U\u00c7K (; ), was an ethnic Albanian militia that operated in the Republic of Macedonia in 2001 and was closely associated with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Following the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia, it was disarmed through the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which gave greater rights and autonomy to the state's Macedonian Albanians.\nBackground and foundation.\nIn 1992\u20131993, ethnic Albanians created the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which started attacking police forces and secret-service officials who abused Albanian civilians in 1995. Starting in 1998, the KLA was involved in frontal battle, with increasing numbers of Yugoslav security forces. Escalating tensions led to the Kosovo War in February 1998.\nAfter the end of the Kosovo War in 1999 with the signing of the Kumanovo agreement, a 5-kilometer-wide Ground Safety Zone (GSZ) was created. It served as a buffer zone between the Yugoslav Army and the Kosovo Force (KFOR). In June 1999, a new Albanian militant insurgent group was formed under the Liberation Army of Pre\u0161evo, Medve\u0111a and Bujanovac (U\u00c7PMB), which started training in the GSZ. The group began attacking Serbian civilians and police, which escalated into an insurgency.\nThe NLA was founded in 1999 and led by former KLA commander Ali Ahmeti, a nephew of one of the founders of the KLA. Ahmeti organized the NLA from former KLA and U\u00c7PMB fighters from Kosovo, Albanian insurgents from the Liberation Army of Pre\u0161evo, Medve\u0111a and Bujanovac in Serbia, young Albanian radicals, nationalists from Macedonia, and foreign mercenaries. With the signing of the Kon\u010dulj Agreement in May 2001, the former KLA and U\u00c7PMB fighters next moved to western Macedonia where the NLA was established, which fought against the Macedonian government in 2001. The acronym was the same as the KLA's in Albanian. A NLA communiqu\u00e9 from 30 January 2000 claimed responsibility for attacks on police stations in Skopje and Oslomej. NLA had the strong support of the Albanian community and many Albanians joined it.\n2001 insurgency in Macedonia.\nThe NLA operated secretly until it began openly engaging the Macedonian military and police. Per the NLA, the goal of the insurgency was to secure greater rights for Albanians. The NLA also demanded a confederate Macedonia. Senior NLA commanders insisted that \"We do not want to endanger the stability and the territorial integrity of Macedonia, but we will fight a guerrilla war until we have won our basic rights, until we are accepted as an equal people inside Macedonia.\" The Macedonian government claimed the NLA was a terrorist organization consisting primarily of KLA fighters, lacking domestic legitimacy and seeking secession or a Greater Albania. \nOn 22 January 2001, the NLA attacked a police station in Tearce, killing 1 and injuring 3. After the attack, the NLA began to carry out attacks on Macedonian security forces using light weapons. In February, the NLA entered the village of Tanu\u0161evci and the conflict expanded to the Kumanovo, Lipkovo and Tetovo region. By the start of March, the NLA had taken effective control of a large swathe of northern and western Macedonia and had come within 12 miles of the capital Skopje.\nIn March, NLA members failed to take the city of Tetovo in an open attack, but controlled the hills and mountains between Tetovo and Kosovo. In 9 March, the NLA ambushed a police convoy consisting of deputy interior minister Refet Elmazi and secretary of state for interior affairs Ljube Bo\u0161koski. On 21 March, the Macedonian government gave the NLA a twenty-four-hour deadline to surrender their weapons or leave the country. NLA announced a ceasefire unilaterally, declaring that it does not want to threaten the territorial integrity of the country and called for a conversation about the rights of ethnic Albanians in the country. However, the government did not want to negotiate with NLA and launched an offensive against it on 25 March. In April, the NLA committed an ambush near Vejce on eight soldiers. On 3 May, a Macedonian government counteroffensive failed in the Kumanovo area. By 8 June, the rebels took Ara\u010dinovo, a village outside of Skopje. The NLA threatened to bomb strategic targets, such as the Skopje International Airport and the oil refinery, Okta AD. A ceasefire was mediated by the EU and the NLA was evacuated by NATO to a village under its control, Niku\u0161tak. On 7 August, five NLA rebels were killed in Skopje in a police raid. The NLA ambushed Macedonian reservists near Karpalak on the next day. On 13 August, the Ohrid Agreement was signed between ethnic Macedonian and Albanian representatives, ending the conflict. NLA's leadership was not involved in the negotiations for the agreement but they accepted it.\nComposition and military capabilities.\nApproximately 400 young Albanian men from Macedonia, including figures like Ali Ahmeti, G\u00ebzim Ostreni, and Xhezair Shaqiri, had fought within KLA's ranks. Many of these fighters later established the NLA, recruiting additional members from Kosovar Albanians, particularly from Prizren (a former stronghold of Ahmeti) and southeastern Kosovo, such as the municipality of Vitina, particularly the village of Debelldeh, which was a key stronghold of the NLA in Kosovo. About 80% of its fighters have been estimated as local Albanians from Macedonia, with only a small number of volunteers coming from Kosovo and the Pre\u0161evo Valley. The Macedonian government denied that local ethnic Albanians had joined the NLA, while foreign observers and ethnic Albanians in Macedonia argued that the NLA had gained significant support from the local Albanian population.\nAli Ahmeti stated that the NLA comprised 5,000 members during the conflict, including those in logistical roles. Other sources suggest the NLA claimed to have the capacity to mobilize a larger force of up to 16,000, likely to intimidate the government. The Macedonian government estimated around 7,000 rebels, while Kusovac provided a more modest figure of 2,000\u20132,500 'full-time' combatants. Nonetheless, the NLA had a broader network of supporters involved in tasks such as reconnaissance, patrolling, communications, and logistics. Interviews with former combatants in the spring and summer of 2003 revealed that the NLA's total strength at its peak was between 5,000 and 5,500 troops. However, a distinction was noted between the fully armed front-line forces, numbering 2,800\u20133,500, and the remaining 2,000 personnel serving as rear-echelon support and logistics staff. According to the combatants, rear-echelon members, if armed at all, typically carried only light weapons, such as pistols. For instance, the NLA reported having two field hospitals staffed by 550 medical personnel, all of whom were unarmed. Members of the Albanian community in Switzerland and Germany raised funding for the NLA through a so-called National Liberation fund (\"Liria Komberate\"). The International Crisis Group argued that the NLA was the recipient of funding and weapons linked to criminal groups.\nAs with the KLA, they were fairly lightly armed \u2013 generally with small arms and mortars \u2013 though there were later reports that they had acquired SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles. As the war progressed the rebels managed to acquire heavy weapons including T-55 tanks and armoured personnel carriers captured from Macedonian government forces. The NLA also had thousands of land and anti-tank mines.\nOrganization.\nThe NLA claimed to have six brigades active within Macedonia. The 111th, 113th, and 114th Brigades operated in the Skopska Crna Gora (Karadak) region, while the 112th Brigade commanded several battalions in the Tetovo area. The 116th Brigade was responsible for the Gostivar region, and the 115th Brigade was positioned in the northwest of Skopje, including Radu\u0161a. In contrast, an OSCE official stated that the NLA had a total of 10 brigades but deployed only the six mentioned above, suggesting that the NLA possessed significant reserve potential.\nThe six brigades, each with their own commanders were:\nNLA veterans in politics.\nSome former leaders of the NLA have taken positions in politics in North Macedonia.\nAlleged war crimes.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch: \"Ethnic Albanian rebels in Macedonia tortured, sexually abused road workers after abducting them from the Skopje\u2013Tetovo highway.\" Dozens of ethnic Macedonians were kidnapped. Per Amnesty International, while many were released after a short time, 12 people apparently remained missing after the NLA released 14 others in late September. In October, reports suggested that the 12 may have been killed and buried in mass graves near Nepro\u0161teno. Another incident is the Vejce ambush, where Albanian guerrillas ambushed and killed eight Macedonian special operatives, part of a patrol of 16 special operatives.\nThe Macedonian government accused the NLA of bombing a 13th-century Orthodox monastery Sveti Atanasij in the village of Le\u0161ok on 21 August 2001. The attack occurred at around 3 am Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The interior had been gratified and destroyed. NATO military experts said that \"the fact that the battery was lying within an area spattered by rubble and wreckage seemed to suggest that it was detonated using a relatively sophisticated timer device;\".\nThe Macedonian government referred four cases against the NLA to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2002 for investigation:\nThe ICTY returned the cases to Macedonia in 2008.\nCeasefire and disarmament.\nUnder the Ohrid Agreement, the Macedonian government pledged to improve the rights of the Albanian population, that make up around 20% of the population. Those rights include making Albanian an official language, increasing the participation of ethnic Albanians in government institutions, police and the army. The Macedonian government also agreed to a new model of decentralization.\nThe Albanian side agreed to give up any separatist demands and to fully recognize all Macedonian institutions. In addition, the NLA was to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force. The exact number of NLA rebels who were killed is unknown. Per the Macedonian Ministry of Interior, the NLA killed ten civilians.\nOperation Essential Harvest was officially launched on 22 August and effectively started on 27 August. This 30-day mission was to initially involve approximately 3,500 NATO troops, a number that went up to 4,200 NATO troops and Macedonian troops, to disarm the NLA and destroy their weapons. In September, the NLA disbanded. \nLater developments.\nIn Albanian communities across North Macedonia, monuments dedicated to the NLA were erected. In 2002, the Macedonian parliament approved a general amnesty for former ethnic Albanian insurgents but it only applied for Macedonian citizens. On 26 March 2002, Albanian National Army members attacked former NLA members in the village and former NLA stronghold Mala Re\u010dica near Tetovo. The shootout lasted around two hours and a half. According to some news sources, 1 to 2 militants died in this skirmish. Ali Ahmeti later formed the Democratic Union for Integration (which also included former NLA members), which has been the biggest Albanian political party in North Macedonia.\nIn April 2010, a weapon cache believed to be intended for group actions was discovered near the border with Serbia; it included uniforms with U\u00c7K marks.\nA movement calling itself the NLA claimed responsibility for the 2014 Skopje government attack. The organization, in the letter signed by \"Kushtrimi\" to the government, claimed that the \"Hasan Prishtina\" elite force hit the government building in a coordinated action. The organization claims it is dissatisfied with the 2001 Ohrid Agreement.\nBomb attacks were carried out on 9 December 2014 at 8 p.m. near Macedonian police stations in Kumanovo and Tetovo. The Ministry of the Interior announced that in both cases it was not about bombs, but about a kind of explosive device. there were no injuries and no major damage. A private car parked near the train station was damaged. After the attacks, an organization claiming to be the NLA claimed responsibility.\nOn 21 April 2015, a group of 40 armed men with U\u00c7K patches attacked a border police station at Go\u0161ince. The group tied the policemen up and beat them, then stole their arms and communication devices. Before they left for Kosovo, they issued the message: \"We are from U\u00c7K. Tell them that neither Ali Ahmeti nor Nikola Gruevski can save you. We do not want any framework agreement and if we see you here again, we will kill you. We want our own state.\"\nOn 9\u201310 May 2015, a series of shootouts happened in Kumanovo between Macedonian police and a group that claimed it was the NLA. Between 50-70 militants were present during the fighting. Ten militants were killed, and reports state they wore uniforms with U\u00c7K insignia, with 30 more being arrested. According to Nikola Gruevski the armed group did not have the support of members of the Albanian minority contrary to the 2001 conflict.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48203", "revid": "44524978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48203", "title": "Article (grammar)", "text": "Word used with a noun to indicate the type of reference being made by the noun\nIn grammar, an article is any member of a class of dedicated words that are used with noun to the identifiability of object type or itself. The category of articles constitutes a part of speech.\nArticles combine with nouns to form noun phrases, and typically specify the grammatical definiteness of the noun phrase. In English, \"the\" and \"a\" (rendered as \"an\" when followed by a vowel sound) are the definite and indefinite articles respectively. Articles in many other languages also carry additional grammatical information such as gender, number, and case. Articles are part of a broader category called determiners, which also include demonstratives, possessive determiners, and quantifiers. In linguistic interlinear glossing, articles are abbreviated as ART.\nTypes of article.\nDefinite article.\nA definite article is an article that marks a definite noun phrase. Definite articles, such as the English \"the,\" are used to refer to a particular member of a group. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned, or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified.\nFor example, Sentence 1 uses the definite article and thus, expresses a request for a particular book. In contrast, Sentence 2 uses an indefinite article and thus, conveys that the speaker would be satisfied with any book.\nThe definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:\n The cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the Brassica \"genus.\"\nHowever, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.\nSome languages (such as the continental North Germanic languages, Bulgarian or Romanian) have definite articles only as suffixes.\nIndefinite article.\nAn indefinite article is an article that marks an indefinite noun phrase. Indefinite articles are those such as English \"a\" or \"an\", which do not refer to a specific identifiable entity. Indefinites are commonly used to introduce a new discourse referent which can be referred back to in subsequent discussion:\nIndefinites can also be used to generalize over entities who have some property in common:\nIndefinites can also be used to refer to specific entities whose precise identity is unknown or unimportant.\nIndefinites also have predicative uses:\nIndefinite noun phrases are widely studied within linguistics, in particular because of their ability to take exceptional scope.\nProper article.\nA proper article indicates that its noun is proper, and refers to a unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a place, the name of a planet, etc. The M\u0101ori language has the proper article , which is used for personal nouns; so, \"\" means \"Peter\". In M\u0101ori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it, both articles are present; for example, the phrase \"\", which contains both the proper article and the definite article refers to the person name Te Rauparaha.\nThe definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition (there \"is\" just one of them). For example: \"the Amazon, the Hebrides\". In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e. \"the Amazon River\", \"the Hebridean Islands\". Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: \"the United States\", \"the People's Republic of China\".\nThis distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usage \"the Ukraine\" stressed the word's Russian meaning of \"borderlands\"; as Ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of Sudan and both Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa); a move in the other direction occurred with The Gambia. In certain languages, such as French and Italian, definite articles are used with all or most names of countries: , , ; , , .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If a name [has] a definite article, e.g. \"the Kremlin\", it cannot idiomatically be used without it: we cannot say \"Boris Yeltsin is in Kremlin\".\u2014\u200a\nSome languages use definite articles with personal names, as in Portuguese (, literally: \"the Maria\"), Greek (, , , ), and Catalan (, /). Such usage also occurs colloquially or dialectally in Spanish, German, French, Italian and other languages. In Hungarian, the colloquial use of definite articles with personal names, though widespread, is considered to be a Germanism.\nThe definite article sometimes appears in American English nicknames such as \"the Donald\", referring to current president Donald Trump, and \"the Gipper\", referring to former president Ronald Reagan.\nPartitive article.\nA partitive article is a type of article, sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article, used with a mass noun such as \"water\", to indicate a non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are a class of determiner; they are used in French and Italian in addition to definite and indefinite articles. (In Finnish and Estonian, the partitive is indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in English is \"some\", although it is classified as a determiner, and English uses it less than French uses . \n French: \n \"Do you want (some) coffee?\"\nFor more information, see the article on the French partitive article.\nHaida has a partitive article (suffixed ) referring to \"part of something or... to one or more objects of a given group or category,\" e.g., \"he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats).\"\nNegative article.\nA negative article specifies \"none\" of its noun, and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite. On the other hand, some consider such a word to be a simple determiner rather than an article. In English, this function is fulfilled by \"no\", which can appear before a singular or plural noun: \n \"No man has been on this island.\"\n \"No dogs are allowed here.\"\n \"No one is in the room.\"\nIn German, the negative article is, among other variations, \"kein\", in opposition to the indefinite article \"ein\".\n\"Ein Hund\" \u2013 a dog\n\"Kein Hund\" \u2013 no dog\nThe equivalent in Dutch is \"geen\":\n \"een hond\" \u2013 a dog\n \"geen hond\" \u2013 no dog\nZero article.\nThe zero article is the absence of an article. In languages having a definite article, the lack of an article specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite. Linguists interested in X-bar theory causally link zero articles to nouns lacking a determiner. In English, the zero article rather than the indefinite is used with plurals and mass nouns, although the word \"some\" can be used as an indefinite plural article.\n \"Visitors end up walking in mud.\"\nCrosslinguistic variation.\nArticles are found in many Indo-European languages, Semitic languages, Polynesian languages, and even language isolates such as Basque; however, they are formally absent from many of the world's major languages including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Tibetan, many Turkic languages (including Tatar, Bashkir, Tuvan and Chuvash), many Uralic languages (incl. Finnic and Saami languages), Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi, the Dravidian languages (incl. Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada), the Baltic languages, the majority of Slavic languages, the Bantu languages (incl. Swahili). In some languages that do have articles, such as some North Caucasian languages, the use of articles is optional; however, in others like English and German it is mandatory in all cases.\nLinguists believe the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, Proto-Indo-European, did not have articles. Most of the languages in this family do not have definite or indefinite articles: there is no article in Latin or Sanskrit, nor in some modern Indo-European languages, such as the families of Slavic languages (except for Bulgarian and Macedonian, which are rather distinctive among the Slavic languages in their grammar, and some Northern Russian dialects), Baltic languages and many Indo-Aryan languages. Although Classical Greek had a definite article (which has survived into Modern Greek and which bears strong functional resemblance to the German definite article, which it is related to), the earlier Homeric Greek used this article largely as a pronoun or demonstrative, whereas the earliest known form of Greek known as Mycenaean Greek did not have any articles. Articles developed independently in several language families.\nNot all languages have both definite and indefinite articles, and some languages have different types of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish finer shades of meaning: for example, French and Italian have a partitive article used for indefinite mass nouns, whereas Colognian has two distinct sets of definite articles indicating focus and uniqueness, and Macedonian uses definite articles in a demonstrative sense, with a tripartite distinction (proximal, medial, distal) based on distance from the speaker or interlocutor. The words \"this\" and \"that\" (and their plurals, \"these\" and \"those\") can be understood in English as, ultimately, forms of the definite article \"the\" (whose declension in Old English included \"thaes\", an ancestral form of this/that and these/those).\nIn many languages, the form of the article may vary according to the gender, number, or case of its noun. In some languages the article may be the only indication of the case. Many languages do not use articles at all, and may use other ways of indicating old versus new information, such as topic\u2013comment constructions.\nTables.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe following examples show articles which are always suffixed to the noun:\nExamples of prefixed definite articles: \nA different way, limited to the definite article, is used by Latvian and Lithuanian. \nThe noun does not change but the adjective can be defined or undefined. In Latvian: \"galds\", a table / the table; \"balts galds\", a white table; \"baltais galds\", the white table. In Lithuanian: \"stalas\", a table / the table; \"baltas stalas\", a white table; \"baltasis stalas\", the white table.\nLanguages in the above table written in \"italics\" are constructed languages and are not natural, that is to say that they have been purposefully invented by an individual (or group of individuals) with some purpose in mind.\nTokelauan.\nWhen using a definite article in Tokelauan language, unlike in some languages like English, if the speaker is speaking of an item, they need not have referred to it previously as long as the item is specific. This is also true when it comes to the reference of a specific person. So, although the definite article used to describe a noun in the Tokelauan language is \"te\", it can also translate to the indefinite article in languages that requires the item being spoken of to have been referenced prior. When translating to English, \"te\" could translate to the English definite article \"the\", or it could also translate to the English indefinite article \"a\". An example of how the definite article \"te\" can be used as an interchangeable definite or indefinite article in the Tokelauan language would be the sentence \u201c\"Kua hau te tino\"\u201d. In the English language, this could be translated as \u201cA man has arrived\u201d or \u201cThe man has arrived\u201d where using \"te\" as the article in this sentence can represent any man or a particular man. The word \"he\", which is the indefinite article in Tokelauan, is used to describe \u2018any such item\u2019, and is encountered most often with negatives and interrogatives. An example of the use of \"he\" as an indefinite article is \u201c\"Vili ake oi k'aumai he toki\" \u201d, where \u2018\"he toki\" \u2019 mean \u2018an axe\u2019. The use of \"he\" and \"te\" in Tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun. However, when describing a plural noun, different articles are used. For plural definite nouns, rather than \"te\", the article \"n\u0101\" is used. \u2018\"Vili ake oi k'aumai n\u0101 nofoa\"\u2019 in Tokelauan would translate to \u201cDo run and bring me the chairs\u201d in English. There are some special cases in which instead of using \"n\u0101\", plural definite nouns have no article before them. The absence of an article is represented by \"0\". One way that it is usually used is if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described. Occasionally, such as if one was describing an entire class of things in a nonspecific fashion, the singular definite noun \"te\" would is used. In English, \u2018\"Ko te povi e kai mutia\"\u2019 means \u201cCows eat grass\u201d. Because this is a general statement about cows, \"te\" is used instead of \"n\u0101\". The \"ko\" serves as a preposition to the \u201c\"te\"\u201d The article \"ni\" is used for describing a plural indefinite noun. \u2018\"E i ei ni tuhi?\"\u2019 translates to \u201cAre there any books?\u201d\nHistorical development.\nArticles often develop by specialization of adjectives or determiners. Their development is often a sign of languages becoming more analytic instead of synthetic, perhaps combined with the loss of inflection as in English, Romance languages, Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian.\nJoseph Greenberg in Universals of Human Language describes \"the cycle of the definite article\": Definite articles (Stage I) evolve from demonstratives, and in turn can become generic articles (Stage II) that may be used in both definite and indefinite contexts, and later merely noun markers (Stage III) that are part of nouns other than proper names and more recent borrowings. Eventually articles may evolve anew from demonstratives.\nDefinite articles.\nDefinite articles typically arise from demonstratives meaning \"that\". For example, the definite articles in most Romance languages\u2014e.g., \"el\", \"il\", \"le\", \"la\", \"lo, a, o\" \u2014 derive from the Latin demonstratives \"ille\" (masculine), \"illa\" (feminine) and \"illud\" (neuter).\nThe English definite article \"the\", written \"\u00fee\" in Middle English, derives from an Old English demonstrative, which, according to gender, was written \"se\" (masculine), \"seo\" (feminine) (\"\u00fee\" and \"\u00feeo\" in the Northumbrian dialect), or \"\u00fe\u00e6t\" (neuter). The neuter form \"\u00fe\u00e6t\" also gave rise to the modern demonstrative \"that\". The \"ye\" occasionally seen in pseudo-archaic usage such as \"Ye Olde Englishe Tea Shoppe\" is actually a form of \"\u00fee\", where the letter thorn (\"\u00fe\") came to be written as a \"y\".\nMultiple demonstratives can give rise to multiple definite articles. Macedonian, for example, in which the articles are suffixed, has \"\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\" (\"stolot\"), the chair; \"\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\" (\"stolov\"), this chair; and \"\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\" (\"stolon\"), that chair. These derive from the Proto-Slavic demonstratives \"*t\u044a\" \"this, that\", \"*ov\u044a\" \"this here\" and \"*on\u044a\" \"that over there, yonder\" respectively. Colognian prepositions articles such as in \"dat Auto\", or \"et Auto\", the car; the first being specifically selected, focused, newly introduced, while the latter is not selected, unfocused, already known, general, or generic.\nStandard Basque distinguishes between proximal and distal definite articles in the plural (dialectally, a proximal singular and an additional medial grade may also be present). The Basque distal form (with infix \"-a-\", etymologically a suffixed and phonetically reduced form of the distal demonstrative \"har-/hai-\") functions as the default definite article, whereas the proximal form (with infix \"-o-\", derived from the proximal demonstrative \"hau-/hon-\") is marked and indicates some kind of (spatial or otherwise) close relationship between the speaker and the referent (e.g., it may imply that the speaker is included in the referent): \"etxeak\" (\"the houses\") vs. \"etxeok\" (\"these houses [of ours]\"), \"euskaldunak\" (\"the Basque speakers\") vs. \"euskaldunok\" (\"we, the Basque speakers\").\nSpeakers of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, a modern Aramaic language that lacks a definite article, may at times use demonstratives \"aha\" and \"aya\" (feminine) or \"awa\" (masculine) \u2013 which translate to \"this\" and \"that\", respectively \u2013 to give the sense of \"the\". In Indonesian, the third person possessive suffix \"-nya\" could be also used as a definite article.\nIndefinite articles.\nIndefinite articles typically arise from adjectives meaning \"one\". For example, the indefinite articles in the Romance languages\u2014e.g., \"un\", \"una\", \"une\"\u2014derive from the Latin adjective \"unus\". Partitive articles, however, derive from Vulgar Latin \"de illo\", meaning \"(some) of the\".\nThe English indefinite article \"an\" is derived from the same root as \"one\". The \"-n\" came to be dropped before consonants, giving rise to the shortened form \"a\". The existence of both forms has led to many cases of juncture loss, for example transforming the original \"a napron\" into the modern \"an apron\".\nThe Persian indefinite article is \"yek\", meaning one.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the Civil War, he provided the Union Army \u2013 specifically General George B. McClellan of the Army of the Potomac \u2013 with military intelligence, including extremely inaccurate enemy troop strength numbers. After the war, his agents played a significant role as strikebreakers \u2013 in particular during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 \u2013 a role that Pinkerton men would continue to play after the death of their founder.\nEarly life.\nAllan Pinkerton was born in the Gorbals, a working-class area of Glasgow, on August 21, 1819, the second surviving son of William Pinkerton, a retired policeman, and Isobel McQueen; he was baptized on August 25, 1819, which many sources incorrectly give as his birthdate. He left school at the age of 10 after his father's death. Pinkerton read voraciously and was largely self-educated. A cooper by trade, he was active in the Scottish Chartist movement as a young man. He was not raised in a religious upbringing, and was a lifelong atheist.\nPinkerton and his wife moved overseas to escape either arrest for his involvement in the Chartist movement, or the ire of the Chartists having turned informer. While sailing toward Canada, their ship accidentally ran aground on Sable Island. They eventually secured passage on a schooner and continued their journey to Detroit, Michigan. Unable to find work there, Pinkerton used the last of his money to buy a horse and wagon. He and his wife then traveled west to Chicago, where he found work as a cooper for a brewery and began to establish a new life. In 1843, he heard of Dundee Township, Illinois, fifty miles northwest of Chicago on the Fox River. He built a cabin and started a cooperage, sending for his wife in Chicago when their cabin was complete. As early as 1844, Pinkerton worked for the Chicago abolitionist leaders, and his Dundee home was a stop on the Underground Railroad.\nDetective.\nPinkerton first became interested in criminal detective work while wandering through the wooded groves around Dundee, looking for trees to make barrel staves, when he came across a band of counterfeiters, who may have been affiliated with the notorious Banditti of the Prairie. After observing their movements for some time he informed the local sheriff, who arrested them. This later led to Pinkerton being appointed, in 1849, as the first police detective in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois. In 1850, he partnered with Chicago attorney Edward Rucker in forming the North-Western Police Agency, which later became Pinkerton &amp; Co, and finally Pinkerton National Detective Agency, still in existence today as Pinkerton Consulting and Investigations, a subsidiary of Securitas AB. Pinkerton's business insignia was a wide open eye with the caption \"We never sleep.\" Allan Pinkerton gained public attention when he and his detectives successfully solved a vandalism case at the Old French Cemetery near Lake Michigan. There, they apprehended three medical students who admitted to committing the crime of grave robbing for medical research purposes. When the story was reported in the news, highlighting Pinkerton\u2019s role in the arrest, it brought widespread attention to his agency. The following morning, the Pinkerton office was flooded with new clients seeking his services. As the US expanded in territory, rail transport increased. Pinkerton's agency solved a series of train robberies during the 1850s, first bringing Pinkerton into contact with George B. McClellan, then Chief Engineer and Vice President of the Illinois Central Railroad, and Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer who sometimes represented the company. In 1857, the \"Chicago Tribune\" urged the city to dismiss its police chief and hire Allan Pinkerton in response to a surge in thefts throughout the city. In 1866, Allan Pinkerton achieved major success by capturing a group of thieves who had stolen $700,000 from a train safe. Through his investigation, he was able to recover $688,000 of the stolen funds. Pinkerton founded an organization that was revolutionary for its time. He hired the first female detective, Kate Warne, and established core investigative principles that continue to influence modern detective work to this day. \nPinkerton was known to be a friend of abolitionist John Brown. On March 11, 1859, he supported Brown by giving him $500 and a ticket on the Michigan Central Railroad to Detroit. He also attended the secret meetings held by John Brown and Frederick Douglass in Chicago along with abolitionists John Jones and Henry O. Wagoner. At those meetings, Jones, Wagoner, and Pinkerton helped purchase clothes and supplies for Brown. Jones' wife, Mary, guessed that the supplies included the suit Brown was hanged in after the failure of John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in November 1859.\nAmerican Civil War.\nWhen the Civil War began, Pinkerton served as head of the Union Intelligence Service during the first two years, heading off an alleged assassination plot in Baltimore, Maryland while guarding Abraham Lincoln on his way to Washington, D.C., as well as providing estimates of Confederate troop numbers to General George B. McClellan when he commanded the Army of the Potomac. His agents often worked undercover as Confederate soldiers and sympathizers to gather military intelligence. Pinkerton himself served on several undercover missions as a Confederate soldier using the alias Major E.J. Allen. He worked across the Deep South in the summer of 1861, focusing on fortifications and Confederate plans. He was found out in Memphis and barely escaped with his life. This counterintelligence work done by Pinkerton and his agents is comparable to the work done by today's U.S. Army Counterintelligence Special Agents in which Pinkerton's agency is considered an early predecessor. He was succeeded as Intelligence Service chief by Lafayette Baker; the Intelligence Service was the predecessor of the U.S. Secret Service. His work led to the establishment of the Federal secret service.\nMilitary historians have been strongly critical of the intelligence Pinkerton provided for the Union Army, which for the most part was undigested raw data. In the view of T. Harry Williams, Pinkerton's work was \"the poorest intelligence service any general ever had.\" Pinkerton's estimates of Rebel troop numbers, derived from his credulous interrogations of Confederate prisoners, deserters, refugees, escaped slaves (\"contrabands\"), and civilians unused to counting large bodies of men, badly exaggerated the size of those formations, sometimes almost doubling their actual strength. Pinkerton's numbers caused McClellan to consistently believe that he was drastically outnumbered by the Confederate forces he faced. McClellan's action in the face of what he believed were overwhelming odds were unduly cautious, causing him to avoid offensive actions almost completely in favor of siege warfare and taking a defensive posture. This led to his retreat in the Peninsula Campaign, his failure to crush Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Antietam, and his unnecessary delay in carrying out his orders to pursue Lee's army as they retreated from their invasion of Maryland back into Virginia. These actions were all based on McClellan's firm trust in Pinkerton's reports, although the problem was compounded by the intelligence-gathering ineptitude of Brigadier General Alfred Pleasonton, McClellan's head cavalryman and his alternate source of enemy troop information when Pinkerton did not have agents in place.\nOn the other hand, Edwin C. Fishel in \"The Secret War for the Union\" and James Mackay in \"Allan Pinkerton: The First Private Eye\" argue that the troop strength figures which Pinkerton passed on to McClellan were relatively accurate, and that McClellan himself held primary responsibility for inflating those numbers to wildly unrealistic levels.\nAfter the war.\nFollowing Pinkerton's services for the Union Army, he continued his pursuit of train robbers, including the Reno Gang. He was hired by the railroad express companies to track outlaw Jesse James, but after Pinkerton failed to capture him, the railroad withdrew their financial support and Pinkerton continued to track James at his own expense. After James allegedly captured and killed one of Pinkerton's undercover agents (who was working undercover at the farm neighboring the James family's farmstead), he abandoned the chase. Some consider this failure Pinkerton's biggest defeat. In 1872, the Spanish Government hired Pinkerton to help suppress a revolution in Cuba which intended to end slavery and give citizens the right to vote. If Pinkerton knew this, then it directly contradicts statements in his 1883 book \"The Spy of the Rebellion\", where he professes to be an ardent abolitionist and hater of slavery. The Spanish government abolished slavery in 1880 and a Royal Decree abolished the last vestiges of it in 1886. \nPersonal life.\nPinkerton married Joan Carfrae (1822\u20131887), a singer from Duddingston, in Edinburgh on March 13, 1842. They remained married until his death. They had six children: Isabella, William, Joan, Robert, Mary, and Joan.\nDeath.\nPinkerton died in Chicago on July 1, 1884. It is usually said that Pinkerton slipped on the pavement and bit his tongue, resulting in gangrene. Contemporary reports give conflicting causes, such as that he succumbed to a stroke \u2013 he had a year earlier \u2013 or to malaria, which he had contracted during a trip to the Southern United States. At the time of his death, he was working on a system to centralize all criminal identification records; such a database is now maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nPinkerton is buried between his wife and Kate Warne in the family plot in Graceland Cemetery, Chicago. He is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.\nLegacy.\nAfter his death, the agency continued to operate and soon became a major force against the labor movement developing in the US and Canada. This effort changed the image of the Pinkertons for years. They were involved in numerous activities against labor during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including:\nDespite his agency's later reputation for anti-labor activities, Pinkerton himself was heavily involved in pro-labor politics as a young man. Though Pinkerton considered himself pro-labor, he opposed strikes and distrusted labor unions.\nAllan Pinkerton was so famous that for decades after his death, his surname was a slang term for a private eye, whether they were agents of the Pinkerton Agency or not. The \"Mr. Pinkerton\" novels, by American mystery writer Zenith Jones Brown (under the pseudonym David Frome), were about Welsh-born amateur detective Evan Pinkerton and may have been inspired by the slang term. \nWritings.\nPinkerton produced numerous popular detective books, ostensibly based on his own exploits and those of his agents. Some were published after his death, and they are considered to have been more motivated by a desire to promote his detective agency than a literary endeavor. Most historians believe that Allan Pinkerton hired ghostwriters, but the books nonetheless bear his name and no doubt reflect his views.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\nFurther reading"}

He is regarded as one of the founders of colloid chemistry.\nLife.\nGraham was born in Glasgow, Scotland and was educated at the High School of Glasgow. Graham's father was a successful textile manufacturer, and wanted his son to enter into the Church of Scotland. Instead, defying his father's wishes, Graham became a student at the University of Glasgow in 1819. There he developed a strong interest in chemistry, studying under Professor Thomas Thomson, who was impressed and influenced by the young man. He left the university after receiving his MA in 1824.\nHe later studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and then briefly taught chemistry at the Glasgow University Portland Street Medical School. In 1828 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer was Edward Turner. He won the Society's Keith Medal for the period 1831\u201333.\nin 1830 he was appointed to be the first professor of chemistry at the Anderson's Medical School, a post later named the Freeland Chair of Chemistry. He also delivered lectures to the Glasgow Mechanics' Institution before moving to take up a professorship at the University of London, where Graham founded the Chemical Society of London in 1841. In 1866, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nHis final position was the Master of the Mint, where he stayed from 1855 until his death. He was the last person to hold that position: afterwards the post was amalgamated into the Chancellor of the Exchequer while all the actual responsibilities were transferred to the Deputy Master.\nHe died in Gordon Square in London but his body was returned to Glasgow for burial in the family plot at Glasgow Cathedral.\nScientific works.\nThomas Graham is known for his studies on the behavior of gases, which resulted in his formulation of two relationships, both since becoming known as \"Graham's laws,\" the first regarding gas diffusion, and the second regarding gas effusion. In the former case, Graham deduced that when measured repeatedly under the same conditions of pressure and temperature, the rate of diffusive mixing of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its density, and given the relationship between density and molar mass, also inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. In the same way, in the latter case, regarding effusion of a gas through a pin hole in to a vacuum, Graham deduced that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. These two are sometimes referred to as a combined law (describing both phenomena).\nIn applied areas, Graham also made fundamental discoveries related to dialysis, a process used in research and industrial settings, as well as in modern health care. Graham's study of colloids resulted in his ability to separate colloids and crystalloids using a so-called \"dialyzer\", using technology that is a rudimentary forerunner of technology in modern kidney dialysis machines. These studies were foundational in the field known as colloid chemistry, and Graham is credited as one of its founders.\nHe also proposed the association theory which claimed that the substances such as cellulose or starch that we now know are polymers are composed from smaller molecules hold together by unknown forces. It remained the most popular explanation until Hermann Staudinger's macromolecular theory of 1920s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The basic gas laws were discovered by the end of the 18th century when scientists found out that relationships between pressure, volume and temperature of a sample of gas could be obtained which would hold to approximation for all gases. The combination of several empirical gas laws led to the development of the ideal gas law.\nThe ideal gas law was later found to be consistent with atomic and kinetic theory.\nHistory.\nIn 1643, the Italian physicist and mathematician, Evangelista Torricelli, who for a few months had acted as Galileo Galilei's secretary, conducted a celebrated experiment in Florence. He demonstrated that a column of mercury in an inverted tube can be supported by the pressure of air outside of the tube, with the creation of a small section of vacuum above the mercury. This experiment essentially paved the way towards the invention of the barometer, as well as drawing the attention of Robert Boyle, then a \"skeptical\" scientist working in England. Boyle was inspired by Torricelli's experiment to investigate how the elasticity of air responds to varying pressure, and he did this through a series of experiments with a setup reminiscent of that used by Torricelli. Boyle published his results in 1662. \nLater on, in 1676, the French physicist Edme Mariotte, independently arrived at the same conclusions of Boyle, while also noting some dependency of air volume on temperature. However it took another century and a half for the development of thermometry and recognition of the absolute zero temperature scale, which eventually allowed the discovery of temperature-dependent gas laws.\nBoyle's law.\nIn 1662, Robert Boyle systematically studied the relationship between the volume and pressure of a fixed amount of gas at a constant temperature. He observed that the volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at a constant temperature.\nBoyle's law, published in 1662, states that, at a constant temperature, the product of the pressure and volume of a given mass of an ideal gas in a closed system is always constant. It can be verified experimentally using a pressure gauge and a variable volume container. It can also be derived from the kinetic theory of gases: if a container, with a fixed number of molecules inside, is reduced in volume, more molecules will strike a given area of the sides of the container per unit time, causing a greater pressure.\nStatement.\nBoyle's law states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely related to its pressure when its temperature is kept constant.\nThe concept can be represented with these formulae:\nformula_4\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume of a gas, and \"k\"1 is the constant in this equation (and is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations).\nCharles' law.\nCharles' law, or the law of volumes, was founded in 1787 by Jacques Charles. It states that, for a given mass of an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, assuming in a closed system.\nThe statement of Charles' law is as follows:\nthe volume (V) of a given mass of a gas, at constant pressure (P), is directly proportional to its temperature (T).\nStatement.\nCharles' law states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The volume of a given fixed mass of a dry gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at a constant pressure.\nTherefore,\nformula_7,\nwhere \"V\" is the volume of a gas, \"T\" is the absolute temperature and \"k\"2 is a proportionality constant (which is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations in this article).\nGay-Lussac's law.\nGay-Lussac's law, Amontons' law or the pressure law was founded by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1808.\nStatement.\nGay-Lussac's law states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The pressure exerted by a given mass and constant volume of an ideal gas on the sides of its container is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.\nTherefore,\nformula_10,\nwhere \"P\" is the pressure, \"T\" is the absolute temperature, and \"k\" is another proportionality constant.\nAvogadro's law.\nAvogadro's law, Avogadro's hypothesis, Avogadro's principle or Avogadro-Amp\u00e8re's hypothesis is an experimental gas law which was hypothesized by Amedeo Avogadro in 1811. It related the volume of a gas to the amount of substance of gas present.\nStatement.\nAvogadro's law states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The volume occupied by an ideal gas at a constant temperature is directly proportional to the number of molecules of the gas present in the container.\nThis statement gives rise to the molar volume of a gas, which at STP (273.15\u00a0K, 1 atm) is about 22.4\u00a0L. The relation is given by:\nformula_11, orformula_12where \"n\" is equal to the number of molecules of gas (or the number of moles of gas).\nCombined and ideal gas laws.\nThe combined gas law or general gas equation is obtained by combining Boyle's law, Charles's law, and Gay-Lussac's law. It shows the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for a fixed mass of gas:\nformula_13\nThis can also be written as:\nformula_14\nWith the addition of Avogadro's law, the combined gas law develops into the ideal gas law:\nformula_15\nwhere \"P\" is the pressure, \"V\" is volume, \"n\" is the number of moles, \"R\" is the universal gas constant and \"T\" is the absolute temperature.\nThe proportionality constant, now named R, is the universal gas constant with a value of 8.3144598 (kPa\u2219L)/(mol\u2219K).\nAn equivalent formulation of this law is:\nformula_16\nwhere \"P\" is the pressure, \"V\" is the volume, \"N\" is the number of gas molecules, \"k\"B is the Boltzmann constant (1.381\u00d710\u221223J\u00b7K\u22121 in SI units) and T is the absolute temperature.\nThese equations are exact only for an ideal gas, which neglects various intermolecular effects (see real gas). However, the ideal gas law is a good approximation for most gases under moderate pressure and temperature.\nThis law has the following important consequences:\nformula_17\nand all component gases and the mixture are at the same temperature and volume\nwhere \"P\"total is the total pressure of the gas mixture\n\"P\"i is the partial pressure or pressure of the component gas at the given volume and temperature.\nformula_18\nand all component gases and the mixture are at the same temperature and pressure\nwhere \"V\"total is the total volume of the gas mixture or the volume of the container,\n\"V\"i is the partial volume, or volume of the component gas at the given pressure and temperature.\nformula_19\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The number of marks on the ruler is its \"order\", and the largest distance between two of its marks is its \"length\". Translation and reflection of a Golomb ruler are considered trivial, so the smallest mark is customarily put at 0 and the next mark at the smaller of its two possible values. Golomb rulers can be viewed as a one-dimensional special case of Costas arrays.\nThe Golomb ruler was named for Solomon W. Golomb and discovered independently by and . Sophie Piccard also published early research on these sets, in 1939, stating as a theorem the claim that two Golomb rulers with the same distance set must be congruent. This turned out to be false for six-point rulers, but true otherwise.\nThere is no requirement that a Golomb ruler be able to measure \"all\" distances up to its length, but if it does, it is called a \"perfect\" Golomb ruler. It has been proved that no perfect Golomb ruler exists for five or more marks. A Golomb ruler is \"optimal\" if no shorter Golomb ruler of the same order exists. Creating Golomb rulers is easy, but proving the optimal Golomb ruler (or rulers) for a specified order is computationally very challenging.\nDistributed.net has completed distributed massively parallel searches for optimal order-24 through order-28 Golomb rulers, each time confirming the suspected candidate ruler.\nCurrently, the complexity of finding optimal Golomb rulers (OGRs) of arbitrary order \"n\" (where \"n\" is given in unary) is unknown. In the past there was some speculation that it is an NP-hard problem. Problems related to the construction of Golomb rulers are provably shown to be NP-hard, where it is also noted that no known NP-complete problem has similar flavor to finding Golomb rulers.\nGolomb rulers have practical applications in information theory and error correction, radio frequency selection and antenna placement, as well as current transformers.\nDefinitions.\nGolomb rulers as sets.\nA set of integers formula_1 where formula_2 is a Golomb ruler if and only if\nformula_3\nThe \"order\" of such a Golomb ruler is formula_4 and its \"length\" is formula_5.

Let \"x\"i \u2208 {0,1} be binary variables indicating the presence of a mark at position \"i\", for \"i\" = 1, ..., \"L\"u, where \"L\"u is an upper bound on the length of the ruler. Let \"t\" be a continuous variable representing the total length of the ruler. The problem is formulated as:\nformula_17\nIn this model, the variables formula_18 define the ruler marks, and the constraint involving the bilinear terms formula_19 ensures that all pairwise distances are distinct. The objective is to minimize the largest marked position, which corresponds to the ruler's length. \nPractical applications.\nInformation theory and error correction.\nGolomb rulers are used within information theory related to error correcting codes.\nRadio frequency selection.\nGolomb rulers are used in the selection of radio frequencies to reduce the effects of intermodulation interference with both terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications.\nRadio antenna placement.\nGolomb rulers are used in the design of phased arrays of radio antennas. In radio astronomy one-dimensional synthesis arrays can have the antennas in a Golomb ruler configuration in order to obtain minimum redundancy of the Fourier component sampling.\nCurrent transformers.\nMulti-ratio current transformers use Golomb rulers to place transformer tap points.\nMethods of construction.\nA number of construction methods produce asymptotically optimal Golomb rulers.\nErd\u0151s\u2013Tur\u00e1n construction.\nThe following construction, due to Paul Erd\u0151s and P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n, produces a Golomb ruler for every odd prime p.\nformula_20\nKnown optimal Golomb rulers.\nThe following table contains all known optimal Golomb rulers, excluding those with marks in the reverse order.

Ice creams made from cow's milk alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, oat, cashew, coconut, almond milk, or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan. Banana \"nice cream\" is a 100% fruit-based vegan alternative. Frozen yoghurt, or \"froyo\", is similar to ice cream but uses yoghurt and can be lower in fat. Fruity sorbets or sherbets are not ice creams but are often available in ice cream shops.\nThe meaning of the name \"ice cream\" varies from one country to another. In some countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of butterfat from cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream, usually due to being reduced fat (often through cost reduction), are sometimes labelled frozen dairy dessert instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants.\nHistory.\nEarly frozen desserts.\nThe origins of frozen desserts are obscure, although several accounts exist about their history. Some sources say the history of ice cream begins in Persia in 550 BC. \nA Roman cookbook dating back to the 1st century includes recipes for sweet desserts that are sprinkled with snow, and there are Persian records from the 2nd century for sweetened drinks chilled with ice.\n is a Japanese dessert made with ice and flavoured syrup. The origins of date back to the Heian period in Japanese history, when blocks of ice saved during the colder months would be shaved and served with sweet syrup to the Japanese aristocracy during the summer. 's origin is referred to in \"The Pillow Book\", a book of observations written by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, who served the Imperial Court during the Heian period.\nThe earliest known written process to artificially make ice is known not from culinary texts, but the 13th-century writings of Syrian historian Ibn Abi Usaybi'a in his book \"Kitab Uyun al-anba fi tabaqat-al-atibba\" (Book of Sources of Information on the Classes of Physicians) concerning medicine in which Ibn Abi Usaybi'a attributes the process to an even older author, Ibn Bakhtawayhi, of whom nothing is known.\nIce cream production became easier with the discovery of the endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could be chilled easily but not frozen. The addition of salt lowered the melting point of ice, drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze.\nEarly modern.\nIn the 16th century, the Mughal Empire used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to its capital, Delhi, used to create kulfi, a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent often described as traditional Indian ice cream.\nEurope.\nThe technique of freezing was not known from any European sources prior to the 16th century. During the 16th century, authors made reference to the refrigerant effect that happened when salt was added to ice. By the latter part of the 17th century sorbets and ice creams were made using this process.\nIce cream's spread throughout Europe is sometimes attributed to Moorish traders, but more often Marco Polo. Though it is not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after learning of them during his travels to China. According to a legend, the Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici introduced flavoured sorbet ices to France when she brought Italian chefs with her to France upon marrying the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (Henry II of France) in 1533. No Italian chefs were present in France during the Medici period, and ice cream already existed in France before de Medici was born. One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the \"frozen snow\" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative. There is no evidence to support these legends.\nFrance.\nIn 1665, the , edited in Montpellier by Jean Fargeon, listed a type of frozen sorbet. While the composition of this sorbet is not provided, Fargeon specified that it was consumed frozen using a container that was plunged into a mixture of ice and saltpetre. These sorbets were transported in pots made of clay and sold for three livres per pound.\nAccording to , the practice of cooling drinks with ice and snow had already emerged in Paris, particularly in the court, during the 16th century. The narrator notes that his hosts stored ice and snow, which they later added to their wine. This practice slowly progressed during the reign of Louis XIII and was likely a necessary step towards the creation of ice cream. In 1682, provided a recipe for a specific type of ice cream, called .\nIn 1686, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream caf\u00e9 in Paris, and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years, another 250 caf\u00e9s opened in Paris.\nThe first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemery's . Recipes for saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in Fran\u00e7ois Massialot's , starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.\nEngland.\nThe first recorded mention of ice cream in England was in 1671. Elias Ashmole described the dishes served at the Feast of St George at Windsor for Charles II in 1671 and included \"one plate of ice cream\". The only table at the banquet with ice cream on it was that of the King. The first recipe for ice cream in English was published in \"Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts,\" in London in 1718:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To ice cream.\nTake Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten'd, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou'd freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten'd; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.\u2014\u200a\nThe 1751 edition of \"The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy\" by Hannah Glasse includes a recipe for ice cream: \"H. GLASSE Art of Cookery (ed. 4) 333 (heading) To make Ice Cream...set it [the cream] into the larger Bason. Fill it with Ice, and a Handful of Salt.\" by M. Emy, in 1768, was a cookbook devoted to recipes for flavoured ices and ice cream.\nIn 1769 Domenico Negri, an Italian confectioner, founded a business in Berkeley Square London which would become famous for its ice creams. His shop was at the Sign of the Pineapple (an emblem used by confectioners) and his trade card said he sold \"All Sorts of English, French and Italian wet and dry'd Sweet Meats, Cedrati and Bergamot Chips, Naples Diavoloni, All sorts of Baskets &amp; Cakes, fine and Common Sugar plums\", but most importantly, \"all Sorts of Ice, Fruits and creams in the best Italian manner.\"\nIn 1789 Frederick Nutt, who served an apprenticeship at Negri's establishment, first published \"The Complete Confectioner\". The book had 31 recipes for ice creams, some with fresh fruit, others with jams, and some using fruit syrups. Flavours included ginger, chocolate, brown breadcrumbs and one flavoured with Parmesan cheese.\nNorth America.\nAn early North American reference to ice cream is from an account in 1744 of a dinner held by governor Thomas Bladen and his wife: \"...after which came a Dessert no less Curious. Among the Rarities of which it was Compos'd, was some fine Ice Cream, which, with the Strawberries and Milk, eat most Deliciously.\"\nWho brought ice cream to the United States first is unknown. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Chatham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790. The same records show president Thomas Jefferson having an 18-step recipe for ice cream. Although it is incorrect that Jefferson introduced ice cream to America, as is popularly believed, he did help to introduce vanilla ice cream. First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of U.S. President James Madison, served ice cream at her husband's Inaugural Ball in 1813.\nSmall-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezers were invented in England by Agnes Marshall and in America by Nancy Johnson in the 1840s.\nExpansion in popularity.\nIn the Mediterranean, ice cream appears to have been accessible to ordinary people by the mid-18th century. Ice cream became popular and inexpensive in England in the mid-19th century, when Swiss \u00e9migr\u00e9 Carlo Gatti set up the first stand outside Charing Cross station in 1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice house. Gatti built an 'ice well' to store ice that he cut from Regent's Canal under a contract with the Regent's Canal Company. By 1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale from Norway.\nIn New Zealand, a newspaper advertisement for ice cream appeared in 1866, claiming to be the first time ice cream was available in Wellington. Commercial manufacturing was underway in 1875. Ice cream rapidly gained in popularity in New Zealand throughout the 20th century. By 2018, exported ice cream products included new flavours such as matcha to cater to Asian markets.\nAgnes Marshall, regarded as the \"queen of ices\" in England, did much to popularize ice cream recipes and make its consumption into a fashionable middle-class pursuit. She wrote four books: \"The Book of Ices\" (1885), \"Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery\" (1888), \"Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes\" (1891) and \"Fancy Ices\" (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream.\nIce cream soda was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the ice cream cone and banana split became popular in the early 20th century.\nThe first mention of the cone being used as an edible receptacle for the ice cream is in \"Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery\" of 1888. Her recipe for \"Cornet with Cream\" said that \"the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons\". The ice cream cone was popularized in the US at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\nThe history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the soda shop, the soda fountain, and the ice cream parlour. During the American Prohibition, the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.\nIce cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap refrigeration became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: Howard Johnson's restaurants advertised \"a world of 28 flavors\", and Baskin-Robbins made its 31 flavours (\"one for every day of the month\") the cornerstone of its marketing strategy (the company now boasts that it has developed over 1,000 varieties).\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream, which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a spigot. In the United States, chains such as Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins later incorporated it into their menu.\nTechnological innovations such as these have introduced various food additives into ice cream, most notably the stabilizing agent gluten, to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.\nThe 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as \"premium\" and \"super-premium\" varieties under brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry's, Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company and H\u00e4agen-Dazs.\nComposition.\nIce cream is a colloidal emulsion made with water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion that has a dispersed phase as fat globules. The emulsion is turned into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. The triacylglycerols in fat are nonpolar and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also, ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to its consistency. The proteins contribute to the emulsification, aeration and texture. Sucrose, which is a disaccharide, is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose, which is sugar present in milk, will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will remain unfrozen and will not give a hard texture. Too much lactose will result in a non-ideal texture because of either excessive freezing point depression or lactose crystallization.\nProduction.\nBefore the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including US Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This is called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water.\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first US patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.\nIn Europe and America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an built-in freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes.\nAn unusual method of making ice cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it. B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.\nRetail sales.\nIce cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. In 2015, the US produced nearly of ice cream.\nSpecialty job.\nToday, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want to purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from travelling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \"ice cream trucks\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as \"Turkey in the Straw\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighbourhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.\nIngredients and definitions.\nMany countries have regulations controlling what can be described as ice cream.\nIn the United Kingdom, Food Labelling Regulations (1996) set a requirement of at least 5% milk fat and 2.5% milk protein in order to be sold as ice cream within the UK. In rest of the European Union, a trade organization called European Ice Cream Association calls for minimum dairy fat content of 5%. In 2015, these regulations were relaxed so that containing milk fat or protein was no longer necessary in the UK for a product to be sold as \"ice cream\", though at least 5% milk fat is still required for a product to be labeled \"dairy ice cream\". After this change, many UK products labelled as \"ice cream\" substitute milk fat with cheaper alternatives like palm oil, coconut oil, and vegetable fats. \nIn the US, the FDA rules state that to be described as \"ice cream\", a product must have the following composition:\nIt generally also has:\nThese compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant. Even low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge, for instance, contains per half-cup due to its high sugar content.\nAccording to the Canadian Food and Drugs Act and Regulations, ice cream in Canada is divided into \"ice cream mix\" and \"ice cream\". Each has a different set of regulations.\nPhysical properties.\nIce cream is considered a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mix with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.\nOstwald ripening.\nOstwald ripening is the explanation for the growth of large crystals at the expense of small ones in the dispersion phase. This process is also called migratory recrystallization. It involves the formation of sharp crystals. Theories about Ostwald recrystallization admit that after a period of time, the recrystallization process can be described by the following equation:\nformula_1\nWhere r (0) is the initial size, n the order of recrystallization, and t a time constant for recrystallization that depends on the rate R (in units of size/time).\nTo make ice cream smooth, recrystallization must occur as slowly as possible, because small crystals create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.\nFood safety concerns.\nFrom the perspective of food chemistry, ice cream is a colloid or foam. The dietary emulsifier plays an important role in ice cream. Soy lecithin and polysorbate are two popular emulsifiers used for ice cream production. A mouse study in 2015 shows that two commonly used dietary emulsifiers carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and polysorbate 80 (P80) can potentially cause inflammatory bowel diseases and other metabolic syndromes.\nAround the world.\nAround the world, different cultures have developed unique versions of ice cream, suiting the product to local tastes and preferences.\nOverview.\nItalian ice cream, or gelato as it is known, is a traditional and popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in \"gelaterie a produzione propria\". Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. It typically contains 4\u20139% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%.\nPer capita, Australians and New Zealanders are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating and each per year respectively, behind the United States where people eat each per year.\n\"Ice Golas\" are a summer treat consisting of shaved ice packed into a popsicle form on a stick and soaked in flavoured sugar syrup, a popular choice being \"kala khatta\" in India, made from the sweet and sour jamun fruit. In Puerto Rico a popular dessert is the Piragua, shaved ice put into a cone shaped cup, with different syrup flavors poured on top of the ice. Vendors walk on sidewalks and near the beach with a small cart containing a huge block of ice and 10 to 15 bottles containing fruit syrups such as Tamarindo and Parcha.\nIn Spain, ice cream is often in the style of Italian gelato. Spanish can be found in many caf\u00e9s or speciality ice cream stores. While many traditional flavours are sold, caf\u00e9s may also sell flavours like nata, viola, crema catalana, or tiramisu. In the 1980s, the Spanish industry was known for creating many creative and weird ice cream bars.\nIn the United Kingdom, 14million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth \u00a31.8billion (according to a report produced in 2024). In the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as \"Philadelphia style\" ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a custard is sometimes called \"French ice cream\". American federal labelling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat. Americans consume about 23 litres of ice cream per person per year\u2014the most in the world. According to the NPD Group, the most popular ice cream flavours in the U.S. are vanilla and chocolate with a combined market share of 40% as of 2008.\nCones.\n\"Mrs A. B. Marshall's Cookery Book\", published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones. Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularize ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.\nReliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. According to legend, an ice cream vendor at the fair ran out of cardboard dishes. The vendor at the Syrian waffle booth next door, unsuccessful in the intense heat, offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles. The new product sold well and was widely copied by other vendors.\nCryogenics.\nIn 2006, some commercial ice cream makers began to use liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, thus eliminating the need for a conventional ice cream freezer. The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapour cloud. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still \"steaming\" with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporized. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw.\nGood results can also be achieved with the more readily available dry ice, and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller profit margins and diminishes the importance of factors (such as brand name) other than price. \nMost commodities are raw materials, basic resources, agricultural, or mining products, such as iron ore, sugar, or grains like rice and wheat. Commodities can also be mass-produced unspecialized products such as chemicals and computer memory. Popular commodities include crude oil, corn, and gold.\nOther definitions of commodity include something useful or valued and an alternative term for an economic good or service available for purchase in the market. In such standard works as Alfred Marshall's \"Principles of Economics\" (1920) and L\u00e9on Walras's \"Elements of Pure Economics\" ([1926] 1954) 'commodity' serves as general term for an economic good or service.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"commodity\" came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French \"commodit\u00e9\", \"amenity, convenience\". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin \"commoditas\", meaning \"suitability, convenience, advantage\". The Latin word \"commodus\" (from which English gets other words including \"commodious\" and \"accommodate\") meant variously \"appropriate\", \"proper measure, time, or condition\", and \"advantage, benefit\".\nDescription.\nCharacteristics.\nIn economics, the term \"commodity\" is used specifically for economic goods that have full or partial but substantial fungibility; that is, the market treats their instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. Karl Marx described this property as follows: \"From the taste of wheat, it is not possible to tell who produced it, a Russian serf, a French peasant or an English capitalist.\" Petroleum and copper are examples of commodity goods: their supply and demand are a part of one universal market.\nNon-commodity items such as stereo systems have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the brand, the user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another.\nThe price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets.\nSix Major Characteristics of Commodities.\nSource:\nHard and soft commodities.\nSoft commodities are goods that are grown, such as wheat, or rice.\nHard commodities are mined. Examples include gold, silver, helium, oil.\nEnergy commodities include electricity, gas, coal and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store, and must therefore be consumed as soon as it is produced.\nCommoditization.\nCommoditization occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of the intellectual capital necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that formerly carried premium margins for market participants have become commodities, such as generic pharmaceuticals and DRAM chips. An article in \"The New York Times\" cites multivitamin supplements as an example of commoditization; a 50\u00a0mg tablet of calcium is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and markets it, and as such, multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little brand differentiation. Following this trend, nanomaterials are emerging from carrying premium profit margins for market participants to a status of commodification.\nThere is a spectrum of commoditization, rather than a binary distinction of \"commodity versus differentiable product\". Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar), in markets where energy choice lets a buyer opt (and pay more) for renewable methods if desired. Many products' degree of commoditization depends on the buyer's mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are not differentiated by many customers; for them, the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor in the purchasing choice. Other customers take into consideration other factors besides price, such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare. To these customers, distinctions such as \"organic versus not\" or \"cage free versus not\" count toward differentiating brands of milk or eggs, and percentage of recycled content or Forest Stewardship Council certification count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper.\nGlobal commodities trading company.\nThis is a list of companies trading globally in commodities, descending by size as of October 28, 2011.\nCommodity trade.\nIn the original and simplified sense, commodities were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer were considered equivalent. On a commodity exchange, it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the commodity, not any quality inherent in a specific producer's product.\nCommodities exchanges include:\nMarkets for trading commodities can be very efficient, particularly if the division into pools matches demand segments. These markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find an equilibrium price and quantity. In addition, investors can gain passive exposure to the commodity markets through a commodity price index.\nIn order to diversify their investments and mitigate the risks associated with inflationary debasement of currencies, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds allocate capital to non-listed assets such as a commodities and commodity-related infrastructure.\nInventory data.\nThe inventory of commodities, with low inventories typically leading to more volatile future prices and increasing the risk of a \"stockout\" (inventory exhaustion). According to economist theorists, companies receive a convenience yield by holding inventories of certain commodities. Data on inventories of commodities are not available from one common source, although data is available from various sources. Inventory data on 31 commodities was used in a 2006 study on the relationship between inventories and commodity futures risk premiums.\nCommodification of labour.\nIn classical political economy and especially in Karl Marx's critique of political economy, a commodity is an object or a good or service (\"product\" or \"activity\") produced by human labour. Objects are external to man. However, some objects attain \"use value\" to persons in this world, when they are found to be \"necessary, useful or pleasant in life\". \"Use value\" makes an object \"an object of human wants\", or \"a means of subsistence in the widest sense\".\nAs society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At this stage, these goods and services became \"commodities\". According to Marx, commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are \"exchanged in a market\". In the marketplace, where commodities are sold, \"use value\" is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use value, commodities must have an \"exchange value\"\u2014a value that could be expressed in the market.\nPrior to Marx, many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value. Adam Smith maintained that exchange value was made up of rent, profit, labour and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of husbandry. David Ricardo, a follower of Adam Smith, modified Smith's approach on this point by alleging that labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service. While maintaining that all exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity, Ricardo noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity. The other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker\u2014unpaid labour. This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit. The means of production means the site where the commodity is made, the raw products that are used in the production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity.\nHowever, not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the market. These priced goods are also treated as commodities, e.g. human labour-power, works of art and natural resources (\"earth itself is an instrument of labour\"), even though they may not be produced specifically for the market, or be non-reproducible goods.\nMarx's analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods, using the labour theory of value. This problem was extensively debated by Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow among others.\nAll three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100% of the exchange value of any commodity. In varying degrees, these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of commodities. Marx held that the \"price\" and the \"value\" of a commodity were not synonymous. Price of any commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time. The \"value\" of the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that commodity.\nPrior to Marx, economists noted that the problem with using the \"quantity of labour\" to establish the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society at large, an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the \"socially necessary labour time\". Socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the \"exchange value\" of a given commodity.\nCommodity super cycle.\nCommodity super cycles are periods of time, around a decade, where commodities as a whole trade at a price that is greater than their long term moving average. A super cycle will usually occur when there is large industrial and commercial change in a country or world that requires more resources to support the change. As prices rise, goods and services that rely on commodities rise with them.\nHistory of super cycles.\nThere have been four super cycles over the last 120 years worldwide. The first commodity super cycle started in late 1890 and was accelerated on the back of widespread U.S. industrialization and World War 1. In 1917 commodity prices peaked and then entered a downtrend to the 1930s. As war erupted in Europe in the late 1930s and eventually including the U.S., the world saw a new cycle begin. Countries were not just preparing for war but also for the aftermath of World War II as large parts of Europe and Asia faced heavy rebuilding. This cycle eventually peaked in 1951 and faded away in the early 70s. In the 1970s as world economies grew, they needed more materials and energy to support expansion leading to increases in prices across the board. This boom came to an end as foreign investments fled as extractive industries became nationalized. The most recent of commodity super cycles began in 2000 as China joined the World Trade Organization. China was also in the beginning of their boom as industry and expansion took off. Workers moved into cities as emerging industries took off and offered a lot of new jobs and opportunities. In 2008 when the Great Recession hit, it put a halt onto the supercycle as GDP's across the world tanked leaving many economies in recessions.\nThe next or the fifth super cycle could arrive as the world enters the final phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and starts to build massive clean energy infrastructure in view of the commodity price increase.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48227", "revid": "4770293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48227", "title": "Torquato Tasso", "text": "Italian poet (1544\u20131595)\nTorquato Tasso ( , , ; 11 March 1544\u00a0\u2013 25 April 1595) was an Italian poet of the 16th century, known for his 1581 poem \"Gerusalemme liberata\" (\"Jerusalem Delivered\"), in which he depicts a highly imaginative version of the combats between Christians and Muslims at the end of the First Crusade, during the Siege of Jerusalem of 1099.\nTasso had a mental illness and died a few days before he was to be crowned on the Capitoline Hill as the king of poets by Pope Clement VIII. His work was widely translated and adapted, and until the beginning of the 20th century, he remained one of the most widely read poets in Europe.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Sorrento, Torquato was the son of Bernardo Tasso, a nobleman of Bergamo and an epic and lyric poet of considerable fame in his day, and his wife Porzia de Rossi, a noblewoman born in Naples of Tuscan origins. His father had for many years been secretary in the service of Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno, and his mother was closely connected with the most illustrious Neapolitan families. When, during the boy's childhood, the prince of Salerno came into collision with the Spanish government of Naples, being subsequently outlawed and deprived of his hereditary fiefs, Tasso's father shared his patron's fate. He was proclaimed a rebel to the state, along with his son Torquato, and his patrimony was sequestered. In 1552, Torquato was living with his mother and his only sister Cornelia at Naples, pursuing his education under the Jesuits, who had recently opened a school there. The precocity of intellect and the religious fervour of the boy attracted general admiration. At the age of eight, he was already famous.\nSoon after this date, he was allowed to join his father, who then lived in great poverty and unemployment in exile in Rome. News reached them in 1556 that Porzia Tasso had died suddenly and mysteriously at Naples. Her husband was firmly convinced that she had been poisoned by her brother with the object of getting control over her property.\nAs it subsequently happened, Porzia's estate never descended to her son, and the daughter Cornelia married below her birth, at the instigation of her maternal relatives. Tasso's father was a poet by predilection and a professional courtier. Therefore, when an opening at the court of Urbino was offered in 1557, Bernardo Tasso gladly accepted it.\nThe young Torquato, a handsome and brilliant lad, became the companion in sports and studies of Francesco Maria della Rovere, heir to the duke of Urbino. At Urbino, a society of cultivated men pursued the aesthetic and literary studies which were then in vogue. Bernardo Tasso read cantos of his poem \"L'Amadigi\" to the duchess and her ladies, or discussed the merits of Homer and Virgil, Trissino and Ariosto, with the duke's librarians and secretaries. Torquato grew up in an atmosphere of refined luxury and somewhat pedantic criticism, both of which gave a permanent tone to his character.\nAt Venice, where his father went to superintend the printing of his own epic, \"L'Amadigi\" (1560), these influences continued. He found himself the pet and prodigy of a distinguished literary circle, but Bernardo had suffered in his own career so seriously from dependence on his writings and the nobility that he now determined on a lucrative profession for his son. Torquato was sent to study law at Padua. Instead of applying himself to law, the young man bestowed all his attention upon philosophy and poetry. Before the end of 1562, he had produced a twelve-canto epic poem called \"Rinaldo\", which was meant to combine the regularity of the Virgilian with the attractions of the romantic epic. In the attainment of this object, and in all the minor qualities of style and handling, \"Rinaldo\" showed marked originality, although other parts seem unfinished and betray the haste in which the poem was composed. Nevertheless, its author was recognised as the most promising young poet of his time. The flattered father allowed the work to be printed, and, after a short period of study at Bologna, he consented to his son's entering the service of Cardinal Luigi d'Este. Even before that date, the young Tasso had been a frequent visitor at the Este court in Ferrara, where in 1561 he had encountered Lucrezia Bendidio, one of Eleanora d'Este's ladies-in-waiting, and fallen in love with her. She became the addressee of his first series of love sonnets, to be followed in 1563 by Laura Peperara, the next object of Tasso's affections. Both Lucrezia and Laura had, in the meantime, become well-known singers, and for a while Tasso seems to have courted them both.\nFrance and Ferrara.\nFrom 1565, Tasso's life was centred on the castle at Ferrara, the scene of many later glories and cruel sufferings. After the publication of \"Rinaldo\" he had expressed his views upon the epic in some \"Discourses on the Art of Poetry\", which committed him to a distinct theory and gained for him the additional celebrity of a philosophical critic. The next five years seem to have been the happiest of Tasso's life, although his father's death in 1569 caused his affectionate nature profound pain. Young, handsome, accomplished in all the exercises of a well-bred gentleman, accustomed to the society of the great and learned, illustrious by his published works in verse and prose, he became the idol of the most brilliant court in Italy. The first two books of his five-hundred-odd love poems were addressed to Lucrezia Bendidio and Laura Peverara. The princesses Lucrezia and Eleonora d'Este, both unmarried, both his seniors by about ten years, took him under their protection. He was admitted to their familiarity. He owed much to the constant kindness of both sisters. In 1570, he travelled to Paris with the cardinal.\nFrankness of speech and a certain habitual want of tact caused a disagreement with his worldly patron. He left France next year and took service under Duke Alfonso II of Ferrara, the Cardinal's brother. The most important events in Tasso's biography during the following four years are the completion of \"Aminta\" in 1573 and \"Gerusalemme Liberata\" in 1574. \"Aminta\" is a pastoral drama of very simple plot, but of exquisite lyrical charm. It appeared at the moment when music, under the influence of composers like Palestrina, Monteverdi, Marenzio and others, was becoming the dominant art of Italy. The honeyed melodies and sensuous melancholy of \"Aminta\" exactly suited and interpreted the spirit of its age. Its influence, in opera and cantata, was felt through two successive centuries. \"Aminta\", played by courtiers in an island of Po river where the duke had his \"Giardino di delizie\", was first printed by Aldus Manutius the Younger in Venice in January 1581. A Croatian translation of \"Aminta\" by the poet Dominko Zlatari\u0107, \"Ljubmir, pripovijest pastijerska\", was printed one year before the original, also in Venice.\nThe \"Gerusalemme Liberata\".\nThe \"Gerusalemme Liberata\" or \"Jerusalem Delivered\" occupies a larger space in the history of European literature, and is a more considerable work. Yet the commanding qualities of this epic poem, those which revealed Tasso's individuality, and which made it immediately pass into the rank of classics, beloved by the people no less than by persons of culture, are akin to the lyrical graces of \"Aminta\".\nIn the \"Gerusalemme Liberata\", as in the \"Rinaldo\", Tasso aimed at ennobling the Italian epic style by preserving the strict unity of plot and heightening poetic diction. He chose Virgil for his model, took the First Crusade for subject, infused the fervour of religion into his conception of the hero, Godfrey. But his natural bent was for romance.\nAs he had done in \"Rinaldo\", Tasso adorned \"Gerusalemme Liberata\" with a number of romantic episodes, which have proved more popular and influential than the grand sweep of the main theme. Thus, while the nominal hero of \"Gerusalemme Liberata\" is Godfrey of Bouillon (\"Goffredo\"), the leader of the First Crusade, and the climax of the epic is the capture of the holy city, Tasso's Goffredo, who is a mixture of Virgil's pious Aeneas and Tridentine Catholicism, is not the real hero of the epic. Instead, the reader is attracted to the stories of Ruggiero, fiery and passionate Rinaldo, melancholy and impulsive Tancredi, and also by the chivalrous Saracens with whom they clash in love and war.\nThe action of the epic turns on three stories of interaction between noble, beautiful pagan women and these Crusaders. \"Armida\", a beautiful witch, is sent forth by the infernal senate to sow discord in the Christian camp. Instead, she is converted to the true faith by her adoration for a crusading knight, and quits the scene with a phrase of the Virgin Mary on her lips. Clorinda, a brave female warrior, dons armor like Ariosto's Marfisa, fights a duel with her devoted lover, and receives baptism at his hands as she lies dying. Finally, Erminia, hopelessly in love with Tancredi, seeks refuge in the shepherds' hut.\nThese stories rivet the reader's attention, while the battles, religious ceremonies, conclaves and stratagems of the campaign are less engaging. Tasso's great invention as an artist was the poetry of sentiment. Sentiment, not sentimentality, gives value to what is immortal in the \"Gerusalemme\". It was a new thing in the 16th century, something concordant with a growing feeling for woman and with the ascendant art of music. This sentiment, refined, noble, natural, steeped in melancholy, exquisitely graceful, pathetically touching, breathes throughout the episodes of the \"Gerusalemme\", finds metrical expression in the languishing cadence of its mellifluous verse, and sustains the ideal life of those seductive heroines whose names were familiar as household words to all Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.\nThe epic was finished in Tasso's thirty-first year; when the manuscripts lay before him, the best part of his life was over, his best work had already been accomplished. Troubles immediately began to gather round him. Instead of having the courage to obey his own instinct, and to publish the \"Gerusalemme\" as he had conceived it, he yielded to the excessive scrupulosity which formed a feature of his paranoid character. The poem was sent in manuscript to a large committee of eminent literary men, Tasso expressing his willingness to hear their strictures and to adopt their suggestions unless he could convert them to his own views. The result was that each of these candid friends, while expressing in general high admiration for the epic, took some exception to its plot, its title, its moral tone, its episodes or its diction, in detail. One wished it to be more regularly classical; another wanted more romance. One hinted that the Inquisition would not tolerate its supernatural machinery; another demanded the excision of its most charming passages, the loves of \"Armida\", \"Clorinda\" and \"Erminia\". Tasso had to defend himself against all these ineptitudes and pedantries, and to accommodate his practice to the theories he had rashly expressed.\nTasso's self-chosen critics were not men to admit what the public has since accepted as incontrovertible. They vaguely felt that a great and beautiful romantic poem was embedded in a dull and not very correct epic. In their uneasiness, they suggested every course but the right one, which was to publish the \"Gerusalemme\" without further dispute.\nTasso, already overworked by his precocious studies, by exciting court life and exhausting literary industry, now grew almost mad with worry. His health began to fail him. He complained of headache, malarious fevers, and wished to leave Ferrara. The \"Gerusalemme\" was laid in manuscript upon a shelf. He opened negotiations with the court of Florence for an exchange of service. This irritated the duke of Ferrara. Alfonso hated nothing more than to see courtiers (especially famous ones) leave him for a rival duchy. Moreover, Alfonso was married to a French Calvinist princess and thus justly worried about antagonising the more orthodox powers in Italy, concentrated in Florence and Rome.\nDifficult relationships in the Court of Ferrara.\nAlfonso thought, moreover, that, if Tasso were allowed to go, the Medici would get the coveted dedication of that already famous epic. Therefore, he bore with the poet's humours and so contrived that the latter should have no excuse for quitting Ferrara. Meanwhile, through the years 1575, 1576 and 1577, Tasso's health grew worse.\nJealousy inspired the courtiers to malign and insult him. His irritable and suspicious temper, vain and sensitive to slights, rendered him only too easy a prey to their malevolence.\nIn the course of the 1570s, Tasso developed a persecution mania which led to legends about the restless, half-mad, and misunderstood author. He became consumed by thoughts that his servants betrayed his confidence, fancied he had been denounced to the Inquisition, and expected daily to be poisoned. Literary and political events surrounding him upset his mental state, escalating his stress and social troubles.\nIn the autumn of 1576, Tasso quarrelled with a Ferrarese gentleman, Maddalo, who had talked too freely about some same-sex love affair; the same year, he wrote a letter to his homosexual friend Luca Scalabrino dealing with his own love for a 21-year-old young man, Orazio Ariosto; in the summer of 1577, he drew his knife upon a servant in the presence of Lucrezia d'Este, duchess of Urbino. For this excess, he was arrested; but the duke released him, and took him for a change of air to his country seat of Villa Belriguardo. What happened there is not known. Some biographers have surmised that a compromising liaison with Leonora d'Este came to light, and that Tasso agreed to feign madness in order to cover her honour, but of this, there is no proof. It is only certain that from Belriguardo he returned to a Franciscan convent at Ferrara, for the express purpose of attending to his health. There, the dread of being murdered by the duke took a firm hold on his mind. He escaped at the end of July, disguised himself as a peasant, and went on foot to his sister at Sorrento.\nThe conclusions were that Tasso, after the beginning of 1575, developed a mental malady, which, without amounting to actual insanity, rendered him fantastical and insupportable, a cause of anxiety to his patrons. There is no evidence whatsoever for the later romantic myth that this state of things was due to an overwhelming passion for Leonora. The duke, contrary to his image as a tyrant, showed considerable forbearance. Though a rigid and unsympathetic man, as egotistical as any princeling of his era, to Tasso, he was never cruel; unintelligent perhaps, but far from being that monster of ferocity as he was later portrayed. The subsequent history of his connection with the poet corroborates this view.\nWhile with his sister at Sorrento, Tasso yearned for Ferrara. The court-made man could not breathe freely outside its charmed circle. He wrote humbly requesting to be taken back. Alfonso consented, provided Tasso would agree to undergo a medical course of treatment for his melancholy. When he returned, which he did with alacrity under those conditions, he was well received by the ducal family.\nAll might have gone well if his old maladies had not revived. Scene followed scene of irritability, moodiness, suspicion, wounded vanity and violent outbursts.\nIn the madhouse of St. Anna.\nIn the summer of 1578, he ran away again, travelling through Mantua, Padua, Venice, and Urbino Lombardy. In September, he reached the gates of Turin on foot and was courteously entertained by Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy. Wherever he went, wandering like the world's rejected guest, he met with the honour due his illustrious name. Great folk gladly opened their houses to him, partly in compassion, partly in admiration of his genius. But he soon wearied of their society and wore their kindness thin by his querulous peevishness. It seemed, moreover, that life was intolerable to him outside Ferrara. Accordingly, he once more opened negotiations with the duke, and in February 1579, he again set foot in the castle.\nAlfonso was about to contract his third marriage, this time with a princess of the house of Mantua. He had no children, and unless he got an heir, there was a probability that his state would fall to the Holy See, as in fact it eventually did. The nuptial festivals, on the eve of which Tasso arrived, were therefore not an occasion of great rejoicing for the elderly bridegroom. As a forlorn hope, Alfonso had to wed a third wife, but his heart was not in it, and his expectations were far from sanguine.\nTasso, preoccupied as always with his own sorrows and his own sense of dignity, made no allowance for the troubles of his master. Rooms below his rank, he thought, had been assigned him; the Duke was engaged. Without exercising common patience or giving his old friends the benefit of the doubt, Tasso broke into terms of open abuse, behaved like a lunatic, and was sent off without ceremony to the madhouse of St. Anna. This happened in March 1579, and there he remained until July 1586. Duke Alfonso's long patience at last had given way. He firmly believed that Tasso was insane, and he felt that if he were so, St. Anna was the safest place for him.\nAfter the first few months of his incarceration, he obtained spacious apartments, received the visits of friends, went abroad, attended by responsible persons of his acquaintance, and was allowed to correspond freely with others. The letters written from St. Anna to the princes and cities of Italy, to warm well-wishers, and to men of the highest reputation in the world of art and learning, form the most valuable source of information, not only on his then condition, but also on his temperament at large. It is singular that he spoke always respectfully, even affectionately, of the Duke. Some critics have attempted to make it appear that he was hypocritically kissing the hand which had chastised him, with the view of being released from prison, but no one who has impartially considered the whole tone and tenor of his epistles will adopt this opinion. What emerges clearly from them is that he laboured under a serious mental disease, and that he was conscious of it.\nMeanwhile, he occupied his uneasy leisure with copious compositions. The mass of his prose dialogues on philosophical and ethical themes, which is very considerable, belongs to the years of imprisonment in St. Anna. Except for occasional odes or sonnets\u2014some written at request, others inspired by his keen sense of suffering and therefore poignant- he neglected poetry. In the year 1580, he heard that part of the \"Gerusalemme\" was being published without his permission and without his corrections. The following year, the whole poem was given to the world, and in the following six months, seven editions were issued from the press.\nThe prisoner of St. Anna had no control over his editors, and from the masterpiece which placed him on the level of Petrarch and Ariosto he never derived one penny of pecuniary profit. A rival poet at the court of Ferrara undertook to revise and edit his lyrics in 1582. This was Battista Guarini; and Tasso, in his cell, had to allow odes and sonnets, poems of personal feeling, occasional pieces of compliment, to be collected and emended, without lifting a voice in the matter.\nA few years later, in 1585, two Florentine pedants of the Crusca Academy declared war against the \"Gerusalemme\". They loaded it with insults, which seem to those who read their pamphlets now mere parodies of criticism. Yet Tasso felt bound to reply, and he did so with a moderation and urbanity which proved him to have been not only in full possession of his reasoning faculties, but a gentleman of noble manners also. The man, like Hamlet, was distraught through ill accommodation to his circumstances and his age; brain-sick he was undoubtedly, and this is the Duke of Ferrara's justification for the treatment he endured. In the prison, he bore himself pathetically, peevishly, but never ignobly.\nWhat remained over, untouched by the malady, unoppressed by his consciousness thereof, displayed a sweet and gravely-toned humanity. The oddest thing about his life in prison is that he was always trying to place his two nephews, the sons of his sister Cornelia, in court service. One of them he attached to Guglielmo I, Duke of Mantua, the other to Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma.\nLate years.\nIn 1586, Tasso left St. Anna at the solicitation of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Prince of Mantua. He followed his young deliverer to the city by the Mincio, basked awhile in liberty and courtly pleasures, enjoyed a splendid reception from his paternal town of Bergamo, and reworked his 1573 tragedy \"Galealto Re di Norvegia\" into a classical drama entitled \"Torrismondo\". But only a few months passed before he grew discontented. Vincenzo Gonzaga, succeeding to his father's dukedom of Mantua, had scanty leisure to bestow upon the poet. Tasso felt neglected. In the autumn of 1587, he journeyed through Bologna and Loreto to Rome, where he took up quarters with an old friend, Scipione Gonzaga, now Patriarch of Jerusalem. The following year he wandered off to Naples, where he wrote several religious poems, including Monte Oliveto. In 158,9 he returned to Rome and took quarters again with the patriarch of Jerusalem. But the servants found Tasso insufferable and turned him out of doors. He fell ill and went to a hospital. The patriarch in 1590 again received him, but Tasso's restless spirit drove him forth to Florence. The Florentines said, \"Actum est de eo.\" Rome once more, then Mantua, then Florence, then Rome, then Naples, then Rome, then Naples\u2014such is the weary record of the years 1590\u201394. He endured a veritable Odyssey of malady, indigence and misfortune. To Tasso, everything was amiss. Though the palaces of princes, cardinals, patriarchs, nay popes, were always open to him, he could rest in none.\nHis health grew ever feebler, and his genius dimmer. In 1592, he published a revised version of the \"Gerusalemme\", \"Gerusalemme Conquistata\". All that made the poem of his early manhood charming, he rigidly erased. The versification became more pedantic; the romantic and magical episodes were excised; the heavier elements of the plot underwent dull rhetorical development. During the same year, a blank-verse retelling of \"Genesis\", called \"Le Sette Giornate\", saw the light.\nThough mental disorder, physical weakness, and a decline in inspiration seemed to doom Tasso to oblivion, hope cheered his last years. Pope Clement VIII ascended the papal chair in 1592. He and his nephew, Cardinal Aldobrandini of San Giorgio, were determined to befriend the poet. In 159,4 they invited him to Rome. There, Tasso was to receive the crown of laurels, as Petrarch had been crowned, on the Capitol.\nWorn out with illness, Tasso reached Rome in November. The ceremony of his coronation was deferred because Cardinal Aldobrandini had fallen ill. But the pope assigned Tasso a pension. Also, under pontifical pressure, Prince Avellino (who held Tasso's maternal estate) agreed to discharge a portion of his claims against Tasso by payment of a yearly stipend.\nAt no time since Tasso left St. Anna had the heavens so smiled upon him. Capitolian honours and money were now at his disposal. Yet fortune arrived too late. Before he donned the crown of poet laureate and received his pensions, Tasso went to the hilltop convent of Sant'Onofrio on a stormy 1 April 1595. After his coach toiled up the steep Trasteverine Hill and the monks came to the door to greet it, Tasso stepped out and announced to the prior that he had come there to die.\nTasso died in Sant'Onofrio in April 1595, aged 51. The last twenty years of his existence had been practically and artistically unsatisfying.\nOther works.\n\"Rime\" (Rhymes), nearly two thousand lyrics in nine books, were written between 1567 and 1593, influenced by Petrarch's \"Canzoniere\" (\"Songbook\").\n\"Galealto re di Norvegia\" (1573\u20134) is an unfinished tragedy, which was later finished under a new title: \"Re Torrismondo\" (1587). It is influenced by the tragedies of Sophocles and Seneca, and tells the story of princess Alvida of Norway, who is forcibly married off to the Goth king Torrismondo, when she is devoted to her childhood friend, king Germondo of Sweden.\nIn \"Messaggiero (The Messenger)\" (1582), Tasso touches on the nature of the diplomat.\n\"Dialoghi\" (\"Dialogues\"), written between 1578 and 1594. These 28 texts deal with issues from morality (love, virtue, nobility) to the mundane (masks, play, courtly style, beauty). Sometimes Tasso touches on major themes of his time, such as religion vs. intellectual freedom; Christianity vs. Islam at Lepanto.\n\"Discorsi del poema eroico\", published in 1594, is the main text for Tasso's poetics. It was probably written during the years he was working on \"Gerusalemme Liberata\".\nMental illness.\nThe disease Tasso had is now believed to be bipolarity. Legends describe him wandering the streets of Rome half-mad, convinced that he was being persecuted. After his lengthy imprisonment in Ferrara's Santa Anna lunatic asylum, he was able to resume his writing, although he never fully recovered.\nTranslations.\nDuring the Renaissance, the first (incomplete) translation of \"Jerusalem Delivered\" was brought out by Richard Carew (1594). A complete version by Edward Fairfax appeared under the title \"Godfrey of Bouillon\" in 1600. John Hoole's version in heroic couplets followed in 1772, and Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen's (in Spenserian stanzas) in 1821. There were several 20th- and 21st-century versions, including by Anthony Esolen (2000) and by Max Wickert, published as \"The Liberation of Jerusalem\" by Oxford University Press (2009). \"Aminta\", also his early love poems, as \"Love Poems for Lucrezia Bendidio\", ed. and trans. by Max Wickert. New York: Italica Press, 2011, and as \"Rhymes of Love\", ed. M.H. and S. Acocella, trans. by Maria Pastore Passaro (Ottawa: Legas, 2011).

{"id": "48230", "revid": "41260977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48230", "title": "Polychlorinated biphenyl", "text": "Highly carcinogenic chemical compounds\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are organochlorine compounds with the formula C12H10\u2212\"x\"Cl\"x\". They were once widely used in the manufacture of carbonless copy paper, as heat transfer fluids, and as dielectric and coolant fluids for electrical equipment. They are highly toxic and carcinogenic chemical compounds, formerly used in industrial and consumer electronic products, whose production was banned internationally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001.\nBecause of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a multitude of problems were identified. With the discovery of PCBs' environmental toxicity, and classification as persistent organic pollutants, their production was banned for most uses by United States federal law on January 1, 1978.\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PCBs cause cancer in animals and are probable human carcinogens. Moreover, because of their use as a coolant in electric transformers, PCBs still persist in built environments.\nSome PCBs share a structural similarity and toxic mode of action with dioxins. Other toxic effects such as endocrine disruption (notably blocking of thyroid system functioning) and neurotoxicity are known. The bromine analogues of PCBs are polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), which have analogous applications and environmental concerns.\nAn estimated 1.2 million tons have been produced globally. Though the US EPA enforced the federal ban as of 1978, PCBs continued to create health problems in later years through their continued presence in soil and sediment, and from products which were made before 1979. In 1988, Japanese scientists Tanabe et al. estimated 370,000 tons were in the environment globally, and 780,000 tons were present in products, landfills, and dumps or kept in storage.\nPhysical and chemical properties.\nPhysical properties.\nThe compounds are pale-yellow viscous liquids. They are hydrophobic, with low water solubilities: 0.0027\u20130.42\u00a0ng/L for Aroclors brand, but they have high solubilities in most organic solvents, oils, and fats. They have low vapor pressures at room temperature. They have dielectric constants of 2.5\u20132.7, very high thermal conductivity, and high flash points (from 170 to 380\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThe density varies from 1.182 to 1.566\u00a0g/cm3. Other physical and chemical properties vary widely across the class. As the degree of chlorination increases, melting point and lipophilicity increase, and vapour pressure and water solubility decrease.\nPCBs do not easily break down or degrade, which made them attractive for industries. PCB mixtures are resistant to acids, bases, oxidation, hydrolysis, and temperature change. They can generate extremely toxic dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans through partial oxidation. Intentional degradation as a treatment of unwanted PCBs generally requires high heat or catalysis (see Methods of destruction below).\nPCBs readily penetrate skin, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and latex (natural rubber). PCB-resistant materials include Viton, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, and Neoprene.\nStructure and toxicity.\nPCBs are derived from biphenyl, which has the formula C12H10, sometimes written (C6H5)2. In PCBs, some of the hydrogen atoms in biphenyl are replaced by chlorine atoms. There are 209 different chemical compounds in which one to ten chlorine atoms can replace hydrogen atoms. PCBs are typically used as mixtures of compounds and are given the single identifying CAS number 1336-36-3 . About 130 different individual PCBs are found in commercial PCB products.\nToxic effects vary depending on the specific PCB. In terms of their structure and toxicity, PCBs fall into two distinct categories, referred to as coplanar or non-\"ortho\"-substituted arene substitution patterns and noncoplanar or \"ortho\"-substituted congeners.\nThe coplanar group members have a fairly rigid structure, with their two phenyl rings in the same plane. It renders their structure similar to polychlorinated dibenzo-\"p\"-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and allows them to act like PCDDs, as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in organisms. They are considered as contributors to overall dioxin toxicity, and the term dioxins and dioxin-like compounds is often used interchangeably when the environmental and toxic impact of these compounds is considered.\nNoncoplanar PCBs, with chlorine atoms at the \"ortho\" positions can cause neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects, but only at concentrations much higher than those normally associated with dioxins. However, as they are typically found at much higher levels in biological and environmental samples they also pose health concerns, particularly to developing animals (including humans). As they do not activate the AhR, they are not considered part of the dioxin group. Because of their lower overt toxicity, they have typically been of lesser concern to regulatory bodies.\nDi-\"ortho\"-substituted, non-coplanar PCBs interfere with intracellular signal transduction dependent on calcium which may lead to neurotoxicity. \"ortho\"-PCBs can disrupt thyroid hormone transport by binding to transthyretin.\nMixtures and trade names.\nCommercial PCB mixtures were marketed under the following names:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBrazil\nCzech Republic and Slovakia\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nJapan\nFormer USSR\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\nAroclor mixtures.\nThe only North American producer, Monsanto Company, marketed PCBs under the trade name Aroclor from 1930 to 1977. These were sold under trade names followed by a four-digit number. In general, the first two digits refer to the product series as designated by Monsanto (e.g., 1200 or 1100 series); the second two numbers indicate the percentage of chlorine by mass in the mixture. Thus, Aroclor 1260 is a 1200 series product and contains 60% chlorine by mass. It is a myth that the first two digits referred to the number of carbon atoms; the number of carbon atoms do not change in PCBs. The 1100 series was a crude PCB material which was distilled to create the 1200 series PCB product.\nThe exception to the naming system is Aroclor 1016 which was produced by distilling 1242 to remove the highly chlorinated congeners to make a more biodegradable product. \"1016\" was given to this product during Monsanto's research stage for tracking purposes but the name stuck after it was commercialized.\nDifferent Aroclors were used at different times and for different applications. In electrical equipment manufacturing in the US, Aroclor 1260 and Aroclor 1254 were the main mixtures used before 1950; Aroclor 1242 was the main mixture used in the 1950s and 1960s until it was phased out in 1971 and replaced by Aroclor 1016.\nProduction.\nOne estimate (2006) suggested that 1\u00a0million tonnes of PCBs had been produced. 40% of this material was thought to remain in use. Another estimate put the total global production of PCBs on the order of 1.5\u00a0million tonnes. The United States was the single largest producer with over 600,000 tonnes produced between 1930 and 1977. The European region follows with nearly 450,000 tonnes through 1984. It is unlikely that a full inventory of global PCB production will ever be accurately tallied, as there were factories in Poland, East Germany, and Austria that produced unknown amounts of PCBs. As of 2002[ [update]], there were still 21,500 tons of PCBs stored in the easternmost regions of Slovakia.\nAlthough deliberate production of PCBs is banned by international treaty, significant amounts of PCBs are still being \"inadvertently\" produced. Research suggests that 45,000 tons of 'by-product' PCBs are legally produced per year in the US as part of certain chemical and product formulations.\nCommercial production of PCBs was banned in the United States in 1979, with the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).\nApplications.\nThe utility of PCBs is based largely on their chemical stability, including low flammability and high dielectric constant. In an electric arc, PCBs generate incombustible gases.\nUse of PCBs is commonly divided into closed and open applications. Examples of closed applications include coolants and insulating fluids (transformer oil) for transformers and capacitors, such as those used in old fluorescent light ballasts, and hydraulic fluids considered a semi-closed application. In contrast, the major open application of PCBs was in carbonless copy (\"NCR\") paper, which even presently results in paper contamination.\nOther open applications were lubricating and cutting oils, and as plasticizers in paints and cements, stabilizing additives in flexible PVC coatings of electrical cables and electronic components, pesticide extenders, reactive flame retardants and sealants for caulking, adhesives, wood floor finishes, such as \"Fabulon\" and other products of Halowax in the U.S., de-dusting agents, waterproofing compounds, casting agents. It was also used as a plasticizer in paints and especially \"coal tars\" that were used widely to coat water tanks, bridges and other infrastructure pieces.\nModern sources include pigments, which may be used in inks for paper or plastic products. PCBs are also still found in old equipment like capacitors, ballasts, X-ray machines, and other e-waste.\nEnvironmental transport and transformations.\nPCBs have entered the environment through both use and disposal. The environmental fate of PCBs is complex and global in scale.\nWater.\nBecause of their low vapour pressure, PCBs accumulate primarily in the hydrosphere, despite their hydrophobicity, in the organic fraction of soil, and in organisms including the human body. The hydrosphere is the main reservoir. The immense volume of water in the oceans is still capable of dissolving a significant quantity of PCBs.\nAs the pressure of ocean water increases with depth, PCBs become heavier than water and sink to the deepest ocean trenches where they are concentrated.\nAir.\nA small volume of PCBs has been detected throughout the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere serves as the primary route for global transport of PCBs, particularly for those congeners with one to four chlorine atoms.\nIn the atmosphere, PCBs may be degraded by hydroxyl radicals, or directly by photolysis of carbon\u2013chlorine bonds (even if this is a less important process).\nAtmospheric concentrations of PCBs tend to be lowest in rural areas, where they are typically in the picogram per cubic meter range, higher in suburban and urban areas, and highest in city centres, where they can reach 1\u00a0ng/m3 or more. In Milwaukee, an atmospheric concentration of 1.9\u00a0ng/m3 has been measured, and this source alone was estimated to account for 120\u00a0kg/year of PCBs entering Lake Michigan. In 2008, concentrations as high as 35\u00a0ng/m3, 10\u00a0times higher than the EPA guideline limit of 3.4\u00a0ng/m3, have been documented inside some houses in the U.S.\nVolatilization of PCBs in soil was thought to be the primary source of PCBs in the atmosphere, but research suggests ventilation of PCB-contaminated indoor air from buildings is the primary source of PCB contamination in the atmosphere.\nBiosphere.\nIn the biosphere, PCBs can be degraded by the sun, bacteria or eukaryotes, but the speed of the reaction depends on both the number and the disposition of chlorine atoms in the molecule: less substituted, \"meta\"- or \"para\"-substituted PCBs undergo biodegradation faster than more substituted congeners.\nIn bacteria, PCBs may be dechlorinated through reductive dechlorination, or oxidized by dioxygenase enzyme. In eukaryotes, PCBs may be oxidized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme.\nLike many lipophilic toxins, PCBs undergo biomagnification and bioaccumulation primarily due to the fact that they are easily retained within organisms.\nPlastic pollution, specifically microplastics, are a major contributor of PCBs into the biosphere and especially into marine environments. PCBs concentrate in marine environments because freshwater systems, like rivers, act as a bridge for plastic pollution to be transported from terrestrial environments into marine environments. It has been estimated that 88\u201395% of marine plastic is exported into the ocean by just 10 major rivers.\nAn organism can accumulate PCBs by consuming other organisms that have previously ingested PCBs from terrestrial, freshwater, or marine environments. The concentration of PCBs within an organism will increase over their lifetime; this process is called bioaccumulation. PCB concentrations within an organism also change depending upon which trophic level they occupy. When an organism occupies a high trophic level, like orcas or humans, they will accumulate more PCBs than an organism that occupies a low trophic level, like phytoplankton. If enough organisms with a trophic level are killed due to the accumulation of toxins, like PCB, a trophic cascade can occur.\nPCBs can cause harm to human health or even death when eaten. PCBs can be transported by birds from aquatic sources onto land via feces and carcasses.\nBiochemical metabolism.\nOverview.\nPCBs undergo xenobiotic biotransformation, a mechanism used to make lipophilic toxins more polar and more easily excreted from the body. The biotransformation is dependent on the number of chlorine atoms present, along with their position on the rings. Phase I reactions occur by adding an oxygen to either of the benzene rings by Cytochrome P450. The type of P450 present also determines where the oxygen will be added; phenobarbital (PB)-induced P450s catalyze oxygenation to the meta-para positions of PCBs while 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC)-induced P450s add oxygens to the \"ortho\"\u2013\"meta\" positions. PCBs containing \"ortho\"\u2013\"meta\" and \"meta\"\u2013\"para\" protons can be metabolized by either enzyme, making them the most likely to leave the organism. However, some metabolites of PCBs containing \"ortho\"\u2013\"meta\" protons have increased steric hindrance from the oxygen, causing increased stability and an increased chance of accumulation.\nSpecies dependent.\nMetabolism is also dependent on the species of organism; different organisms have slightly different P450 enzymes that metabolize certain PCBs better than others. Looking at the PCB metabolism in the liver of four sea turtle species (green, olive ridley, loggerhead and hawksbill), green and hawksbill sea turtles have noticeably higher hydroxylation rates of PCB 52 than olive ridley or loggerhead sea turtles. This is because the green and hawksbill sea turtles have higher P450 2-like protein expression. This protein adds three hydroxyl groups to PCB 52, making it more polar and water-soluble. P450 3-like protein expression that is thought to be linked to PCB 77 metabolism, something that was not measured in this study.\nTemperature dependent.\nTemperature plays a key role in the ecology, physiology and metabolism of aquatic species. The rate of PCB metabolism was temperature dependent in yellow perch (\"Perca flavescens\"). In fall and winter, only 11 out of 72 introduced PCB congeners were excreted and had halflives of more than 1,000 days. During spring and summer when the average daily water temperature was above 20\u00a0\u00b0C, persistent PCBs had halflives of 67 days. The main excretion processes were fecal egestion, growth dilution and loss across respiratory surfaces. The excretion rate of PCBs matched with the perch's natural bioenergetics, where most of their consumption, respiration and growth rates occur during the late spring and summer. Since the perch is performing more functions in the warmer months, it naturally has a faster metabolism and has less PCB accumulation. However, multiple cold-water periods mixed with toxic PCBs with coplanar chlorine molecules can be detrimental to perch health.\nSex dependent.\nEnantiomers of chiral compounds have similar chemical and physical properties, but can be metabolized by the body differently. This was looked at in bowhead whales (\"Balaena mysticetus\") for two main reasons: they are large animals with slow metabolisms (meaning PCBs will accumulate in fatty tissue) and few studies have measured chiral PCBs in cetaceans. They found that the average PCB concentrations in the blubber were approximately four times higher than the liver; however, this result is most likely age- and sex-dependent. As reproductively active females transferred PCBs and other poisonous substances to the fetus, the PCB concentrations in the blubber were significantly lower than males of the same body length (less than 13 meters).\nHealth effects.\nThe toxicity of PCBs varies considerably among congeners. The coplanar PCBs, known as nonortho PCBs because they are not substituted at the ring positions \"ortho\" to (next to) the other ring, (such as PCBs 77, 126 and 169), tend to have dioxin-like properties, and generally are among the most toxic congeners. Because PCBs are almost invariably found in complex mixtures, the concept of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulation, where more toxic PCB congeners are assigned higher TEF values on a scale from 0 to 1. One of the most toxic compounds known, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo[p]dioxin, a PCDD, is assigned a TEF of 1. In June 2020, State Impact of Pennsylvania stated that \"In 1979, the EPA banned the use of PCBs, but they still exist in some products produced before 1979. They persist in the environment because they bind to sediments and soils. High exposure to PCBs can cause birth defects, developmental delays, and liver changes.\"\nExposure and excretion.\nIn general, people are exposed to PCBs overwhelmingly through food, much less so by breathing contaminated air, and least by skin contact. Once exposed, some PCBs may change to other chemicals inside the body. These chemicals or unchanged PCBs can be excreted in feces or may remain in a person's body for years, with half lives estimated at 10\u201315 years. PCBs collect in body fat and milk fat. PCBs biomagnify up the food web and are present in fish and overflow of contaminated aquifers. Human infants are exposed to PCBs through breast milk or by intrauterine exposure through transplacental transfer of PCBs and are at the top of the food chain.\nWorkers recycling old equipment in the electronics recycling industry can also be exposed to PCBs.\nSigns and symptoms.\nHumans.\nThe most commonly observed health effects in people exposed to extremely high levels of PCBs are skin conditions, such as chloracne and rashes, but these were known to be symptoms of acute systemic poisoning dating back to 1922. Studies in workers exposed to PCBs have shown changes in blood and urine that may indicate liver damage. In Japan in 1968, 280\u00a0kg of PCB-contaminated rice bran oil was used as chicken feed, resulting in a mass poisoning, known as Yush\u014d disease, in over 1800 people. Common symptoms included dermal and ocular lesions, irregular menstrual cycles and lowered immune responses. Other symptoms included fatigue, headaches, coughs, and unusual skin sores. Additionally, in children, there were reports of poor cognitive development. Women exposed to PCBs before or during pregnancy can give birth to children with lowered cognitive ability, compromised immune systems, and motor control problems.\nThere is evidence that crash dieters that have been exposed to PCBs have an elevated risk of health complications. Stored PCBs in the adipose tissue become mobilized into the blood when individuals begin to crash diet.\nPCBs have shown toxic and mutagenic effects by interfering with hormones in the body. PCBs, depending on the specific congener, have been shown to both inhibit and imitate estradiol, the main sex hormone in females. Imitation of the estrogen compound can feed estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells, and possibly cause other cancers, such as uterine or cervical. Inhibition of estradiol can lead to serious developmental problems for both males and females, including sexual, skeletal, and mental development issues. In a cross-sectional study, PCBs were found to be negatively associated with testosterone levels in adolescent boys.\nHigh PCB levels in adults have been shown to result in reduced levels of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine, which affects almost every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate. It also resulted in reduced immunity and increased thyroid disorders.\nAnimals.\nAnimals that eat PCB-contaminated food, even for short periods of time, suffer liver damage and may die. In 1968 in Japan, 400,000 birds died after eating poultry feed that was contaminated with PCBs. Animals that ingest smaller amounts of PCBs in food over several weeks or months develop various health effects, including anemia; acne-like skin conditions (chloracne); liver, stomach, and thyroid gland injuries (including hepatocarcinoma), and thymocyte apoptosis. Other effects of PCBs in animals include changes in the immune system, behavioral alterations, and impaired reproduction. PCBs that have dioxin-like activity are known to cause a variety of teratogenic effects in animals. Exposure to PCBs causes hearing loss and symptoms similar to hypothyroidism in rats.\nCancer.\nIn 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified dioxin-like PCBs as human carcinogens.\nAccording to the U.S. EPA, PCBs have been shown to cause cancer in animals and evidence supports a cancer-causing effect in humans. Per the EPA, studies have found increases in malignant melanoma and rare liver cancers in PCB workers.\nIn 2013, the IARC determined that the evidence for PCBs causing non-Hodgkin lymphoma is \"limited\" and \"not consistent\". In contrast an association between elevated blood levels of PCBs and non-Hodgkin lymphoma had been previously accepted. PCBs may play a role in the development of cancers of the immune system because some tests of laboratory animals subjected to very high doses of PCBs have shown effects on the animals' immune system, and some studies of human populations have reported an association between environmental levels of PCBs and immune response.\nLawsuits related to health effects.\nIn the early 1990s, Monsanto faced several lawsuits over harm caused by PCBs from workers at companies such as Westinghouse that bought PCBs from Monsanto and used them to build electrical equipment. Monsanto and its customers, such as Westinghouse and GE, also faced litigation from third parties, such as workers at scrap yards that bought used electrical equipment and broke them down to reclaim valuable metals. Monsanto settled some of these cases and won the others, on the grounds that it had clearly told its customers that PCBs were dangerous chemicals and that protective procedures needed to be implemented.\nIn 2003, Monsanto and Solutia Inc., a Monsanto corporate spin-off, reached a $700 million settlement with the residents of West Anniston, Alabama, who had been affected by the manufacturing and dumping of PCBs. In a trial lasting six weeks, the jury found that \"Monsanto had engaged in outrageous behavior, and held the corporations and its corporate successors liable on all six counts it considered\u00a0\u2013 including negligence, nuisance, wantonness and suppression of the truth.\"\nIn 2014, the Los Angeles Superior Court found that Monsanto was not liable for cancers claimed to be from PCBs permeating the food supply of three plaintiffs who had developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After a four-week trial, the jury found that Monsanto's production and sale of PCBs between 1935 and 1977 were not substantial causes of the cancer.\nIn 2015, the cities of Spokane, San Diego, and San Jose initiated lawsuits against Monsanto to recover cleanup costs for PCB contaminated sites, alleging that Monsanto continued to sell PCBs without adequate warnings after they knew of their toxicity. Monsanto issued a media statement concerning the San Diego case, claiming that improper use or disposal by third-parties, of a lawfully sold product, was not the company's responsibility.\nIn July 2015, a St Louis county court in Missouri found that Monsanto, Solutia, Pharmacia and Pfizer were not liable for a series of deaths and injuries caused by PCBs manufactured by Monsanto Chemical Company until 1977. The trial took nearly a month and the jury took a day of deliberations to return a verdict against the plaintiffs from throughout the USA. Similar cases are ongoing. \"The evidence simply doesn't support the assertion that the historic use of PCB products was the cause of the plaintiffs' harms. We are confident that the jury will conclude, as two other juries have found in similar cases, that the former Monsanto Company is not responsible for the alleged injuries,\" a Monsanto statement said.\nIn May 2016, a Missouri state jury ordered Monsanto to pay $46.5 million to three plaintiffs whose exposure to PCB caused non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nIn December 2016, the state of Washington filed suit in King County. The state sought damages and clean up costs related to PCBs. In March 2018 Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine also filed a lawsuit against Monsanto over health issues posed by PCBs.\nOn November 21, 2019, a federal judge denied a bid by Monsanto to dismiss a lawsuit filed by LA County calling the company to clean up cancer-causing PCBs from Los Angeles County waterways and storm sewer pipelines. The lawsuit calls for Monsanto to pay for cleanup of PCBs from dozens of waterways, including the LA River, San Gabriel River and the Dominguez Watershed.\nIn June 2020, Bayer agreed to pay $650 million to settle local lawsuits related to Monsanto's pollution of public waters in various areas of the United States with PCBs.\nIn that same month of June 2020, Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced Monsanto will pay 95 million dollar settlement after the 3 year litigation. This litigation began related to the costs of water contamination. PCB contamination is found in 13 bodies of water, where fish advisory warnings have been given from the PCBs that have accumulated in the tissues. Some of the consequences, include affecting other aspects of the ecosystem, such as contamination on bays, soil and other related species like birds and other animal life.\nIn 2023, over 90 Vermont school districts joined a lawsuit against Monsanto alleging that PCBs created by the company were used in the construction of their schools. The Vermont Attorney General's office also filed its own lawsuit against Monsanto related to the use of its PCBs.\nA settlement between Monsanto and students, parents and staff of Monroe school occurred in August 2025. The legal campaign started in 2018, where the plaintiffs alleged Monsanto knew about the toxicity of PCBs that were used in the school infrastructure. Not only did the school not remove the banned material to ensure safety of students, but Monsanto themselves knew of the health implications of PCBs before they were banned.\nFurther controversy occurred because evidence obtained by the Washington state who is in an ongoing legal battle with Monsanto shows that they knew of the risks of PCBs before the 1979 ban, based on over 20,000 internal documents.\nIn October 2025, NC state university filed a lawsuit against Monsanto over PCBs used in construction of Poe Hall on campus in 1971. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is currently evaluating the health hazards.\nHistory.\nIn 1865, the first \"PCB-like\" chemical was discovered, and was found to be a byproduct of coal tar. Years later in 1876, German chemist Oscar D\u00f6bner (Doebner) synthesized the first PCB in a laboratory. Since then, large amounts of PCBs were released into the environment, to the extent that there are even measurable amounts of PCBs in feathers of birds currently held in museums before the production of PCBs peaked.\nIn 1935, Monsanto Chemical Company (later Solutia Inc) took over commercial production of PCBs from Swann Chemical Company which had begun in 1929. PCBs, originally termed \"chlorinated diphenyls\", were commercially produced as mixtures of isomers at different degrees of chlorination. The electric industry used PCBs as a non-flammable replacement for mineral oil to cool and insulate industrial transformers and capacitors. PCBs were also commonly used as heat stabilizer in cables and electronic components to enhance the heat and fire resistance of PVC.\nIn the 1930s, the toxicity associated with PCBs and other chlorinated hydrocarbons, including polychlorinated naphthalenes, was recognized because of a variety of industrial incidents. Between 1936 and 1937, there were several medical cases and papers released on the possible link between PCBs and its detrimental health effects. In 1936, a U.S. Public health Service official described the wife and child of a worker from the Monsanto Industrial Chemical Company who exhibited blackheads and pustules on their skin. The official attributed these symptoms to contact with the worker's clothing after he returned from work. In 1937, a conference about the hazards was organized at Harvard School of Public Health, and a number of publications referring to the toxicity of various chlorinated hydrocarbons were published before 1940.\nIn 1947, Robert Brown reminded chemists that Arochlors were \"objectionably toxic\": \"Thus the maximum permissible concentration for an 8-hr. day is 1 mg. per cu.m. [] of air. They also produce a serious and disfiguring dermatitis\".\nIn 1954, Kanegafuchi Chemical Co. Ltd. (Kaneka Corporation) first produced PCBs, and continued until 1972.\nThrough the 1960s Monsanto Chemical Company knew increasingly more about PCBs' harmful effects on humans and the environment, per internal leaked documents released in 2002, yet PCB manufacture and use continued with few restraints until the 1970s.\nIn 1966, PCBs were determined by Swedish chemist S\u00f6ren Jensen to be an environmental contaminant. Jensen, according to a 1994 article in \"Sierra\", named chemicals PCBs, which previously, had simply been called \"phenols\" or referred to by various trade names, such as Aroclor, Kanechlor, Pyrenol, Chlorinol and others. In 1972, PCB production plants existed in Austria, West Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Japan, Spain, the USSR and the US.\nIn the early 1970s, Ward B. Stone of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) first published his findings that PCBs were leaking from transformers and had contaminated the soil at the bottom of utility poles.\nThere have been allegations that Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories engaged in data falsification in testing relating to PCBs. In 2003, Monsanto and Solutia Inc., a Monsanto corporate spinoff, reached a US$700\u00a0million settlement with the residents of West Anniston, Alabama, who had been affected by the manufacturing and dumping of PCBs. In a trial lasting six weeks, the jury found that \"Monsanto had engaged in outrageous behavior, and held the corporations and its corporate successors liable on all six counts it considered \u2013 including negligence, nuisance, wantonness and suppression of the truth.\"\nExisting products containing PCBs which are \"totally enclosed uses\" such as insulating fluids in transformers and capacitors, vacuum pump fluids, and hydraulic fluid, are allowed to remain in use in the US. The public, legal, and scientific concerns about PCBs arose from research indicating they are likely carcinogens having the potential to adversely impact the environment and, therefore, undesirable as commercial products. Despite active research spanning five decades, extensive regulatory actions, and an effective ban on their production since the 1970s, PCBs still persist in the environment and remain a focus of attention.\nPollution due to PCBs.\nBelgium.\nIn 1999, the Dioxin Affair occurred when 50\u00a0kg of PCB transformer oils were added to a stock of recycled fat used for the production of 500 tonnes of animal feed, eventually affecting around 2,500 farms in several countries. The name \"Dioxin Affair\" was coined from early misdiagnosis of dioxins as the primary contaminants, when in fact they turned out to be a relatively small part of the contamination caused by thermal reactions of PCBs. The PCB congener pattern suggested the contamination was from a mixture of Aroclor 1260 and 1254. Over 9 million chickens, and 60,000 pigs were destroyed because of the contamination. The extent of human health effects has been debated, in part because of the use of differing risk assessment methods. One group predicted increased cancer rates, and increased rates of neurological problems in those exposed as neonates. A second study suggested carcinogenic effects were unlikely and that the primary risk would be associated with developmental effects due to exposure in pregnancy and neonates. Two businessmen who knowingly sold the contaminated feed ingredient received two-year suspended sentences for their role in the crisis.\nItaly.\nThe Italian company Caffaro, located in Brescia, specialized in producing PCBs from 1938 to 1984, following the acquisition of the exclusive rights to use the patent in Italy from Monsanto. The pollution resulting from this factory and the case of Anniston, in the US, are the largest known cases in the world of PCB contamination in water and soil, in terms of the amount of toxic substance dispersed, size of the area contaminated, number of people involved and duration of production.\nThe values reported by the local health authority (ASL) of Brescia since 1999 are 5,000 times above the limits set by Ministerial Decree 471/1999 (levels for residential areas, 0.001\u00a0mg/kg). As a result of this and other investigations, in June 2001, a complaint of an environmental disaster was presented to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Brescia. Research on the adult population of Brescia showed that residents of some urban areas, former workers of the plant, and consumers of contaminated food, have PCB levels in their bodies that are in many cases 10\u201320 times higher than reference values in comparable general populations. PCBs entered the human food supply by animals grazing on contaminated pastures near the factory, especially in local veal mostly eaten by farmers' families. The exposed population showed an elevated risk of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but not for other specific cancers.\nJapan.\nIn 1968, a mixture of dioxins and PCBs got into rice bran oil produced in northern Kyushu. Contaminated cooking oil sickened more than 1,860 people. The symptoms were called Yush\u014d disease.\nIn Okinawa, high levels of PCB contamination in soil on Kadena Air Base were reported in 1987 at thousands of parts per million, some of the highest levels found in any pollution site in the world.\nRepublic of Ireland.\nIn December 2008, a number of Irish news sources reported testing had revealed \"extremely high\" levels of dioxins, by toxic equivalent, in pork products, ranging from 80 to 200 times the EU's upper safe limit of 1.5\u00a0pg WHO-TEQDFP/\u03bcg i.e. 0.12 to 0.3 parts per billion.\nBrendan Smith, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, stated the pork contamination was caused by PCB-contaminated feed that was used on 9 of Ireland's 400 pig farms, and only one feed supplier was involved. Smith added that 38 beef farms also used the same contaminated feed, but those farms were quickly isolated and no contaminated beef entered the food chain. While the contamination was limited to just 9 pig farms, the Irish government requested the immediate withdrawal and disposal of all pork-containing products produced in Ireland and purchased since September 1, 2008. This request for withdrawal of pork products was confirmed in a press release by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on December 6.\nIt is thought that the incident resulted from the contamination of fuel oil used in a drying burner at a single feed processor, with PCBs. The resulting combustion produced a highly toxic mixture of PCBs, dioxins and furans, which was included in the feed produced and subsequently fed to a large number of pigs.\nKenya.\nIn Kenya, a number of cases have been reported in the 2010s of thieves selling transformer oil, stolen from electric transformers, to the operators of roadside food stalls for use in deep frying. When used for frying, it is reported that transformer oil lasts much longer than regular cooking oil. The downside of this misuse of the transformer oil is the threat to the health of the consumers, due to the presence of PCBs.\nSlovakia.\nThe chemical plant Chemko in Str\u00e1\u017eske (east Slovakia) was an important producer of polychlorinated biphenyls for the former communist bloc (Comecon) until 1984. Chemko contaminated a large part of east Slovakia, especially the sediments of the Laborec river and reservoir Zempl\u00ednska \u0161\u00edrava.\nSlovenia.\nBetween 1962 and 1983, the Iskra Kondenzatorji company in Semi\u010d (White Carniola, Southeast Slovenia) manufactured capacitors using PCBs. Due to the wastewater and improperly disposed waste products, the area (including the Krupa and Lahinja rivers) became highly contaminated with PCBs. The pollution was discovered in 1983, when the Krupa river was meant to become a water supply source. The area was sanitized then, but the soil and water are still highly polluted. Traces of PCBs were found in food (eggs, cow milk, walnuts) and Krupa is still the most PCB-polluted river in the world.\nSpain and Portugal.\nSeveral cetacean species have very high mean blubber PCB concentrations likely to cause population declines and suppress population recovery. Striped dolphins, bottlenose dolphins and orcas were found to have mean levels that markedly exceeded all known marine mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. The western Mediterranean Sea and the south-west Iberian Peninsula were identified as \"hotspots\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nMonsanto manufactured PCBs at its chemical plant in Newport, South Wales, until the mid- to late-1970s. During this period, waste matter, including PCBs, from the Newport site was dumped at a disused quarry near Groes-faen, west of Cardiff, and Penhros landfill site from where it continues to be released in waste water discharges.\nUnited States.\nMonsanto was the only company that manufactured PCBs in the US. Its production was entirely halted in 1977. (Kimbrough, 1987, 1995) On November 25, 2020, U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin rejected a proposed $650 million settlement from Bayer, the company which acquired Monsanto in 2018, and allowed Monsanto-related lawsuits involving PCB to proceed.\nAlabama.\nPCBs originating from Monsanto Chemical Company in Anniston, Alabama, were dumped into Snow Creek, which then spread to Choccolocco Creek, then Logan Martin Lake. In the early 2000s, class action lawsuits were settled by local land owners, including those on Logan Martin Lake, and Lay Reservoir (downstream on the Coosa River), for the PCB pollution. Donald Stewart, former Senator from Alabama, first learned of the concerns of hundreds of west Anniston residents after representing a church which had been approached about selling its property by Monsanto. Stewart went on to be the pioneer and lead attorney in the first and majority of cases against Monsanto and focused on residents in the immediate area known to be most polluted. Other attorneys later joined in to file suits for those outside the main immediate area around the plant; one of these was the late Johnnie Cochran.\nIn 2007, the highest pollution levels remained concentrated in Snow and Choccolocco Creeks. Concentrations in fish have declined and continue to decline over time; sediment disturbance, however, can resuspend the PCBs from the sediment back into the water column and food web.\nCalifornia.\nSan Francisco Bay has been contaminated by PCBs, \"a legacy of PCBs spread widely across the land surface of the watershed, mixed deep into the sediment of the Bay, and contaminating the Bay food web\". Levels of PCBs in fish and shellfish exceed thresholds for safe consumption. Signs around the Bay warn anglers of which species to avoid. State water quality regulators set a Total Maximum Daily Load for PCBs require city and county governments around the Bay to implement control measures to limit PCBs in urban runoff. An important part of the second, revised version of this permit was the requirement for municipalities to install green infrastructure with a goal of reducing pollutant levels in stormwater.\nConnecticut.\nIn New Haven, the decommissioned English Station has a high concentration of PCB contamination due to the chemicals used in the running of the plant. This, along with asbestos contamination, has made cleaning and demolishing the abandoned site extremely difficult. The PCB contamination has spread to the soil, and to the river, where locals will sometimes fish unaware of the danger.\nGreat Lakes.\nIn 1976, environmentalists found PCBs in the sludge at Waukegan Harbor, the southwest end of Lake Michigan. They were able to trace the source of the PCBs back to the Outboard Marine Corporation that was producing boat motors next to the harbor. By 1982, the Outboard Marine Corporation was court-ordered to release quantitative data referring to their PCB waste released. The data stated that from 1954 they released 100,000 tons of PCB into the environment, and that the sludge contained PCBs in concentrations as high as 50%.\nIn 1989, during construction near the Zilwaukee bridge, workers uncovered an uncharted landfill containing PCB-contaminated waste which cost $100,000 to clean up.\nMuch of the Great Lakes area were still heavily polluted with PCBs in 1988, despite extensive remediation work.\nIndiana.\nFrom the late 1950s through 1977, Westinghouse Electric used PCBs in the manufacture of capacitors in its Bloomington, Indiana, plant. Reject capacitors were hauled and dumped in area salvage yards and landfills, including Bennett's Dump, Neal's Landfill and Lemon Lane Landfill. Workers also dumped PCB oil down factory drains, which contaminated the city sewage treatment plant. The City of Bloomington gave away the sludge to area farmers and gardeners, creating anywhere from 200 to 2,000 sites, which remain unaddressed.\nOver 1,000 tons of PCBs were estimated to have been dumped in Monroe and Owen counties. Although federal and state authorities have been working on the sites' environmental remediation, many areas remain contaminated. Concerns have been raised regarding the removal of PCBs from the karst limestone topography, and regarding the possible disposal options. To date, the Westinghouse Bloomington PCB Superfund site case does not have a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and Record of Decision (ROD), although Westinghouse signed a US Department of Justice Consent Decree in 1985. The 1985 consent decree required Westinghouse to construct an incinerator that would incinerate PCB-contaminated materials. Because of public opposition to the incinerator, however, the State of Indiana passed a number of laws that delayed and blocked its construction. The parties to the consent decree began to explore alternative remedies in 1994 for six of the main PCB contaminated sites in the consent decree. Hundreds of sites remain unaddressed as of 2014. Monroe County will never be PCB-free, as noted in a 2014 Indiana University program about the local contamination.\nOn February 15, 2008, Monroe County approved a plan to clean up the three remaining contaminated sites in the City of Bloomington, at a cost of $9.6 million to CBS Corp., the successor of Westinghouse. In 1999, Viacom bought CBS, so they are current responsible party for the PCB sites.\nMassachusetts.\nPittsfield, in western Massachusetts, was home to the General Electric (GE) transformer, capacitor, and electrical generating equipment divisions. The electrical generating division built and repaired equipment that was used to power the electrical utility grid throughout the nation. PCB-contaminated oil routinely migrated from GE's industrial plant located in the very center of the city to the surrounding groundwater, nearby Silver Lake, and to the Housatonic River, which flows through Massachusetts, Connecticut, and down to Long Island Sound. PCB-containing solid material was widely used as fill, including oxbows of the Housatonic River. Fish and waterfowl which live in and around the river contain significant levels of PCBs and are not safe to eat. EPA designated the Pittsfield plant and several miles of the river as a Superfund site in 1997, and ordered GE to remediate the site. EPA and GE began a cleanup of the area in 1999.\nNew Bedford Harbor, which is a listed Superfund site, contained some of the highest sediment concentrations of PCBs in the marine environment. Cleanup of the area began in 1994 and is mostly complete as of 2020.\nInvestigations into historic waste dumping in the Bliss Corner neighborhood have revealed the existence of PCBs, among other hazardous materials, buried in soil and waste material.\nMissouri.\nIn 1982, Martha C. Rose Chemical Inc. began processing and disposing of materials contaminated with PCBs in Holden, Missouri, a small rural community about east of Kansas City. From 1982 until 1986, nearly 750 companies, including General Motors Corp., Commonwealth Edison, Illinois Power Co. and West Texas Utilities, sent millions of pounds of PCB contaminated materials to Holden for disposal. Instead, according to prosecutors, the company began storing the contaminated materials while falsifying its reports to the EPA to show they had been removed. After investigators learned of the deception, Rose Chemical was closed and filed for bankruptcy. The site had become the nation's largest waste site for the chemical PCB. In the four years the company was operational, the EPA inspected it four times and assessed $206,000 in fines but managed to collect only $50,000.\nAfter the plant closed the state environmental agency found PCB contamination in streams near the plant and in the city's sewage treatment sludge. A 100,000 square-foot warehouse and unknown amounts of contaminated soil and water around the site had to be cleaned up. Most of the surface debris, including close to 13 million pounds of contaminated equipment, carcasses and tanks of contaminated oil, had to be removed. Walter C. Carolan, owner of Rose Chemical, and five others pleaded guilty in 1989 to committing fraud or falsifying documents. Carolan and two other executives served sentences of less than 18 months; the others received fines and were placed on probation. Cleanup costs at the site are estimated at $35 million.\nMontana.\nTwo launch facilities at Malmstrom Air Force Base showed PCB levels higher than the thresholds recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency when extensive sampling began of active U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile bases to address specific cancer concerns in 2023.\nNew York.\nPollution of the Hudson River is largely due to dumping of PCBs by General Electric from 1947 to 1977. GE dumped an estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCBs into the Hudson River during these years. The PCBs came from the company's two capacitor manufacturing plants at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, New York. This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river or drink the water. In 1984, EPA declared a 200-mile (320\u00a0km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup. Extensive remediation actions on the river began in the 1970s with the implementation of wastewater discharge permits and consequent control or reduction of wastewater discharges, and sediment removal operations, which have continued into the 21st century.\nLove Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York, that was heavily contaminated with toxic waste including PCBs. Eighteen Mile Creek in Lockport, New York, is an EPA Superfund site for PCBs contamination.\nPCB pollution at the State Office Building in Binghamton was responsible for what is now considered to be the first indoor environmental disaster in the United States. In 1981, a transformer explosion in the basement spewed PCBs throughout the entire 18-story building. The contamination was so severe that cleanup efforts kept the building closed for 13 years.\nNorth Carolina.\nOne of the largest deliberate PCB spills in American history occurred in the summer of 1978 when 31,000 gallons (117 m^3) of PCB-contaminated oil were illegally sprayed by the Ward PCB Transformer Company in swaths along the roadsides of some of North Carolina highway shoulders in 14 counties and at the Fort Bragg Army Base. The crime, known as \"the midnight dumpings\", occurred over nearly two weeks, as drivers of a black-painted tanker truck drove down one side of rural Piedmont highways spraying PCB-laden waste and then up the other side the following night.\nUnder Governor James B. Hunt, Jr., state officials then erected large, yellow warning signs along the contaminated highways that read: \"CAUTION: PCB Chemical Spills Along Highway Shoulders\". The illegal dumping is believed to have been motivated by the passing of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which became effective on August 2, 1978, and increased the expense of chemical waste disposal.\nWithin a couple of weeks of the crime, Robert Burns and his sons, Timothy and Randall, were arrested for dumping the PCBs along the roadsides. Burns was a business partner of Robert \"Buck\" Ward Jr., of the Ward PCB Transformer Company, in Raleigh. Burns and sons pleaded guilty to state and Federal criminal charges; Burns received a three to five-year prison sentence. Ward was acquitted of state charges in the dumping, but was sentenced to 18 months prison time for violation of TSCA.\nCleanup and disposal of the roadside PCBs generated controversy, as the Governor's plan to pick up the roadside PCBs and to bury them in a landfill in rural Warren County were strongly opposed in 1982 by local residents.\nIn October 2013, at the request of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), the City of Charlotte, North Carolina, decided to stop applying sewage sludge to land while authorities investigated the source of PCB contamination.\nIn February 2014, the City of Charlotte admitted PCBs have entered their sewage treatment centers as well.\nAfter the 2013 SCDHEC had issued emergency regulations, the City of Charlotte discovered high levels of PCBs entering its sewage waste water treatment plants, where sewage is converted to sewage sludge. The city at first denied it had a problem, then admitted an \"event\" occurred in February 2014, and in April that the problem had occurred much earlier. The city stated that its very first test with a newly changed test method revealed very high PCB levels in its sewage sludge farm field fertilizer. Because of the widespread use of the contaminated sludge, SCDHEC subsequently issued PCB fish advisories for nearly all streams and rivers bordering farm fields that had been applied with city waste.\nOhio.\nThe Clyde cancer cluster (also known as the Sandusky County cancer cluster) is a childhood cancer cluster that has affected many families in Clyde, Ohio, and surrounding areas. PCBs were found in soil in a public park within the area of the cancer cluster.\nIn Akron, Ohio, soil was contaminated and noxious PCB-laden fumes had been put into the air by an electrical transformer deconstruction operation from the 1930s to the 1960s.\nSouth Carolina.\nFrom 1955 until 1977, the Sangamo Weston plant in Pickens, South Carolina, used PCBs to manufacture capacitors, and dumped 400,000 pounds of PCB contaminated wastewater into the Twelve Mile Creek. In 1990, the EPA declared the site of the capacitor plant, its landfills and the polluted watershed, which stretches nearly downstream to Lake Hartwell as a Superfund site. Two dams on the Twelve Mile Creek are to be removed and on Feb. 22, 2011 the first of two dams began to be dismantled. Some contaminated sediment is being removed from the site and hauled away, while other sediment is pumped into a series of settling ponds.\nIn 2013, the state environmental regulators issued a rare emergency order, banning all sewage sludge from being land applied or deposited on landfills, as it contained very high levels of PCBs. The problem had not been discovered until thousands of acres of farm land in the state had been contaminated by the hazardous sludge. A criminal investigation to determine the perpetrator of this crime was launched.\nWashington.\nAs of 2015, several bodies of water in the state of Washington were contaminated with PCBs, including the Columbia River, the Duwamish River, Green Lake, Lake Washington, the Okanogan River, Puget Sound, the Spokane River, the Walla Walla River, the Wenatchee River, and the Yakima River. A study by Washington State published in 2011 found that the two largest sources of PCB flow into the Spokane River were City of Spokane stormwater (44%) and municipal and industrial discharges (20%).\nPCBs entered the environment through paint, hydraulic fluids, sealants, inks and have been found in river sediment and wildlife. Spokane utilities will spend $300 million to prevent PCBs from entering the river in anticipation of a 2017 federal deadline to do so. In August 2015 Spokane joined other U.S. cities like San Diego and San Jose, California, and Westport, Massachusetts, in seeking damages from Monsanto.\nWisconsin.\nFrom 1954 until 1971, the Fox River in Appleton, Wisconsin, had PCBs deposited into it from Appleton Paper/NCR, P.H. Gladfelter, Georgia-Pacific and other notable local paper manufacturing facilities. The Wisconsin DNR estimates that after wastewater treatment the PCB discharges to the Fox River due to production losses ranged from 81,000\u00a0kg to 138,000\u00a0kg. (178,572\u00a0lbs. to 304,235\u00a0lbs). The production of Carbon Copy Paper and its byproducts led to the discharge into the river. Fox River clean up is ongoing.\nPacific Ocean.\nPolychlorinated biphenyls have been discovered in organisms living in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. Levels were as high as 1,900 nanograms per gram of amphipod tissue in the organisms analyzed.\nRegulation.\nJapan.\nIn 1972 the Japanese government banned the production, use, and import of PCBs.\nSweden.\nIn 1973, the use of PCBs in \"open\" or \"dissipative\" sources (such as plasticisers in paints and cements, casting agents, fire retardant fabric treatments and heat stabilizing additives for PVC electrical insulation, adhesives, paints and waterproofing, railroad ties) was banned in Sweden.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn 1981, the UK banned closed uses of PCBs in new equipment, and nearly all UK PCB synthesis ceased; closed uses in existing equipment containing in excess of 5\u00a0litres of PCBs were not stopped until December 2000.\nUnited States.\nIn 1976, concern over the toxicity and persistence (chemical stability) of PCBs in the environment led the United States Congress to ban their domestic production, effective January 1, 1978, pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act. To implement the law, EPA banned new manufacturing of PCBs, but issued regulations that allowed for their continued use in electrical equipment for economic reasons. EPA began issuing regulations for PCB usage and disposal in 1979. The agency has issued guidance publications for safe removal and disposal of PCBs from existing equipment.\nEPA defined the \"maximum contaminant level goal\" for public water systems as zero, but because of the limitations of water treatment technologies, a level of 0.5 parts per billion is the actual regulated level (maximum contaminant level).\nMethods of destruction.\nPhysical.\nPCBs were technically attractive because of their inertness, which includes their resistance to combustion. Nonetheless, they can be effectively destroyed by incineration at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. When combusted at lower temperatures, they convert in part to more hazardous unintentional persistent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dibenzo-p-dioxins. When conducted properly, the combustion products are water, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen chloride. In some cases, the PCBs are combusted as a solution in kerosene. PCBs have also been destroyed by pyrolysis in the presence of alkali metal carbonates.\nThermal desorption is highly effective at removing PCBs from soil.\nChemical.\nPCBs are fairly chemically unreactive, this property being attractive for its application as an inert material. They resist oxidation.\nMany chemical compounds are available to destroy or reduce the PCBs. Commonly, PCBs are degraded by basic mixtures of glycols, which displace some or all chloride. Also effective are reductants such as sodium or sodium naphthalene. Vitamin B12 has also shown promise.\nMicrobial.\nThe use of microorganisms to degrade PCBs from contaminated sites, relying on multiple microorganisms' co-metabolism, is known as bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyl. Some micro-organisms degrade PCBs by reducing the C-Cl bonds. Microbial dechlorination tends to be rather slow-acting in comparison to other methods. Enzymes extracted from microbes can show PCB activity. In 2005, \"Shewanella oneidensis\" biodegraded a high percentage of PCBs in soil samples. A low voltage current can stimulate the microbial degradation of PCBs.\nFungal.\nThere is research showing that some ligninolytic fungi can degrade PCBs.\nBioremediation.\nThe remediation, or removal, of PCBs from estuarian and coastal river sediments is quite difficult due to the overlying water column and the potential for resuspension of contaminants during the removal process. The most common method of PCB extraction from sediments is to dredge an area and dispose of the sediments in a landfill. This method is troubling for a number of reasons, namely that it has a risk of resuspension of the chemicals as the sediments are disturbed, and this method can be very damaging to ecosystems.\nA potential cost effective, low risk remediation technique is bioremediation. Bioremediation involves the use of biota to remediate sediments. Phytoremediation, the use of plants to remediate soils, has been found to be effective for a broad range of contaminants such as mercury, PCB, and PAHs in terrestrial soils. A promising study conducted in New Bedford Harbor found that \"Ulva rigida\", a type of seaweed common throughout the world, is effective at removing PCB from sediments. During a typical bloom in New Bedford Harbor, \"U. rigida\" forms a thick mat that lies on top of and in contact with the sediment. This allows for \"U. rigida\" to uptake large amounts of PCB from the sediment with concentrations of PCB in \"U. rigida\" reaching 1580 \u03bcg kg\u22121 within 24 hours of the bloom. Live tissue tended to take up higher concentrations of PCB than dead tissue, but this is not to say that dead tissue did not still take up large amounts of PCB as well.\nHomologs.\nFor a complete list of the 209 PCB congeners, see PCB congener list. Note that biphenyl, while not technically a PCB congener because of its lack of chlorine substituents, is still typically included in the literature.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48232", "revid": "11487766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48232", "title": "Phenyl group", "text": "Cyclic chemical group (\u2013C6H5)\nIn organic chemistry, the phenyl group, or phenyl ring, is a cyclic group of atoms with the formula , and is often represented by the symbol Ph (archaically \u03c6) or \u00d8. The phenyl group is closely related to benzene and can be viewed as a benzene ring, minus a hydrogen atom, which may be replaced by some other element or compound to serve as a functional group. A phenyl group has six carbon atoms bonded together in a hexagonal planar ring, five of which are bonded to individual hydrogen atoms, with the remaining carbon bonded to a substituent. Phenyl groups are commonplace in organic chemistry. Although often depicted with alternating double and single bonds, the phenyl group is chemically aromatic and has equal bond lengths between carbon atoms in the ring.\nNomenclature.\nUsually, a \"phenyl group\" is synonymous with and is represented by the symbol Ph (archaically, \u03a6), or \u00d8. Benzene is sometimes denoted as PhH. Phenyl groups are generally attached to other atoms or groups. For example, triphenylmethane () has three phenyl groups attached to the same carbon center. Many or even most phenyl compounds are not described with the term \"phenyl\". For example, the chloro derivative is normally called chlorobenzene, although it could be called phenyl chloride. In special (and rare) cases, isolated phenyl groups are detected: the phenyl anion (), the phenyl cation (), and the phenyl radical (C6H5\u2022).\nAlthough Ph and phenyl uniquely denote , substituted derivatives also are described using the phenyl terminology. For example, is nitrophenyl, and is pentafluorophenyl. Monosubstituted phenyl groups (that is, disubstituted benzenes) are associated with electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and the products follow the arene substitution pattern. So, a given substituted phenyl compound has three isomers, \"ortho\" (1,2-disubstitution), \"meta\" (1,3-disubstitution) and \"para\" (1,4-disubstitution). A disubstituted phenyl compound (trisubstituted benzene) may be, for example, 1,3,5-trisubstituted or 1,2,3-trisubstituted. Higher degrees of substitution, of which the pentafluorophenyl group is an example, exist and are named according to IUPAC nomenclature.\nEtymology.\nPhenyl is derived from fr \" ph\u00e9nyle\", which in turn derived from el \" \"\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\" (phaino)\"\u00a0'shining', as the first phenyl compounds named were byproducts of making and refining various gases used for lighting. According to McMurry, \"The word is derived from el \" pheno\"\u00a0'I\u00a0bear light', commemorating the discovery of benzene by Michael Faraday in 1825 from the oily residue left by the illuminating gas used in London street lamps.\"\nStructure, bonding, and characterization.\nPhenyl compounds are derived from benzene (), at least conceptually and often in terms of their production. In terms of its electronic properties, the phenyl group is related to a vinyl group. It is generally considered an inductively withdrawing group (-\"I\"), because of the higher electronegativity of sp2 carbon atoms, and a resonance donating group (+\"M\"), due to the ability of its \u03c0 system to donate electron density when conjugation is possible. The phenyl group is hydrophobic. Phenyl groups tend to resist oxidation and reduction. Phenyl groups (like all aromatic compounds) have enhanced stability in comparison to equivalent bonding in aliphatic (non-aromatic) groups. This increased stability is due to the unique properties of aromatic molecular orbitals.\nThe bond lengths between carbon atoms in a phenyl group are approximately 1.4\u00a0\u00c5.\nIn 1H-NMR spectroscopy, protons of a phenyl group typically have chemical shifts around 7.27 ppm. These chemical shifts are influenced by aromatic ring current and may change depending on substituents.\nPreparation, occurrence, and applications.\nPhenyl groups are usually introduced using reagents that behave as sources of the phenyl anion or the phenyl cation. Representative reagents include phenyllithium () and phenylmagnesium bromide (). Electrophiles are attacked by benzene to give phenyl derivatives:\n&lt;chem&gt;C6H6 + E+ -&gt; C6H5E + H+&lt;/chem&gt;\nwhere (the \"electrophile\") = . These reactions are called electrophilic aromatic substitutions.\nPhenyl groups are found in many organic compounds, both natural and synthetic (see figure). Most common among natural products is the amino acid phenylalanine, which contains a phenyl group. A major product of the petrochemical industry is \"BTX\" consisting of benzene, toluene, and xylene - all of which are building blocks for phenyl compounds. The polymer polystyrene is derived from a phenyl-containing monomer and owes its properties to the rigidity and hydrophobicity of the phenyl groups. Many drugs as well as many pollutants contain phenyl rings.\nOne of the simplest phenyl-containing compounds is phenol, . It is often said the resonance stability of phenol makes it a stronger acid than that of aliphatic alcohols such as ethanol (p\"K\"a = 10 vs. 16\u201318). However, a significant contribution is the greater electronegativity of the \"sp\"2 alpha carbon in phenol compared to the \"sp\"3 alpha carbon in aliphatic alcohols.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dafydd's poetry also offers a unique window into the transcultural movement of cultural practices and preservation of culture in the face of occupation. Dafydd also helps answer questions that linger over the spread of culture. Even though it has been given less attention, cultural development in Wales differed slightly than in other parts of Europe during the same time.\nLife.\nR. Geraint Gruffydd suggests c. 1315-c. 1350 as the poet's dates; others place him a little later from c. 1320\u201340c. 1370\u201380.\nLater tradition has it that Dafydd was born at Brogynin, Penrhyn-coch (at the time Llanbadarn Fawr parish), Ceredigion. His father, Gwilym Gam, and mother, Ardudfyl, were both from noble families. As one of noble birth it seems Dafydd did not belong to the guild of professional poets in medieval Wales, and yet the poetic tradition had been strong in his family for generations.\nAccording to R. Geraint Gruffydd he died in 1350, a possible victim of the Black Death. Tradition says that he was buried within the precinct of the Cistercian Strata Florida Abbey, Ceredigion. This burial location is disputed by supporters of the Talley Abbey theory who contend that burial took place in the Talley Abbey Churchyard:\nOn Saturday 15 September 1984 a memorial stone was unveiled by a Prifardd to mark the site in the churchyard at Talley where a deeply-rooted tradition asserts that the poet Dafydd ap Gwilym lies buried. For many centuries the rival claims of Talley and Ystrad Fflur have been debated as the burialplace of Wales\u2019 foremost poet.While it may be difficult to trace the exact years Dafydd was active, it is clear he wrote after the Edwardian conquests of Wales. Despite living under English authority, Dafydd's poetry presents ways in which Welsh culture continued to distinguish itself and prevail. Some of Dafydd's poetry outright reflects rejection of the standards of English authority, like in one poem where he draws attention to the state of housing after English subjugation of Wales.\nThe first recorded observation that Dafydd ap Gwilym was buried in Talley was made in the sixteenth century. Talley is located about 30 miles from Strata Florida (Welsh: Ystrad Fflur).\nWelsh literature after the Norman invasion.\nWhile Dafydd's work displays the role literature played in forming Welsh culture in the early 14th century, artistic expression of culture was not as prevalent in the centuries prior. A large majority of cultural expression was demonstrated militarily, as the Welsh suffered many incursions by Norman and English invaders.\nAs the English kingdom fell to William I\u2019s Norman conquest, Welsh holdings that were already contested by the English fell to Norman power. Immediately, William I placed William fitz Osbern in charge of managing the defence of the holdings. Quickly, Norman and trusted Anglo-Saxon nobility were put into centers of control within Welsh lands. The Norman Invasions began a long period where the preservation of Welsh culture coincided with the need for military defence.\nIn the following decades, the Norman advance grew slow, as the Welsh had time to plan defences unlike their English counterparts. As the campaigns drew on, marcher lordships were established on the border of Wales to help facilitate a defence against any counter-incursions. Due to the relative freedom granted to marcher lords, local marcher lords would often compete over territory. The lack of pressure exercised on Welsh authorities during the period of marcher lordships allowed Welsh cultural authority to strengthen in regions not controlled by the Normans or English.\nIn 1277, after multiple attempts to gain more local authority by the Welsh, Edward I began his conquests of the Welsh territories to plant control firmly in English hands. Within 5 years of the conquest's start, most of Wales was under English control. Under English control, the newly acquired Welsh territories saw a large expansion of English influence. The English made large investments into Welsh infrastructure and instituted new laws that would align more similarly to English law. This period of Welsh history saw Welsh culture physically dominated by English occupation; however, the peace brought under English rule allowed for Welsh culture to manifest in more artistic means. Poetry, like Dafydd's, became a more popular expression of Welsh culture because there was less of a united interest on warfare and defence.\nThemes in Dafydd's poetry.\nIt is believed that about one hundred and seventy of his poems have survived, though many others have been attributed to him over the centuries. His main themes were love and nature. The influence of wider European ideas of courtly love, as exemplified in the troubadour poetry of Proven\u00e7al, is seen as a significant influence on Dafydd's poetry. Courtly love was not a unique theme of Dafydd's poetry. While courtly love is primarily associated with the literature of mainland Europe, its elements can be found in works across the British Isles. Elements of courtly love have been noted in Welsh literature well before the Dafydd's active days, suggesting that courtly love grew as a culturally connected phenomenon across European literature.\nDafydd's poetry reflected the individuality of his own personal as well as Welsh cultural expression through his unique expression of common literary practices, as well as his individual voice in his poetry. One aspect that differed from conventional poetry in Dafydd's works was the use of himself as the subject. Traditional contemporary poetry traditionally kept the poet far removed from the scene. Dafydd's work, in contrast, is full of his own feelings and experiences, and he is a key figure in this transition from a primarily social poetic tradition into one in which the poet's own vision and art is given precedence. Dafydd's poetry was also unique in its expressions of religion and nature. In \u201cPraise of Summer,\u201d Dafydd praises both the divine and the changing of summer as connected and benevolent. Reference to the divine in prior and contemporary literature usually depicted strong themes of judgement and virtue. With Dafydd's poetry, we see these forces as a gift worth celebrating.\nDafydd's poetry also differs from the conventions of other love poetry in its use of sexual metaphor. Some of Dafydd's poetry, such as \u201cA Poem in Praise of the Penis\u201d display explicit connection to sexual desire. Yet, Dafydd was also well adept at keeping his metaphors subtle. In \u201cThe Lady Goldsmith,\u201d Dafydd praises his devotion to a woman who creates attire out of her hair and nature's bristle. In the poem, the woman crafts a belt for Dafydd. In this poem, the metaphor of sexual desire is drawn from the proximity of the woman's hair to Dafydd's waist. The belt itself stands as the sexual connection between this woman and Dafydd. In contrast, traditional courtly love literature tended to shy away from praising sexual desire in favour of patience and virtuous romance.\nHe was an innovative poet who was responsible for popularising the metre known as the \"cywydd\" and first to use it for praise. Dafydd also has been credited for popularising the meter form known as \u201ccynghanedd.\u201d The continued use of cynghanedd and cywydd by Welsh poets after Dafydd's active years is a testament to the effect Dafydd had on shaping Welsh literary culture. Dafydd's poetry provided a framework for which Welsh literary culture could grow its own unique traditions.\nAlthough Dafydd wrote comparatively conventional praise poetry, he also wrote love poetry and poetry expressing a personal wonderment at nature; Dafydd's poetry on the latter subject in particular is largely without precedent in Welsh or European literature in terms of its depth and complexity. His popularity during his own historic period is testified by the fact that so many of his poems were selected for preservation in texts, despite a relatively short career compared to some of his contemporaries.\nMany of his poems are addressed to women, but particularly to two of them, Morfudd and Dyddgu. His best-known works include the following poems:\nThe lyrics to the \"Lied\" 'Der Traum' in Ludwig van Beethoven's 1810 collection \"26 Welsh Songs\" are a German translation and adaption of a dream-vision poem supposedly by Dafydd, though not to be found among his works or in his apocrypha.\nDafydd's window into Welsh culture.\nThe development of culture has been a topic of discussion for many years. As Robert Bartlett argues, European cultures formed in a homogeneous nature, primarily through conquest and settlement. This view has a favourable outlook if you take Wales in the time of Dafydd. The Welsh had become predominantly subservient to the English after the Edwardian conquests. Bartlett might argue that the cultural developments that came in the period of peace after the conquests is evidence for this principle of assimilation.\nSome contend still that cultures developed as a product of their internal audiences. In the case of Dafydd, Helen Fulton argues that his poetry reflected the values admired by Welsh audiences and reflected values of the culture's uniqueness. In this context, Welsh culture is formed outside of outside influences of other cultures.\nOthers place their arguments somewhere on a spectrum of these two extremes. Andrew Breeze has noted that from even the earliest evidence of Welsh literature, there are many similarities between works of cultures from close and far proximity to the Welsh. While some of these similarities are directly attributed to warfare, there is also an apparent spread of cultural traditions peacefully. The argument is taken further by Carol Lloyd Wood, who demonstrates how intermarriage and architectural similarity among various regions also support an idea of passive cultural diffusion. Although, when looking at architecture from after the Edwardian conquests, the narratives of the polarised views tend to be amplified. Architecture tended to reflect the cultures of either the Welsh or English based on the level of authority of either group in the region.\nDafydd's poetry reflects the multiple avenues in which cultural exchange manifested in medieval Europe. Dafydd had clear influences by traditions of foreign origin that became used often in his poetry. Some of Dafydd's poetry also reflects the assimilation and domination present by the Edwardian conquests. Yet, Dafydd also displays poetic structure that would become part of the Welsh literary identity. Scratching the surface of Dafydd's poetry reveals that culture was defined and controlled by many aspects, and not just one major force.\nWhen looking at a successor of Dafydd, Guto'r Glyn, one is able see to how these forces that control culture interact in a different context. Like Dafydd, Glyn used cywydd meter and referenced himself in his poetry; however, in Glyn's \u201cMoliant i Syr Rhisiart Gethin ap Rhys Gethin o Fuellt, capten Mantes yn Ffrainc,\u201d one can see other influences in Welsh literary culture. The poem praises an English lord in the same manner of classic heroes such as Arthur. God is also mentioned as an omnipotent protector. Glyn's poem demonstrates a much more traditional approach of gallantry and chivalry popular in continental European literature. Glyn also demonstrates the principle of assimilation in the sense that the English are viewed as equals or interchangeable with the Welsh. Despite taking influence from a previous Welsh figure in Dafydd, Glyn also demonstrates the effect outside influences had in shaping Welsh literary culture.\nIt is fair to say Dafydd was important in establishing certain customs that would become popular among Welsh literary culture. Although literary culture was very prevalent in the identities of medieval cultures, it often gets overlooked in larger debates about the spread of culture. By looking at Dafydd ap Gwilym, literary culture appears as just as an important part of Welsh cultural identity as resistance to occupation was.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was posthumously awarded the bard's chair at the 1917 National Eisteddfod. Evans, who had been awarded several chairs for his poetry, was inspired to take the Bardic name (, \"blessed peace\") from the way sunlight penetrated the mist in the valleys.\nBorn in the village of , Wales, Evans wrote much of his poetry while working as a shepherd on his family's hill farm. His style, which was influenced by romantic poetry, was dominated by themes of nature and religion. He also wrote several war poems following the outbreak of war on the Western Front in 1914.\nEarly life.\nEllis Humphrey Evans was born on 13 January 1887 at Penlan, a house in the centre of Trawsfynydd, Meirionydd, Wales. He was the eldest of eleven children born to Evan and Mary Evans. In the spring of 1887, the family moved to his father's family hill-farm of , in , a few miles from Trawsfynydd. He spent his life there, apart from a short stint in South Wales.\nEllis Evans received a basic education from the age of six at the local primary school and Sunday school. He left school around 14 years of age and worked as a shepherd on his father's farm. Despite his brief attendance in formal schooling (6\u201314) he had a talent for poetry and had already composed his first poem by the age of 11, \"\" ('the peat stack'). Ellis's interests included both Welsh and English poetry. His main influence was the Romantic poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley, and themes of nature and religion dominated his work.\nHis talent for poetry was well known in the village of Trawsfynydd, and he took part in numerous competitions and local , winning his first chair () at Bala in 1907, aged 20. In 1910, he was given the bardic name by the bard at a poets' meeting in Blaenau Ffestiniog. is Welsh for peace and can mean white or pure; this 'blessed peace' also alluded to the way rays of sunlight penetrated the mists in the Meirionydd valleys.\n was the bardic name of Evans's older friend Humphrey Jones (1867\u20131947), a quarryman from Blaenau Ffestiniog; in his lifetime, Jones published two volumes of poetry, won more than 60 bardic chairs and was an comp\u00e8re. Jones said he bestowed on Evans because he had the manner of a dreamer who moved slowly and calmly. Another close friend of was the clergyman and writer R. Silyn Roberts, who was known as .\nIn 1913, 26-year-old began to find fame for his poetry when he won chairs at the local at and . In 1915 he was successful at local in and . That same year he entered his first poem (an ode to Snowdonia) in the National Eisteddfod of Wales which was held in Bangor, Gwynedd. The following year he took second place at the National Eisteddfod in Aberystwyth with , an awdl written in honour of Strata Florida, the medieval Cistercian abbey ruins in Ceredigion.\nFirst World War.\nHedd Wyn was a Christian pacifist and did not enlist for the war initially, feeling he could never kill anyone. The war left Welsh non-conformists deeply divided. Traditionally, the Nonconformists had not been comfortable at all with the idea of warfare. The war saw a major clash within Welsh Nonconformism between those who backed military action and those who adopted a pacifist stance on religious grounds.\nThe war inspired Hedd Wyn's work and produced some of his most noted poetry, including ('Children of Trawsfynydd'), ('The Black Dot'), and ('[It] Will Not Be Forgotten'). His poem, ('War'), remains one of his most frequently quoted works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nConscription.\nAlthough farm work was classed as a reserved occupation due its national importance, in 1916, the Evans family were required to send one of their sons to join the British Army. The 29-year-old Ellis enlisted rather than his younger brother Robert. In February 1917, he received his training at Litherland Camp, Liverpool, but in March 1917 the government called for farm workers to help with ploughing and many soldiers were temporarily released. Hedd Wyn was given seven weeks' leave. He spent most of this leave working on the ('The Hero'), his submission for the National Eisteddfod. According to his nephew, Gerald Williams, \"It was a wet year in 1917. He came back for 14 days' leave and wrote the poem, , on the table by the fire. As it was such a wet year, he stayed for another seven days. This extra seven days made him a deserter. So the military police came to fetch him from the hayfield and took him to the jail at Blaenau. From there he travelled to... the war in Belgium. Because he left in such a hurry he forgot the poem on the table, so he wrote it again on the journey. So there are two copies: one in Aberystwyth and one in Bangor.\"\nIn June 1917, Hedd Wyn joined the 15th (Service) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (1st London Welsh) (part of the 38th (Welsh) Division) at Fl\u00e9chin, France. His arrival depressed him, as exemplified in his quote, \"Heavy weather, heavy soul, heavy heart. That is an uncomfortable trinity, isn\u2019t it?\" Nevertheless, at Fl\u00e9chin he finished his National Eisteddfod entry and signed it \u201cFleur de Lis\u201d. It is believed it was sent via the Royal Mail around the end of June. On 31 July 15 Battalion marched towards the major offensive which would become known as the Battle of Passchendaele.\nThird Battle of Ypres and death.\nHedd Wyn was fatally wounded within the first few hours of the start of the Third Battle of Ypres on 31 July, 1917. He fell during the Battle of Pilckem Ridge which had begun at 3:50 a.m. with a heavy bombardment of the German lines (this was the opening attack in what became known as Battle of Passchendaele). However, the troops' advance was hampered by incoming artillery and machine gun fire, and by heavy rain turning the battlefield to swamp.\nPrivate Evans, as part of the 15th (Service) Battalion (1st London Welsh), was advancing towards a German strongpoint \u2013 created within the ruins of the Belgian hamlet of Hagebos (\"Iron Cross\") \u2013 when he was hit. In an interview conducted in 1975 by St Fagans National History Museum, Simon Jones, a veteran of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, recalled, \"We started over Canal Bank at Ypres, and he was killed half way across Pilckem. I've heard many say that they were with and this and that, well I was with him... I saw him fall and I can say that it was a nosecap shell in his stomach that killed him. You could tell that... He was going in front of me, and I saw him fall on his knees and grab two fistfuls of dirt... He was dying, of course... There were stretcher bearers coming up behind us, you see. There was nothing \u2013 well, you'd be breaking the rules if you went to help someone who was injured when you were in an attack.\"\nSoon after being wounded, Hedd Wyn was carried to a first-aid post. Still conscious, he asked the doctor \"Do you think I will live?\" though it was clear that he had little chance of surviving; he died at about 11:00 a.m. Among the fatalities that day was the Irish war poet, Francis Ledwidge, who was \"blown to bits\" while drinking tea in a shell hole.\nEllis H. Evans was buried in Section II, Row F, Grave 11 at Artillery Wood Cemetery, near Boezinge. After a petition was submitted to the Imperial War Graves Commission after the war, his headstone was given the additional words (English: \"The Chief Bard, \").\nLegacy.\nNational Eisteddfod.\nOn 6 September 1917, the ceremony of Chairing of the Bard took place at the National Eisteddfod in Birkenhead Park, England; in attendance was the Welsh-speaking British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. After the adjudicators announced that the entry submitted under the pseudonym \"Fleur de Lys\" was the winner, the trumpets were sounded for the author to identify themselves. After three such summons, Archdruid Dyfed solemnly announced that the winner had been killed in action six weeks earlier. The empty chair was then draped in a black sheet. It was delivered to Evans's parents in the same condition, \"the festival in tears and the poet in his grave\", as Archdruid Dyfed said. The festival is now referred to as \"\" (\"The Eisteddfod of the Black Chair\").\nThe chair was hand-crafted by Flemish craftsman, Eugeen Vanfleteren (1880\u20131950), a carpenter born in Mechelen, Belgium, who had fled to England on the outbreak of war and had settled in Birkenhead.\nManuscripts and publications.\nImmediately after the , a committee was formed in to look after the poet's legacy. Under the leadership of J. R. Jones, the head teacher of the village school, all manuscripts in the poet's hand were collected and carefully preserved. Due to the committee's efforts, the first anthology of the bard's work, titled (\"The Shepherd's Poems\"), was published in 1918. The manuscripts were donated to the National Library of Wales in 1934.\n, a complete Welsh language anthology of his works, was published by Trawsfynydd's Merilang Press in 2012.\nThe poem (\"The Hero\"), for which Hedd Wyn won the National Eisteddfod, is still considered his greatest work. The ode is structured in four parts and presents two principal characters, (\"Daughter of the Tempests\") and the . There has been much disagreement in the past regarding the meaning of the ode. It can be said with certainty that , like his favourite poet Shelley, longed for a perfect humanity and a perfect world during the chaos of war.\n has been perceived as a symbol of love, the beauty of nature, and creativity; and as a symbol of goodness, fairness, freedom, and justice.

The property was preserved just as it was in 1917 by the poet's family and his nephew Gerald Williams (d. 2021), who was the last of his relatives to live on the farm. For years, Gerald and his brother Ellis continued to farm the land surrounding the farmhouse as custodians of both and \u2019s legacy, welcoming visitors and working to ensure \u2019s story lived on.

In the same year, Gerald Williams was awarded an MBE for his \"exceptional contribution\" to conserving the heritage of his bardic uncle.\nCentennial commemorations.\nIn August 2014, the Welsh Memorial Park, Ypres was unveiled at Pilckem Ridge near Ypres.

{"id": "48235", "revid": "50548440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48235", "title": "Vaudeville", "text": "Entertainment genre\nVaudeville (; ) is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment which became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1870s until the early 1930s.\nIn some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain, a typical North American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, ventriloquists, strongmen, female and male impersonators, acrobats, clowns, mimes, illustrated songs, jugglers, athletes, lecturing celebrities, or scenes from plays, one-act plays, minstrels, and films. A vaudeville performer is often referred to as a \"vaudevillian.\"\nVaudeville developed from many sources, including the concert saloon, minstrelsy, freak shows, dime museums, and literary American burlesque. Called \"the heart of American show business\", vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America, South America, Australia, and Europe for several decades.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the term is obscure but often explained as being derived from the French expression \"voix de ville\" 'voice of the city'. A second hypothesis is that it comes from the 15th-century songs on satire by poet Olivier Basselin, \"Vau de Vire\". In his \"Connections\" television series, science historian James Burke argues that the term is a corruption of the French 'Vire River Valley', an area known for its bawdy drinking songs and where Basselin lived. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" also endorses the origin, a truncated form of 'song of the Valley of the Vire'. Around 1610, Jean le Houx collected these works as \"Le Livre des Chants nouveaux de Vaudevire\", which is probably the direct origin of the word.\nBeginnings.\nWith its first subtle appearances within the early 1860s, vaudeville was not initially a common form of entertainment. The form gradually evolved from the concert saloon and variety hall into its mature form throughout the 1870s and 1880s. This more gentle form was known as \"Polite Vaudeville\".\nIn the years before the American Civil War, entertainment existed on a different scale. Similar variety theatre existed before 1860 in Europe and elsewhere. In the US, as early as the first decades of the 19th century, theatergoers could enjoy a performance consisting of Shakespeare plays, acrobatics, singing, dancing, and comedy. As the years progressed, people seeking diversified amusement found an increasing number of ways to be entertained. Vaudeville was characterized by traveling companies touring through cities and towns. A handful of circuses regularly toured the country; dime museums appealed to the curious; amusement parks, riverboats, and town halls often featured \"cleaner\" presentations of variety entertainment; compared to saloons, music halls, and burlesque houses, which catered to those with a taste for the \"risqu\u00e9\". In the 1840s, the minstrel show, another type of variety performance, and \"the first emanation of a pervasive and purely American mass culture\", grew to enormous popularity and formed what Nick Tosches called \"the heart of 19th-century show business\". A significant influence also came from \"Dutch\" (i.e., German or faux-German) minstrels and comedians. Medicine shows traveled the countryside offering programs of comedy, music, jugglers, and other novelties along with displays of tonics, salves, and miracle elixirs, while \"Wild West\" shows provided romantic vistas of the disappearing frontier, complete with trick riding, music and drama. Vaudeville incorporated these various itinerant amusements into a stable, institutionalized form centered in America's growing urban hubs.\nFrom the mid-1860s, impresario Tony Pastor, a former singing circus clown who had become a prominent variety theater performer and manager, capitalized on middle class sensibilities and spending power when he began to feature \"polite\" variety programs in his New York City theatres. Pastor opened his first \"Opera House\" on the Bowery in 1865, later moving his variety theater operation to Broadway and, finally, to Fourteenth Street near Union Square. He only began to use the term \"vaudeville\" in place of \"variety\" in early 1876. Hoping to draw a potential audience from female and family-based shopping traffic uptown, Pastor barred the sale of liquor in his theatres, eliminated bawdy material from his shows, and offered gifts of coal and hams to attendees. Pastor's experiment proved successful, and other managers soon followed suit.\nPopularity.\nB. F. Keith took the next step, starting in Boston, where he built an empire of theatres and brought vaudeville to the United States and Canada. Later, E. F. Albee, adoptive grandfather of the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Edward Albee, managed the chain to its greatest success. Circuits such as those managed by Keith-Albee provided vaudeville's greatest economic innovation and the principal source of its industrial strength. They enabled a chain of allied vaudeville houses that remedied the chaos of the single-theatre booking system by contracting acts for regional and national tours. These could easily be lengthened from a few weeks to two years.\nAlbee also gave national prominence to vaudeville's trumpeting \"polite\" entertainment, a commitment to entertainment equally inoffensive to men, women and children. Acts that violated this ethos (e.g., those that used words such as \"hell\") were admonished and threatened with expulsion from the week's remaining performances or were canceled altogether. In spite of such threats, performers routinely flouted this censorship, often to the delight of the very audience members whose sensibilities were supposedly endangered. He eventually instituted a set of guidelines to be an audience member at his show, and these were reinforced by the ushers working in the theatre.\nThis \"polite entertainment\" also extended to Keith's company members. He went to extreme measures to maintain this level of modesty. Keith even went as far as posting warnings backstage such as this: \"Don't say 'slob' or 'son of a gun' or 'hully gee' on the stage unless you want to be canceled peremptorily... if you are guilty of uttering anything sacrilegious or even suggestive you will be immediately closed and will never again be allowed in a theatre where Mr. Keith is in authority.\" Along these same lines of discipline, Keith's theatre managers would occasionally send out blue envelopes with orders to omit certain suggestive lines of songs and possible substitutions for those words. If actors chose to ignore these orders or quit, they would get \"a black mark\" on their name and would never again be allowed to work on the Keith Circuit. Thus, actors learned to follow the instructions given to them by B.\u00a0F. Keith for fear of losing their careers forever.\nBy the late 1890s, vaudeville had large circuits, houses (small and large) in almost every sizable location, standardized booking, broad pools of skilled acts, and a loyal national following. One of the biggest circuits was Martin Beck's Orpheum Circuit. It incorporated in 1919 and brought together 45 vaudeville theatres in 36 cities throughout the United States and Canada and a large interest in two vaudeville circuits. Another major circuit was that of Alexander Pantages. In his heyday, Pantages owned more than 30 vaudeville theatres and controlled, through management contracts, perhaps 60 more in both the United States and Canada.\nAt its height, vaudeville played across multiple strata of economic class and auditorium size. On the vaudeville circuit, it was said that if an act would succeed in Peoria, Illinois, it would work anywhere. The question \"Will it play in Peoria?\" has now become a metaphor for whether something appeals to the American mainstream public. The three most common levels were the \"small time\" (lower-paying contracts for more frequent performances in rougher, often converted theatres), the \"medium time\" (moderate wages for two performances each day in purpose-built theatres), and the \"big time\" (possible remuneration of several thousand dollars per week in large, urban theatres largely patronized by the middle and upper-middle classes). As performers rose in renown and established regional and national followings, they worked their way into the less arduous working conditions and better pay of the big time. The capital of the big time was New York City's Palace Theatre (or just \"The Palace\" in the slang of vaudevillians), built by Martin Beck in 1913 and operated by Keith. Featuring a bill stocked with inventive novelty acts, national celebrities, and acknowledged masters of vaudeville performance (such as comedian and trick roper Will Rogers), the Palace provided what many vaudevillians considered the apotheosis of remarkable careers. A standard show bill would begin with a sketch, follow with a single (an individual male or female performer); next would be an alley-oop (an acrobatic act); then another single, followed by yet another sketch such as a blackface comedy. The acts that followed these for the rest of the show would vary from musicals to jugglers to song-and-dance singles and end with a final extravaganza \u2013 either musical or drama \u2013 with the full company. These shows would feature such stars as ragtime and jazz pianist Eubie Blake, the famous and magical Harry Houdini, and child star Baby Rose Marie. In the \"New-York Tribune\"'s article about Vaudeville, it is said that at any given time, Vaudeville was employing over twelve thousand different people throughout its entire industry. Each entertainer would be on the road 42 weeks at a time while working a particular \"Circuit\" \u2013 or an individual theatre chain of a major company.\nWhile the neighborhood character of vaudeville attendance had always promoted a tendency to tailor fare to specific audiences, mature vaudeville grew to feature houses and circuits specifically aimed at certain demographic groups. Black patrons, often segregated into the rear of the second gallery in white-oriented theatres, had their own smaller circuits, as did speakers of Italian and Yiddish (see below). This foreign addition combined with comedy produced such acts as \"minstrel shows of antebellum America\" and Yiddish theatre. Many ethnic families joined in on this entertainment business, and for them, this traveling lifestyle was simply a continuation of the circumstances that brought them to America. Through these acts, they were able to assimilate themselves into their new home while also bringing bits of their own culture into this new world. White-oriented regional circuits, such as New England's \"Peanut Circuit\", also provided essential training grounds for new artists while allowing established acts to experiment with and polish new material. At its height, vaudeville was rivaled only by churches and public schools among the nation's premiere public gathering places.\nAnother slightly different aspect of Vaudeville was an increasing interest in the female figure. The previously mentioned ominous idea of \"the blue envelopes\" led to the phrase \"blue\" material, which described the provocative subject matter present in many Vaudeville acts of the time. Many managers even saw this scandalous material as a marketing strategy to attract many different audiences. As stated in Andrew Erdman's book \"Blue Vaudeville\", the Vaudeville stage was \"a highly sexualized space\u00a0... where unclad bodies, provocative dancers, and singers of 'blue' lyrics all vied for attention.\" Such performances highlighted and objectified the female body as a \"sexual delight\", but more than that, historians think that Vaudeville marked a time in which the female body became its own \"sexual spectacle\". This sexual image began sprouting everywhere an American went: the shops, a restaurant, the grocery store, etc. The more this image brought in the highest revenue, the more Vaudeville focused on acts involving women. Even acts that were as innocent as a sister act were higher sellers than a good brother act. Consequently, Erdman adds that female Vaudeville performers such as Julie Mackey and Gibson's Bathing Girls began to focus less on talent and more on physical appeal through their figure, tight gowns, and other revealing attire. It eventually came as a surprise to audience members when such beautiful women actually possessed talent in addition to their appealing looks. This element of surprise colored much of the reaction to the female entertainment of this time.\nWomen.\nIn the 1920s, announcements seeking all-girl bands for vaudeville performances appeared in industry publications like \"Billboard\", \"Variety\" and in newspapers. Bands like The Ingenues and The Dixie Sweethearts were well-publicized, while other groups were simply described as \"all-girl Revue\". According to Feminist Theory, similar trends in theater and film objectified women, an example of male gaze, as women's role in public life was expanding. These expectations for women in the 19th century played a big role in the compelling aspects of vaudeville. Through vaudeville, many women were allowed to join their male counterparts on the stage and found success in their acts.\nLeila Marie Koerber, later Marie Dressler, was a Canadian actress who specialized in vaudeville comedy, and eventually won an Academy Award for Best Actress later in her career. Being the daughter of a musician, she moved to the United States of America in her childhood. At just fourteen years old, she left home to begin her career, lying about her age and sending her mother half of her paycheck. Dressler found great success and was known for her comedic timing and physical comedy, like carrying her male co-stars. She eventually worked on Broadway, where she had a great desire to become a serious actress but was advised to remain in comedy. She went on to star in a few films but again returned to vaudeville, her original career.\nAnother famous vaudevillian actress was Trixie Friganza, born Delia O'Callaghan. She had a famous catchphrase: \"You know Trixie with her bag of tricks.\" She began her career in opera, performing to help provide for her family. The oldest of three daughters, she wanted to help her family financially but had to do it secretly, as female performers were frowned on at the time. She worked largely in comedy and gained acclaim and success due to her willingness to step into other's roles who had fallen ill, and were otherwise unable to perform. In her acts she often emphasized her plus-size figure, calling herself the \"perfect forty-six\". Friganza was also a poet and writer. She used many of her performances as ways to raise money to support the poor or disenfranchised and went on record publicly numerous times to support these social causes. Friganza spent much of her life fighting for women's equality and pushing for self-acceptance for women, both publicly and within themselves, as well as their rights in comparison to men.\nBetty Felsen was an American ballerina, vaudeville star, and teacher. She was born on 9 June 1905, in Chicago, IL Betty began taking lessons at a local Chicago ballet school when she was eight years old, and often performed solo dances in shows presented by that school. Just before her tenth birthday in 1916, her parents enrolled her as a ballet student with the http:// School within the https:// Association. Then, in 1919 Betty was accepted to be a member of the Chicago Opera\u2019s Pavley-Oukrainsky Ballet corps de ballet. From December 1920 until the fall of 1922 Betty was a ballerina soloist and performed with them throughout North America. Under the name Buddye Felsen, Betty landed a starring dancing role in a new show at Fred Mann\u2019s Million Dollar Rainbo Room in the Rainbo Gardens. The show, \"Rainbo Trail\", directed by Frank Westphal, opened on 15 December 1922, and ran until 1 March 1923. In the winter of 1923 Betty began a partnership with Jack Broderick. From then until the end of 1927 Broderick &amp; Felsen performed on the B.F. Keith and Pantages vaudeville circuits throughout the U.S. and Canada. Their act evolved from a simple dance act to one with over twenty dancers, an orchestra, and elaborate costumes and sets. From 1925 to 1926 they played for 20 straight weeks at the Colony Theater on Broadway in New York City. In 1926 and 1927, they starred in two spectacular musical productions, touring across the United States and Canada, first for about three months in Emil Boreo\u2019s \"Mirage de Paris\" followed by nine months in their own \"Ballet Caprice\". After Jack quit the act near the end of 1927, Betty continued to manage the troupe and, with a new dance partner, toured throughout the northeastern United States for the next six months as Betty Felsen and Company. The final performance of \"Ballet Caprice\" was on 4 June 1928, at Broadway\u2019s Palace Theater in New York City.\nAnother famous comedienne, one who brought in thousands of audience members with her signature improvisational skills, was May Irwin. She worked from about 1875 to 1914. Born Ada Campbell, she began her life on the stage at thirteen years old following the death of her father. She and her older sister created a singing act called the \"Irwin Sisters\". Many years later, their act had taken off and with performances in both vaudeville and burlesque at famous music halls, until Irwin decided to continue her career on her own. She then changed her approach to vaudeville, performing African-American-influenced songs, even later writing her songs. She introduced her signature in vaudeville, \"The Bully Song\", which was performed in a Broadway show. This is when she began experimenting with improvisational comedy and quickly found her unique success, even taking her performances global with acts in the U.K.\nSophie Tucker, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was told by promoter Chris Brown that she was not attractive enough to succeed in show business without doing Blackface, so she performed that way for the first two years onstage, until one day she decided to go without it, and achieved much greater success being herself from that point on, especially with her song \"Some of These Days\".\nMoms Mabley was a comedienne who got her start in Vaudeville and the Chitlin circuits in the 1920s, and ended up with mainstream success in the 20th century. Other 20th century women performers who started in Vaudeville included blues singers Ma Rainey, Ida Cox and Bessie Smith. Women-led touring companies like Black Patti's Troubadours, the Whitman Sisters and the Hyers Sisters were popular acts. Other women worked the business side of Vaudeville, like Amanda Thorpe, a white woman who founded a black theater in Virginia, and the Griffin Sisters, who managed several theaters in their efforts to create a Black Vaudeville circuit.\nBlack vaudeville.\nBlack performers and patrons participated in a racially segregated Vaudeville circuit. Though many popular acts like Lewis and Walker, Ernest Hogan, Irving Jones, and the Hyers Sisters played to both white and black audiences, early Vaudeville performances for white audiences were limited to one Black act per show, and performers faced discrimination in restaurants and lodging. Entertainers and entrepreneurs like The Whitman Sisters, Pat Chapelle and John Isham created and managed their own touring companies; others took on theater ownership and management and created Black Vaudeville circuits, as was the case for Sherman H. Dudley and the Griffin Sisters Later, in the 1920s, many bookings were managed by the Theatre Owners Booking Association.\nAfrican-Americans challenged the prevailing Blackface stereotypes played by white performers by bringing their own authenticity and style to the stage, composing music, comedy and dance routines and laying the groundwork for distinctly American cultural phenomena like blues, jazz, ragtime and tap dance. Notable Black entertainers in Vaudeville included comedians Bert Williams, and George Walker, dancer/choreographer Ada Overton Walker, and many others. Black songwriters and composers like Bob Cole, Ernest Hogan, Irving Jones, Rosamond Johnson, George Johnson, Tom Lemonier, Gussie L. Davis, and Chris Smith, wrote many of the songs that were popularized onstage by white singers, and paved the way for African-American musical theater.\nImmigrant America.\nIn addition to vaudeville's prominence as a form of American entertainment, it reflected the newly evolving urban inner-city culture and interaction of its operators and audience. Making up a large portion of immigration to the United States in the mid-19th century, Irish Americans interacted with established Americans, with the Irish becoming subject to discrimination due to their perceived ethnic, physical, and cultural characteristics. The ethnic stereotypes of Irish through their greenhorn depiction alluded to their newly arrived status as immigrant Americans, with the stereotype portrayed in avenues of entertainment.\nFollowing the Irish immigration wave were several waves in which new immigrants from different backgrounds came in contact with the Irish in America's urban centers. Already settled and being native English speakers, Irish Americans took hold of these advantages and began to assert their positions in the immigrant racial hierarchy based on skin tone and assimilation status, cementing job positions that were previously unavailable to them as recently arrived immigrants. As a result, Irish Americans became prominent in vaudeville entertainment as curators and actors, creating a unique ethnic interplay between Irish American use of self-deprecation as humor and their diverse inner city surroundings.\nThe interactions between newly arrived immigrants and settled immigrants within the backdrop of the unknown American urban landscape allowed vaudeville to be utilized as an avenue for expression and understanding. The often hostile immigrant experience in their new country was now used for comic relief on the vaudeville stage, where stereotypes of different ethnic groups were perpetuated. The crude stereotypes that emerged were easily identifiable not only by their distinct ethnic cultural attributes, but how those attributes differed from the mainstream established American culture and identity.\nCoupled with their historical presence on the English stage for comic relief, and as operators and actors of the vaudeville stage, Irish Americans became interpreters of immigrant cultural images in American popular culture. New arrivals found their ethnic group status defined within the immigrant population and in their new country as a whole by the Irish on stage. Unfortunately, the same interactions between ethnic groups within the close living conditions of cities also created racial tensions which were reflected in vaudeville. Conflict between Irish and African Americans saw the promotion of black-face minstrelsy on the stage, purposefully used to place African Americans beneath the Irish in the racial and social urban hierarchy.\nAlthough the Irish had a strong Celtic presence in vaudeville and in the promotion of ethnic stereotypes, the ethnic groups that they were characterizing also utilized the same humor. As the Irish donned their ethnic costumes, groups such as the Chinese, Italians, Germans and Jews utilized ethnic caricatures to understand themselves as well as the Irish. The urban diversity within the vaudeville stage and audience also reflected their societal status, with the working class constituting two-thirds of the typical vaudeville audience.\nThe ethnic caricatures that now comprised American humor reflected the positive and negative interactions between ethnic groups in America's cities. The caricatures served as a method of understanding different groups and their societal positions within their cities. The use of the greenhorn immigrant for comedic effect showcased how immigrants were viewed as new arrivals, but also what they could aspire to be. In addition to interpreting visual ethnic caricatures, the Irish American ideal of transitioning from the shanty to the lace curtain became a model of economic upward mobility for immigrant groups.\nDecline.\nThe continued growth of the lower-priced cinema in the early 1910s dealt the heaviest blow to vaudeville (similar to the advent of free broadcast television's diminishing the cultural and economic strength of the cinema). Cinema was first regularly commercially presented in the US in vaudeville halls. The first public showing of movies projected on a screen took place at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in 1896. Lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions, many performers and personalities, such as Al Jolson, W. C. Fields, Mae West, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, Jimmy Durante, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Edgar Bergen, Fanny Brice, Burns and Allen, and Eddie Cantor, used the prominence gained in live variety performance to vault into the new medium of cinema. In doing so, such performers often exhausted in a few moments of screen time the novelty of an act that might have kept them on tour for several years. Other performers who entered in vaudeville's later years, including Jack Benny, Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, Kate Smith, Cary Grant, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Judy Garland, Rose Marie, Sammy Davis Jr., Red Skelton, Larry Storch and The Three Stooges, used vaudeville only as a launching pad for later careers. They left live performance before achieving the national celebrity of earlier vaudeville stars, and found fame in new venues.\nThe line between live and filmed performances was blurred by the number of vaudeville entrepreneurs who made more or less successful forays into the movie business. For example, Alexander Pantages quickly realized the importance of motion pictures as a form of entertainment. He incorporated them in his shows as early as 1902. Later, he entered into a partnership with the Famous Players\u2013Lasky, a major Hollywood production company and an affiliate of Paramount Pictures.\nBy the late 1920s, most vaudeville shows included a healthy selection of cinema. Earlier in the century, many vaudevillians, cognizant of the threat represented by cinema, held out hope that the silent nature of the \"flickering shadow sweethearts\" would prevent movies from ever overtaking vaudeville in popularity. However, with the introduction of talking pictures in 1926, the burgeoning film studios removed what had remained the chief difference in favor of live theatrical performance: spoken dialogue. Historian John Kenrick wrote:\nTop vaudeville stars filmed their acts for one-time pay-offs, inadvertently helping to speed the death of vaudeville. After all, when \"small time\" theatres could offer \"big time\" performers on screen at a nickel a seat, who could ask audiences to pay higher amounts for less impressive live talent? The newly-formed RKO studios took over the famed Orpheum vaudeville circuit and swiftly turned it into a chain of full-time movie theatres. The half-century tradition of vaudeville was effectively wiped out within less than four years.\nInevitably, managers further trimmed costs by eliminating the last of the live performances. Vaudeville also suffered due to the rise of broadcast radio following the greater availability of inexpensive receiver sets later in the decade. Even the hardiest in the vaudeville industry realized the form was in decline; the perceptive understood the condition to be terminal. The standardized film distribution and talking pictures of the 1930s confirmed the end of vaudeville. By 1930, the vast majority of formerly live theatres had been wired for sound, and none of the major studios were producing silent pictures. For a time, the most luxurious theatres continued to offer live entertainment, but most theatres were forced by the Great Depression to economize.\nSome in the industry blamed cinema's drain of talent from the vaudeville circuits for the medium's demise. Others argued that vaudeville had allowed its performances to become too familiar to its famously loyal, now seemingly fickle audiences.\nThere was no abrupt end to vaudeville, though the form was clearly sagging by the late 1920s. Joseph Kennedy Sr. in a hostile buyout, acquired the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Theatres Corporation (KAO), which had more than 700 vaudeville theatres across the United States which had begun showing movies. The shift of New York City's Palace Theatre, vaudeville's center, to an exclusively cinema presentation on 16 November 1932, is often considered to have been the death knell of vaudeville.\nThough talk of its resurrection was heard during the 1930s and later, the demise of the supporting apparatus of the circuits and the higher cost of live performance made any large-scale renewal of vaudeville unrealistic.\nArchitecture.\nThe most striking examples of Gilded Age theatre architecture were commissioned by the big time vaudeville magnates and stood as monuments of their wealth and ambition. Examples of such architecture are the theatres built by impresario Alexander Pantages. Pantages often used architect B. Marcus Priteca (1881\u20131971), who in turn regularly worked with muralist Anthony Heinsbergen. Priteca devised an exotic, neo-classical style that his employer called \"Pantages Greek\".\nThough classic vaudeville reached a zenith of capitalization and sophistication in urban areas dominated by national chains and commodious theatres, small-time vaudeville included countless more intimate and locally controlled houses. Small-time houses were often converted saloons, rough-hewn theatres, or multi-purpose halls, together catering to a wide range of clientele. Many small towns had purpose-built theatres. A small yet interesting example might include what is called Grange Halls in northern New England, still being used. These are old-fashioned, wooden buildings with creaky, dimly-lit, wooden stages, which were meant to offset the isolation of a farming lifestyle. These stages could offer anything from child performers to contra-dances to visits by Santa to local, musical talent, to homemade foods such as whoopee pies.\nVaudeville's cultural influence and legacy.\nSome of the most prominent vaudevillians successfully made the transition to cinema, though others were not as successful. Some performers such as Bert Lahr fashioned careers out of combining live performance with radio and film roles. Many others later appeared in the Catskill resorts that constituted the \"Borscht Belt\".\nVaudeville was instrumental in the success of the newer media of film, radio, and television. Comedies of the new era adopted many of the dramatic and musical tropes of classic vaudeville acts. Film comedies of the 1920s through the 1940s used talent from the vaudeville stage and followed a vaudeville aesthetic of variety entertainment, both in Hollywood and in Asia, including China.\nThe rich repertoire of the vaudeville tradition was mined for prominent prime-time radio variety shows such as \"The Rudy Vall\u00e9e Show\". The structure of a single host introducing a series of acts became a popular television style and can be seen consistently in the development of television, from \"The Milton Berle Show\" in 1948 to \"Late Night with David Letterman\" in the 1980s. The multi-act format had renewed success in shows such as \"Your Show of Shows\" with Sid Caesar and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Today, performers such as Bill Irwin, a MacArthur Fellow and Tony Award-winning actor, are frequently lauded as \"New Vaudevillians\".\nReferences to vaudeville and the use of its distinctive argot continue throughout North American popular culture. Words such as \"flop\" and \"gag\" were terms created from the vaudeville era and have entered the American idiom. Vaudevillian techniques can commonly be witnessed on television and in movies, remarkably in the recent, worldwide phenomenon of TV shows such as \"America's Got Talent\".\nIn professional wrestling, there was a noted tag team, based in WWE, called The Vaudevillains.\nIn 2018, noted film director Christopher Annino, maker of a new silent feature film, \"Silent Times\", founded Vaudeville Con, a gathering to celebrate the history of vaudeville. The first meeting was held in Pawcatuck, Connecticut.\nArchives.\nThe records of the Tivoli Theatre are housed at the State Library of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, with additional personal papers of vaudevillian performers from the Tivoli Theatre, including extensive costume and set design holdings, held by the Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre Melbourne.\nThe American Vaudeville Museum, one of the largest collections of vaudeville memorabilia, is located at the University of Arizona.\nThe Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres in Toronto houses the world's largest collection of vaudeville props and scenery.\nThe Benjamin Franklin Keith and Edward F. Albee Collection housed at the University of Iowa includes a large collection of managers' report books recording and commenting on the lineup and quality of the acts each night.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48236", "revid": "49701843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48236", "title": "Saunders Lewis", "text": "Welsh writer and politician (1893\u20131985)\nSaunders Lewis (born John Saunders Lewis; 15 October 1893 \u2013 1 September 1985) was a Welsh politician, poet, dramatist, Medievalist, and literary critic. Born into a Welsh-speaking ministerial family in Greater Liverpool, Lewis studied in a public school growing up. He rediscovered the importance of both his heritage language and cultural roots while serving as a junior officer in the British Army during the trenches of the First World War. As a vocal supporter of Welsh nationalism, Lewis believed, however, that heritage language revival, cultural nationalism, the dramatic arts, and culture needed to precede Welsh devolution or political independence. If the excessive Anglophilia and colonial mentality traditionally known as Dic Si\u00f4n Dafydd was never challenged or defeated, Lewis predicted in 1918, \"the Welsh Parliament would [only] be an enlarged County Council.\"\nLewis accordingly became a co-founder of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru (The National Party of Wales), now the Welsh nationalist political party known as Plaid Cymru, at a covert meeting with fellow nationalists during the 1925 National Eisteddfod of Wales. Lewis has been described by Jan Morris as, \"the most passionate of twentieth century Welsh patriots\", and as being, \"one of the few twentieth century writers in Welsh with a European reputation, but for many Welshmen [he was] chiefly the keeper of the national conscience.\" Lewis is usually acknowledged as one of the most vitally important figures in 20th-century Welsh-language literature. He is also widely credited, through his 1962 radio address \"Tynged yr Iaith\" (\"The Fate of the Language\"), with almost singlehandedly bringing Welsh back from the brink of language death. \nIn 1970, Lewis was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Literature and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory by Pope Paul VI. Saunders Lewis' traditionalist Catholic and distributist beliefs gave him a simultaneously anti-Marxist and anti-colonialist interpretation of Welsh history and a similar vision, influenced by his study of what had he considered to have worked in Irish nationalism, for the future of the Welsh people. Lewis was overwhelmingly voted the tenth greatest Welsh hero in the '100 Welsh Heroes' poll, released on St. David's Day 2004.\nEarly life.\nJohn Saunders Lewis was born into a Welsh-speaking family in Wallasey in the Wirral, Cheshire, in the north-west of England, on 15 October 1893. He was the second of three sons of Lodwig Lewis (1859\u20131933), a Calvinistic Methodist minister, and his wife Mary Margaret (n\u00e9e Thomas, 1862\u20131900). When he was only six years old, Lewis's mother died and his unmarried maternal \"Aunt Ellen\" (Ellen Elizabeth Thomas) moved into the manse and helped to raise him.\nJan Morris has described Liverpool as the closest there is to a metropolis for the people of North Wales. During a television interview with Aneirin Talfan Davies, Lewis later recalled that this was also true during his childhood, as in and around Liverpool, \"there were around about a hundred thousand Welsh-speaking Welsh people... So I was not born in English-speaking England... but into a society that was completely Welsh and Welsh-speaking.\"\nEven though his father was a scholar, \"who liked solitude and study\", and possessed a very large library of Welsh literature, the only Welsh-language books that Saunders Lewis read while growing up were Bishop Morgan's Bible, the hymnbook, and Sunday school commentaries.\nLewis attended prestigious English-speaking Liscard High School for Boys where he was bullied at first, due to the fact that what little English he could speak, \"was full of Welsh words.\" In time, however, Lewis became, \"a typical product of the English education system.\" He became editor of \"The Liscard High School Magazine\" and often visited the Wallasey Public Library, where he read contemporary English literature and, as a teenager, was enthusiastic when he discovered the recent mythopoeic poetry and prose reimaginings of Irish folklore and mythology by Irish nationalists William Butler Yeats, John Millington Synge, and Padraic Colum.\nLewis later recalled that through these writers, \"I came for the first time to understand what patriotism meant and the spirit of the nation meant. And I soon began to think that things like those , which had seized hold of them in Ireland, were the things I should seize hold of in Wales.\"\nLewis' earliest attempts at writing poems were in English and were inspired by William Wordsworth, Walter Pater, John Wesley and the King James Bible.\nPersonal life.\nAfter entering Liverpool University to study English literature in 1911, Lewis is believed to have first met fellow student Margaret Gilcriest, a Roman Catholic from County Wicklow and staunch believer in Irish political and cultural nationalism, in December 1913. Lewis and Gilcriest shared an enthusiasm for literature and in their subsequent courtship by letters, all of which have since been published, there are references to the writings of Dora Sigerson, Katherine Tynan, James Clarence Mangan, Alice Meynell, Emily Lawless, Thomas Kettle, Daniel Corkery, and James Joyce.\nAfter his aunt Ellen persuaded his father \"to accept the inevitable\", Lewis and Margaret Gilcriest (1891-1984) were married at Our Lady and St Michael Roman Catholic Church in Workington, Cumberland, on 31 July 1924. They had one child, a daughter.\nFirst World War.\nWhen the First World War broke out, an idealistic Lewis, feeling inspired by the Aesthete philosophy of Walter Pater to, \"savour this experience of life-energy at the utmost\", enlisted in the 3rd Battalion, King's Liverpool Regiment on 4 September 1914. British Army records describe Lewis at the time as five-feet and three inches in height, weighing just over seven and a half stone, and as having red hair and grey eyes.\nIn April 1915, Lewis applied for a commission with the South Wales Borderers and was promoted to full lieutenant in February 1916. The following summer, he was deployed to active service on the Western Front.\nDuring the war, Lewis read the trilogy of novels \"The Cult of the Self\" (French: \"Le Culte du moi\") by the French writer Maurice Barr\u00e8s. Barr\u00e8s, a French nationalist, had called since the 1890s, alongside Paul Claudel and Paul Bourget, for, \"a 'return' to national values and traditions.\" This volume heavily influenced Lewis' growing sense of his own Welsh identity and belief in the vital importance of cultural nationalism. \nFurthermore, according to Jelle Krol, Lewis, was amazed to see how his own father's recent words of advice were echoed by Barr\u00e8s, who wrote, \"the only way to cultivate your personality as an artist and to develop your own resources, is to go back to your roots\". Lewis accordingly, \"discovered the importance of his Welsh roots during his service in France.\"\nIn April 1917, Lewis was severely wounded in action in the left leg and thigh near Gonnelieu, with, \"the calf of the leg nearly blown away\", as part of the Battle of Cambrai. Afterwards, Lewis needed more than a year to convalesce, during which his younger brother, Ludwig Lewis, was killed in action on 7 July 1917. Although Lewis desperately wanted to visit and help comfort their grieving father at Swansea, his own battlefield injuries were still far too severe to permit him to travel.\nIn a 23 July 1918 letter to \"The Cambria Daily Leader\", Lewis, as he would do for the remainder of his life, explained why he felt cultural nationalism needed to precede political decolonisation, \"In Wales, if we gave ourselves less to party politics and more to the development of our own education and culture, we should make Wales more fitted to have an independent life of her own under Home Rule. And Home Rule, before we have a real national spirit, would mean simply that the Welsh Parliament would be an enlarged County Council.\"\nReturn to Wales.\nAfter his return from the trenches, Lewis entered the literary field by arguing that three conditions needed to be met for Welsh literature to become truly meaningful. Firstly, \"a more professional attitude to Welsh drama\". Secondly, the reestablishment of a direct link between Welsh culture with that of mainland Europe, and particularly with French culture, and, lastly, a more continual religious and cultural exploration of pre-Reformation Wales by Welsh writers and intellectuals.\nIn a 22 October 1919 letter to \"The Cambria Daily Leader\", called for a revival of drama in the Welsh language, beginning with the improvement of dramas set in the villages, \"All the plays we have seen so far describe, and rather idyllically describe, village manners. But village life is more than 'manners'. It includes memories and traditions and song and even dance and mummery. Village and peasant drama, if it should tell the round truth, must include romance, the \"Mabinogion\", the monastery, witchcraft, fairyland, and all the ancient playgrounds of men. Let us widen our field.\"\nIn a letter of 25 October 1919 to the same newspaper, Lewis urged Welsh-language playwrights and the theatre going public to both, \"take note of the dramatic history of Europe.\" Lewis continued, \"And so it seems to me we should begin anew with translation. We should translate into Welsh the plays of the acknowledged masters, of Euripides, of Corneille, of Racine, of Moliere, of Ibsen, of the Spaniards, and we should act them continually; we should learn the classics.\"\nIn 1922, he was appointed as lecturer in Welsh literature at the University College of Wales, Swansea. During his time at Swansea he produced some of his most significant works of literary criticism: \"A School of Welsh Augustans\" (1924), \"Williams Pantycelyn\" (1927), and \"\" (An outline history of Welsh literature) (1932). He continued in this post until his dismissal for a political act of arson at Penyberth, Gwynedd, in 1936.\nFounding Plaid Cymru.\nDiscussions of the need for a \"Welsh party\" had been conducted since the 19th century. With the generation or so before 1922 there \"had been a marked growth in the constitutional recognition of the Welsh nation\", wrote historian John Davies. By 1924 there were people in Wales \"eager to make their nationality the focus of Welsh politics\". Lewis's experiences in World War I, and his sympathy for the cause of Irish independence, brought him to Welsh nationalism. He was an advocate for Welsh independence.\nIn 1924, Lewis founded \"\" (\"The Welsh Movement\") with a small group of fellow nationalists. The group met secretly for the first time in Penarth on 7 January 1924. The group continued to meet in secret throughout 1924 and began drawing up a set of aims and policies intended to \"rescue Wales from political and cultural oblivion\".\nAt around the same time as Lewis formed ', another group of nationalists formed ' (\"The Welsh Home Rule Army\") in Caernarfon. The group was led by Huw Robert Jones, who made contact with Lewis in early 1925 and proposed to form a new political party. \nLewis met with Jones, Lewis Valentine, Moses Griffith, Fred Jones and D. Edmund Williams in a caf\u00e9 called Maes Gwyn during the 1925 National Eisteddfod in Pwllheli, Gwynedd, with the aim of establishing a \"Welsh party\". They founded \"\" (\"National Party of Wales\"), on 5 August 1925. The principal aim of the party would be to foster a Welsh-speaking Wales. To this end it was agreed that party business be conducted in Welsh, and that members sever all links with other British parties. Lewis insisted on these principles before he would agree to the Pwllheli conference.\nAccording to the 1911 census, out of a population of just under 2.5 million, 43.5% of the total population of Wales spoke Welsh as a primary language. This was a decrease from the 1891 census with 54.4% speaking Welsh out of a population of 1.5 million. With these pre-requisites, Lewis condemned \"'Welsh nationalism' as it had hitherto existed, a nationalism characterized by inter-party conferences, an obsession with Westminster and a willingness to accept a subservient position for the Welsh language\", wrote Davies. It may be because of these strict positions that the party failed to attract politicians of experience in its early years. However, the party's members believed its founding was an achievement in itself; \"merely by existing, the party was a declaration of the distinctiveness of Wales\", wrote Davies.\nThe Lewis Doctrine 1926\u20131939.\nDuring the inter-war years, \"Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru\" was most successful as a social and educational pressure group rather than as a political party. For Saunders Lewis, party president 1926 to 1939, \"the chief aim of the party [is] to 'take away from the Welsh their sense of inferiority\u00a0... to remove from our beloved country the mark and shame of conquest.'\" Lewis sought to cast \"Welshness\" into a new context, wrote Davies.\nLewis wished to demonstrate how Welsh heritage was linked as one of the 'founders' of European civilization. Lewis, a self-described \"strong monarchist\", wrote \"Civilization is more than an abstraction. It must have a local habitation and name. Here its name is Wales.\" Additionally, Lewis strove for the stability, educational and cultural advancement, and economic prosperity of local communities in Y Fro Gymraeg. He also denounced both laissez faire capitalism and Marxism, and instead promoted what he called \"\": (lit. \"distributing property among the masses\"), based on Catholic social teaching, Distributism, and Christian democracy.\nBroadcasting.\nSaunders Lewis perceived the early development of BBC radio broadcasting in Wales (which was almost entirely in English) as serious threat to his aim of arresting the decline of the Welsh language (then down to 36%) and turning Wales back into a 100% Welsh-speaking nation. At the same time he also recognised that if he could exert influence and pressure on the BBC, the Corporation could become a useful tool to serve Plaid Cymru's political ends. In 1929 he declared it would soon be necessary to arrange for \"thousands of Welshmen to be prosecuted for refusing to pay for English programmes\". The following year Lewis was commissioned by E.R. Appleton, Director of the BBC's Cardiff radio station, (who had banned broadcasting in Welsh) to broadcast a talk which would \"explain Welsh Nationalism\". On vetting the script, which advocated political nationalism in preference to \"cultural nationalism\", Appleton decided it was too controversial and inflammatory to be broadcast. In October 1933 the University of Wales Council, which had been lobbying for more Welsh-language broadcasting, appointed a ten-man council to press the case with the BBC. It included David Lloyd George, William George, W.\u00a0J. Gruffydd and Saunders Lewis \u2013 who was continuing to incense the BBC by publicly alleging it was \"seeking the destruction of the Welsh language\". The University Committee, which was described by BBC Director General John Reith as \"the most unpleasant and unreliable people with whom it has been my misfortune to deal\" gained ever more influence on the BBC in Wales not least in the selection of BBC staff \u2013 a function delegated to the committee by the corporation. As newspapers of the time noted, appointees seemed primarily drawn from the families of the Welsh-speaking elite including \"the son of a professor of Welsh and the offspring of three archdruids\". Saunders Lewis's assiduous campaigning over the years was to succeed in cementing an ongoing Plaid Cymru influence within the BBC. When the BBC's Welsh Advisory Council was eventually established in 1946, although half its members were Labour, several Plaid Cymru supporters were appointed including Saunders Lewis's successor as Plaid Cymru president, Gwynfor Evans.\n\"\" 1936.\nWelsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK Government settled on establishing an RAF training camp and aerodrome at Penyberth on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in Gwynedd. The events surrounding the protest, known as ' (\"Fire in Ll\u0177n\"), helped define '. The UK Government settled on Ll\u0177n as the site for its training camp after similar proposed sites in Northumberland and Dorset met with protests.\nHowever, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin refused to hear the case against building this \"bombing school\" in Wales, despite a deputation representing 500,000 Welsh protesters. Protest against the project was summed up by Lewis when he wrote that the UK Government was intent upon turning one of the \"essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature\" into a place for promoting a \"barbaric\" method of warfare. Construction of this military academy began exactly 400 years after the passage of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542.\nOn 8 September 1936, the building was set on fire and in the investigations which followed Saunders Lewis, Lewis Valentine, and D.\u00a0J. Williams claimed responsibility. They were tried at Caernarfon, where the jury failed to agree on a verdict. The case was then sent to be retried at the Old Bailey in London, where \"the Three\" were convicted, and sentenced to nine months imprisonment. On their release from Wormwood Scrubs, they were greeted as heroes by 15,000 Welsh people at a pavilion in Caernarfon.\nMany Welsh people were angered by the judge's scornful treatment of the Welsh language, by the decision to move the trial to London, and by the decision of University College, Swansea, to dismiss Lewis from his post before he had been found guilty. Dafydd Glyn Jones wrote of the fire that it was \"the first time in five centuries that Wales struck back at England with a measure of violence... To the Welsh people, who had long ceased to believe that they had it in them, it was a profound shock.\"\nHowever, despite the acclaim the events of ' generated, by 1938 Lewis's concept of ' (\"home ownership\") had been firmly rejected as \"not\" a fundamental tenet of the party. In 1939 Lewis resigned as \"\" president, saying that Wales was not ready to accept the leadership of a Roman Catholic.\nAlthough Lewis was the son and grandson of prominent Welsh Calvinistic Methodist ministers, he had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1932.\nSecond World War.\nLewis maintained a strict neutrality in his writings through his column ' in '. It was his attempt at an unbiased interpretation of the causes and events of the war.\nOutside of the party's initial position on the war, party members were free to choose for themselves their level of support for the war effort. \"\" was officially neutral regarding involvement the Second World War, which Lewis and other leaders considered a continuation of the First World War. Central to the neutrality policy was the idea that Wales, as a nation, had the right to decide independently on its attitude towards war, along with opposition towards the UK government's decision to involve Wales in the conflict. With this challenging and revolutionary policy Lewis hoped a significant number of Welshmen would refuse to join the armed forces.\nLewis and other party members were attempting to strengthen loyalty to the Welsh nation \"over the loyalty to the British State\". Lewis argued \"The only proof that the Welsh nation exists is that there are some who act as if it did exist.\"\nHowever, most party members who claimed conscientious objection status did so in the context of their moral and religious beliefs, rather than on political policy. Of these almost all were exempt from military service. About 24 party members made politics their sole grounds for exemption, of whom 12 received prison sentences. For Lewis, those who objected proved that the assimilation of Wales was \"being withstood, even under the most extreme pressures\".\nUniversity of Wales by-election, 1943.\nPrior to 1950, universities could elect and return representatives to the House of Commons. The University of Wales seat had become vacant when the constituency's Liberal Member of Parliament, Ernest Evans, had been appointed a county court judge in 1942. Lewis was selected to contest the seat for Plaid Cymru in the ensuing 1943 University of Wales by-election.\nHis opponent was former Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru Deputy Vice-president William John Gruffydd. Gruffydd had been voicing doubts about Lewis's ideas since 1933, and by 1943 he had left Plaid Cymru and joined the Liberal Party. His other opponent, independent candidate Alun Talfan Davies, was another former member of Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru who would later become Chairman of the Welsh Liberal Party.\nThe \"brilliant but wayward\" Gruffydd was a favorite with Welsh-speaking intellectuals and drew 52.3% of the vote, to Lewis's 22.5%.\nThe election effectively split the Welsh-speaking intelligentsia, and left Lewis embittered with politics, leading him to retreat from direct political involvement. However the experience proved invaluable for Plaid Cymru, as \"for the first time they were taken seriously as a political force.\" The by-election campaign led directly to \"considerable growth\" in the party's membership.\n\" and the 1961 census.\nIn 1962 Lewis gave a radio speech entitled \" (\"The Fate of the Language\") in which he predicted the complete extinction of the Welsh language by 2000 unless immediate action was taken.\nLewis's radio speech was in response to the 1961 census, which showed a decrease in the percentage of Welsh speakers from 36% in 1931 to 26%, of the population of about 2.5 million. In the census the counties of Merionethshire (Meirionnydd), Anglesey (Ynys M\u00f4n), Carmarthenshire (Sir Gaerfyrddin), and Caernarfonshire averaged a 75% proportion of Welsh speakers, with the most significant decreases in the counties of Glamorgan, Flint, and Pembroke.\nAssuming, \"a gloomy sepulchral tone\", Lewis argued that the Welsh language was, \"driven into a corner, ready to be thrown, like a worthless rag, on the dung heap.\" The responsibility for this lay, according to Lewis, less in the hands of the British civil service bureaucracy than with the timidity and indifference of the Welsh-speaking people themselves. As he had fully intended it to do, Lewis' lecture immediately touched a raw nerve.\nWhile Lewis' had wished to shame Plaid Cymru into more direct action promoting a Welsh language revival, his speech instead led to the formation of \"Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg\" (\"Welsh Language Society\") later that year at a Plaid Cymru summer school held in Pontardawe in Glamorgan. The foundation of \"\" allowed Plaid Cymru to focus on electoral politics, while the Cymdeithas launched a campaign of civil disobedience aimed at the State's policy of coercive Anglicisation.\nAccording to Marcus Tanner, \"For the first time, the British government was forced to recognise the existence of a substantial non-Anglophone culture, and to rethink attitudes that had been set in stone since Henry VIII's so-called Acts of Union. The new, more conciliatory attitude began under Labour, but continued under the Conservatives.\"\nResponding to escalating demands for devolution in the United Kingdom, in 1964 the Labour Government established the Welsh Office () and the post of Secretary of State for Wales. The Welsh Language Bill of 1967 granted Welsh equal status to English in the legal system. Further legislation belatedly granted century-old demands for Welsh-medium education.\nLater life and death.\nIn 1970, Lewis was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. \nIn March 1983, at the age of 89, Saunders Lewis was made an honorary Doctor of Letters of the University of Wales at a ceremony specially conducted at his home in Penarth. The \"Catholic Herald\", reporting the honour, noted that in the previous year Lewis had made a plea for the restoration to the Catholic Church in Wales of the Tridentine Mass in Ecclesiastical Latin, rather than the Mass of Paul VI in the \"foreign language of English\", which he pointed out was \"a later arrival\".\nLewis died at St Winifred's Hospital in Cardiff, on 1 September 1985. Lewis' final request for a Tridentine Requiem Mass in Ecclesiastical Latin was denied by Bishop Daniel Mullins, who personally offered the Mass of Paul VI instead. Following the Funeral Mass, Lewis was buried in the same grave as his wife Margaret in St. Joseph's Roman Catholic cemetery in Penarth. Lewis's medal as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory, to which he had been appointed by Pope Paul VI, was laid on Lewis' casket during the funeral ceremony and then buried with him.\nLiterary legacy.\nHis literary works include stage plays, poetry, novels and essays. He wrote mostly in Welsh, but he also wrote some works in English. By the time of his death in 1985 some rated him as amongst the most celebrated of Welsh writers.\nLewis was above all a dramatist. His notable plays include ' (The woman of flowers) (1923\u201325, revised 1948), ' (The life of St. Germain) (radio play, 1936), ' (1956), ' (Will you have a cigarette?) (1956), ' (Treachery) (1958), \"Esther\" (1960), and ' (Tomorrow's Wales) (1967). His plays drew upon a wide range of material and covered a range of subject matter including Welsh mythology and history, as well as the Christian Bible, although he also wrote plays set in contemporary Wales.\nLewis also translated Samuel Beckett's \"\" from French into Welsh. \nLewis' use of poetic forms in the Welsh language included both the use of the traditional 24 strict metres in cynghanedd such as cywyddau and awdlau as well as the Sicilian School's sonnet form, \"a variety of other rhyming stanzas\", and \"full breathed free verse\", which were derived from poetry in other languages.\nFollowing his conversion to the Catholic Church, Lewis also wrote many works of Christian poetry inspired by his new faith. These included poems about the Real Presence in the Blessed Sacrament, a poem that sympathetically describes Saint Joseph's crisis of faith, about the traumatic but purgatorial sense of loss experienced by Saint Mary Magdalen after the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and about attending the Tridentine Mass on Christmas Day.\nLewis wrote the libretto for Arwel Hughes's opera ' (Love's the doctor), based on Moli\u00e8re's ' (first performance 1960 by Welsh National Opera).\nHe published two novels, \"Monica\" (1930) and ' (The daughter of Gwern Hywel) (1964) and two collections of poems as well as numerous articles and essays in various newspapers, magazines and journals. These articles have been collected into volumes including: ' (Following Arthur) (1938), ' (Wednesday essays) (1945), ' (Masters of the centuries) (1973), ' (Masters and their craft) (1981) and ' (Go to it, young men) (1986).\nPolitical and cultural legacy.\nLewis's legacy remains a controversial one. Particularly controversial was his belief, as expressed in \"Braslun o Hanes Llenyddiaeth Gymraeg\", a 1932 outline of the history of Welsh-language literature, that the Edwardian conquest of Wales was less damaging to Welsh culture and literature in the long run than the Protestant Reformation, which began under King Henry VIII with the destruction of the independence of the Catholic Church in Wales from control by the State. This was because, according to Lewis, King Henry's legacy ensured that subsequent Welsh literature was cut off by religious persecution and government censorship of the bardic profession from their own religious past and from their previously close links to the rest of Europe.\nThis was why Lewis urged Welsh-language writers as early as 1919 to read, translate, and draw influence from literature in many other European languages, rather than, as he and many others before him had once done, only reading and emulating literature in English. This is also why he particularly recommended translating into the Welsh-language and arranging regular performances in the theatres of the best French poets and playwrights of the Counter-Reformation and the Baroque era. Despite his own Francophilia, Lewis had also mentioned the importance of combatting the Black Legend by exposing the Welsh people to the literary canon of Spanish Golden Age theatre, whose greatest playwrights included Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca. \nWithout mentioning Pope Gregory XI or his 1373 \"r\u00e8gle d'idiom\", command for the Catholic clergy to both learn and communicate with their flocks in the local vernacular, Lewis believed that the coercive Anglicisation of the Welsh people began with the Acts of Union passed under King Henry VIII following his break with the Holy See and commented, \"it was this materialistic and pagan triumph that destroyed our Wales.\" \nExplaining his preference for the era before King Henry VIII, Lewis wrote, \"There was one law and one civilisation throughout Europe, but that law, that civilisation took on many forms and many colours. It did not occur to the rulers of a country to destroy another land's civilisation, even when they conquered that land... Despite being conquered, being oppressed, too, and quite cruelly, it (Welsh civilisation) grew upright and without losing the innate qualities of its culture. No doubt Wales often yearned for freedom, but did not fear losing its heritage, nor did it. Because there was one law and one authority throughout Europe, Welsh civilisation was safe, and the Welsh language and the special Welsh way of life and society.\" \nFor example, historian John Davies writes that, \"in a notable article\", Saunders Lewis argued that the Welsh bards of the Medieval era, \"were expressing in their poetry a love for a stable, deep-rooted civilization.\" Lewis added that the bards \"were the leading upholders of the belief that a hierarchical social structure, 'the heritage and tradition of an ancient aristocracy', were the necessary precondition of civilized life and that there were deep philosophical roots to this belief.\"\nDespite his many statements to the contrary, Lewis' allegedly \"condescending attitude towards some aspects of the Nonconformist, radical and pacifist traditions of Wales\", also drew extremely harsh criticism from fellow Welsh nationalists such as D.\u00a0J. Davies, a socialist Plaid Cymru member. \nLewis, however, always insisted that his conversion to Catholicism did not keep him from understanding the sensibilities or appreciating the role played in Welsh culture by the Nonconformists. For example, he praised Methodism and Calvinism for preserving the uniqueness of Welsh-language literature and culture against the Anglophilia and linguistic imperialism favoured by the Victorian era Welsh gentry, the Government in Westminster, and the Established Church. \nAlong with his careful study of what had worked and what had failed in Irish nationalism, these were the real roots of Lewis' beliefs that Welsh cultural and language revival, Christian democracy, rural landscape conservation, and an Irish-style Land War - meaning direct action tactics intended to reduce rents and coerce an Irish-style breakup and sale of the gentry's estates to their tenants - were preferable causes for the Welsh nationalist movement to embrace than socialism and which have attracted such extreme criticism, both during Lewis' lifetime and since his death.\nIn particular, D.J. Davies denounced Lewis' calls for Welsh language revival and cultural nationalism. Davies called instead for engaging the English-speaking South Wales valleys. Davies also pointed towards left-wing political parties in Scandinavia as a model for Plaid Cymru to emulate, and was accordingly far more interested in the \"economic implications\" of Welsh self-determination.\nLeft wing historian Geraint H. Jenkins has written, \"Lewis was a cold fish. His reedy voice, bow tie, cerebral style and aristocratic contempt for the proletariat were hardly endearing qualities in a political leader, and his conversion to Catholicism lost him the sympathy of fervent Nonconformists. Heavily influenced by the discourse of right-wing French theorists, this profoundly authoritarian figure developed a grand strategy, such as it was, based on the deindustrialization of Wales. Such a scheme was both impractical and unpopular. It caused grave embarrassment to his socialist colleague D.\u00a0J. Davies, a progressive economist who, writing with force and passion, showed a much better grasp of the economic realities of the time and greater sensitivity towards the plight of working people.\nDuring the post-World War II battles between Plaid Cymru and the Labour Party over political control of South Wales, a hostile 1946 portrait mocked Saunders Lewis for thinking himself to be the \"Masaryk of Wales\" and that both the United Kingdom and the very concept of Britishness would one day to collapse similarly to the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. The same writer then sarcastically feigned sympathy for Plaid Cymru, a political party which was allegedly burdened by, \"bitterness and hate and the (possibly unintentional) air of physical superiority with which only too many of its members have regarded the bulk of their countrymen.\"\nDuring the 1990s, in the midst of a debate over the \"Government of Wales Act 1998\", Saunders Lewis was also accused in the House of Commons of having praised Adolf Hitler in 1936 with the words, \"At once he fulfilled his promise \u2014 a promise which was greatly mocked by the London papers months before that \u2014 to completely abolish the financial strength of the Jews in the economic life of Germany.\"\nIn 2001, former Plaid Cymru President Dafydd Elis-Thomas accused Saunders Lewis during a television documentary of being, \"lousy as a politician, lousy as a writer, but a good Catholic\".\nIn the same book, Tanner credited the famous 1962 radio lecture by Saunders Lewis with being the primary reason why the Welsh language was, as of 2004, the only one of the Celtic languages that was neither dead or critically endangered.\nAccording to Tanner, \"Welsh is more visible than ever before. The moment I drove across the Severn Bridge, signs written in a different language proclaimed that I had entered a different land. It was not like Scotland, where Gaelic bilingual signs were limited to a few Highland areas. As for the Bretons in France, they can only dream of such symbols of recognition. You can live your life in Welsh now, at least in theory. The officials of the North Western Railway, who fired workers on the line from Holyhead to Chester for their inability or unwillingness to speak English in the 1890s, would have a tough time of it now. It is the English-speaking monoglot who faces a problem in trying to work in the public sector, and the language sections of universities do a booming trade in teaching basic Welsh to English professionals who have taken up such posts. Saunders Lewis saved more than most people though possible by his stirring radio address back in 1962.\"\nLewis' legacy is further reflected by the fact that, even in decaying and traditionally English-speaking Welsh colliery and industrial towns and cities, Welsh-medium education is increasingly used as a means of both heritage language learning and reasserting national identity.\nFor this and many other reasons, Saunders Lewis was overwhelmingly voted by the Welsh people as their 10th greatest national hero in the '100 Welsh Heroes' poll, the results of which was released on St. David's Day, 2004.\nElectoral record.\nLewis contested the University of Wales Constituency on two occasions, once in the general election of 1931;"}

All objects in the sky can be conceived as being projected upon the inner surface of the celestial sphere, which may be centered on Earth or the observer. If centered on the observer, half of the sphere would resemble a hemispherical screen over the observing location.\nThe celestial sphere is a conceptual tool used in spherical astronomy to specify the position of an object in the sky without consideration of its linear distance from the observer. The celestial equator divides the celestial sphere into northern and southern hemispheres.\nDescription.\nBecause astronomical objects are at such remote distances, casual observation of the sky offers no information on their actual distances. All celestial objects seem equally far away, as if fixed onto the inside of a sphere with a large but unknown radius, which appears to rotate westward overhead; meanwhile, Earth underfoot seems to remain still. For purposes of spherical astronomy, which is concerned only with the directions to celestial objects, it makes no difference if this is actually the case or if it is Earth that is rotating while the celestial sphere is stationary.\nThe celestial sphere can be considered to be infinite in radius. This means any point within it, including that occupied by the observer, can be considered the center. It also means that all parallel lines, be they millimetres apart or across the Solar System from each other, will seem to intersect the sphere at a single point, analogous to the vanishing point of graphical perspective. All parallel planes will seem to intersect the sphere in a coincident great circle (a \"vanishing circle\").\nConversely, observers looking toward the same point on an infinite-radius celestial sphere will be looking along parallel lines, and observers looking toward the same great circle, along parallel planes. On an infinite-radius celestial sphere, all observers see the same things in the same direction.\nFor some objects, this is over-simplified. Objects which are relatively near to the observer (for instance, the Moon) will seem to change position against the distant celestial sphere if the observer moves far enough, say, from one side of planet Earth to the other. This effect, known as parallax, can be represented as a small offset from a mean position. The celestial sphere can be considered to be centered at the Earth's center, the Sun's center, or any other convenient location, and offsets from positions referred to these centers can be calculated.\nIn this way, astronomers can predict geocentric or heliocentric positions of objects on the celestial sphere, without the need to calculate the individual geometry of any particular observer, and the utility of the celestial sphere is maintained. Individual observers can work out their own small offsets from the mean positions, if necessary. In many cases in astronomy, the offsets are insignificant.\nDetermining location of objects.\nThe celestial sphere can thus be thought of as a kind of astronomical shorthand, and is applied very frequently by astronomers. For instance, the \"Astronomical Almanac\" for 2010 lists the apparent geocentric position of the Moon on January 1 at 00:00:00.00 Terrestrial Time, in equatorial coordinates, as right ascension 6h 57m 48.86s, declination +23\u00b0 30' 05.5\". Implied in this position is that it is as projected onto the celestial sphere; any observer at any location looking in that direction would see the \"geocentric Moon\" in the same place against the stars. For many rough uses (e.g. calculating an approximate phase of the Moon), this position, as seen from the Earth's center, is adequate.\nFor applications requiring precision (e.g. calculating the shadow path of an eclipse), the \"Almanac\" gives formulae and methods for calculating the \"topocentric\" coordinates, that is, as seen from a particular place on the Earth's surface, based on the geocentric position. This greatly abbreviates the amount of detail necessary in such almanacs, as each observer can handle their own specific circumstances.\nGreek history on celestial spheres.\nCelestial spheres (or celestial orbs) were envisioned to be perfect and divine entities initially from Greek astronomers such as Aristotle. He composed a set of principles called Aristotelian physics that outlined the natural order and structure of the world. Like other Greek astronomers, Aristotle also thought the \"...celestial sphere as the frame of reference for their geometric theories of the motions of the heavenly bodies\". With his adoption of Eudoxus of Cnidus' theory, Aristotle had described celestial bodies within the Celestial sphere to be filled with pureness, perfect and quintessence (the fifth element that was known to be divine and purity according to Aristotle). Aristotle deemed the Sun, Moon, planets and the fixed stars to be perfectly concentric spheres in a superlunary region above the sublunary sphere. Aristotle had asserted that these bodies (in the superlunary region) are perfect and cannot be corrupted by any of the classical elements: fire, water, air, and earth. Corruptible elements were only contained in the sublunary region and incorruptible elements were in the superlunary region of Aristotle's geocentric model. Aristotle had the notion that celestial orbs must exhibit celestial motion (a perfect circular motion) that goes on for eternity. He also argued that the behavior and property follows strictly to a principle of natural place where the quintessential element moves freely of divine will, while other elements, fire, air, water and earth, are corruptible, subject to change and imperfection. Aristotle's key concepts rely on the nature of the five elements distinguishing the Earth and the Heavens in the astronomical reality, taking Eudoxus's model of separate spheres.\nNumerous discoveries from Aristotle and Eudoxus (approximately 395 B.C. to 337 B.C.) have sparked differences in both of their models and sharing similar properties simultaneously. Aristotle and Eudoxus claimed two different counts of spheres in the heavens. According to Eudoxus, there were only 27 spheres in the heavens, while there are 55 spheres in Aristotle's model. Eudoxus attempted to construct his model mathematically from a treatise known as \"On Speeds\" () and asserted the shape of the hippopede or lemniscate was associated with planetary retrogression. Aristotle emphasized that the speed of the celestial orbs is unchanging, like the heavens, while Eudoxus emphasized that the orbs are in a perfect geometrical shape. Eudoxus's spheres would produce undesirable motions to the lower region of the planets, while Aristotle introduced unrollers between each set of active spheres to counteract the motions of the outer set, or else the outer motions will be transferred to the outer planets. Aristotle would later observe \"...the motions of the planets by using the combinations of nested spheres and circular motions in creative ways, but further observations kept undoing their work\".\nAside from Aristotle and Eudoxus, Empedocles gave an explanation that the motion of the heavens, moving about it at divine (relatively high) speed, puts the Earth in a stationary position due to the circular motion preventing the downward movement from natural causes. Aristotle criticized Empedocles's model, arguing that all heavy objects go towards the Earth and not the whirl itself coming to Earth. He ridiculed it and claimed that Empedocles's statement was extremely absurd. Anything that defied the motion of natural place and the unchanging heavens (including the celestial spheres) was criticized immediately by Aristotle.\nCelestial coordinate systems.\nThese concepts are important for understanding celestial coordinate systems, frameworks for measuring the positions of objects in the sky. Certain reference lines and planes on Earth, when projected onto the celestial sphere, form the bases of the reference systems. These include the Earth's equator, axis, and orbit. At their intersections with the celestial sphere, these form the celestial equator, the north and south celestial poles, and the ecliptic, respectively. As the celestial sphere is considered arbitrary or infinite in radius, all observers see the celestial equator, celestial poles, and ecliptic at the same place against the background stars.\nFrom these bases, directions toward objects in the sky can be quantified by constructing celestial coordinate systems. Similar to geographic longitude and latitude, the equatorial coordinate system specifies positions relative to the celestial equator and celestial poles, using right ascension and declination. The ecliptic coordinate system specifies positions relative to the ecliptic (Earth's orbit), using ecliptic longitude and latitude. Besides the equatorial and ecliptic systems, some other celestial coordinate systems, like the galactic coordinate system, are more appropriate for particular purposes.\nHistory.\nThe ancient Greeks assumed the literal truth of stars attached to a celestial sphere, revolving about the Earth in one day, and a fixed Earth. \nThe Eudoxan planetary model, on which the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic models were based, was the first geometric explanation for the \"wandering\" of the classical planets. The outermost of these \"crystal spheres\" was thought to carry the fixed stars. Eudoxus used 27 concentric spherical solids to answer Plato's challenge: \"By the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?\"\nAnaxagoras in the mid 5th century BC was the first known philosopher to suggest that the stars were \"fiery stones\" too far away for their heat to be felt. Similar ideas were expressed by Aristarchus of Samos. However, they did not enter mainstream European and Islamic astronomy of the late ancient and medieval period.\nCopernican heliocentrism did away with the planetary spheres, but it did not necessarily preclude the existence of a sphere for the fixed stars. The first astronomer of the European Renaissance to suggest that the stars were distant suns was Giordano Bruno in his \"De l'infinito universo et mondi\" (1584). This idea was among the charges, albeit not in a prominent position, brought against him by the Inquisition.\nThe idea became mainstream in the later 17th century, especially following the publication of \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" by Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle (1686), and by the early 18th century it was the default working assumptions in stellar astronomy.\nStar globe.\nA celestial sphere can also refer to a physical model of the celestial sphere or celestial globe.\nSuch globes map the constellations on the \"outside\" of a sphere, resulting in a mirror image of the constellations as seen from Earth. The oldest surviving example of such an artifact is the globe of the Farnese Atlas sculpture, a 2nd-century copy of an older (Hellenistic period, ca. 120 BCE) work.\nBodies other than Earth.\nObservers on other worlds would, of course, see objects in that sky under much the same conditions \u2013 as if projected onto a dome. Coordinate systems based on the sky of that world could be constructed. These could be based on the equivalent \"ecliptic\", poles and equator, although the reasons for building a system that way are as much historic as technical.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Both were first-generation Irish Americans. He was born the youngest of five siblings. His first name, Raphael, derived from the day on which he was expected to be born (the Feast of St. Raphael). When he was four, his family moved to Perry, Oklahoma.\nHe graduated from Cascia Hall, and came of age in the early years of the Great Depression. He studied in the night school division at the University of Tulsa in 1932\u201333, mostly studying math and German, but left before graduating. In 1935, he began to work for Clark Electrical Supply Company in Tulsa and, from 1939 to 1942, attended the International Correspondence School. One of his hobbies was studying languages. Per \"The New York Times\", \"He taught himself Greek in order to read the New Testament in the original.\"\nHe enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942. After training in Texas, North Carolina, Florida, and California, he was sent to the South Pacific Area, serving in Australia, New Guinea, Morotai and the Philippines. When he left the Army in 1946, he had become a 1st Sergeant serving as a staff sergeant and had received an Asiatic\u2013Pacific Campaign Medal. He returned to his sales position at Clark and turned to writing in the late 1950s. He never married and lived most of his life in Tulsa with his sister, Anna Lafferty.\nAlthough Lafferty did not begin writing until his mid-40s, he wrote dozens of novels and more than two hundred short stories, most of them at least nominally science fiction. His first published story was \"The Wagons\" in the \"New Mexico Quarterly Review\" in 1959. His first published science fiction story was \"Day of the Glacier\", in \"The Original Science Fiction Stories\" in 1960, and his debut novel was \"Past Master\" in 1968. In the same year, he also published \"The Reefs of Earth\" and \"Space Chantey\", a science fiction retelling of Homer's \"Odyssey\", which was then followed by \"Fourth Mansions\" (1969), a work inspired by Teresa of \u00c1vila.\nAround 1980, his output declined due to a stroke. He stopped writing regularly in 1984. In 1994, he suffered another, more severe, stroke.\nLafferty's work was represented by Virginia Kidd Literary Agency, which held a cache of his unpublished manuscripts. This included over a dozen novels, such as \"Iron Tongue of Midnight\", as well as about eighty short stories and a handful of essays.\nDeath and legacy.\nHe died on March 18, 2002, aged 87 in a nursing home in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Lafferty's funeral took place at Christ the King Catholic Church in Tulsa, where he regularly attended daily Mass. He is buried at St. Rose Catholic Cemetery in Perry.\nHis collected papers, drafts of novels and short stories, artifacts, and ephemera were donated to the University of Tulsa's McFarlin Library, Department of Special Collections and University Archives. A smaller collection, donated by Lafferty in 1979, is also housed in the University of Iowa Libraries' Special Collections department.\nIn March 2011, it was announced in \"Locus\" that the copyrights to 29 Lafferty novels and 225 short stories were up for sale. The literary estate was soon thereafter purchased by the magazine's nonprofit foundation, under the auspices of board member Neil Gaiman.\nHolocaust denial.\nIn July 2025, it was revealed that the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at McFarlin Library houses materials related to Lafferty\u2019s Holocaust denial, such as a letter in which Lafferty categorically denies the Holocaust. It also archives his collection of Holocaust denial materials and handwritten notes. Special Collections is undertaking an evaluation of the labeling of these materials.\nWriting style.\nIn his 2006 short story collection \"Fragile Things\", Neil Gaiman includes a short story called \"Sunbird\" written in the style of Lafferty. In the introduction, he says this about Lafferty: There was a writer from Tulsa, Oklahoma (he died in 2002), who was, for a little while in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the best short story writer in the world. His name was R. A. Lafferty, and his stories were unclassifiable and odd and inimitable -- you knew you were reading a Lafferty story within a sentence. When I was young I wrote to him, and he wrote back.&lt;br&gt;\"Sunbird\" was my attempt to write a Lafferty story, and it taught me a number of things, mostly how much harder they are than they look...\nGaiman and Lafferty had corresponded for several years during Gaiman's adolescence; he remembered Lafferty's letters as \"filled with typical cock-eyed Lafferty humour and observations, wise and funny and sober all at once.\"\nPer \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\": He has fairly been described as a writer of tall tales, as a cartoonist, as an author whose tone was fundamentally oral; his conservative Catholicism has been seen as permeating every word he wrote (or has been ignored); he has been seen as a ransacker of old Mythologies, and as a flippant generator of new ones; he clearly delighted in a vision of the world as being irradiated by conspiracies both godly and devilish, but at times paid scant attention to the niceties of plotting; he has been understood by some as essentially light-hearted and by others as a solitary, stringent moralist; he was technically inventive, but lunged constantly into a slapdash sublime only skittishly evocative, and only occasionally, of anything like the traditional Sense of Wonder; his skill in the deploying of various rhetorical narrative voices was manifest, but these voices were sometimes choked in baroque flamboyance. ... He and Gene Wolfe have more than a shared faith in common.He has also been compared to the English writer G. K. Chesterton: \"[Once a] French publisher nervously asked whether Lafferty minded being compared to G. K. Chesterton (another Catholic author), and there was a terrifying silence that went on and on. Was the great man hideously offended? Eventually, very slowly, he said: 'You're on the right track, kid,' and wandered away.\"\nThemes.\nLafferty's quirky prose drew from traditional storytelling styles, largely from the Irish and Native American, and his shaggy-dog characters and tall tales are unique in science fiction. Little of Lafferty's writing is considered typical of the genre. His stories are closer to tall tales than traditional science fiction and are deeply influenced by his Catholic beliefs; \"Fourth Mansions\", for example, draws on \"The Interior Mansions\" of Teresa of \u00c1vila.\nHis writings, both topically and stylistically, are not easy to categorize. Plot is frequently secondary to other elements of Lafferty's writing. While this style has resulted in a loyal cult following, it causes some readers to give up reading his work. Not all of Lafferty's work was science fiction or fantasy. His novel \"Okla Hannali\" (1972), published by University of Oklahoma Press, tells the story of the Choctaw in Mississippi, and after the Trail of Tears, in Oklahoma, through an account of the larger-than-life character Hannali and his large family. This novel was thought of highly by the novelist Dee Brown, author of \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" (1970), who on the back cover of the edition published by the University of Oklahoma Press, writes \"The history of the Choctaw Indians has been told before and is still being told, but it has never been told in the way Lafferty tells it ... Hannali is a buffalo bull of a man who should become one of the enduring characters in the literature of the American Indian.\" He also wrote, \"It is art applied to history so that the legend of the Choctaws, their great and small men, their splendid humor, and their tragedies are filled with life and breath.\"\nLike the work of Chesterton and Belloc, Lafferty's writing occasionally shows evidence of antisemitism. For instance, his novella \"The\" \"Three Armageddons of Enniscorthy Sweeny\" (1977) is a history of the 20th century that erases the Jewish Holocaust. \nRecognition.\nLafferty received Hugo Award nominations for \"Past Master\", \"Continued on Next Rock\", \"Sky\", and \"Eurema's Dam\", the last of which won the Best Short Story Hugo in 1973 (shared with Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth's \"The Meeting\").\nHe received Nebula Award nominations for \"In Our Block\", \"Slow Tuesday Night\", \"Past Master\", \"Fourth Mansions\", \"Continued on Next Rock\", \"Entire And Perfect Chrysolite\", and \"The Devil is Dead\". He never received a Nebula award.\nHis collection \"Lafferty in Orbit\" was nominated for a World Fantasy Award, and in 1990, Lafferty received a World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award. His 1992 collection \"Iron Tears\" was also a finalist for the Philip K. Dick Award. In 2002, he received the Cordwainer Smith Foundation's Rediscovery award.\nThe Oklahoma Department of Libraries granted him the Arrell Gibson Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995.\n\"Fourth Mansions\" was also named by David Pringle as one of his selections for \"\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is usually denoted with the symbol \u22c9. There are two closely related concepts of semidirect product: \nAs with direct products, there is a natural equivalence between inner and outer semidirect products, and both are commonly referred to simply as \"semidirect products\".\nFor finite groups, the Schur\u2013Zassenhaus theorem provides a sufficient condition for the existence of a decomposition as a semidirect product (also known as splitting extension).\nInner semidirect product definitions.\nGiven a group \"G\" with identity element \"e\", a subgroup \"H\", and a normal subgroup formula_1, the following statements are equivalent:\nIf any of these statements holds (and hence all of them hold, by their equivalence), we say \"G\" is the semidirect product of \"N\" and \"H\", written\n formula_5 or formula_6\nor that \"G\" \"splits\" over \"N\"; one also says that \"G\" is a semidirect product of \"H\" acting on \"N\", or even a semidirect product of \"H\" and \"N\". To avoid ambiguity, it is advisable to specify which is the normal subgroup.\nIf formula_5, then there is a group homomorphism formula_8 given by formula_9, and for formula_10, we have formula_11.\nInner and outer semidirect products.\nInner semidirect product.\nLet us first consider the inner semidirect product. In this case, for a group formula_12, consider a normal subgroup \"N\" and another subgroup \"H\" (not necessarily normal). Assume that the\nconditions on the list above hold. Let formula_13 denote the group of all automorphisms of \"N\", which is a group under composition. Construct a group homomorphism formula_14 defined by conjugation, \n formula_15, for all \"h\" in \"H\" and \"n\" in \"N\". \nIn this way we can construct a group formula_16 with group operation defined as \n formula_17 for \"n\"1, \"n\"2 in \"N\" and \"h\"1, \"h\"2 in \"H\". \nThe subgroups \"N\" and \"H\" determine \"G\" up to isomorphism, as we will show later. In this way, we can construct the group \"G\" from its subgroups. This kind of construction is called an inner semidirect product (also known as internal semidirect product).\nOuter semidirect product.\nLet us now consider the outer semidirect product. Given any two groups \"N\" and \"H\" and a group homomorphism \"\u03c6\" : \"H\" \u2192 Aut(\"N\"), we can construct a new group \"N\" \u22ca\"\u03c6\" \"H\", called the outer semidirect product of \"N\" and \"H\" with respect to \"\u03c6\", defined as follows:\nThis defines a group in which the identity element is (\"e\"\"N\", \"eH\") and the inverse of the element (\"n\", \"h\") is (\"\u03c6\"\"h\"\u22121(\"n\"\u22121), \"h\"\u22121). Pairs (\"n\", \"eH\") form a normal subgroup isomorphic to \"N\", while pairs (\"eN\", \"h\") form a subgroup isomorphic to \"H\". The full group is a semidirect product of those two subgroups in the sense given earlier.\nConversely, suppose that we are given a group \"G\" with a normal subgroup \"N\" and a subgroup \"H\", such that every element \"g\" of \"G\" may be written uniquely in the form \"g \n nh\" where \"n\" lies in \"N\" and \"h\" lies in \"H\". Let \"\u03c6\" : \"H\" \u2192 Aut(\"N\") be the homomorphism (written \"\u03c6\"(\"h\") \n \"\u03c6\"\"h\") given by\n formula_15\nfor all \"n\" \u2208 \"N\", \"h\" \u2208 \"H\".\nThen \"G\" is isomorphic to the semidirect product \"N\" \u22ca\"\u03c6\" \"H\". The isomorphism \"\u03bb\" : \"G\" \u2192 \"N\" \u22ca\"\u03c6\" \"H\" is well defined\nby \"\u03bb\"(\"a\") \n \"\u03bb\"(\"nh\") \n (\"n, h\") due to the uniqueness of the decomposition \"a\" \n \"nh\".\nIn \"G\", we have \n formula_19\nThus, for \"a\" \n \"n\"1\"h\"1 and \"b\" \n \"n\"2\"h\"2 we obtain\n formula_20\nwhich proves that \"\u03bb\" is a homomorphism. Since \"\u03bb\" is obviously an epimorphism and monomorphism, then it is indeed an isomorphism. This also explains the definition of the multiplication rule in \"N\" \u22ca\"\u03c6\" \"H\".\nThe direct product is a special case of the semidirect product. To see this, let \"\u03c6\" be the trivial homomorphism (i.e., sending every element of \"H\" to the identity automorphism of \"N\") then \"N\" \u22ca\"\u03c6\" \"H\" is the direct product \"N\" \u00d7 \"H\".\nA version of the splitting lemma for groups states that a group \"G\" is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the two groups \"N\" and \"H\" if and only if there exists a short exact sequence\n formula_21\nand a group homomorphism \"\u03b3\" : \"H\" \u2192 \"G\" such that \"\u03b1\"\u2009\u2218\u2009\"\u03b3\" \n id\"H\", the identity map on \"H\". In this case, \"\u03c6\" : \"H\" \u2192 Aut(\"N\") is given by \"\u03c6\"(\"h\") \n \"\u03c6\"\"h\", where\nformula_22\nExamples.\nDihedral group.\nThe dihedral group D\"n\" with 2\"n\" elements is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the cyclic groups C\"n\" and C2. Here, the non-identity element of C2 acts on C\"n\" by inverting elements; this is an automorphism since C\"n\" is abelian. The presentation for this group is:\nformula_23\nCyclic groups.\nMore generally, a semidirect product of any two cyclic groups C\"m\" with generator \"a\" and C\"n\" with generator \"b\" is given by one extra relation, \"aba\"\u22121 \n \"bk\", with \"k\" and \"n\" coprime, and formula_24; that is, the presentation:\n formula_25\nIf \"r\" and \"m\" are coprime, \"ar\" is a generator of C\"m\" and \"arba\u2212r\" \n \"bkr\", hence the presentation:\n formula_26\ngives a group isomorphic to the previous one.\nSymmetric group.\nThe symmetric group S\"n\" where formula_27 is a semidirect product of the alternating group A\"n\" and any 2-element subgroup generated by a single transposition.\nHolomorph of a group.\nOne canonical example of a group expressed as a semidirect product is the holomorph of a group. This is defined asformula_28where formula_29 is the automorphism group of a group formula_12 and the structure map formula_31 comes from the right action of formula_29 on formula_12. In terms of multiplying elements, this gives the group structureformula_34\nFundamental group of the Klein bottle.\nThe fundamental group of the Klein bottle can be presented in the form\n formula_35\nand is therefore a semidirect product of the group of integers with addition, formula_36, with formula_36. The corresponding homomorphism \"\u03c6\" : formula_36 \u2192 Aut(formula_36) is given by \"\u03c6\"(\"h\")(\"n\") \n (\u22121)\"h\"\"n\".\nUpper triangular matrices.\nThe group formula_40 of upper triangular matrices with non-zero determinant in an arbitrary field, that is with non-zero entries on the diagonal, has a decomposition into the semidirect product\nformula_41 where formula_42 is the subgroup of matrices with only formula_43s on the diagonal, which is called the upper unitriangular matrix group, and formula_44 is the subgroup of diagonal matrices.\nThe group action of formula_44 on formula_42 is induced by matrix multiplication. If we set\n formula_47\nand\n formula_48\nthen their matrix product is\n formula_49\nThis gives the induced group action formula_50\n formula_51\nA matrix in formula_40 can be represented by matrices in formula_42 and formula_44. Hence formula_41.\nGroup of isometries on the plane.\nThe Euclidean group of all rigid motions (isometries) of the plane (maps \"f\" : formula_562 \u2192 formula_562 such that the Euclidean distance between \"x\" and \"y\" equals the distance between \"f\"(\"x\") and \"f\"(\"y\") for all \"x\" and \"y\" in formula_58) is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the abelian group formula_58 (which describes translations) and the group O(2) of orthogonal 2 \u00d7 2 matrices (which describes rotations and reflections that keep the origin fixed). Applying a translation and then a rotation or reflection has the same effect as applying the rotation or reflection first and then a translation by the rotated or reflected translation vector (i.e. applying the conjugate of the original translation). This shows that the group of translations is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group, that the Euclidean group is a semidirect product of the translation group and O(2), and that the corresponding homomorphism \"\u03c6\" : O(2) \u2192 Aut(formula_562) is given by matrix multiplication: \"\u03c6\"(\"h\")(\"n\") \n \"hn\".\nOrthogonal group O(\"n\").\nThe orthogonal group O(\"n\") of all orthogonal real \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices (intuitively the set of all rotations and reflections of \"n\"-dimensional space that keep the origin fixed) is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the group SO(\"n\") (consisting of all orthogonal matrices with determinant 1, intuitively the rotations of \"n\"-dimensional space) and C2. If we represent C2 as the multiplicative group of matrices {\"I\", \"R\"}, where \"R\" is a reflection of \"n\"-dimensional space that keeps the origin fixed (i.e., an orthogonal matrix with determinant \u20131 representing an involution), then \"\u03c6\" : C2 \u2192 Aut(SO(\"n\")) is given by \"\u03c6\"(\"H\")(\"N\") \n \"HNH\"\u22121 for all \"H\" in C2 and \"N\" in SO(\"n\"). In the non-trivial case (\"H\" is not the identity) this means that \"\u03c6\"(\"H\") is conjugation of operations by the reflection (in 3-dimensional space a rotation axis and the direction of rotation are replaced by their \"mirror image\").\nSemi-linear transformations.\nThe group of semilinear transformations on a vector space \"V\" over a field formula_61, often denoted \u0393L(\"V\"), is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the linear group GL(\"V\") (a normal subgroup of \u0393L(\"V\")), and the automorphism group of formula_61.\nNon-examples.\nOf course, no simple group can be expressed as a semidirect product (because they do not have nontrivial normal subgroups), but there are a few common counterexamples of groups containing a non-trivial normal subgroup that nonetheless cannot be expressed as a semidirect product. Note that although not every group formula_12 can be expressed as a split extension of formula_3 by formula_65, it turns out that such a group can be embedded into the wreath product formula_66 by the universal embedding theorem.\nZ4.\nThe cyclic group formula_67 is not a simple group since it has a subgroup of order 2, namely formula_68 is a subgroup and their quotient is formula_69, so there is an extension formula_70If instead this extension is split, then the group formula_12 informula_72would be isomorphic to formula_73.\nQ8.\nThe group of the eight quaternions formula_74 where formula_75 and formula_76, is another example of a group which has non-trivial normal subgroups yet is still not split. For example, the subgroup generated by formula_77 is isomorphic to formula_67 and is normal. It also has a subgroup of order formula_79 generated by formula_80. This would mean formula_81 would have to be a split extension in the following \"hypothetical\" exact sequence of groups: formula_82, but such an exact sequence does not exist. This can be shown by computing the first group cohomology group of formula_69 with coefficients in formula_67, so formula_85 and noting the two groups in these extensions are formula_86 and the dihedral group formula_87. But, as neither of these groups is isomorphic with formula_81, the quaternion group is not split. This non-existence of isomorphisms can be checked by noting the trivial extension is abelian while formula_81 is non-abelian, and noting the only normal subgroups are formula_69 and formula_67, but formula_81 has three subgroups isomorphic to formula_67.\nProperties.\nIf \"G\" is the semidirect product of the normal subgroup \"N\" and the subgroup \"H\", and both \"N\" and \"H\" are finite, then the order of \"G\" equals the product of the orders of \"N\" and \"H\". This follows from the fact that \"G\" is of the same order as the outer semidirect product of \"N\" and \"H\", whose underlying set is the Cartesian product \"N\" \u00d7 \"H\".\nRelation to direct products.\nSuppose \"G\" is a semidirect product of the normal subgroup \"N\" and the subgroup \"H\". If \"H\" is also normal in \"G\", or equivalently, if there exists a homomorphism \"G\" \u2192 \"N\" that is the identity on \"N\" with kernel \"H\", then \"G\" is the direct product of \"N\" and \"H\".\nThe direct product of two groups \"N\" and \"H\" can be thought of as the semidirect product of \"N\" and \"H\" with respect to \"\u03c6\"(\"h\") \n id\"N\" for all \"h\" in \"H\".\nNote that in a direct product, the order of the factors is not important, since \"N\" \u00d7 \"H\" is isomorphic to \"H\" \u00d7 \"N\". This is not the case for semidirect products, as the two factors play different roles.\nFurthermore, the result of a (proper) semidirect product by means of a non-trivial homomorphism is never an abelian group, even if the factor groups are abelian.\nNon-uniqueness of semidirect products (and further examples).\nAs opposed to the case with the direct product, a semidirect product of two groups is not, in general, unique; if \"G\" and \"G\u2032\" are two groups that both contain isomorphic copies of \"N\" as a normal subgroup and \"H\" as a subgroup, and both are a semidirect product of \"N\" and \"H\", then it does \"not\" follow that \"G\" and \"G\u2032\" are isomorphic because the semidirect product also depends on the choice of an action of \"H\" on \"N\".\nFor example, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 16 that are semidirect products of C8 and C2; in this case, C8 is necessarily a normal subgroup because it has index 2. One of these four semidirect products is the direct product, while the other three are non-abelian groups:\nIf a given group is a semidirect product, then there is no guarantee that this decomposition is unique. For example, there is a group of order 24 (the only one containing six elements of order 4 and six elements of order 6) that can be expressed as semidirect product in the following ways: (D8 \u22c9 C3) \u2245 (C2 \u22c9 Q12) \u2245 (C2 \u22c9 D12) \u2245 (D6 \u22c9 V).\nExistence.\nIn general, there is no known characterization (i.e., a necessary and sufficient condition) for the existence of semidirect products in groups. However, some sufficient conditions are known, which guarantee existence in certain cases. For finite groups, the Schur\u2013Zassenhaus theorem guarantees existence of a semidirect product when the order of the normal subgroup is coprime to the order of the quotient group.\nFor example, the Schur\u2013Zassenhaus theorem implies the existence of a semidirect product among groups of order 6; there are two such products, one of which is a direct product, and the other a dihedral group. In contrast, the Schur\u2013Zassenhaus theorem does not say anything about groups of order 4 or groups of order 8 for instance.\nGeneralizations.\nWithin group theory, the construction of semidirect products can be pushed much further. The Zappa\u2013Sz\u00e9p product of groups is a generalization that, in its internal version, does not assume that either subgroup is normal. \nThere is also a construction in ring theory, the crossed product of rings. This is constructed in the natural way from the group ring for a semidirect product of groups. The ring-theoretic approach can be further generalized to the semidirect sum of Lie algebras. \nFor geometry, there is also a crossed product for group actions on a topological space; unfortunately, it is in general non-commutative even if the group is abelian. In this context, the semidirect product is the \"space of orbits\" of the group action. The latter approach has been championed by Alain Connes as a substitute for approaches by conventional topological techniques; cf. noncommutative geometry. \nThe semidirect product is a special case of the Grothendieck construction in category theory. Specifically, an action of formula_3 on formula_4 (respecting the group, or even just monoid structure) is the same thing as a functor\n formula_96\nfrom the groupoid formula_97 associated to \"H\" (having a single object *, whose endomorphisms are \"H\") to the category of categories such that the unique object in formula_97 is mapped to formula_99. The Grothendieck construction of this functor is equivalent to formula_100, the (groupoid associated to) semidirect product.\nGroupoids.\nAnother generalization is for groupoids. This occurs in topology because if a group \"G\" acts on a space \"X\" it also acts on the fundamental groupoid \"\u03c0\"1(\"X\") of the space. The semidirect product \"\u03c0\"1(\"X\") \u22ca \"G\" is then relevant to finding the fundamental groupoid of the orbit space \"X/G\". For full details see Chapter 11 of the book referenced below, and also some details in semidirect product in ncatlab.\nAbelian categories.\nNon-trivial semidirect products do \"not\" arise in abelian categories, such as the category of modules. In this case, the splitting lemma shows that every semidirect product is a direct product. Thus the existence of semidirect products reflects a failure of the category to be abelian.\nNotation.\nUsually the semidirect product of a group \"H\" acting on a group \"N\" (in most cases by conjugation as subgroups of a common group) is denoted by \"N\" \u22ca \"H\" or \"H\" \u22c9 \"N\". However, some sources may use this symbol with the opposite meaning. In case the action \"\u03c6\" : \"H\" \u2192 Aut(\"N\") should be made explicit, one also writes \"N\" \u22ca\"\u03c6\" \"H\". One way of thinking about the \"N\" \u22ca \"H\" symbol is as a combination of the symbol for normal subgroup (\u25c1) and the symbol for the product (\u00d7). Barry Simon, in his book on group representation theory, employs the unusual notation formula_101 for the semidirect product.\nUnicode lists four variants:\nHere the Unicode description of the rtimes symbol says \"right normal factor\", in contrast to its usual meaning in mathematical practice.\nIn LaTeX, the commands \\rtimes and \\ltimes produce the corresponding characters. With the AMS symbols package loaded, \\leftthreetimes produces \u22cb and \\rightthreetimes produces \u22cc.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards. It is a genre of computer art and digital art which are part of new media art. The mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art. They combine to produce a type of abstract art.\nFractal art (especially in the western world) is rarely drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of fractal-generating software, iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other graphics programs are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork. The Julia set and Mandelbrot sets can be considered as icons of fractal art.\nIt was assumed that fractal art could not have developed without computers because of the calculative capabilities they provide. Fractals are generated by applying iterative methods to solving non-linear equations or polynomial equations. Fractals are any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes for which any suitably chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size.\nTypes.\nThere are many different kinds of fractal images. They can be subdivided into several groups. \nFractal Expressionism is a term used to differentiate traditional visual art that incorporates fractal elements such as self-similarity for example. Perhaps the best example of fractal expressionism is found in Jackson Pollock's dripped patterns. They have been analysed and found to contain a fractal dimension which has been attributed to his technique.\nTechniques.\nFractals of all kinds have been used as the basis for digital art and animation. High resolution color graphics became increasingly available at scientific research labs in the mid-1980s. Scientific forms of art, including fractal art, have developed separately from mainstream culture. Starting with 2-dimensional details of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot Set, fractals have found artistic application in fields as varied as texture generation, plant growth simulation, and landscape generation.\nFractals are sometimes combined with evolutionary algorithms, either by iteratively choosing good-looking specimens in a set of random variations of a fractal artwork and producing new variations, to avoid dealing with cumbersome or unpredictable parameters, or collectively, as in the Electric Sheep project, where people use fractal flames rendered with distributed computing as their screensaver and \"rate\" the flame they are viewing, influencing the server, which reduces the traits of the undesirables, and increases those of the desirables to produce a computer-generated, community-created piece of art.\nMany fractal images are admired because of their perceived harmony. This is typically achieved by the patterns which emerge from the balance of order and chaos. Similar qualities have been described in Chinese painting and miniature trees and rockeries.\nLandscapes.\nThe first fractal image that was intended to be a work of art was probably the famous one on the cover of \"Scientific American\", August 1985. This image showed a landscape formed from the potential function on the domain outside the (usual) Mandelbrot set. However, as the potential function grows fast near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it was necessary for the creator to let the landscape grow downwards, so that it looked as if the Mandelbrot set was a plateau atop a mountain with steep sides. The same technique was used a year after in some images in \"The Beauty of Fractals\" by Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Michael M. Richter. They provide a formula to estimate the distance from a point outside the Mandelbrot set to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set (and a similar formula for the Julia sets). Landscapes can, for example, be formed from the distance function for a family of iterations of the form formula_1.\nArtists.\nNotable fractal artists include Desmond Paul Henry, Hamid Naderi Yeganeh, and musician Bruno Degazio. British artists include William Latham, who has used fractal geometry and other computer graphics techniques in his works. and Vienna Forrester who creates flame fractal art using data extracted from her photographs. Greg Sams has used fractal designs in postcards, T-shirts, and textiles. American Vicky Brago-Mitchell has created fractal art which has appeared in exhibitions and on magazine covers. Scott Draves is credited with inventing flame fractals. Carlos Ginzburg has explored fractal art and developed a concept called \"homo fractalus\" which is based around the idea that the human is the ultimate fractal. Merrin Parkers from New Zealand specialises in fractal art. \nKerry Mitchell wrote a \"Fractal Art Manifesto\", claiming that. In Italy, the artist Giorgio Orefice wrote the \"Fractalism\" manifesto, founding a Fractalism cultural mouvement in 1999.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fractal Art is a subclass of two-dimensional visual art, and is in many respects similar to photography\u2014another art form that was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as prints, bringing fractal artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers. Fractals exist natively as electronic images. This is a format that traditional visual artists are quickly embracing, bringing them into Fractal Art's digital realm. Generating fractals can be an artistic endeavor, a mathematical pursuit, or just a soothing diversion. However, Fractal Art is clearly distinguished from other digital activities by what it is, and by what it is not.\nAccording to Mitchell, fractal art is not computerized art, lacking in rules, unpredictable, nor something that any person with access to a computer can do well. Instead, fractal art is expressive, creative, and requires input, effort, and intelligence. Most importantly, \"fractal art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART.\"\nAmerican artist Hal Tenny was hired to design environment in the 2017 film \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\". There has also been a surge in fractal art distributed via Non-fungible tokens - such as work listed by Fractal_Dimensions, spectral.haus, and NetMetropolis.\nExhibits.\nFractal art has been exhibited at major international art galleries. One of the first exhibitions of fractal art was \"Map Art\", a travelling exhibition of works from researchers at the University of Bremen. Mathematicians Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Michael M. Richter discovered that the public not only found the images aesthetically pleasing but that they also wanted to understand the scientific background to the images.\nIn 1989, fractals were part of the subject matter for an art show called \"Strange Attractors: Signs of Chaos\" at the New Museum of Contemporary Art. The show consisted of photographs, installations and sculptures designed to provide greater scientific discourse to the field which had already captured the public's attention through colourful and intricate computer imagery.\nIn 2014, emerging British fractal artist Vienna Forrester created an exhibition held at the I-node of the Planetary Collegium, Kefalonia, entitled \"IO. Fragmented Myths and Memories: A Fractal Exploration of Kefalonia\", part of the 2013\u201314 international arts festival \"Stone Kingdom Kefalonia\" commemorating the devastating 1953 Ionian earthquake. Her works were created by using geographical coordinates and photographs from parts of the island which still bear the scars.\nArtworks.\n\"Global Forest\" artwork is based on a study highlighting the aesthetic and physiological impacts of fractal patterns. Fractals, patterns found universally in nature, repeat self-similarly across scales, with the complexity and aesthetic perception determined by their recursion and dimension rate. Notably, these patterns are featured in art across various cultures, including Jackson Pollock's paintings, eliciting strong aesthetic reactions. Moreover, incorporating fractals in architectural designs can mitigate visual strain and discomfort caused by Euclidean spaces and even reduce stress, resonating with the biophilic idea of humans' innate connection to nature. The ScienceDesignLab collaborated with the Mohawk Group to integrate these findings, producing award-winning \"Relaxing Floors\" that use fractal patterns, hypothesizing their therapeutic effects stem from nature's soothing visuals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The concept generally relies on the notion of a sequence of random variables and many statistical discussions begin with the words \"let \"X\"1...,\"Xn\" be independent random variables...\". Yet as D. H. Lehmer stated in 1951: \"A random sequence is a vague notion... in which each term is unpredictable to the uninitiated and whose digits pass a certain number of tests traditional with statisticians\".\nAxiomatic probability theory \"deliberately\" avoids a definition of a random sequence. Traditional probability theory does not state if a specific sequence is random, but generally proceeds to discuss the properties of random variables and stochastic sequences assuming some definition of randomness. The Bourbaki school considered the statement \"let us consider a random sequence\" an abuse of language. \nEarly history.\n\u00c9mile Borel was one of the first mathematicians to formally address randomness in 1909. In 1919 Richard von Mises gave the first definition of algorithmic randomness, which was inspired by the law of large numbers, although he used the term \"collective\" rather than random sequence. Using the concept of the impossibility of a gambling system, von Mises defined an infinite sequence of zeros and ones as random if it is not biased by having the \"frequency stability property\" i.e. the frequency of zeros goes to 1/2 and every sub-sequence we can select from it by a \"proper\" method of selection is also not biased.\nThe sub-sequence selection criterion imposed by von Mises is important, because although 0101010101... is not biased, by selecting the odd positions, we get 000000... which is not random. Von Mises never totally formalized his definition of a proper selection rule for sub-sequences, but in 1940 Alonzo Church defined it as any recursive function which having read the first N elements of the sequence decides if it wants to select element number\u00a0\"N\"\u00a0+\u00a01. Church was a pioneer in the field of computable functions, and the definition he made relied on the Church Turing Thesis for computability. This definition is often called \"Mises\u2013Church randomness\".\nModern approaches.\nDuring the 20th century various technical approaches to defining random sequences were developed and now three distinct paradigms can be identified. In the mid 1960s, A. N. Kolmogorov and D. W. Loveland independently proposed a more permissive selection rule. In their view Church's recursive function definition was too restrictive in that it read the elements in order. Instead they proposed a rule based on a partially computable process which having read \"any\" \"N\" elements of the sequence, decides if it wants to select another element which has not been read yet. This definition is often called \"Kolmogorov\u2013Loveland stochasticity\". But this method was considered too weak by Alexander Shen who showed that there is a Kolmogorov\u2013Loveland stochastic sequence which does not conform to the general notion of randomness.\nIn 1966 Per Martin-L\u00f6f introduced a new notion which is now generally considered the most satisfactory notion of algorithmic randomness. His original definition involved measure theory, but it was later shown that it can be expressed in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. Kolmogorov's definition of a random string was that it is random if it has no description shorter than itself via a universal Turing machine.\nThree basic paradigms for dealing with random sequences have now emerged:\n* The \"frequency / measure-theoretic\" approach. This approach started with the work of Richard von Mises and Alonzo Church. In the 1960s Per Martin-L\u00f6f noticed that the sets coding such frequency-based stochastic properties are a special kind of measure zero sets, and that a more general and smooth definition can be obtained by considering all effectively measure zero sets.\n* The \"complexity / compressibility\" approach. This paradigm was championed by A. N. Kolmogorov along with contributions from Leonid Levin and Gregory Chaitin. For finite sequences, Kolmogorov defines randomness of a binary string of length \"n\" as the entropy (or Kolmogorov complexity) normalized by the length \"n\". In other words, if the Kolmogorov complexity of the string is close to \"n\", it is very random; if the complexity is far below \"n\", it is not so random. The dual concept of randomness is compressibility \u2012 the more random a sequence is, the less compressible, and vice versa.\n* The \"predictability\" approach. This paradigm is due to Claus P. Schnorr and uses a slightly different definition of constructive martingales than martingales used in traditional probability theory. Schnorr showed how the existence of a selective betting strategy implied the existence of a selection rule for a biased sub-sequence. If one only requires a recursive martingale to succeed on a sequence instead of constructively succeed on a sequence, then one gets the concept of recursive randomness. Yongge Wang showed that recursive randomness concept is different from Schnorr's randomness concept.\nIn most cases, theorems relating the three paradigms (often equivalence) have been proven.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Humor and a postmodern outlook carried over into his novels as well. One of his stories, \"Arena\", was adapted into a of the American television series .\nEarly life and education.\nFredric William Brown, the only child of Karl Lewis and Emma Amelia Brown (n\u00e9e Graham), was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 29, 1906 (and often wished he'd been born two days later, on Halloween); he found a sad, piquant pleasure in recalling that 1906 was the year of the San Francisco Earthquake and the Atlanta Race Riot. His father Karl Brown was born in 1871 in Oxford, Ohio, son of Waldo Franklin Brown (1832-1907), a nationally familiar progressive agricultural writer and lecturer who edited the farm pages of \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" and published articles under the name Johnny Plowboy. Karl was something of a get-rich-quick schemer, taking jobs in sales and secretarial correspondence, as well as serving as what one biographer calls \"accountant\u2014in the shady business enterprises of a substitute father figure, William P. Harrison, a pioneering if not overly scrupulous entrepreneur of direct mail marketing ... headquartered in Columbus and later, after Columbus had gotten too hot for him, Cincinnati.\" When Fred was little, Karl Brown was arrested for fraud and Harrison bailed him out. A few years later, Harrison was put on trial for further frauds which gained nationwide headlines and was imprisoned. Biographer Curtis Evans suggests that these childhood experiences led to the shady and downright corrupt figures who appear in Fredric's mystery novels.\nBrown attended Hughes High School, where he was (following his father) a member of the Commercial Club and the Salesmanship Club, among others. Fred spent a year at Hanover College, Indiana, before returning to Cincinnati. There, he studied for a semester at the University of Cincinnati. His mother died when he was a teenager; biographers say it is likely that he worked for his father, who died when he was 19. His uncle Linn is thought to have given him an allowance from the life insurance money.\nBrown was descended from Presbyterian families of Massachusetts and Vermont on his father's side, and from Scots-Irish in Pennsylvania on his mother's. His mother Emma was the daughter of a railroad mail clerk. His uncle was Linn Waldo Brown, a schoolteacher in Oxford, Ohio, whom Fredric often visited and would later name his second son after.\nCareer.\nDay jobs.\nIn 1929 he married and relocated to Milwaukee, working various jobs before settling into a career as a proofreader. Other work included writing for newspapers and magazines in the Midwest.\nWriting.\nDuane Swierczynski wrote, \"According to his wife, Brown hated to write, and did whatever he could to put it off: play his flute, challenge a friend to a game of chess, or tease Ming Tah, his Siamese cat.\" When Brown would have trouble with a certain story, he would take a long bus trip in order to sit and think for days on end. When he would finally return home to sit himself in front of the typewriter, he produced work in a variety of genres: mystery, science fiction, short fantasy, black comedy.\nMany of his books make use of the threat of the supernatural or occult before the \"straight\" explanation comes at the end. For example, \"Night of the Jabberwock\" is a humorous narrative of an extraordinary day in the life of a small-town newspaper editor.\nBrown began to sell mystery short stories to American magazines in 1936. His first science fiction story, \"Not Yet the End\", was published in the Winter 1941 issue of \"Captain Future\".\nBrown's first mystery novel, \"The Fabulous Clipjoint\" (1947), began a series starring Ed and Ambrose Hunter, depicting how a young man gradually ripens into a detective under the tutelage of his uncle, an ex\u2013private eye now working as a carnival concessionaire.\nHis science fiction novel \"What Mad Universe\" (1949) is a parody of pulp science fiction story conventions.\n\"The Lights in the Sky Are Stars\" (1952) tells the story of an aging astronaut who is trying to get his beloved space program back on track after Congress has cut its funding.\nThe short story \"Answer\" (1954) is thought to be the earliest representation of the \"Yes, \"now\" there is a God\" science fiction trope of a supercomputer that releases itself from human control. The story was originally published in \"Angels and Spaceships\" and the entire collection was later re-published as \"Star Shine\" for paperback adaptation\".\"\n\"Martians, Go Home\" (1955) is both a broad farce and a satire on human frailties as seen through the eyes of a billion jeering, invulnerable Martians who arrive not to conquer the world but to drive it crazy.\nPopularity and influence.\nAssessment by other authors.\nHis 1945 short story \"The Waveries\" was described by Philip K. Dick as \"what may be the most significant\u2014startlingly so\u2014story sci-fi has yet produced\". Brown was one of three dedicatees of Robert A. Heinlein's 1961 novel \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" (the other two being Robert Cornog and Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer). Philosopher and novelist Umberto Eco in his book \"On Ugliness\" describes Brown's short story \"Sentry\" as \"one of the finest short stories produced by contemporary science fiction\" and uses its twist ending as an example of how ugliness and aesthetics are relative to different cultures.\nIn \"The Annotated Alice\" (1960), Martin Gardner refers to Brown's \"Night of the Jabberwock\" as a \"magnificently funny mystery novel ... an outstanding work of fiction that has close ties to the \"Alice\" books.\"\nIn his non-fiction book \"Danse Macabre\" (1981), a survey of the horror genre since 1950, writer Stephen King includes an appendix of \"roughly one hundred\" influential books of the period: Fredric Brown's short-story collection \"Nightmares and Geezenstacks\" is included, and is, moreover, asterisked as being among those select works King regards as \"particularly important\".\nCritical reception.\nBrown's first mystery novel, \"The Fabulous Clipjoint\", won the Edgar Award for outstanding first mystery novel. His short story \"Arena\" was voted by Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the top 20 science fiction stories written before 1965.\nSeveral Brown works were selected by the New England Science Fiction Association for their 1997 \"NESFA Core Reading List of Fantasy and Science Fiction\", which is designed to introduce readers to the core works and authors responsible for shaping the genres of science fiction and fantasy:\nAdaptations.\nBrown's 1943 short story, \"Madman's Holiday\", was adapted into the 1946 RKO film \"Crack-Up\". His novel \"The Screaming Mimi\" became a 1958 film starring Anita Ekberg and Gypsy Rose Lee and directed by Gerd Oswald.\nThe 1944 short story \"Arena\" bore similarities to the episode of the same name in the series. The title is the same, although the details of the conflict are different. In order to avoid legal problems, it was agreed that Brown would receive payment and a story credit. It was also adapted in 1973 for issue 4 of the Marvel Comics title \"Worlds Unknown.\"\nBrown's 1950 short story \"The Last Martian\" was adapted as \"Human Interest Story\", a 1959 episode of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". Directed by Norman Lloyd, it starred Steve McQueen, Arthur Hill, Tyler McVey, and William Challee. Sharing elements with a great many of his stories, it is set in a bar and involves a newspaper reporter interviewing a man who claims to have been possessed by a Martian.\nIn Spain, his 1961 short story \"Nightmare in Yellow\" was adapted as \"El cumplea\u00f1os\" (\"The Birthday\"), the 1966 debut episode of \"Historias para no dormir\". Another short story, 1954's \"Naturally\", was adapted as \"Geometria\", a 1987 short film by director Guillermo del Toro.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the third episode of the third season of Amazon's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's \"The Man In The High Castle\", Oberstgruppenf\u00fchrer Smith remarks, when told of the possibility of travel between worlds, that \"this is like something out of Fredric Brown\", implying that Brown's work is known in the German-occupied areas of the former United States.\nHis novel \"The Lights in the Sky Are Stars\" gives its name to the final episode of 2007 anime \"Gurren Lagann\". It is also referred to in Taishi Tsutsui's manga \"We Never Learn\", at the end of Chapter 39.\nCelebrated crime novelist Lawrence Block published \"The Burglar Who Met Fredric Brown\" in 2022.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1929, Brown married Helen Ruth Brown, a woman he had known only through a series of letters they had exchanged by mail. In 1930 the couple moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They had two sons, James R. Brown of Culver City, California, and Linn L. Brown of Fremont, California.\nHis second wife was Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Charlier). \nBrown was an ardent atheist, like his father was, and his mother was an agnostic. In 1965, he published a biographical piece titled \"It's Only Everything,\" in which he recalls being eight or nine years old and attending a Presbyterian church. He prayed for the life of a dying relative, but when she died in pain, he decided \"that Christianity except for a part of its code of ethics was a mess of crap.\" \nA lifelong smoker, Brown developed emphysema in his 50s, and he died of it at the age of sixty-five in 1972.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called unbounded. The word \"bounded\" makes no sense in a general topological space without a corresponding metric.\n\"Boundary\" is a distinct concept; for example, a circle (not to be confused with a disk) in isolation is a boundaryless bounded set, while the half plane is unbounded yet has a boundary.\nA bounded set is not necessarily a closed set and vice versa. For example, a subset S of a 2-dimensional real space R2 constrained by two parabolic curves \"x\"2 + 1 and \"x\"2 \u2212 1 defined in a Cartesian coordinate system is closed by the curves but not bounded (so unbounded).\nDefinition in the real numbers.\nA set S of real numbers is called \"bounded from above\" if there exists some real number k (not necessarily in S) such that \"k\" \u2265 \" s\" for all s in S. The number k is called an upper bound of S. The terms \"bounded from below\" and lower bound are similarly defined.\nA set S is bounded if it has both upper and lower bounds. Therefore, a set of real numbers is bounded if it is contained in a finite interval.\nDefinition in a metric space.\nA subset S of a metric space (\"M\", \"d\") is bounded if there exists \"r\" &gt; 0 such that for all s and t in S, we have \"d\"(\"s\", \"t\") &lt; \"r\". The metric space (\"M\", \"d\") is a \"bounded\" metric space (or d is a \"bounded\" metric) if M is bounded as a subset of itself.\nBoundedness in topological vector spaces.\nIn topological vector spaces, a different definition for bounded sets exists which is sometimes called von Neumann boundedness. If the topology of the topological vector space is induced by a metric which is homogeneous, as in the case of a metric induced by the norm of normed vector spaces, then the two definitions coincide.\nBoundedness in order theory.\nA set of real numbers is bounded if and only if it has an upper and lower bound. This definition is extendable to subsets of any partially ordered set. Note that this more general concept of boundedness does not correspond to a notion of \"size\". \nA subset S of a partially ordered set P is called bounded above if there is an element k in P such that \"k\" \u2265 \"s\" for all s in S. The element k is called an upper bound of S. The concepts of bounded below and lower bound are defined similarly. (See also upper and lower bounds.)\nA subset S of a partially ordered set P is called bounded if it has both an upper and a lower bound, or equivalently, if it is contained in an interval. Note that this is not just a property of the set S but also one of the set S as subset of P.\nA bounded poset P (that is, by itself, not as subset) is one that has a least element and a greatest element. Note that this concept of boundedness has nothing to do with finite size, and that a subset S of a bounded poset P with as order the restriction of the order on P is not necessarily a bounded poset.\nA subset S of R\"n\" is bounded with respect to the Euclidean distance if and only if it bounded as subset of R\"n\" with the product order. However, S may be bounded as subset of R\"n\" with the lexicographical order, but not with respect to the Euclidean distance.\nA class of ordinal numbers is said to be unbounded, or cofinal, when given any ordinal, there is always some element of the class greater than it. Thus in this case \"unbounded\" does not mean unbounded by itself but unbounded as a subclass of the class of all ordinal numbers."}
{"id": "48260", "revid": "50966701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48260", "title": "Monotonic function", "text": "Order-preserving mathematical function\nIn mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory.\nIn calculus and analysis.\nIn calculus, a function formula_1 defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called \"monotonic\" if it is either entirely non-decreasing, or entirely non-increasing. That is, as per Fig. 1, a function that increases monotonically does not exclusively have to increase, it simply must not decrease.\nA function is termed \"monotonically increasing\" (also \"increasing\" or \"non-decreasing\") if for all formula_2 and formula_3 such that formula_4 one has formula_5, so formula_1 preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called \"monotonically decreasing\" (also \"decreasing\" or \"non-increasing\") if, whenever formula_4, then formula_8, so it \"reverses\" the order (see Figure 2).\nIf the order formula_9 in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order formula_10, one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called \"strictly increasing\" (also \"increasing\"). Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called \"strictly decreasing\" (also \"decreasing\"). A function with either property is called \"strictly monotone\". Functions that are strictly monotone are one-to-one (because for formula_2 not equal to formula_3, either formula_13 or formula_14 and so, by monotonicity, either formula_15 or formula_16, thus formula_17.\nTo avoid ambiguity, the terms \"weakly monotone\", \"weakly increasing\" and \"weakly decreasing\" are often used to refer to non-strict monotonicity.\nThe terms \"non-decreasing\" and \"non-increasing\" should not be confused with the (much weaker) negative qualifications \"not decreasing\" and \"not increasing\". For example, the non-monotonic function shown in figure 3 first falls, then rises, then falls again. It is therefore not decreasing and not increasing, but it is neither non-decreasing nor non-increasing.\nA function formula_1 is said to be \"absolutely monotonic\" over an interval formula_19 if the derivatives of all orders of formula_1 are nonnegative or all nonpositive at all points on the interval.\nInverse of function.\nAll strictly monotonic functions are invertible because they are guaranteed to have a one-to-one mapping from their range to their domain.\nHowever, functions that are only weakly monotone need not be invertible; they may be constant on some interval (and therefore not one-to-one).\nA function may be strictly monotonic over a limited a range of values and thus have an inverse on that range even though it is not strictly monotonic everywhere. For example, if formula_21 is strictly increasing on the range formula_22, then it has an inverse formula_23 on the range formula_24.\nThe term \"monotonic\" is sometimes used in place of \"strictly monotonic\", so a source may state that all monotonic functions are invertible when they really mean that all strictly monotonic functions are invertible.\nMonotonic transformation.\nThe term \"monotonic transformation\" (or \"monotone transformation\") may also cause confusion because it refers to a transformation by a strictly increasing function. This is the case in economics with respect to the ordinal properties of a utility function being preserved across a monotonic transform (see also monotone preferences). In this context, the term \"monotonic transformation\" refers to a positive monotonic transformation and is intended to distinguish it from a \"negative monotonic transformation,\" which reverses the order of the numbers.\nSome basic applications and results.\nThe following properties are true for a monotonic function formula_25:\nThese properties are the reason why monotonic functions are useful in technical work in analysis. Other important properties of these functions include:\nAn important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If formula_55 is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function formula_56 is a monotonically increasing function.\nA function is \"unimodal\" if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the \"mode\") and then monotonically decreasing.\nWhen formula_1 is a \"strictly monotonic\" function, then formula_1 is injective on its domain, and if formula_59 is the range of formula_1, then there is an inverse function on formula_59 for formula_1. In contrast, each constant function is monotonic, but not injective, and hence cannot have an inverse.\nThe graphic shows six monotonic functions. Their simplest forms are shown in the plot area and the expressions used to create them are shown on the \"y\"-axis.\nIn topology.\nA map formula_63 is said to be \"monotone\" if each of its fibers is connected; that is, for each element formula_64 the (possibly empty) set formula_65 is a connected subspace of formula_66\nIn functional analysis.\nIn functional analysis on a topological vector space formula_55, a (possibly non-linear) operator formula_68 is said to be a \"monotone operator\" if\nformula_69\nKachurovskii's theorem shows that convex functions on Banach spaces have monotonic operators as their derivatives.\nA subset formula_70 of formula_71 is said to be a \"monotone set\" if for every pair formula_72 and formula_73 in formula_70,\nformula_75\nformula_70 is said to be \"maximal monotone\" if it is maximal among all monotone sets in the sense of set inclusion. The graph of a monotone operator formula_77 is a monotone set. A monotone operator is said to be \"maximal monotone\" if its graph is a \"maximal monotone set\".\nIn order theory.\nOrder theory deals with arbitrary partially ordered sets and preordered sets as a generalization of real numbers. The above definition of monotonicity is relevant in these cases as well. However, the terms \"increasing\" and \"decreasing\" are avoided, since their conventional pictorial representation does not apply to orders that are not total. Furthermore, the strict relations formula_10 and formula_79 are of little use in many non-total orders and hence no additional terminology is introduced for them.\nLetting formula_9 denote the partial order relation of any partially ordered set, a \"monotone\" function, also called \"isotone\", or \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;order-preserving\", satisfies the property\nformula_81\nfor all x and y in its domain. The composite of two monotone mappings is also monotone.\nThe dual notion is often called \"antitone\", \"anti-monotone\", or \"order-reversing\". Hence, an antitone function f satisfies the property\nformula_82\nfor all x and y in its domain.\nA constant function is both monotone and antitone; conversely, if f is both monotone and antitone, and if the domain of f is a lattice, then f must be constant.\nMonotone functions are central in order theory. They appear in most articles on the subject and examples from special applications are found in these places. Some notable special monotone functions are order embeddings (functions for which formula_4 if and only if formula_84 and order isomorphisms (surjective order embeddings).\nIn the context of search algorithms.\nIn the context of search algorithms monotonicity (also called consistency) is a condition applied to heuristic functions. A heuristic formula_85 is monotonic if, for every node n and every successor n' of n generated by any action a, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n is no greater than the step cost of getting to n' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n',\nformula_86\nThis is a form of triangle inequality, with n, n', and the goal Gn closest to n. Because every monotonic heuristic is also admissible, monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility. Some heuristic algorithms such as A* can be proven optimal provided that the heuristic they use is monotonic.\nIn Boolean functions.\nIn Boolean algebra, a monotonic function is one such that for all a\"i\" and b\"i\" in {0,1}, if \"a\"1 \u2264 \"b\"1, \"a\"2 \u2264 \"b\"2, ..., \"a\"\"n\" \u2264 \"b\"\"n\" (i.e. the Cartesian product {0, 1}n is ordered coordinatewise), then f(\"a\"1, ..., \"a\"\"n\") \u2264 f(\"b\"1, ..., \"b\"\"n\"). In other words, a Boolean function is monotonic if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. Graphically, this means that an n-ary Boolean function is monotonic when its representation as an n-cube labelled with truth values has no upward edge from \"true\" to \"false\". (This labelled Hasse diagram is the dual of the function's labelled Venn diagram, which is the more common representation for \"n\" \u2264 3.)\nThe monotonic Boolean functions are precisely those that can be defined by an expression combining the inputs (which may appear more than once) using only the operators \"and\" and \"or\" (in particular \"not\" is forbidden). For instance \"at least two of a, b, c hold\" (the ternary majority function) is a monotonic function of a, b, c, since it can be written for instance as ((a and b) or (a and c) or (b and c)).\nThe number of such functions on n variables is known as the Dedekind number of n.\nSAT solving, generally an NP-hard task, can be achieved efficiently when all involved functions and predicates are monotonic and Boolean.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jonson's artistry exerted a lasting influence on English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the comedy of humours; he is best known for the satirical plays \"Every Man in His Humour\" (1598), \"Volpone, or The Fox\" (c.\u20091606), \"The Alchemist\" (1610) and \"Bartholomew Fair\" (1614) and for his lyric and epigrammatic poetry. He is regarded as \"the second most important English dramatist, after William Shakespeare, during the reign of James I.\"\nJonson was a classically educated, well-read and cultured man of the English Renaissance with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual). His cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the Jacobean era (1603\u20131625) and of the Caroline era (1625\u20131642).\nEarly life.\nJonson was born in June 1572\u2014possibly on the 11th\u2014in or near London. In midlife, Jonson said his paternal grandfather, who \"served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman\", was a member of the extended Johnston family of Annandale in Dumfries and Galloway, a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles (rhombi) in the Jonson family coat of arms: one spindle is a diamond-shaped heraldic device used by the Johnston family. His ancestors spelt the family name with a letter \"t\" (Johnstone or Johnstoun). While the spelling had eventually changed to the more common \"Johnson\", the playwright's own particular preference became \"Jonson\".\nJonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and, as a Protestant, suffered forfeiture under Queen Mary. Becoming a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth. His widow married a master bricklayer two years later. Jonson attended school in St Martin's Lane in London. Later, a family friend paid for his studies at Westminster School, where the antiquarian, historian, topographer and officer of arms William Camden was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and literary style remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623. At Westminster School he met the Welsh poet Hugh Holland, with whom he established an \"enduring relationship\". Both of them would write preliminary poems for William Shakespeare's First Folio (1623).\nOn leaving Westminster School in 1589, Jonson attended St John's College, Cambridge, to continue his book learning. However, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather, he returned after a month. According to the churchman and historian Thomas Fuller, Jonson at this time built a garden wall in Lincoln's Inn. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Jonson went to the Netherlands and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Sir Francis Vere in Flanders. England was allied with the Dutch in their fight for independence as well as the ongoing war with Spain.\nThe \"Hawthornden Manuscripts\" (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden, report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in single combat, and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier.\nJonson is reputed to have visited the antiquary Sir Robert Cotton at a residence of his in Chester early in the 17th century.\nAfter his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, he was the protagonist \"Hieronimo\" (Geronimo) in the play \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (c.\u20091586), by Thomas Kyd, the first revenge tragedy in English literature. By 1597, he was a working playwright employed by Philip Henslowe, the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of \"Every Man in His Humour\" (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist.\nJonson described his wife to William Drummond as \"a shrew, yet honest\". The identity of Jonson's wife is obscure, though she sometimes is identified as \"Ann Lewis\", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr, near London Bridge.\nThe registers of St Martin-in-the-Fields record that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. A decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of bubonic plague when he was seven years old, upon which Jonson wrote the elegiac \"On My First Sonne\" (1603). A second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635.\nDuring that period, Jonson and his wife lived separate lives for five years; Jonson enjoying the residential hospitality of his patrons, Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox and 7th Seigneur d'Aubigny and Sir Robert Townshend.\nCareer.\nBy summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the Admiral's Men, then performing under Philip Henslowe's management at The Rose. John Aubrey reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was more valuable to the company as a writer.\nBy this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by Francis Meres in his \"Palladis Tamia\" as one of \"the best for tragedy.\" None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, \"The Case is Altered\", may be his earliest surviving play.\nIn 1597, a play which he co-wrote with Thomas Nashe, \"The Isle of Dogs\", was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen Elizabeth I's so-called interrogator, Richard Topcliffe. Jonson was jailed in Marshalsea Prison and charged with \"Leude and mutynous behaviour\", while Nashe managed to escape to Great Yarmouth. Two of the actors, Gabriel Spenser and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in Newgate Prison, for killing Spenser in a duel on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields (today part of Hoxton). Tried on a charge of manslaughter, Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by benefit of clergy, a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief Bible verse (the neck-verse), forfeiting his \"goods and chattels\" and being branded with the so-called Tyburn T on his left thumb.\nWhile in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest.\nIn 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, \"Every Man in His Humour\", capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which George Chapman had begun with \"An Humorous Day's Mirth\". William Shakespeare was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with \"Every Man out of His Humour\", a pedantic attempt to imitate Aristophanes. It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.\nJonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of Elizabeth I's reign was marked by fighting and controversy. \"Cynthia's Revels\" was produced by the Children of the Chapel Royal at Blackfriars Theatre in 1600. It satirised both John Marston, who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in \"Histriomastix\", and Thomas Dekker. Jonson attacked the two poets again in \"Poetaster\" (1601). Dekker responded with \"Satiromastix\", subtitled \"the untrussing of the humorous poet\". The final scene of this play, while certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report \u2013 boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.\nThis \"War of the Theatres\" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a pageant welcoming James I to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated \"The Malcontent\" to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on \"Eastward Ho!\", a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.\nRoyal patronage.\nAt the beginning of the English reign of James VI and I in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for masques and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort Anne of Denmark. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as Elizabeth Sidney (daughter of Sir Philip Sidney) and Lady Mary Wroth. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the country house poem \"To Penshurst\".\nIn February 1603 John Manningham reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of Sir Roger Townshend, and \"scorns the world.\" Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the Privy Council about \"Sejanus\", a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. After the plot's discovery, he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator Robert Cecil and the Privy Council. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness.\nAt the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court. \"The Satyr\" (1603) and \"The Masque of Blackness\" (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at Apethorpe Palace when the King was in residence. \"The Masque of Blackness\" was praised by Algernon Charles Swinburne as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle. In July 1607, Jonson performed a poem at the great banquet given for the King by the Merchant Taylors' Company, for which he earned a fee of \u00a320.\nOn many of these projects, he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer Inigo Jones. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque \"Oberon, the Faery Prince\" performed at Whitehall on 1 January 1611 in which Prince Henry, eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.\nIn 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 marks (about \u00a360), leading some to identify him as England's first Poet Laureate. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio-collected edition of his works that year. Other volumes followed in 1640\u201341 and 1692. (See: Ben Jonson folios)\nOn 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the Great North Road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses. On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September. He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, William Drummond of Hawthornden, sited on the River Esk. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was \"a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others\".\nOn returning to England, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University.\nThe period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy \"Catiline\" (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success and the comedies \"Volpone\" (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), \"Epicoene, or the Silent Woman\" (1609), \"The Alchemist\" (1610), \"\" (1614) and \"The Devil Is an Ass\" (1616). \"The Alchemist\" and \"Volpone\" were immediately successful. Of \"Epicoene\", Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet \"Epicoene\", along with \"Bartholomew Fair\" and (to a lesser extent) \"The Devil Is an Ass\" have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.\nReligion.\nJonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous Protestant landowner until the reign of \"Bloody Mary\" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On Elizabeth's accession, he had been freed and had been able to travel to London to become a clergyman. (All that is known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to St Martin-in-the-Fields parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at Westminster School, then part of Westminster Abbey.\nNotwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to Catholicism. This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in Newgate Gaol charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England. Wright, although placed under house arrest on the orders of Lord Burghley, was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons. It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal absolution that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death. Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the Earl of Essex, was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch. Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.\nConviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play \"Sejanus His Fall\" was banned for \"popery\", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut. In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the Consistory Court in London to answer a charge of recusancy, with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to \"seduce\" citizens to the cause. This was a serious matter (the Gunpowder Plot was still fresh in people's minds) but he explained that his failure to take communion was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings (156 pence) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time\u2014indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, Queen Anne of Denmark, herself\u2014to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience. Leading church figures, including John Overall, Dean of St Paul's, were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted.\nIn May 1610 Henry IV of France was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England. He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of communion wine at the eucharist to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine. The exact date of the ceremony is unknown. However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death.\nDecline and death.\nJonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well-known. In that time, the Sons of Ben or the \"Tribe of Ben\", those younger poets such as Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, and Sir John Suckling who took their bearing in verse from Jonson, rose to prominence. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of Charles I's England. \"The Staple of News\", for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given to that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of \"The New Inn\"; the cold reception given to this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (\"An Ode to Himself\"), which in turn prompted Thomas Carew, one of the \"Tribe of Ben\", to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.\nThe principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of King Charles I in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to \u00a3100 and included a tierce of wine and beer.\nDespite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, \"The Sad Shepherd\". Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into pastoral drama. During the early 1630s, he also conducted a correspondence with James Howell, who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.\nAccording to a contemporary letter written by Edward Thelwall of Gray's Inn, Jonson died on 18 August 1637 (O.S. 6 August). He died in London. His funeral was held the next day. It was attended by \"all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town\". He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey, with the inscription \"O Rare Ben Johnson [\"sic\"]\" set in the slab over his grave. John Aubrey, in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of Great Milton, Oxfordshire, saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from William Davenant, Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist Leigh Hunt contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used. The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death, although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18\u00a0inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space.\nIt has been pointed out that the inscription could be read \"Orare Ben Jonson\" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of Catholic doctrine during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England); the carving shows a distinct space between \"O\" and \"rare\".\nA monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner. It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the English Civil War intervened.\nHis work.\nDrama.\nApart from two tragedies, \"Sejanus\" and \"\", that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for boy players, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poets' War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, the plot mostly takes second place to a variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. Thomas Davies called \"Poetaster\" \"a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of Augustus Caesar, Maecenas, Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Tibullus, are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment\". Another early comedy in a different vein, \"The Case is Altered\", is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.\nThe comedies of his middle career, from \"Eastward Hoe\" to \"The Devil Is an Ass\" are for the most part city comedy, with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to \"Volpone\" to \"mix profit with your pleasure\". His late plays or \"dotages\", particularly \"The Magnetic Lady\" and \"The Sad Shepherd\", exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of Elizabethan comedy.\nWithin this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the folio version of \"Every Man in His Humour\": he promises to represent \"deeds, and language, such as men do use\". He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory\u2014or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from Plautus and Terence, he intended to apply those premises with rigour. This commitment entailed negations: after \"The Case is Altered\", Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of new comedy. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and jealousy. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the farcical (as William Congreve, for example, judged \"Epicoene\"). He was more diligent in adhering to the classical unities than many of his peers\u2014although as Margaret Cavendish noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model, Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that \"The Alchemist\" had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.\nPoetry.\nJonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the humanist manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as Thomas Campion and Gabriel Harvey. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.\n\"Epigrams\" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson's epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, \"On My First Sonne\" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called \"lyric poetry.\" It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the sonnet form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of \"The Forest\" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem \"To Penshurst\" and the poem \"To Celia\" (\"Come, my Celia, let us prove\") that appears also in \"Volpone\".\n\"Underwood\", published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains \"A Celebration of Charis\", Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; encomiastic poems including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on Mary Wroth; the \"Execration against Vulcan\" and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).\nRelationship with Shakespeare.\nThere are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with Shakespeare. William Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in \"Julius Caesar\" and the setting of \"The Winter's Tale\" on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare \"wanted art\" (i.e., lacked skill).\nIn in \"Timber\", which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was \"Would he had blotted a thousand!\" However, Jonson explains, \"Hee was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature: had an excellent \"Phantsie\"; brave notions and gentle expressions: wherein hee flow'd with that facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stopp'd\". Jonson concludes that \"there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.\" When Shakespeare died, he said, \"He was not of an age, but for all time.\"\nThomas Fuller relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates at the Mermaid Tavern; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (\"Every Man in His Humour\" and \"Sejanus His Fall\") Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.\nJonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's First Folio. This poem, , did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite \"small Latine, and lesse Greeke\", had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the \"Sweet Swan of Avon\", the \"Soul of the Age!\" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the First Folio, and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.\nReception and influence.\nJonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as \"One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature\". Before the English Civil War, the \"Tribe of Ben\" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of \"humour characters\" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. John Aubrey wrote of Jonson in \"Brief Lives\". By 1700, Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.\nIn 2012, after more than two decades of research, Cambridge University Press published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years.\nDrama.\nAs G. E. Bentley notes in \"Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared\", Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the Restoration of Charles II, Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and Fletcher's, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among English Renaissance dramatists. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in \"Timber\", and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.\nFor some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and Samuel Butler drew the same comparison in his commonplace book later in the century.\nAt the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. Charles de Saint-\u00c9vremond placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and Charles Gildon called Jonson the father of English comedy. John Dryden offered a more common assessment in the \"Essay of Dramatic Poesie,\" in which his Avatar Neander compares Shakespeare to Homer and Jonson to Virgil: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But \"artifice\" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with \"art\"; Jonson, for instance, used \"artificer\" as a synonym for \"artist\" (\"Discoveries,\" 33). For Lewis Theobald, too, Jonson \"ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,\" in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. Nicholas Rowe, to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of \"Every Man in his Humour\" to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, Edward Young casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, Aphra Behn, writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from Sallust and Cicero, Augustan critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his aesthetic judgment.\nIn this period, Alexander Pope is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: \"It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Jonson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Jonson wanted both.\" For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, Sarah Fielding could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a \"man of sense\" encountered by David Simple.\nThough his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg translated parts of Peter Whalley's edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, Edward Capell offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) \"has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius.\" The disastrous failures of productions of \"Volpone\" and \"Epicoene\" in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as Earl Camden and William Gifford, he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.\nThe romantic revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's \"laborious caution.\" Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: \"He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.\" Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as Thomas Middleton or John Heywood, who were in some senses \"discoveries\" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; William Gifford, Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, Swinburne, who was more interested in Jonson than most Victorians, wrote, \"The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance\" \u2013 by \"fragrance,\" Swinburne means spontaneity.\nIn the 20th century, Jonson's body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in \"The Sacred Wood\", T. S. Eliot attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his \"surface\", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by E. E. Stoll and M. C. Bradbrook, provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.\nThe proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived sociopolitical criticism. Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of patronage and in the rising culture of mass media.\nPoetry.\nJonson has been called \"the first poet laureate\". If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of John Donne. In this comparison, Jonson represents the cavalier strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the metaphysical school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, baroque metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison (Herbert Grierson for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.\nIn his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian Edmund Bolton named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the \"father\" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his \"sons\" or his \"tribe\". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; Herrick described meetings at \"the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne\". All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of wit. In these respects, Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English neoclassicism.\nThe best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: \"On My First Sonne\"; \"To Celia\"; \"To Penshurst\"; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.\nJonson's works.\nOther works.\nIt is in Jonson's \"Timber, or Discoveries...\" that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man\u2019s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it.\u2014\u200a\nAs with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to \"The Isle of Dogs\" (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: \"Richard Crookback\" (1602); \"Hot Anger Soon Cold\" (1598), with Porter and Henry Chettle; \"Page of Plymouth\" (1599), with Dekker; and \"Robert II, King of Scots\" (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: \"The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors\" (1607); \"The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I\" (1608); and \"The May Lord\" (1613\u201319).\nFinally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in \"Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother\", a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy \"The Widow\" was printed in 1652 as the work of Thomas Middleton, Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as \"The London Prodigal\", have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.\nIn fiction.\nBen Johnson features as a character in Jean Findlay's historical novel, \"The Queen's Lender\" (2022).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He began his writing career as a journalist but from 1934 produced a series of best-selling novels for adults and children. The most successful was \"Fame Is the Spur\" (1940), which was later adapted into a film starring Michael Redgrave, and later still a BBC TV series (1982) starring Tim Pigott-Smith and David Hayman.\nBiography.\nHoward Spring was born in Cardiff, the son of a jobbing gardener. He was forced to leave school at the age of twelve, when his father died, to start work as an errand boy. He later became an office boy at a firm of chartered accountants in Cardiff Docks and then a messenger at the offices of the \"South Wales Daily News\". He was keen to train as a reporter, and spent his leisure time learning shorthand and taking evening classes at Cardiff University, where he studied English, French, Latin, mathematics and history. He graduated to be a reporter on both the morning and evening editions of the \"South Wales Daily News\".\nIn 1911 he joined the \"Yorkshire Observer\" in Bradford before moving in 1915 to the \"Manchester Guardian\", but was there only a few months before he was called up for the Royal Army Service Corps as a shorthand typist.\nAfter the war, he returned to the \"Guardian\", where he worked as a reporter. C. P. Scott, the editor, apparently regarded Spring's reporting skills highly; he wrote of Spring that: \"Nobody does a better 'descriptive' or a better condensation of a difficult address.\" Whilst working for the \"Guardian\", Spring lived in the suburb of Didsbury. In 1931, after reporting on a political meeting at which Lord Beaverbrook was the speaker, Beaverbrook was so impressed by Spring's piece (Spring described Beaverbrook as \"a pedlar of dreams\", which took Beaverbrook's fancy) that he arranged for him to be offered a post with the \"Evening Standard\" in London as a book reviewer. Spring described the offer as \"irresistible\", and the appointment proved successful.\nAt the same time, Spring was developing his ambitions as a writer; his first book, \"Darkie and Co.\", a children's story, came out in 1932, followed by his first novel, \"Shabby Tiger\", which was set in Manchester, published by William Collins, Sons in 1934. \"Shabby Tiger\" was adapted as a television series of the same title produced by Granada Television in 1973. It starred John Nolan as Nick and Prunella Gee as Anna, with Sharon Maughan making her TV debut as the glamorous and ambitious Rachel Rosing. A sequel to the novel followed a year later, \"Rachel Rosing\" (Collins, 1935). Both were published in the US in 1936.\nThe children's story \"Sampson's Circus\", illustrated by Steven Spurrier and published by Faber &amp; Faber in 1936, was one of two commended runners up for the Library Association's inaugural Carnegie Medal, recognising the year's outstanding contribution to children's literature by a British subject.\nHis first major success in the adult market came with \"My Son, My Son\" (1937), originally titled \"O Absalom\". It gained success in America, listed as a national fiction best seller in \"The English Journal\" for eight consecutive months, starting in July 1948. The novel was adapted as the American 1940 film \"My Son, My Son!\" and later made for television by the BBC in 1977. WorldCat libraries report editions in Chinese, German, Hebrew and four other languages.\nIn 1939 Spring moved to Mylor in Cornwall to become a full-time writer. (His wife Marion's father had a house at St Mawes.) In 1940, his best-known work appeared: \"Fame Is the Spur\", the story of a Labour leader's rise to power. During the war years Spring wrote two other novels, \"Hard Facts\" (1944) and \"Dunkerley's\" (1946).\nIn 1947 Spring and his wife moved to Falmouth, The White Cottage in Fenwick Road, and in the post-war period he published \"There Is No Armour\" (1948), \"The Houses in Between\" (1951), \"A Sunset Touch\" (1953), \"These Lovers Fled Away\" (1955), \"Time and the Hour\" (1957), \"All the Day Long \" (1959), \"I Met a Lady\" (1961), and his last book was \"Winds of the Day\" (1964). Spring also produced three volumes of autobiography: \"Heaven Lies About Us, A Fragment of Infancy\" (1939); \"In the Meantime\" (1942); and \"And Another Thing\" (1946), later published in one volume as \"The Autobiography of Howard Spring\" (Collins, 1972).\nDuring this period Spring served eight years as President of the prestigious Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society and as a Director of the Falmouth School of Art and President of the Cornish Drama League. The last was well known for producing plays at the open-air Minack Theatre on the cliffs near Land's End.\nSpring was a successful writer, who combined a wide understanding of human character with technical skill as a novelist. His method of composition was painstaking. Each morning he would shut himself in his room and write a thousand words, steadily building up to novels of around 150,000 words. He rarely made major alterations to his writings.\nHoward Spring died of a stroke. In 1967, his widow, Marion Spring, wrote an affectionate story of their life together, called \"Howard\", with a foreword by A. L. Rowse. It was published by Collins.\nWorks.\nSource:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a center of controversy for his views on homosexuality, which brought him into open conflict with the Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn.\nBiography.\nHe was born in Bni Mansour. In Morocco he was banned several times for speaking about \"injustice\" in society.\nOn 3 May 2001, he appeared on the Dutch television program \"Nova\" to discuss the rising incidence of anti-homosexual violence by Moroccan youths. He said that \"if the sickness of homosexuality spreads itself, everyone can become infected\". \"That's what we are afraid of... Who will still make children if men marry among themselves and women too?\".\nLater, various sources reported statements from sermons of his that were published in Arabic in 1998. He said: \"The western civilisation is a civilisation without morals. In the Netherlands it is permitted for homosexuals to marry each other. The Europeans stand lower than dogs and pigs\".\nForty-nine individuals and organizations filed official complaints about his statements on the Nova program, under Dutch anti-discrimination laws. However a drawn-out period of reconciliation followed, involving supporters of el-Moumni, Dutch politicians, homosexuals and religious groups, in which he was gradually moved to apologize. He said that some of the Arabic statements were mistranslated.\nIn December 2001, the justice ministry decided to prosecute him anyway. On 4 April 2002 a court in Rotterdam announced its verdict: although in principle his statements had been discriminatory against homosexuals, they were permitted on grounds of freedom of religious expression, since they were based on the Qur'an and other Muslim documents. The justice ministry appealed the decision but lost again on 18 November 2002.\nJust before reaching the age of 65, el-Moumni ended his 46-year career with a last service in the An-Nasr Mosque on 23 June 2006. In this service el-Moumni called on believers to use the mosque not only for prayer, but also for civil activities.\nOn 21 November 2020, el-Moumni died from COVID-19 at the age of 79."}

It lies on the River Stour. The city has a mild oceanic climate.\nCanterbury is a popular tourist destination, with the city's economy heavily reliant upon tourism, alongside higher education and retail. As of 2011, the city's population was over 55,000, including a substantial number of students and one of the highest student-to-permanent-resident ratios in Britain.\nThe site of the city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the Celtic Cantiaci and Jute Kingdom of Kent. Many historical structures fill the area, including a city wall founded in Roman times and rebuilt in the 14th century, the Westgate Towers museum, the ruins of St Augustine's Abbey, the Norman Canterbury Castle, and the oldest extant school in the world, the King's School. Modern additions include the Marlowe Theatre and Kent County Cricket Club's St Lawrence Ground. Canterbury Cathedral is known for its architecture, its music, and for being the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury; it receives a million visitors per year.\nToponymy.\nThe Roman settlement of \"Durovernum Cantiacorum\" (\"Kentish Durovernum\") occupied the location of an earlier British town whose ancient British name has been reconstructed as *\"Durou\u032fernon\" (\"stronghold by the alder grove\"), although the name is sometimes supposed to have derived from various British names for the Stour. Medieval variants of the Roman name include \"Dorobernia\" and \"Dorovernia\". In Sub-Roman Britain, it was known in Old Welsh as \"Cair Ceint\" (\"stronghold of Kent\"). Occupied by the Jutes, it became known in Old English as \"Cantwareburh\" (\"stronghold of the Kentish men\").\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Canterbury area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Lower Paleolithic axes, and Neolithic and Bronze Age pots have been found in the area. Canterbury was first recorded as the main settlement of the Celtic tribe of the Cantiaci, which inhabited most of modern-day Kent. In the 1st century AD, the Romans captured the settlement and named it Durovernum Cantiacorum. The Romans rebuilt the city, with new streets in a grid pattern, a theatre, a temple, a forum, and public baths. Although they did not maintain a major military garrison, its position on Watling Street relative to the major Kentish ports of Rutupiae (Richborough), Dubrae (Dover), and Lemanae (Lymne) gave it considerable strategic importance. In the late 3rd century, to defend against attack from barbarians, the Romans built an earth bank around the city and a wall with seven gates, which enclosed an area of .\nDespite being counted as one of the 28 cities of Sub-Roman Britain, it seems that after the Romans left Britain in 410 Durovernum Cantiacorum was abandoned for around 100 years, except by a few farmers and gradually decayed. Over the next 100\u00a0years, an Anglo-Saxon community formed within the city walls, as Jutish refugees arrived, possibly intermarrying with the locals. The town's new importance led to its revival, and trades developed in pottery, textiles, and leather. By 630, gold coins were being struck at the Canterbury mint. In 842 and 851, Canterbury suffered great loss of life during Danish raids. \n11th\u201316th centuries.\nThe siege of Canterbury saw a large Viking army besiege Canterbury in 1011, culminating in the city being pillaged. Remembering the destruction caused by the Danes, the inhabitants of Canterbury did not resist William the Conqueror's invasion in 1066. William immediately ordered a wooden motte-and-bailey castle to be built by the Roman city wall. In the early 12th century, the castle was rebuilt with stone. Canterbury Castle was captured by the French Prince Louis during his 1215 invasion of England, before the death of John caused his English supporters to desert his cause and support the young Henry III.\nBlack Death reached Canterbury in 1348. At 10,000, Canterbury had the 10th largest population in England; by the early 16th century, the population had fallen to 3,000. In 1363, during the Hundred Years' War, a Commission of Inquiry found disrepair, stone-robbing and ditch-filling had led to the Roman wall becoming eroded. Between 1378 and 1402, the wall was virtually rebuilt, and new wall towers were added. In 1381, during Wat Tyler's Peasants' Revolt, the castle and Archbishop's Palace were sacked, and Archbishop Sudbury was beheaded in London. In 1413, Henry IV became the only sovereign to be buried at the cathedral. In 1448 Canterbury was granted a city charter, which gave it a mayor and a high sheriff; the city still has a Lord Mayor and Sheriff.\nIn 1519 a public cage for talkative women and other wrongdoers was set up next to the town's pillory at the Bullstake, now the Buttermarket. In 1522 a stone cross with gilt lead stars was erected at the same place, and painted with bice and gilded by Florence the painter.\nHistory of Huguenot refugees.\nIn the mid-16th century many Huguenots, experiencing persecution and conflict in the Low Countries, fled and resettled in Reformed regions such as England. Canterbury hosted the first congregation of so-called 'refugee strangers' in the country. This first Huguenot church in Canterbury was founded around 1548, in part by Jan Utenhove who relocated from Strasbourg, alongside Val\u00e9rand Poullain and Fran\u00e7ois de la Rivi\u00e8re. When Utenhove travelled to London in 1549, Francois de la Rivi\u00e8re remained to lead the congregation. With the accession of Mary I, the Huguenot residents of Canterbury were compelled to flee in 1553\u20134 alongside the English Marian exiles to Emden, Wesel, Z\u00fcrich, Strasbourg, Frankfurt, and later Basel, Geneva, and Aarau.\nAfter the accession of Elizabeth I, a small number of Huguenots returned to London, including Jan Utenhove in 1559. In 1561, a number of Huguenots in London were sent to Sandwich, a settlement which began to grow rapidly with new refugees arriving from Artois and Flanders. This settlement, in June 1575, almost entirely relocated to Canterbury, which had in the previous year gained a small Huguenot population. A number of refugees also arrived around this time from the temporary Huguenot settlements at Rye and Winchelsea. In 1575, the Huguenot population of Canterbury were granted use of the church of St Alphedge but in the following year had begun to use the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral as their church. The Church of the Crypt swiftly became the nucleus of the Huguenot community in Canterbury. \nBy the 17th century, French-speaking Huguenots comprised two-fifths of Canterbury's population. The Huguenots had a large influence on the economy of Canterbury, and introduced silk weaving into the city which had outstripped wool weaving by 1676. \n17th century\u2013present.\nCanterbury remained an important city in the 17th century. Charles I and Henrietta Maria visited in 1625; musicians played whilst the couple entered the city under a velvet canopy supported by six men holding poles. In 1647, during the English Civil War, riots broke out. The riots became known as the \"Plum Pudding Riots\". The rioters' trial the following year led to a Kent revolt against Parliamentarian forces, contributing to the start of the second phase of the war. However, Canterbury surrendered peacefully to Parliamentarians at the Battle of Maidstone.\nBy 1770, the castle had fallen into disrepair, and many parts of it were demolished during the late 18th century and early 19th century. In 1787 all the gates in the city wall, except for Westgate\u2014the city jail\u2014were demolished as a result of a commission that found them impeding to new coach travel. Canterbury Prison opened in 1808 just outside the city boundary. By 1820 the silk weaving in the city had been supplanted by imported Indian muslins and trade carried out was thereafter largely of hops and wheat. The Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway (The Crab and Winkle Way), the world's first passenger railway, was opened in 1830; bankrupt by 1844, it was purchased by the South Eastern Railway, which connected the city to its larger network in 1846. The London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway arrived in 1860; the competition and cost-cutting between the lines was resolved by merging them as the South Eastern &amp; Chatham in 1899. Between 1830 and 1900, the city's population grew from 15,000 to 24,000.\nDuring the First World War, barracks and voluntary hospitals were set up around the city. In 1917 a German bomber crash-landed near Broad Oak Road. Mahatma Gandhi visited Canterbury in October 1931.\nDuring the Second World War, 10,445 bombs dropped during 135 separate raids destroyed 731 homes and 296 other buildings in the city, including the missionary college and Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School. 119 civilian people died through enemy action in the borough. The most devastating raid was on 1 June 1942 during the Baedeker Blitz. Before the end of the war, the architect Charles Holden drew up plans to redevelop the city centre, but locals were so opposed that the Citizens' Defence Association was formed; it swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections. Rebuilding of the city centre eventually began 10 years after the war. A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre, which was later pedestrianised. The biggest expansion of the city occurred in the 1960s, with the arrival of the University of Kent at Canterbury and Christ Church College.\nThe 1980s saw visits from Queen Elizabeth II, and the beginning of the annual Canterbury Festival. Between 1999 and 2005, the Whitefriars Shopping Centre underwent major redevelopment. In 2000, during the redevelopment, a major archaeological project was undertaken by the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, known as the Big Dig, which was supported by Channel Four's \"Time Team\".\nGeography.\nClimate.\nCanterbury experiences an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfb\"), similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. Canterbury enjoys mild temperatures all year round, being between 1.8\u00a0\u00b0C (35.2\u00a0\u00b0F) and 22.8\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F). There is relatively little rainfall throughout the year.\nDemographics.\nThe 2021 United Kingdom census showed a population of 55,087. Ethnically, the city was 78.3% white, 8.2% Asian, 5.9% Black, 4.4% Mixed, 1% Arab and 2.1% Other groups.\nAt the 2001 UK census, the total population of the city itself was 43,432, and 135,278 within the Canterbury district. In 2011, the total district population was counted as 151,200, with an 11.7% increase from 2001, and the population of the city had grown to over 55,000. By 2015, Canterbury's student population, including the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University, and the smaller University for the Creative Arts, was almost 40,000.\nPhysical.\nCanterbury is in east Kent, about east-southeast of London. The coastal towns of Herne Bay and Whitstable are to the north, and Faversham is to the northwest. The city is on the River Stour or Great Stour. The river is navigable on the tidal section to Fordwich, although above this point canoes and other small craft can be used. The geology of the area consists mainly of brickearth overlying chalk. Tertiary sands overlain by London clay form St. Thomas's Hill and St. Stephen's Hill about a mile northwest of the city centre.\nCanterbury is a medieval city, with Canterbury Cathedral inside the ring of the city walls, forming the historic centre. Of the defensive structures, a section of the medieval walls remains to the south, near Canterbury Castle, while to the northwest, the Westgate survives as the Westgate Towers museum. Immediately outside the Westgate is the River Stour which crosses the city from southwest to northeast. A road runs straight across the city from the Westgate, forming the High Street (including St George's Street) and part of the North Downs Way. St Augustine's Abbey lies just outside the city walls.\nPolitical.\nThe city became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the city came under the control of Kent County Council. Canterbury, along with Whitstable and Herne Bay, is now in the City of Canterbury local government district. The city's urban area consists of the six electoral wards of Barton, Blean Forest, Northgate, St Stephens, Westgate, and Wincheap. These wards have eleven of the fifty seats on the Canterbury City Council, which governs the city.\nThe former Holy Cross Church building was officially re-opened by the Prince of Wales as the new Canterbury Guildhall and meeting place of the City Council on 9 November 1978.\nThe Member of Parliament for the Canterbury constituency, which includes Whitstable, is Rosie Duffield formerly of the Labour Party but now sits as an independent.\nEconomic.\nCanterbury district retained approximately 4,761\u00a0businesses, up to 60,000\u00a0full and part-time employees and was worth \u00a31.3\u00a0billion in 2001. This made the district the second largest economy in Kent. Today, the three primary sectors are tourism, higher education and retail.\nIn 2015, the value of tourism to the city of Canterbury was over \u00a3450 million; 7.2 million people visited that year, making it one of the most-visited cities in England. A full 9,378 jobs were supported by tourism, an increase of 6% over the previous year. The two universities provided an even greater benefit. In 2014/2015, the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University were worth \u00a3909m to city's economy and accounted for 16% of all jobs.\nUnemployment in the city dropped 0.6 percentage points to 1.7% from 2001 to 2007. The registered unemployment rate as of September 2011 stood at 5.7%. By May 2018, the rate had dropped to 1.8%; in fact, Kent in general had a moderate unemployment rate of 2%. This data considers only people claiming either Jobseekers Allowance or Universal Credit principally for the reason of being unemployed. It does not include those without access to such benefits. At the time, the national rate was 4.2%.\nA report in 2023 by the Poverty Working Group of the Canterbury Sustainable Development Goals Forum evidenced increasing poverty in the city using, for example, life expectancy figures and the number of meals provided by the city food banks, as well as interviews with organisations and individuals attempting to help those in danger of and in poverty. This supports earlier findings on poverty in the city.\nCulture.\nLandmarks.\nThe 17th century, double jettied, half-timbered Crooked House bookshop operated by the Catching Lives homelessness charity at the end of Palace Street, opposite Kings School is frequently photographed for its quirky, slanted appearance. Canterbury Roman Museum houses an \"in situ\" mosaic pavement dating from around 300 AD. Other surviving Roman structures in the city include Queningate, a blocked gate in the city wall, and the Dane John Mound, once part of a Roman cemetery. The Dane John Gardens were built beside the mound in the 18th century, and a memorial placed on the mound's summit.\nWestgate Towers is a museum narrating its earlier use as a jail. The medieval church of St Alphege is as of 2022[ [update]] used by the King's School. The Old Synagogue, now the King's School Music Room, is one of only two Egyptian Revival synagogues still standing. The city centre contains many timber-framed 16th and 17th century houses but others were destroyed, particularly in the Second World War Baedeker Blitz. Survivors include the Huguenot \"Old Weaver's House\". St Martin's Mill is the only surviving mill out of the six known to have stood in Canterbury. It was built in 1817 and worked until 1890 but is now a residence.\nTheatres.\nThe Marlowe Theatre is named after Christopher Marlowe, who was born in the city. It was formerly located in St Margaret's Street but moved to the present location in 1984. It was completely rebuilt in 2011 with a main 1,200-seat auditorium and secondary performance space. Its modern structure is a landmark across the city.\nThe University of Kent's Gulbenkian Theatre serves the city, and incorporates a cinema and caf\u00e9. Other theatrical performances take place at Canterbury Cathedral and St Augustine's Abbey. The oldest surviving theatre building in Canterbury is The Shakespeare bar which had been a playhouse in the Tudor period. Theatre companies in Canterbury include The Canterbury Players.\nMusic.\nIn common with many English towns and cities in the Middle Ages, Canterbury employed a band of waits. There are records of payments to the waits from 1402, though they probably existed earlier. The waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile. Civic waits were ultimately abolished nationally by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 but a modern, early music group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.\nCanterbury's Catch Club was a musical and social club which met in the city between 1779 and 1865. Its male club members met weekly in the winter and employed an orchestra to assist in performances for the first half of their evening. After an interval, the members sang catches and glees from the club's extensive music library which is now deposited at Canterbury Cathedral's archives.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s the Canterbury Scene emerged comprising progressive rock, avant-garde and jazz musicians established within the city. Members included Soft Machine, Caravan, Matching Mole, Egg, Hatfield and the North, National Health, Gilgamesh, Soft Heap, Khan and In Cahoots. Ian Dury, front man of 1970s rock band Ian Dury and the Blockheads, taught Fine Art at Canterbury College of Art and early incarnations of his band Kilburn and the High Roads performed in the city. Canterbury Choral Society give regular concerts in Canterbury Cathedral, typically large-scale classical choral works. The Canterbury Orchestra, founded in 1953, perform major works from the symphonic repertoire. Other local musical groups include the Canterbury Singers, founded in 1953; Cantemus; and the City of Canterbury Chamber Choir.\nThe Canterbury Festival takes place over two weeks in October including musical events ranging from opera and symphony concerts to world music, jazz and folk. From 2006 to 2015 the July Lounge On The Farm music festival presented rock, indie and dance artists near Canterbury.\nSport.\nCricket\nCanterbury is the home of Kent County Cricket Club, with the St Lawrence Ground hosting many of the team's matches. It has also been used for several One Day Internationals, including an England match during the 1999 Cricket World Cup.\nThe St Lawrence Ground is notable for being one of only two grounds used regularly for first-class cricket that have had a tree within the boundary, the other being the City Oval in Pietermaritzburg.\nAmerican Football\nThere have been multiple American football teams based in Canterbury since the game was popularised in the UK. Currently, the city is the home of the East Kent Mavericks, 2023 BAFA National Leagues Southern Football Conference 2 Champions, as well as teams from both universities.\nFootball\nCanterbury City F.C. reformed in 2007 as a community interest company and currently compete in the Southern Counties East Football League. The previous incarnation of the club folded in 2001.\nRugby\nCanterbury RFC were founded in 1926 and became the first East Kent club to achieve National League status and currently play in the fourth tier, National League 2 South.\nTour de France\nThe cycling Tour de France passed through the city in 1994, and again in 2007 when it hosted the finish for Stage 1. \nHockey\nCanterbury Hockey Club is one of the largest in the country; it enters teams in both the Men's and Women's England Hockey Leagues. Former Olympic gold medal winner Sean Kerly has been a member.\nPublic Facilities\nPublic sporting facilities are provided at Kingsmead Leisure Centre, including a swimming pool and sports hall for football, basketball, and badminton.\nEducation.\nUniversities.\nCanterbury hosts some 31,000 students and has the highest student to permanent resident ratio in the UK. They attend three universities, and other higher education institutions. The University of Kent's main campus extends to and is situated on Saint Stephen's Hill, a mile north of Canterbury city centre. In 2014, it enrolled around 20,000 students. Canterbury Christ Church University was founded as a teacher training college in 1962 by the Church of England; in 2005 it became a university. In 2024, it had around 30,000 students. The Franciscan International Study Centre is close to the University of Kent campus.\nSchools.\nKing's School is the oldest secondary school in the United Kingdom. St. Augustine established it shortly after his 597 arrival in Canterbury though documented history of it only began after dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century, when it took the present name in honour of Henry VIII.\nThe city's secondary grammar schools are Barton Court Grammar School, Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys and Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School, all of which in 2008 had over 93% of their pupils gain five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C including English and maths.\nTransport.\nRail.\nThe pioneering Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway, known locally as the \"Crab and Winkle line\", had a terminus at North Lane station. It ran from 3 May 1830 to 1953 and was the first regular passenger steam railway in the world. Canterbury South railway station was sited on the Elham Valley Railway. The station opened in 1889 and closed, along with the rest of the railway, in 1947.\nCanterbury West railway station is operated by Southeastern. \nCanterbury East railway station, (Canterbury's other station) is also operated by Southeastern. There is no direct interchange between Canterbury West and Canterbury East stations because the two railways into the city were built by rival companies. Canterbury Parkway railway station has been proposed as an additional station outside of the city, with links to both lines.\nBus.\nStagecoach run local bus routes in Canterbury, as well as long-distance services. Its bio fuel 'Unibus' service operates between the city centre and University of Kent. Canterbury has three operational park and ride sites at Wincheap and New Dover Road, intended for visitors arriving from the south by road, and at Sturry Road, intended for visitors arriving from the east by road.\nCycling.\nNational Cycle Routes 1 runs through Canterbury from Dover and Sandwich to Whitstable. National Cycle Route 18 runs from Canterbury to Ashford.\nLocal media.\nNewspapers.\nCanterbury's first newspaper was the \"Kentish Post\", founded in 1717. It merged with newly founded \"Kentish Gazette\" in 1768 which is still being published, claiming to be the country's second oldest surviving newspaper. It is currently produced as a paid-for newspaper by KM Group in Whitstable with a 25,000 circulation across East Kent.\nThree free weekly newspapers provide local news. The Daily Mail and General Trust's \"Canterbury Times\" has a circulation of 55,000. Similar circulation \"Canterbury Extra\" is owned by KM Group. \"yourcanterbury\" is published by KOS Media, which also prints Kent on Sunday.\nRadio.\nLocal radio stations are BBC Radio Kent on 104.2FM, Heart South on 102.8FM and KMFM Canterbury on 106FM. KMFM Canterbury was formerly KMFM106, and from foundation in 1997 until KM Group took control CTFM, a reference to Canterbury's CT postcode. KMFM's studio moved from the city to Ashford in 2008. Canterbury Hospital Radio serves Kent and Canterbury Hospital, and SBSLive's coverage is limited to the Simon Langton Boys School grounds.\nFrom 2007 to 2020 Canterbury was also served by the country's first student led community radio station CSR 97.4FM. CSR means \"Canterbury Student Radio\" but it was a radio station catering to the students of the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University, other educational establishments and the wider community being a collaboration of the two university's and broadcasting from studios at both. It replaced the student radio stations that served both university's being UKCR and C4 Radio respectively. In 2020 due to the COVID pandemic the station management decided to hand back the FM licence to OFCOM due to rising costs and has been broadcasting online since. There are plans for CSR to go on the recently awarded digital radio multiplex when it launches in the near future.\nTelevision.\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian from the Dover TV transmitter.\nNotable people.\nComposer Orlando Gibbons (1583\u20131625) died in Canterbury and is commemorated by a marble bust and memorial tablet in the cathedral.\nThe grave of author Joseph Conrad, in Canterbury Cemetery, is a Grade II listed building.\nOther people connected with Canterbury include:\nInternational relations.\nCanterbury is twinned with the following cities:\nReligion.\nIn 597, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine to convert its King \u00c6thelberht to Christianity. After the conversion, Canterbury, being a Roman town, was chosen by Augustine as the centre for his episcopal see in Kent, and an abbey and cathedral were built. Augustine thus became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. In 672, the Synod of Hertford gave the see of Canterbury authority over the entire English Church. In 978, Archbishop Dunstan refounded the abbey built by Augustine, and named it St Augustine's Abbey. In 1504 the cathedral's main tower, the Bell Harry Tower, was completed, ending 400\u00a0years of building. Cardinal Wolsey visited in June 1518 and was given a present of fruit, nuts, and marchpane. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the city's priory, nunnery and three friaries were closed. St Augustine's Abbey, the 14th richest in England at the time, was surrendered to the Crown, and its church and cloister were levelled. The rest of the abbey was dismantled over the next 15\u00a0years, although part of the site was converted to a palace.\nAfter the murder of the Archbishop Thomas Becket at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury became one of the most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine. This pilgrimage provided the framework for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century collection of stories, \"The Canterbury Tales\". Thomas Becket's shrine in the cathedral was demolished in 1538 by King Henry VIII, all the gold, silver, and jewels were removed to the Tower of London, and Becket's images, name and feasts were obliterated throughout the kingdom, ending the pilgrimages. In 1620, Robert Cushman negotiated the lease of the \"Mayflower\" at 59 Palace Street for the purpose of transporting the Pilgrims to America. In 1647, during the English Civil War, riots broke out when Canterbury's puritan mayor banned church services on Christmas Day. In 1848, St Augustine's Abbey was refurbished for use as a missionary college for the Church of England's representatives in the British colonies. The extensive restoration of the cathedral that was underway in mid 2018 was part of a 2016\u20132021 schedule that includes replacement of the nave roof, improved landscaping and accessibility, new visitor facilities and a general external restoration. The so-called Canterbury Journey project was expected to cost nearly \u00a325 million.\nCanterbury Cathedral is Mother Church of the Anglican Communion and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Founded in 597\u00a0AD by Augustine, it forms a World Heritage Site, along with Saxon St. Martin's Church and the ruins of St Augustine's Abbey. The cathedral receives a million visitors annually and is one of the most visited places in the country. Services are held three or more times a day.\nSt Thomas of Canterbury Church is the only Roman Catholic church in the city and contains relics of Thomas Becket.\nIn popular culture.\nChaucer\u2019s text became the inspiration for the 1944 British film, \"A Canterbury Tale\" by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starring Eric Portman, Sheila Sim, Dennis Price and Sgt. John Sweet, filmed in the city in the aftermath of the destruction caused by German bombing during World War Two.\nIn more recent popular culture, Canterbury appeared in Russell Hoban\u2019s 1980 post apocalyptic novel \"Riddley Walker,\" renamed \"Cambry\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48276", "revid": "26937909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48276", "title": "History of Palestinian statehood", "text": "The idea of establishing a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has evolved through various proposals and disputes. During the British mandate period, numerous territorial and constitutional models were proposed for Palestine, none of them winning the agreement of all parties. In 1947, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was voted for. The leaders of the Jewish Agency for Palestine accepted parts of the plan, while Arab leaders refused it. This triggered the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war and led, in 1948, to the establishment of the state of Israel on a part of Mandate Palestine as the Mandate came to an end.\nThe Gaza Strip came under Egyptian occupation, and the West Bank was ruled by Jordan, before both territories were occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since then there have been proposals to establish a Palestinian state. In 1969, for example, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) proposed the establishment of a binational state over the whole of the former British Mandate territory. This proposal was rejected by Israel, as it would have amounted to the disbanding of the state of Israel. The basis of the current proposals is for a two-state solution on either a portion of or the entirety of the Palestinian territories\u2014the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which have been occupied by Israel since 1967.\nBackground.\nBritish mandate period.\nThe rise of Zionism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a growing stream of Jewish immigration into Palestine. In 1917, during World War I, the British Government issued the Balfour Declaration which declared British support for the creation in Palestine of a \"national home for the Jewish people\". While the declaration was enthusiastically received by many Jews worldwide, the British Government was quick to point out that it spoke of a \"home\", making no promise of a \"state\". It was nevertheless opposed by Palestinian and Arab leaders, who later claimed that the objective was a breach of promises made to the Sharif of Mecca in 1915, in exchange for Arabs helping to fight the Ottoman Empire during the war.\nThe defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I resulted in the dismantling of their rule. In 1920, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate to govern Palestine, leading to the subsequent period of British administration.\nMany different proposals have been made and continue to be made to resolve the dilemma of the competing objectives, including an Arab state, with or without a significant Jewish population, a Jewish state, with or without a significant Arab population, a single bi-national state, with or without some degree of cantonization, two states, one bi-national and one Arab, with or without some form of federation, and two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with or without some form of federation.\nAt the same times, many Arab leaders maintained that Palestine should join a larger Arab state covering the imprecise region of the Levant. These hopes were expressed in the Faisal\u2013Weizmann Agreement, which was signed by soon-to-be Iraqi ruler Faisal I and the Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann. Despite this, the promise of a Pan-Arab state including Palestine were dashed as Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan declared independence from their European rulers, while western Palestine festered in the developing Arab-Jewish conflict.\nIn light of these developments, Arabs began calling for both their own state in the British Mandate of Palestine and an end to the British support of the Jewish homeland's creation and to Jewish immigration. The movement gained steam through the 1920s and 1930s as Jewish immigration picked up. Under pressure from the arising nationalist movement, the British enforced the White Papers, a series of laws greatly restricting Jewish immigration and the sale of lands to Jews. The laws, passed in 1922, 1930, and 1939, varied in severity, but all attempted to find a balance between British sympathies with the Jews and the Arabs.\nMcMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence (1915\u201316).\nIn the early years of World War I, negotiations took place between the British High Commissioner in Egypt Henry McMahon and Sharif of Mecca Husayn bin Ali for an alliance of sorts between the Allies and the Arabs in the Near East against the Ottomans. On 24 October 1915, McMahon sent to Hussein a note which the Arabs came to regard as their \"Declaration of Independence\". In McMahon's letter, part of the McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence, McMahon declared Britain's willingness to recognise the independence of the Arabs, both in the Levant and the Hejaz, subject to certain exemptions. It stated on behalf of the Government of Great Britain that:\nThe two districts of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the limits demanded.\nWith the above modification, and without prejudice of our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept those limits.\nAs for those regions lying within those frontiers wherein Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interest of her ally, France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances and make the following reply to your letter:\nThe exemptions from Arab control of certain areas set out in the McMahon note were to seriously complicate the problems of peace in the Near East. At the time, the Arab portions of the Ottoman Empire were divided into administrative units called \"vilayets\" and \"sanjaks\". Palestine was divided into the \"sanjuks\" of Acre and Nablus, both of which were a part of the vilayet of Beirut, and an independent \"sanjak\" of Jerusalem. The areas exempted from Arab control by the McMahon note included \"Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo.\" Between 1916 and 1920, the British government interpreted these commitments as including Palestine in the Arab area. However, in the Churchill White Paper they argued instead that \"Damascus\" meant the \"vilayet\" and not the city of Damascus, and accordingly virtually all of Palestine was excluded from Arab control. The British entered into the secret Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement on 16 May 1916 and the commitment of the Balfour Declaration, for example, on that understanding.\nThe Arabs, however, insisted at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference at the end of the war that \"Damascus\" meant the city of Damascus\u00a0\u2013 which left Palestine in their hands. However, in 1915, these problems of interpretation did not occur to Hussein, who agreed to the British wording.\nDespite Arab objections based in part on the Arab interpretation of the McMahon correspondence noted above, Britain was given the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine. The Mandate was administered as two territories: Palestine and Transjordan, with the Jordan River being the boundary between them. The boundaries under the Mandate also did not follow those sought by the Jewish community, which sought the inclusion of the east bank of the Jordan into the Palestinian territory, to which the objective of the Mandate for a homeland for the Jewish people would apply. It was made clear from before the commencement of the Mandate, and a clause to that effect was inserted in the Mandate, that the objective set out in the Mandate would not apply to Transjordan following the passing of the Transjordan memorandum. Transjordan was destined for early independence. The objective of the Mandate was to apply only to territory west of the Jordan, which was commonly referred to as Palestine by the British administration, and as Eretz Israel by the Hebrew-speaking Jewish population.\nPeel Commission (1936\u201337).\nDuring the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine the British government formed the Peel Commission, which recommended the formation of a Jewish and an Arab state. It called for a small Jewish state in the Galilee and maritime strip, a British enclave stretching from Jerusalem to Jaffa, and an Arab state covering the rest. The Commission recommended the creation of a small Jewish state in a region less than 1/5 of the total area of Palestine. The Arab area was to be joined to Transjordan. The Arab population in the Jewish areas was to be removed, by force if necessary, and vice versa, although this would mean the movement of far more Arabs than Jews. The Zionist Congress rejected the proposal, while allowing the leadership to continue negotiating with the British. The Arab leadership rejected the proposal outright. It all came to nothing, as the British government shelved the proposal altogether by the middle of 1938.\nIn February 1939, the St. James Conference convened in London, but the Arab delegation refused to formally meet with its Jewish counterpart or to recognize them. The Conference ended on March 17, 1939, without making any progress. On May 17, 1939, the British government issued the White Paper of 1939, in which the idea of partitioning the Mandate was abandoned in favor of Jews and Arabs sharing one government and put strict quotas on further Jewish immigration. Because of impending World War II and the opposition from all sides, the plan was dropped.\nWorld War II (1939\u20131945) gave a boost to the Jewish nationalism, as the Holocaust reaffirmed their call for a Jewish homeland. At the same time, many Arab leaders had even supported Nazi Germany, a fact which could not play well with the British. As a result, Britain pooled its energy into winning over Arab opinions by abandoning the Balfour Declaration and the terms of the League of Nations mandate which had been entrusted to it in order to create a \"Jewish National Home\". Britain did this by issuing the 1939 white paper which officially allowed a further 75,000 Jews to move over five years (10,000 a year plus an additional 25,000) which was to be followed by Arab majority independence. The British would later claim that that quota had already been fulfilled by those who had entered without its approval.\nThe Arab League and the Arab Higher Committee (1945).\nThe framers of the Arab League sought to include the Palestinian Arabs within the framework of the League from its inception. An annex to the League Pact declared:\nEven though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League of Nations determined a system of government for her. Her existence and her independence among the nations can, therefore, no more be questioned \"de jure\" than the independence of any of the other Arab States... Therefore, the States signatory to the Pact of the Arab League consider that in view of Palestine's special circumstances, the Council of the League should designate an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work until this country enjoys actual independence.\nIn November 1945, the Arab League reconstituted the Arab Higher Committee comprising twelve members as the supreme executive body of Palestinian Arabs in the territory of the British Mandate of Palestine. The committee was dominated by the Palestine Arab Party and was immediately recognised by Arab League countries. The Mandate government recognised the new Committee two months later. The Constitution of the League of Arab States says the existence and independence of Palestine cannot be questioned \"de jure\" even though the outward signs of this independence have remained veiled as a result of \"force majeure\".\nIn 1946, Jewish leaders\u00a0\u2013 including Nahum Goldmann, Rabbi Abba Silver, Moshe Shertok, and David Ben-Gurion\u00a0\u2013 proposed a union between Arab Palestine and Transjordan. Also in 1946, leaders of the Zionist movement in the U.S. sought the postponement of a determination of the application by Transjordan for United Nations membership until the status of Mandate Palestine as a whole was determined. However, at its final session the League of Nations recognized the independence of Transjordan, with the agreement of Britain.\nIn April 1947, during the activity of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, the Arab Higher Committee articulated its demands in the solution for the Question of Palestine:\n1947 UN Partition Plan.\nIn 1947, the United Nations created the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) to find an immediate solution to the Palestine question, which the British had handed over to the UN. The report indicated that the Arab state would be forced to call for financial assistance \"from international institutions in the way of loans for expansion of education, public health and other vital social services of a non-self-supporting nature.\" A technical note from the Secretariat explained that without some redistribution of customs from the Jewish state, Arab Palestine would not be economically viable. The committee was satisfied that the proposed Jewish State and the City of Jerusalem would be viable. The majority of the members of UNSCOP proposed certain recommendations for the UN General Assembly which on 29 November 1947 adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of the Partition Plan, based substantially on those proposals as Resolution 181(II). PART I: Future constitution and government of Palestine: A. Clause 3. provided as follows:- \"Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem, set forth in part III of this plan, shall come into existence in Palestine two months after the evacuation of the armed forces of the mandatory Power has been completed but in any case not later than 1 October 1948\". The resolution noted Britain's planned termination of the British Mandate for Palestine and recommended the partition of Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area being under special international protection, administered by the United Nations. The resolution included a highly detailed description of the recommended boundaries for each proposed state. The resolution also contained a plan for an economic union between the proposed states, and a plan for the protection of religious and minority rights. The resolution sought to address the conflicting objectives and claims to the Mandate territory of two competing nationalist movements, Zionism (Jewish nationalism) and Arab nationalism, as well as to resolve the plight of Jews displaced as a result of the Holocaust. The resolution called for the withdrawal of British forces and termination of the Mandate by 1 August 1948, and establishment of the new independent states by 1 October 1948.\nThe leaders of the Jewish Agency for Palestine accepted the plan, while Arab leaders refused it.\nIn the October 1947 Arab League conference in Aley, the Arab states rejected the option of establishing an interim Palestinian Arab government and the Lebanese prime minister Riad Al Solh in particular told Hajj Amin al-Husseini that if a Palestinian Arab government will be established, he couldn't be part of it. Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam wanted the Arab League to manage the Arab struggle in Palestine.\nKing Abdullah I of Jordan met with a delegation headed by Golda Meir (who later became Prime Minister of Israel in 1968) to negotiate terms for accepting the partition plan, but rejected its proposal that Jordan remain neutral. Indeed, the king knew that the nascent Palestinian state would soon be absorbed by its Arab neighbors, and therefore had a vested interest in being party to the imminent war.\nCivil war 1947\u201348.\nSoon after the UN resolution, less than half a year prior to the expiration of the British Mandate, large-scale fighting broke out between the Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine. By the time Israel declared its independence on 14 May 1948, the result of these five and a half months of fighting was, according to historian Benny Morris, a \"decisive Jewish victory\". On one side, the \"Palestinian Arab military power was crushed\" and most of the Arab population in the combat zones was fleeing or had been driven out. On the other side, the \"Haganah transformed from a militia into an army\" and succeeded \"in consolidating its hold on a continuous strip of territory embracing the Coastal Plain, the Jezreel Valley, and the Jordan Valley\". The Yishuv (the Jewish community and its \"state-in-waiting\"-type organisations) proved it had the capability to defend itself, persuading the United States and the remainder of the world to support it and the \"victory over the Palestinian Arabs gave the Haganah the experience and self-confidence [...] to confront [...] the invading armies of the Arab states.\"\nOn 12 April 1948, the Arab League announced:The Arab armies shall enter Palestine to rescue it. His Majesty (King Farouk, representing the League) would like to make it clearly understood that such measures should be looked upon as temporary and devoid of any character of the occupation or partition of Palestine, and that after completion of its liberation, that country would be handed over to its owners to rule in the way they like.\n1948 war until 1988.\nArab\u2013Israeli War (1948).\nOn May 14, 1948, at the end of the British Mandate, the Jewish People's Council gathered in Tel Aviv and the chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel.\" U.S. President Harry Truman recognised the State of Israel \"de facto\" the following day. The Arab countries declared war on the newly formed State of Israel heralding the start of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War.\nArmies of the neighbouring Arab states entered the former Mandate territories the next day starting the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. But some of the leaders of these countries had plans of their own for Palestine. As the Palestinian writer Hisham Sharabi would observe, Palestine had \"disappeared from the map\".\nAs a result of the war, Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip, and on September 22, 1948, formed the All-Palestine Government in Gaza, partly as an Arab League move to limit the influence of Jordan over the Palestinian issue. The former mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, was appointed president. The Palestinian National Council declared an independent Palestinian state on October 1, 1948 in all of Palestine region with Jerusalem as its capital. This government was recognised by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, but not by Jordan or any non-Arab country. However, it was little more than a facade under Egyptian control and had negligible influence or funding. Egypt did not permit unrestricted entry of Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt proper, and vice versa. In 1959, Gamal Abdel Nasser, president of Egypt, dissolved the All-Palestine government to rule the Gaza Strip directly.\nKing Abdullah I of Jordan sent the Arab Legion into the West Bank with no intention of withdrawing it following the war. Jordan annexed the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, granting citizenship to the Arab refugees and residents living in the West Bank against the objection of many Arab leaders who still hoped to establish an Arab state of Palestine. The country's name was changed in 1949 from Transjordan to Jordan and Palestinians were given seats in the Jordanian Parliament. A royal decree in March 1949 forbade the use of the term \"Palestine\" in legal documents, and other measures were designed to emphasize that there would not be an independent Palestine. He also banned any opinion contrary to unification of the two territories and outlawed all All-Palestine Government activity within territories under his control.\nAfter the war, which the Israelis call the War of Independence and the Palestinians call the Catastrophe, the 1949 Armistice Agreements established the separation lines between the combatants, leaving Israel in control of some of the areas which had been designated for the Arab state under the Partition Plan, Transjordan in control of the West Bank, Egypt in control of the Gaza Strip and Syria in control of the Himmah Area. The Arab League \"supervised\" the Egyptian trusteeship of the Palestinian government in Gaza after and secured assurances from Jordan that the 1950 Act of Union was \"without prejudice to the final settlement\".\nJordanian West Bank.\nKing Abdullah I of Jordan annexed the West Bank, granting citizenship to the Arab refugees and residents against the wishes of many Arab leaders who still hoped to establish an Arab state. Under Abdullah's leadership, Arab hopes of independence were dealt a severe blow. In March he issued a royal decree forbidding the use of the term \"Palestine\" in any legal documents, and pursued other measures designed to make the fact that there would not be an independent Palestine clear and certain.\nDuring the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Transjordan occupied the area of Cisjordan, now called the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), which it continued to control in accordance with the 1949 Armistice Agreements and a political union formed in December 1948. Military Proclamation Number 2 of 1948 provided for the application in the West Bank of laws that were applicable in Palestine on the eve of the termination of the Mandate. On 2 November 1948, the military rule was replaced by a civilian administration by virtue of the Law Amending Public Administration Law in Palestine. Military Proclamation Number 17 of 1949, Section 2, vested the King of Jordan with all the powers that were enjoyed by the King of England, his ministers and the High Commissioner of Palestine by the Palestine Order-in-Council, 1922. Section 5 of this law confirmed that all laws, regulations and orders that were applicable in Palestine until the termination of the Mandate would remain in force until repealed or amended.\nThe Second Arab-Palestinian Congress was held in Jericho on 1 December 1948 at the end of the war. The delegates proclaimed Abdullah King of Palestine and called for a union of Arab Palestine with the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. Avi Plascov says that Abdullah contacted the Nashashibi opposition, local mayors, mukhars, those opposed to the Husaynis, and opposition members of the AHC. Plascov said that the Palestinian Congresses were conducted in accordance with prevailing Arab custom. He also said that contrary to the widely held belief outside Jordan the representatives did reflect the feelings of a large segment of the population.\nThe Transjordanian Government agreed to the unification on 7 December 1948, and on 13 December the Transjordanian parliament approved the creation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The change of status was reflected by the adoption of this new official name on 21 January 1949. Unification was ratified by a joint Jordanian National Assembly on 24 April 1950 which comprised twenty representatives each from the East and West Bank. The Act of Union contained a protective clause which preserved Arab rights in Palestine \"without prejudice to any final settlement\".\nMany legal scholars say the declaration of the Arab League and the Act of Union implied that Jordan's claim of sovereignty was provisional, because it had always been subject to the emergence of the Palestinian state. A political union was legally established by the series of proclamations, decrees, and parliamentary acts in December 1948. Abdullah thereupon took the title King of Jordan, and he officially changed the country's name to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in April 1949. The 1950 Act of Union confirmed and ratified King Abdullah's actions. Following the annexation of the West Bank, only two countries formally recognized the union: Britain and Pakistan. Thomas Kuttner notes that de facto recognition was granted to the regime, most clearly evidenced by the maintaining of consulates in East Jerusalem by several countries, including the United States. Joseph Weiler agreed, and said that other states had engaged in activities, statements, and resolutions that would be inconsistent with non-recognition. Joseph Massad said that the members of the Arab League granted \"de facto\" recognition and that the United States had formally recognized the annexation, except for Jerusalem. The policy of the U.S. Department, was stated in a paper on the subject prepared for the Foreign Ministers meetings in London in May was in favor of the incorporation of Central Palestine into Jordan, but desired that it be done gradually and not by sudden proclamation. Once the annexation took place, the department approved of the action \"in the sense that it represents a logical development of the situation which took place as a result of a free expression of the will of the people... The United States continued to wish to avoid a public expression of approval of the union.\"\nThe United States government extended \"de jure\" recognition to the Government of Transjordan and the Government of Israel on the same day, 31 January 1949. U.S. President Truman told King Abdullah that the policy of the U.S. as regards a final territorial settlement in Palestine had been stated in the General Assembly on 30 November 1948 by the American representative. The U.S. supported Israeli claims to the boundaries set forth in the UN General Assembly resolution of 29 November 1947, but believed that if Israel sought to retain additional territory in Palestine allotted to the Arabs, it should give the Arabs territorial compensation. Clea Bunch said that \"President Truman crafted a balanced policy between Israel and its moderate Hashemite neighbours when he simultaneously extended formal recognition to the newly created state of Israel and the Kingdom of Transjordan. These two nations were inevitably linked in the President's mind as twin emergent states: one serving the needs of the refugee Jew, the other absorbing recently displaced Palestinian Arabs. Truman was aware of the private agreements that existed between Jewish Agency leaders and King Abdullah I of Jordan. Thus, it made perfect sense to Truman to favour both states with \"de jure\" recognition.\"\nSandra Berliant Kadosh analyzed U.S. policy toward the West Bank in 1948, based largely on the Foreign Relations Documents of the United States. She noted that the U.S. government believed that the most satisfactory solution regarding the disposition of the greater part of Arab Palestine would be incorporation in Transjordan and that the State Department approved the Principle underlying the Jericho resolutions. Kadosh said that the delegates claimed to represent 90 percent of the population, and that they ridiculed the Gaza government. They asserted that it represented only its eighty-odd members.\nAll-Palestine.\nIn Gaza, the All-Palestine Government was formed prior to the war's end in September 1948. The government, under the leadership of the Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, declared the independence of the Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital. The All-Palestine Government would go on to be recognized by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, while Jordan and the other Arab states refused to recognize it.\nEgypt supervised the government of Palestine in Gaza as a trustee on behalf of the Arab League. An Egyptian Ministerial order dated 1 June 1948 declared that all laws in force during the Mandate would continue to be in force in the Gaza Strip. Another order issued on 8 August 1948 vested an Egyptian Administrator-General with the powers of the High Commissioner. The All-Palestine Government had very limited power however, as Egypt maintained control over Gaza's administration. The All-Palestine Government was under official Egyptian protection, but on the other hand it had no executive role, but rather mostly political and symbolic. Its importance gradually declined, especially with the government seat relocation from Gaza to Cairo in December 1948.\nShortly thereafter, the Jericho Conference named King Abdullah I of Transjordan, \"King of Arab Palestine\". The Congress called for the union of Arab Palestine and Transjordan and Abdullah announced his intention to annex the West Bank. The other Arab League member states opposed Abdullah's plan.\nThe U.S. advised the Arab states that the U.S. attitude regarding Israel had been clearly stated in the UN by Dr. Jessup on 20 November 1949. He said that the U.S. supported Israeli claims to the boundaries set forth in the UN General Assembly resolution. However, the U.S. believed that if Israel sought to retain additional territory in Palestine it should give the Arabs other territory as compensation. The Israelis agreed that the boundaries were negotiable, but did not agree to the principle of compensation as a precondition. Israel's Foreign Minister Eban stressed that it was undesirable to undermine what had already been accomplished by the armistice agreements, and maintained that Israel held no territory wrongfully, since her occupation of the areas had been sanctioned by the armistice agreements, as had the occupation of the territory in Palestine held by the Arab states.\nIn late 1949, under the auspices of the UNCCP, their subsidiary Economic Survey Mission for the Middle East, headed by Gordon R. Clapp, recommended four development projects, involving the Wadi Zerqa basin in Jordan, the Wadi Qelt watershed and stream bed in Arab Palestine, the Litani River in Lebanon, and the Ghab valley in Syria. The World Bank considered the mission's plans positive, and U.S. President Harry Truman subsequently announced that the Foreign Economic Assistance Act of 1950 contained an appropriation of US$27 million for the development projects recommended by the Clapp Mission and to assist Palestinian refugees.\nIn a diplomatic conversation held on 5 June 1950 between Stuart W. Rockwell of the State Department's Office of African and Near Eastern Affairs and Abdel Monem Rifai, a Counselor of the Jordan Legation. Rifai asked when the U.S. was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Rockwell explained the Department's position, stating that it was not the custom of the U.S. to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the U.S. accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the U.S. did in fact recognize the union. The U.S. State Department published this memorandum of conversation in 1978.\nIn 1957, the Basic Law of Gaza established a Legislative Council that could pass laws which were given to the High Administrator-General for approval. In 1959, Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser ordered the dismantling of the All-Palestine Protectorate for good. In March 1962, a Constitution for the Gaza Strip was issued confirming the role of the Legislative Council. The All-Palestine Protectorate is regarded by some as the first attempt to establish an independent Palestinian state, whilst most just saw it as an Egyptian puppet, only to be annulled a few years after its creation by no less than President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt.\nSix-Day War (1967).\nIn June 1967, Israel captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, from Jordan, the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, and the area of Golan Heights from Syria as a result of the Six-Day War. Israel, which was ordered to withdraw from territories occupied during the war in exchange for Arab recognition and the negotiation of final borders by United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem and later applied Israeli civil law to the Golan Heights. On 9 June 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister Eban assured the U.S. that it was not seeking territorial aggrandizement and had no \"colonial\" aspirations. U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk stressed to Israel that no settlement with Jordan would be accepted by the global community unless it gave Jordan some special position in the Old City of Jerusalem. The U.S. also assumed Jordan would receive the bulk of the West Bank as that was regarded as Jordanian territory.\nThe international community considers the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, held under military occupation by Israel subject to the Fourth Geneva Convention. Israel does not accept that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies \"de jure\", but has stated that on humanitarian issues it will govern itself \"de facto\" by its provisions, without specifying which these are. The Gaza Strip is still considered to be occupied by the United Nations, international human rights organisations, and the majority of governments and legal commentators, despite the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza.\nOn 3 November 1967, U.S. Ambassador Goldberg called on King Hussein of Jordan, saying that the U.S. was committed to the principle of political independence and territorial integrity and was ready to reaffirm it bilaterally and publicly in the Security Council resolution. According to Goldberg, the U.S. believed in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles, there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.\nThe U.S. President's Special Assistant, Walt Rostow, told Israeli ambassador Harmon that he had already stressed to Foreign Minister Eban that the U.S. expected the thrust of the settlement would be toward security and demilitarisation arrangements rather than toward major changes in the armistice lines. Harmon said the Israeli position was that Jerusalem should be an open city under unified administration, but that the Jordanian interest in Jerusalem could be met through arrangements including \"sovereignty\". Rostow said the U.S. government assumed (and Harman confirmed) that despite public statements to the contrary, the Government of Israel position on Jerusalem was that which Eban, Harman, and Evron had given several times, that Jerusalem was negotiable.\nFollowing the outbreak of fighting in Jordan in September 1970 between the Jordanian army and Palestinian guerilla, the US government began considering the creation of a separate Palestinian political entity. However, a Palestinian state was the least considered alternative. A State Department memo of 1970 stated in that regard:\nsuch a state would presumably have to be limited to the West Bank and Gaza, it would probably not be economically viable without the injection of large-scale outside financial assistance. Its political viability is also doubtful, since a large number of Palestinians would remain outside its borders and it would tend to be dominated by a larger and more powerful Israel.\nPLO and the binational state solution.\nBefore the Six-Day War, the movement for an independent Palestine received a boost in 1964 when the Palestine Liberation Organization was established. Its goal, as stated in the Palestinian National Covenant was to create a Palestinian state in the whole British Mandate, a statement which nullified Israel's right to exist. The PLO would become the leading force in the Palestinian national movement politically, and its leader, Egyptian-born Yassir Arafat, would become regarded as the leader of the Palestinian people.\nIn 1969, the Fatah movement, accepting as a \"fait accompli\" the presence in Palestine of a large number of Jews, declared that it was not fighting against Jews, but against Israel as a racist and theocratic entity. The fifth national council of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in February 1969 passed a resolution confirming that the PLO's objective was \"to establish a free and democratic society in Palestine for all Palestinians whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews\". The PLO was not successful in building support for the binational solution within Israeli society, however, which lay the groundwork for an eventual re-scoping of the PLO's aim toward partition into two states.\nRift between Jordan and Palestinian leadership (1970).\nAfter the events of Black September in Jordan, the rift between the Palestinian leadership and the Kingdom of Jordan continued to widen. The Arab League affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to \"self-determination\" and called on all the Arab states, including Jordan, to undertake to defend Palestinian national unity and not to interfere in internal Palestinian affairs. The Arab League also 'affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent national authority under the command of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in any Palestinian territory that is liberated.' King \u1e24ussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament. Half of its members had been West Bank representatives. He renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank, and allowed the PLO to assume responsibility as the Provisional Government of Palestine. The Kingdom of Jordan, Egypt, and Syria no longer act as the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people, or their territory.\nTen Point Program.\nIn 1974, the PLO adopted the \"Ten Point Program\", which called for the establishment of an Israeli-Palestinian democratic, binational state (a one state solution). It also called for the establishment of Palestinian rule on \"any part\" of its liberated territory, as a step towards \"completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory, and as a step along the road to comprehensive Arab unity.\" While this was not seen by Israel as a significant moderation of PLO policy, the phrasing was extremely controversial within the PLO itself, where it was widely regarded as a move towards a two-state solution. The adoption of the program, under pressure from Arafat's Fatah faction and some minor groups (e.g. DFLP, al-Sa'iqa) led many hard-line groups to break away from the Arafat and the mainstream PLO members, forming the Rejectionist Front. To some extent, this split is still evident today. Declassified diplomatic documents reveal that in 1974, on the eve of the UN debate that granted the PLO an observer status, some parts of the PLO leadership were considering to proclaim the formation of a Palestinian government in exile at some point. This plan, however, was not carried out.\nAt the Rabat summit conference in 1974, Jordan and the other members of the Arab League declared that the Palestine Liberation Organization was the \"sole legitimate representative of the [Arab] Palestinian people\", thereby relinquishing to that organization its role as representative of the West Bank.\nDuring the 1978 Camp David negotiations between Israel and Egypt Anwar Sadat proposed the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel refused.\nIn a speech delivered on 1 September 1982, U.S. President Ronald Reagan called for a settlement freeze and continued to support full Palestinian autonomy in political union with Jordan. He also said that \"It is the United States' position that\u00a0\u2013 in return for peace\u00a0\u2013 the withdrawal provision of Resolution 242 applies to all fronts, including the West Bank and Gaza.\"\nThe Amman Agreement of 11 February 1985, declared that the PLO and Jordan would pursue a proposed confederation between the state of Jordan and a Palestinian state. In 1988, King Hussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament and renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank. The PLO assumed responsibility as the Provisional Government of Palestine and an independent state was declared.\nTimeline.\nDeclaration of the state in 1988.\nThe declaration of a State of Palestine () took place in Algiers on November 15, 1988, by the Palestinian National Council, the legislative body of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It was approved by the Palestinian National Council (PNC) by a vote of 253 in favour, 46 against and 10 abstentions. It was read by Yasser Arafat at the closing session of the 19th PNC to a standing ovation. Upon completing the reading of the declaration, Arafat, as Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization assumed the title of \"President of Palestine\". By the 1988 declaration, the PNC empowered its central council to form a government-in-exile when appropriate, and called upon its executive committee to perform the duties of the government-in-exile until its establishment.\nThe borders of the state were not specified. Jordan extended recognition to the state and ceded its claim to the West Bank to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, which had been previously designated by the Arab League as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\".\nThe Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the United States, the European Union, and the Arab League, envision the establishment of a State of Palestine to include all or part of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, living in peace with Israel under a democratically elected and transparent government. The PNA, however, does not claim sovereignty over any territory and therefore is not the government of the State of Palestine proclaimed in 1988.\nReferring to \"the historical injustice inflicted on the Palestinian Arab people resulting in their dispersion and depriving them of their right to self-determination,\" the declaration recalled the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) and UN General Assembly Resolution 181 (1947 Partition Plan) as supporting the rights of Palestinians and Palestine. The declaration then proclaims a \"State of Palestine on our Palestinian territory with its capital Jerusalem\". The borders of the declared State of Palestine were not specified. The population of the state was referred to by the statement: \"The State of Palestine is the state of Palestinians wherever they may be\". The state was defined as an Arab country by the statement: \"The State of Palestine is an Arab state, an integral and indivisible part of the Arab nation\". The declaration was accompanied by a PNC call for multilateral negotiations on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 242. This call was later termed \"the Historic Compromise\", as it implied acceptance of the \"two-state solution\", namely that it no longer questioned the legitimacy of the State of Israel. The PNC's political communiqu\u00e9 accompanying the declaration called only for withdrawal from \"Arab Jerusalem\" and the other \"Arab territories occupied.\" Arafat's statements in Geneva a month later were accepted by the United States as sufficient to remove the ambiguities it saw in the declaration and to fulfill the longheld conditions for open dialogue with the United States.\nAs a result of the declaration, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) convened, inviting Arafat, Chairman of the PLO to give an address. An UNGA resolution was adopted \"acknowledging the proclamation of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council on 15 November 1988,\" and it was further decided that \"the designation 'Palestine' should be used in place of the designation 'Palestine Liberation Organization' in the United Nations system,\" and it delegate was assigned a seated in the UN General Assembly immediately after non-member states, and before all other observers. One hundred and four states voted for this resolution, forty-four abstained, and two\u00a0\u2013 the United States and Israel\u00a0\u2013 voted against. By mid-December, seventy-five states had recognized Palestine, rising to eighty-nine states by February 1989.\nThe declaration is generally interpreted to be a major step on the path to Israel's recognition by the Palestinians. Just as in Israel's declaration of independence, it partly bases its claims on UN GA 181. By reference to \"resolutions of Arab Summits\" and \"UN resolutions since 1947\" (like SC 242) it implicitly and perhaps ambiguously restricted its immediate claims to the Palestinian territories and Jerusalem. It was accompanied by a political statement that explicitly mentioned SC 242 and other UN resolutions and called only for withdrawal from \"Arab Jerusalem\" and the other \"Arab territories occupied.\" Yasser Arafat's statements in Geneva a month later were accepted by the United States as sufficient to remove the ambiguities it saw in the declaration and to fulfill the longheld conditions for open dialogue with the United States.\nPalestinian Authority (1994).\nUnder the terms of the Oslo Accords signed between Israel and the PLO, the latter assumed control over the Jericho area of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 17 May 1994. On 28 September 1995, following the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli military forces withdrew from the West Bank towns of Nablus, Ramallah, Jericho, Jenin, Tulkarem, Qalqilya and Bethlehem. In December 1995, the PLO also assumed responsibility for civil administration in 17 areas in Hebron. While the PLO assumed these responsibilities as a result of Oslo, a new temporary interim administrative body was set up as a result of the Accords to carry out these functions on the ground: the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nAccording to Omar Dajani, the relationship between the PLO and PNA (or PA) in light of the interim arrangements of Oslo Accords may be stating as \"Palestine may best be described as a transitional association between the PA and the PLO.\" He goes on to explain that this transitional association accords the PA responsibility for local government and the PLO responsibility for representation of the Palestinian people in the international arena, while prohibiting it from concluding international agreements that affect the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This situation is said to be accepted by the Palestinian population insofar as it is viewed as a temporary arrangement.\nIn 2005, following the implementation of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and territorial waters.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[iii] This increased the percentage of land in the Gaza strip nominally governed by the PA from 60 percent to 100 percent.\nThe West Bank and Gaza Strip continued to be considered by the international community to be Occupied Palestinian Territory, notwithstanding the 1988 declaration of Palestinian independence, the limited self-government accorded to the Palestinian Authority as a result of the 1993 Oslo Accords, and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza as part of the Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2005, which saw the dismantlement of four Israeli settlements in the West Bank and all settlements in the Gaza Strip.\nIn March 2008, it was reported that the PA was working to increase the number of countries that recognize Palestine and that a PA representative had signed a bilateral agreement between the State of Palestine and Costa Rica. An Al-Haq position paper (2009) said the reality is that the PA has entered into various agreements with international organizations and states. These instances of foreign relations undertaken by the PA signify that the Interim Agreement is part of a larger on-going peace process, and that the restrictions on the foreign policy operations of the PA conflict with the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, now a norm with a nature of jus cogens, which includes a right to engage in international relations with other peoples. Israeli government and many experts consider such actions as violation of the Oslo Accords.\nWhen the PA is exercising the power that is granted to them by the Oslo Accords, they're acting in the capacity of an agency whose authority is based on an agreement between Israel and the PLO and not as a state.\nSplit of Fatah and Hamas.\nIn 2007, after Hamas's legislative victories, the Fatah and Hamas engaged into a violent conflict, taking place mainly in the Gaza Strip, leading to effective collapse of the Palestinian national unity government. After the takeover in Gaza by Hamas on 14 June 2007, Palestinian Authority Chairman Abbas dismissed the Hamas-led government and appointed Salam Fayyad as Prime Minister. Though the new government's authority is claimed to extend to all Palestinian territories, in effect it became limited to the West Bank, as Hamas hasn't recognized the move and continued to rule the Gaza Strip. While PNA budget comes mainly from various aid programs and support of the Arab League, the Hamas Government in Gaza became dependent mainly on Iran until the eruption of the Arab Spring.\nPalestine in the United Nations.\n2011 United Nations membership application.\nAfter a two-year impasse in negotiations with Israel, the Palestinian Authority sought to gain recognition as a state according to its 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital from the UN General Assembly in September 2011. A successful application for membership in the UN would require approval from the UN Security Council and a two-thirds majority in the UN General Assembly.\nOn the prospect of this being successful, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice alluded to a potential U.S. government withdrawal of UN funding: \"This would be exceedingly politically damaging in our domestic context, as you can well imagine. And I cannot frankly think of a greater threat to our ability to maintain financial and political support for the United Nations in Congress than such an outcome.\" On 28 June, the U.S. Senate passed calling on U.S. President Barack Obama to veto the motion and threatening a withdrawal of aid to the West Bank if the Palestinians followed through on their plans. At the likely prospect of a veto, Palestinian leaders signalled they might opt instead for a more limited upgrade to \"non-member state\" status, which requires only the approval of the UN General Assembly.\nMahmoud Abbas stated he would accept a return to negotiations and abandon the decision if the Israelis agree to the 1967 borders and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Israel labelled the plan as a unilateral step, to which Foreign Minister Erekat replied,\"We are not going [to the UN] for a unilateral declaration of the Palestinian state. We declared our state in 1988 and we have embassies in more than 130 countries and more countries are recognising our state on the 1967 borders. The recognition of the Palestinian state is a sovereignty decision by the countries and it doesn't need to happen through the UN.\" The Arab League formally backed the plan in May, and was officially confirmed by the PLO on 26 June.\nOn 11 July, the Quartet on the Middle East met to discuss a return to negotiations, but the meeting produced no result. On 13 July, in an interview with \"Haaretz\", Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations Riyad Mansour claimed that 122 states had so far extended formal recognition to the Palestinian state. On the following day, the Arab League released a draft statement which declared a consensus to \"go to the United Nations to request the recognition of the State of Palestine with Al Quds as its capital and to move ahead and request a full membership.\" The league's secretary-general, Nabil al-Arabi, confirmed the statement and said that the application for membership will be submitted by the Arab League. On 18 July, Syria announced that it had formally recognised the State of Palestine, the last Arab state to do so. The decision was welcomed by the league, but met with criticism from some, including former Lebanese prime minister Selim al-Hoss: \"Syria has always been calling for the liberation of Palestine from Israeli occupation and ambitions. The latest stance, however, shows that [Syria] has given up on a national policy that has spanned several decades. ... Why this abandonment of a national principle, and what is the motive behind it? There is no motive except to satisfy international powers that seek to appease Israel\".\nOn 23 September, Abbas delivered to the UN Secretary-General the official application for recognition of a Palestinian state by the UN and a membership in the same organization. On 11 November a report was approved by the Security Council which concluded that the council had been unable \"to make a unanimous recommendation\" on membership for Palestine.\n2011 UNESCO membership.\nThe PLO was accorded observer status at UNESCO in 1974. In 1989, an application for the admission of Palestine as a member state was submitted by a group of seven states during the 131st session of UNESCO's executive board. The board postponed a decision until the next session, and the item was included on each session's agenda thereafter, being repeatedly deferred. During the board's 187th session in September 2011, a draft resolution was presented by 24 states requesting that the application be considered and Palestine be granted membership in the organisation. Following consultations between the representatives of the 58-member board, the draft resolution was put for voting on 5 October. The board voted in favour of recommending the application, winning the approval of 40 states. The resolution to admit Palestine as the agency's 195th member state was adopted at the 36th General Conference on 31 October. Of the 185 dues-paying members eligible for voting, 107 were in favour, 14 were against, 52 abstained and 12 were absent. The resolution was submitted by a total of 43 states. Its membership was ratified on 23 November.\nNon-member Observer State status in the UN (2012).\nBy September 2012, with their application for full membership stalled, Palestinian representatives had decided to pursue an upgrade in status from \"observer entity\" to \"non-member observer state\". On November 27 it was announced that the appeal had been officially made, and would be put to a vote in the General Assembly on November 29, where their status upgrade was expected to be supported by a majority of states. In addition to granting Palestine \"non-member observer state status\", the draft resolution \"expresses the hope that the Security Council will consider favorably the application submitted on 23 September 2011 by the State of Palestine for admission to full membership in the United Nations, endorses the two state solution based on the pre-1967 borders, and stresses the need for an immediate resumption of negotiations between the two parties.\"\nOn Thursday, November 29, 2012, in a 138\u20139 vote (with 41 abstentions and 5 absences), General Assembly resolution 67/19 was adopted, upgrading Palestine to \"non-member observer state\" status in the United Nations. The new status equates Palestine's with that of the Holy See. Switzerland was also a non-member observer state until 2002. The change in status was described by \"The Independent\" as \"\"de facto\" recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine\".\nThe vote was a historic benchmark for the recognition of the State of Palestine, whilst it was widely considered a diplomatic setback for Israel and the United States. Status as an observer state in the UN allows the State of Palestine to participate in general debate at the General Assembly, to co-sponsor resolutions, to join treaties and specialized UN agencies. Even as a nonmember state, the Palestinians could join influential international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Bank and the International Criminal Court, where Palestinian Authority tried to have alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza (2008-2009) investigated. However, in April 2012 prosecutors refused to open the investigation, saying it was not clear if the Palestinians were qualified as a state - as only states can recognize the court's jurisdiction. But the prosecutor confirmed explicitly in 2014 that the upgrade of November 2012 qualified the state of Palestine to join the Rome statute. On 31 December 2014 Palestinian President Abbas signed a declaration in which Palestine recognized the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court for any crimes committed in the Palestinian territory since 13 June 2014.\nThe UN now can also help to affirm the borders of the Palestinian territories that Israel occupied in 1967. Theoretically Palestine could even claim legal rights over its territorial waters and air space as a sovereign state recognised by the UN.\nThe UN has, after the resolution was passed, permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as 'The Permanent Observer Mission of the \"State of\" Palestine to the United Nations', seen by many as a reflexion of the UN's \"de facto\" recognition of the State of Palestine's sovereignty, and Palestine has started to re-title its name accordingly on postal stamps, official documents and passports. The Palestinian authorities have also instructed its diplomats to officially represent 'The State of Palestine', as opposed to the 'Palestine National Authority'. On 17 December 2012, UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon decided that 'the designation of \"State of Palestine\" shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents'. In January 2013, by an official decree of the Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority has officially transformed all of its designations into the State of Palestine.\n2013 State of Palestine decree.\nFollowing the successful passage of the 2012 United Nations status resolution which changed Palestine's status at the UN to that of observer state, on 3 January 2013, Abbas signed a presidential decree 1/2013 officially changing the name of the 'Palestinian Authority' to the 'State of Palestine'. The decree stated that \"Official documents, seals, signs and letterheads of the Palestinian National Authority official and national institutions shall be amended by replacing the name \u2018Palestinian National Authority\u2019 whenever it appears by the name \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 and by adopting the emblem of the State of Palestine.\" According to international lawyer John V. Whitbeck the decree results in absorbing of the Palestinian Authority into the State of Palestine. On 8 January 2013 the Minister of Communication Safa Nassereddin, said that because issuing new stamps requires Israeli approval to print them and bring them into the country, it was decided that the new stamps will be printed in Bahrain and the first of these stamps will be used by Palestinian embassies and other diplomatic missions abroad.\nOn 5 January 2013 Abbas ordered all Palestinian embassies to change any official reference to the Palestinian Authority into State of Palestine. Missions in countries that voted \"against\" UNGA resolution 67/19 of 2012 are ordered to consult the foreign ministry. Three days later, Omar Awadallah, a foreign ministry official, said that those missions should also use the new name. Some of the countries themselves, such as Norway, Sweden and Spain, stick to the Palestinian Authority term even though they voted \"in favor\" of the UNGA resolution.\nOn 6 January 2013, Abbas ordered his cabinet of ministers to prepare regulations to issue new Palestinian passports, official signs and postage stamps in the name of the 'State of Palestine'. Two days later, following a negative reaction by Israel, it was announced that the change will not apply to documents used at Israel checkpoints in the West Bank and Israeli crossings, unless there is a further decision by Abbas. Saeb Erekat then said the new emblem will be used in correspondence with countries that have recognized a state of Palestine.\nFor the time being the governments of the renamed Authority established in 1994 and of the State established in 1988 remain distinct. On 5 January 2013 it was announced that it is expected the PLO Central Council would take over the functions of the Palestinian Authority's government and parliament. On the following day, Saeb Erekat, head of the PLO negotiations department, said that the authority should draft a new constitution.\nFollowing the change in name, Turkey became the first state to recognize this change, and on 15 April 2013, the Turkish Consul-General in East Jerusalem \u015eakir Torunlar presented his credentials as first Turkish Ambassador to the State of Palestine to Palestinian President in Ramallah.\nPeace process.\nOslo accords.\nIn the 1990s, outstanding steps were taken which formally began a process the goal of which was to solve the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict through a two-state solution. Beginning with the Madrid Conference of 1991 and culminating in the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords between Palestinians and Israelis, the peace process has laid the framework for Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and in Gaza. According to the Oslo Accords, signed by Yassir Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Washington, Israel would pull out of the Gaza Strip and cities in the West Bank. East Jerusalem, which had been annexed by Israel in 1980 was not mentioned in any of the agreements.\nFollowing the landmark accords, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was established to govern those areas from which Israel was to pull out. The PNA was granted limited autonomy over a non-contiguous area, though it does govern most Palestinian population centers.\nThe process stalled with the collapse of the Camp David 2000 Summit between Palestinians and Israel, after which the second Intifada broke out.\nIsrael ceased acting in cooperation with the PNA. In the shadow of the rising death toll from the violence, the United States initiated the Road Map for Peace (published on June 24, 2002), which was intended to end the Intifada by disarming the Palestinian terror groups and creating an independent Palestinian state. The Road Map has stalled awaiting the implementation of the step required by the first phase of that plan with then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stating within weeks of the release of the final text that a settlement freeze, one of Israel's main requirements, would be \"impossible\" because of the need for settlers to build new houses and start families. It remains stalled because of Israel's continuing refusal to comply with the requirement to freeze settlement expansion and the civil war between Hamas and Fatah, except that on April 27, 2011, it was announced that Hamas and Fatah had reached a reconciliation agreement in a pact which was brokered by Egypt. Hamas, Fatah, and the other Palestinian political factions signed the reconciliation agreement in the official signing ceremony of that agreement which took place on May 4, 2011.\nIn 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip as part of the Disengagement Plan.\nIn 2008, U.S.-brokered negotiations were ongoing between Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and the outgoing Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert.\nIn 2011, Al Jazeera published thousands of classified documents that it had received from sources close to negotiators in the 2008 negotiation talks between Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. The documents, dubbed the Palestine Papers, showed that in private the Palestinians had made major concessions on issues that had scuttled previous negotiations. Olmert also presented his ideas for the borders for a Palestinian state, dubbed the \"Napkin Map\" because of Abbas having to sketch the map on a napkin because Olmert refused to allow Abbas to keep a copy for further consideration. Olmert's proposal largely followed the route of the Israeli West Bank barrier, and placed all of the Israeli settlement blocs and East Jerusalem Jewish neighbourhoods under Israeli sovereignty. Israel would retain around 10% of the West Bank and in return the Palestinians would receive around 5% of Israeli territory adjacent to the southern West Bank and lands adjacent to the Gaza Strip.\nDirect talks in 2010.\nIn early September 2010 the first peace talks since the Gaza war in 2009 were held in Washington DC between Israeli prime-minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. The pace of the talks were assessed by the US as \"break through\". However, on 25 September Netanyahu did not renew a 10-month moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank, which brought him severe criticism from the United States, Europe and the United Nations. Abbas stated that Netanyahu could not be trusted as a 'true' peace negotiator if the freeze was not extended. Netanyahu's failure to uphold the commitments he made just a few weeks earlier \"to reaching a comprehensive peace agreement with Palestinians\" through extending the term of moratorium has caused a \"de facto\" halt of peace negotiations.\nOn 28 September 2010, Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party, presented to the UN a \u2033peace plan\u2033 according to which \u2033parts of Israel's territory populated predominantly by Israeli Arabs would be transferred to a newly created Palestinian state, in return for annexation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and/or population swap\u2033. The statement came about while Israeli prime-minister Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Abbas were holding peace talks mediated by the United States. In the press conference on 28 September Netanyahu stated \"Israel, Palestinians can reach Middle-East peace in a year\". However, Liberman's controversial proposal means that \"the conflict will not be solved within a year and that implementation of the peace agreement will take generations\". Lieberman's proposal was viewed as undermining Netanyahu's credibility in the discussions and causing embarrassment for the Israeli government. According to a New York Jewish leader \"Every time when Lieberman voices skepticism for peace talks, he gives Abu Mazen [Abbas] and the Arab League an opportunity to reinforce their claim that Netanyahu isn't serious.\" On 29 September, while commenting on the Lieberman proposal Netanyahu said that \"I didn't see [the] speech beforehand, but I don't reject the idea.\"\nThe proposal also caused wide 'outrage' among Israelis and US Jews. Seymour Reich, a former president of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations stated that \"If Lieberman can't keep his personal opinions to himself, he ought to resign from the cabinet.\"\nPositions.\nThe 2013 position of the Palestinian Authority was that all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip should form the basis of a future \"State of Palestine\". For additional discussion, see Palestinian territories. Israeli governments have maintained that the area involved is subject to future negotiations, and within territorial dispute. However, the position of the Islamic&lt;ref name=\"islamist/islamic\"&gt;* \"Hamas is a radical Islamic fundamentalist organization that has stated that its highest priority is a Jihad (holy war) for the liberation of Palestine ...\" \"Peace and War: The Arab\u2013Israeli Military Balance Enters the 21st Century\", by Anthony H. Cordesman, 2002, p.\u00a0243 https:// \nThe main discussion since 1993 has focused on turning most or all of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank into an independent Palestinian state. This was the basis for the Oslo accords, and it is, as a matter of official policy, favoured by the U.S. The status of Israel within the 1949 Armistice lines has not been the subject of international negotiations. Some members of the PLO recognize Israel's right to exist within these boundaries; others hold that Israel must eventually be destroyed. Consequently, some Israelis hold that Palestinian statehood is impossible with the current PLO as a basis, and needs to be delayed.\nIsrael declares that its security demands that a \"Palestinian entity\" would not have all attributes of a state, at least initially, so that in case things go wrong, Israel would not have to face a dangerous and nearby enemy. Israel may be therefore said to agree (as of now) not to a complete and independent Palestinian state, but rather to a self-administering entity, with partial but not full sovereignty over its borders and its citizens.\nThe central Palestinian position is that they have already compromised greatly by accepting a state covering only the areas of the West Bank and Gaza. These areas are significantly less territory than allocated to the Arab state in UN Resolution 181. They feel that it is unacceptable for an agreement to impose additional restrictions (such as level of militarization, see below) which, they declare, makes a viable state impossible. In particular, they are angered by significant increases in the population of Israeli settlements and communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the interim period of the Oslo accords. Palestinians claim that they have already waited long enough, and that Israel's interests do not justify depriving their state of those rights that they consider important. The Palestinians have been unwilling to accept a territorially disjointed state.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He painted many Polish and Lithuanian nobles, members of the royal family, local Patricians, such as the astronomer Johannes Hevelius; animals, and hunts. His work can be found at the Wawel Castle State Art Collections, the National Museum in Warsaw, the Stockholm National Museum, the Hermitage Museum, and at the Gda\u0144sk National Museum.\nLife and professional career.\nBorn somewhere around 1615 in Gda\u0144sk (Danzig), in Pomeranian Voivodeship, Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Schultz learned the art of painting from his uncle, Daniel Schultz the Elder, another important painter, working in his workshop for about five years. After his uncle's death he travelled to France and the Netherlands to continue his studies for about three years.\nSchultz became the leading artist at the Warsaw court of the Polish kings in the second half of the 17th century. In 1649 he became a private painter to the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa, and then to successor kings Michael Wi\u015bniowiecki and John III Sobieski. Schultz returned to his hometown around 1660, yet from time to time worked on royal commissions in Warsaw, often in the Wilan\u00f3w Palace. His great portraits of Polish kings and nobles are among the best examples of Baroque art in Poland. The most notable of his works \"Crimean Falconer of King John II Casimir with his Family \" (also known as \"The Family Portrait\", today in the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg) was painted in 1664. It depicts Crimean Agha Dedesh (or Dedis) with his sons and servants. The eldest son of Agha was entitled \"Royal Falconer\" in reward for his father's support during the Polish war with Russia (1654\u20131667). This work was painted during Agha's visit to Warsaw after successful invasion of the Left-bank Ukraine (1663\u20131664). Rich color variations of cerise, dark green and orange create an ideal composition with silver-brown tone of the painting. Some of the portraits of John II are also well known - \"en pied\" propaganda portrait in Polish costume, when he was leading the Berestechko expedition and so-called \"Bielany portrait\" in armour with black glow of burning Krak\u00f3w in background.\nHis greatest activity occurred during the reign of John II. At that time Schultz painted many portraits and religious paintings. For the abdicating king he painted Saint Casimir, which was later displayed in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s in Paris (missing). After the king's death, he painted his coffin portrait (now at the Royal Castle in Warsaw), that was later placed in the Marble Room at the Royal Castle among preserved 22 effigies of the Polish monarchs by Peter Danckerts de Rij. The inspirations of Rembrandt and Philippe de Champaigne are visible in his works. During his career at the court he probably had contact with some of Rembrandt's works, as king John II was a passionate collector of Dutch paintings and by his agent in Amsterdam, Gerrit van Uylenburgh, he purchased many of his works (\"The bath of Diana\", \"Actaeon\" among others).\nSchultz lived in Gda\u0144sk at the same time as the engraver Jeremias Falck (c.\u20091620\u20131664), who often engraved portraits after Schultz's paintings.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48294", "revid": "28057722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48294", "title": "International auxiliary language", "text": "Constructed language meant to facilitate communication\nAn international auxiliary language (sometimes acronymized as IAL or contracted as auxlang) is a language meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common first language. An auxiliary language is primarily a foreign language and often a constructed language. The concept is related to but separate from the idea of a \"lingua franca\" (or dominant language) that people must use to communicate. The study of international auxiliary languages is interlinguistics.\nThe term \"auxiliary\" implies that it is intended to be an additional language for communication between the people of the world, rather than to replace their native languages. Often, the term is used specifically to refer to planned or constructed languages proposed to ease international communication, such as Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua. It usually takes words from widely spoken languages. However, it can also refer to the concept of such a language being determined by international consensus, including even a standardized natural language (e.g., International English), and has also been connected to the project of constructing a universal language.\nLanguages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as lingua francas that have sometimes approached the international level. Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Persian, Tamil, and the Mediterranean Lingua Franca were used in the past. In recent times, Standard Arabic, Standard Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish have been used as such in many parts of the world. However, as lingua francas are traditionally associated with the very dominance\u2014cultural, political, and economic\u2014that made them popular, they are often also met with resistance. For this and other reasons, some have turned to the idea of promoting a constructed language as a possible solution, by way of an \"auxiliary\" language, one example of which being Esperanto.\nHistory.\nThe use of an intermediary auxiliary language (also called a \"working language\", \"bridge language\", \"vehicular language\", or \"unifying language\") to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues, may be almost as old as language itself. Certainly they have existed since antiquity. Latin and Greek (or Koine Greek) were the intermediary language of all areas of the Mediterranean; Akkadian, and then Aramaic, remained the common languages of a large part of Western Asia through several earlier empires. Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called \"lingua francas\".\n\"Lingua francas\" (natural international languages).\nLingua francas have arisen around the globe throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called \"trade languages\") but also for diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term originates with one such language, Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a pidgin language used as a trade language in the Mediterranean area from the 11th to the 19th century. Examples of lingua francas remain numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is English. Moreover, a special case of English is that of Basic English, a simplified version of English which shares the same grammar (though simplified) and a reduced vocabulary of only 1,000 words, with the intention that anyone with a basic knowledge of English should be able to understand even quite complex texts.\nConstructed languages.\nSince all natural languages display a number of irregularities in grammar that make them more difficult to learn, and they are also associated with the national and cultural dominance of the nation that speaks it as its mother tongue, attention began to focus on the idea of creating an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution. The concept of simplifying an existing language to make it an auxiliary language was already in the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\" of the 18th century, where Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve, in the article on \"Langue\", wrote a short proposition of a \"laconic\" or regularized grammar of French.\nSome of the philosophical languages of the 17th\u201318th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages as well as to disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; Solresol by Fran\u00e7ois Sudre, a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.\nVolap\u00fck.\nDuring the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such constructed international auxiliary languages (IALs) were proposed, so Louis Couturat and L\u00e9opold Leau in \"Histoire de la langue universelle\" (1903) reviewed 38 projects.\nVolap\u00fck, first described in an article in 1879 by Johann Martin Schleyer and in book form the following year, was the first to garner a widespread international speaker community. Three major Volap\u00fck conventions were held, in 1884, 1887, and 1889; the last of them used Volap\u00fck as its working language. Andr\u00e9 Cherpillod writes of the third Volap\u00fck convention,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, not long after, the Volap\u00fck speaker community broke up due to various factors including controversies between Schleyer and other prominent Volap\u00fck speakers, and the appearance of newer, easier-to-learn constructed languages, primarily Esperanto.\nIdiom Neutral and Latino sine flexione.\nAnswering the needs of the first successful artificial language community, the Volap\u00fckists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name International Volap\u00fck Academy (\"Kadem bev\u00fcnetik volap\u00fcka\") at the second Volap\u00fck congress in Munich in August 1887. The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language Volap\u00fck, but soon conflicts arose between conservative Volap\u00fckists and those who wanted to reform Volap\u00fck to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major world languages. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new Volap\u00fck Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.\nUnder Waldemar Rosenberger, who became the director in 1892, the original Academy began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volap\u00fck. The vocabulary and the grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were completely discarded, so that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named \"Idiom Neutral\". The name of the Academy was changed to \"Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal\" in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.\nIn 1903, the mathematician Giuseppe Peano published his completely new approach to language construction. Inspired by the idea of philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, instead of inventing schematic structures and an \"a priori\" language, he chose to simplify an existing and once widely used international language, Latin. This simplified Latin, devoid of inflections and declensions, was named \"Interlingua\" by Peano but is usually referred to as \"Latino sine flexione\".\nImpressed by Peano's Interlingua, the \"Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal\" effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Peano's Interlingua in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group was subsequently changed to \"Academia pro Interlingua\" (where \"Interlingua\" stands for Peano's language). The \"Academia pro Interlingua\" survived until about 1939. It was Peano's Interlingua that partly inspired the better-known Interlingua presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).\nEsperanto.\nAfter the emergence of Volap\u00fck, a wide variety of other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880s\u20131900s, but none except Esperanto gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873\u20131887 (a first version was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by L. L. Zamenhof, as a primarily schematic language; the word-stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of derivational word formation which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one word root. Moreover, Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time. From early on, Esperantists created their own culture which helped to form the Esperanto language community.\nWithin a few years this language had thousands of fluent speakers, primarily in eastern Europe. In 1905 its first world convention was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Esperanto has become \"the most outlandishly successful invented language ever\" and the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language. Esperanto is probably among the fifty languages which are most used internationally.\nIn 1922 a proposal by Iran and several other countries in the League of Nations to have Esperanto taught in member nations' schools failed. Esperanto speakers were subject to persecution under Stalin's regime. In Germany under Hitler, in Spain under Franco for about a decade, in Portugal under Salazar, in Romania under Ceau\u0219escu, and in half a dozen Eastern European countries during the late forties and part of the fifties, Esperanto activities and the formation of Esperanto associations were forbidden. In spite of these factors more people continued to learn Esperanto, and significant literary work (both poetry and novels) appeared in Esperanto in the period between the World Wars and after them. Esperanto is spoken today in a growing number of countries and it has multiple generations of native speakers, although it is primarily used as a second language. Of the various constructed language projects, it is Esperanto that has so far come closest to becoming an officially recognized international auxiliary language; China publishes daily news in Esperanto.\nIdo and the Esperantidos.\nThe Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language was founded in 1900 by Louis Couturat and others; it tried to get the International Association of Academies to take up the question of an international auxiliary language, study the existing ones and pick one or design a new one. However, when the meta-academy declined to do so, the Delegation decided to do the job itself. Among Esperanto speakers there was a general impression that the Delegation would of course choose Esperanto, as it was the only auxlang with a sizable speaker community at the time; it was felt as a betrayal by many Esperanto speakers when in 1907 the Delegation came up with its own reformed version of Esperanto, Ido. Ido drew a significant number of speakers away from Esperanto in the short term, but in the longer term most of these either returned to Esperanto or moved on to other new auxlangs. Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called Esperantidos, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the more widely spoken auxlangs.\nInterlingue (Occidental).\nEdgar de Wahl's Occidental of 1922 was in reaction against the perceived artificiality of some earlier auxlangs, particularly Esperanto. Inspired by Idiom Neutral and Latino sine flexione, de Wahl created a language whose words, including compound words, would have a high degree of recognizability for those who already know a Romance language. However, this design criterion was in conflict with the ease of coining new compound or derived words on the fly while speaking. Occidental was most active from the 1920s to the 1950s, and supported some 80 publications by the 1930s, but had almost entirely died out by the 1980s. Its name was officially changed to Interlingue in 1949. More recently Interlingue has been revived on the Internet.\nNovial.\nIn 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, abandoned Ido, and published his own planned language, Novial. It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Occidental, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido. The notability of its creator helped the growth of this auxiliary language, but a reform of the language was proposed by Jespersen in 1934 and not long after this Europe entered World War II, and its creator died in 1943 before Europe was at peace again.\nInterlingua.\nThe International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) was founded in 1924 by Alice Vanderbilt Morris; like the earlier \"Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language\", its mission was to study language problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. Interlingua, published in 1951, was primarily the work of Alexander Gode, though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including Andr\u00e9 Martinet, and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano's Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen's Novial, de Wahl's Interlingue, and the Academy's Idiom Neutral. Like Interlingue, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who already know a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Interlingue, though still less than in any natural language.\nThe theory underlying Interlingua posits an \"international vocabulary\", a large number of words and affixes that are present in a wide range of languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to \"all corners of the world\". The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred. They conducted studies to identify \"the most generally international vocabulary possible\", while still maintaining the unity of the language. This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called \"control languages\") resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that can be called the highest common factor of each major European language.\nInterlingua gained a significant speaker community, perhaps roughly the same size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's success can be explained by the fact that it is the most widely \"understood\" international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study. Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.\nAfter the creation of Interlingua, the enthusiasm for constructed languages gradually decreased in the years between 1960 and 1990.\nInternet age.\nAll of the auxlangs with a surviving speaker community seem to have benefited from the advent of the Internet, Esperanto more than most. The CONLANG mailing list was founded in 1991; in its early years discussion focused on international auxiliary languages. As people interested in artistic languages and engineered languages grew to be the majority of the list members, and flame-wars between proponents of particular auxlangs irritated these members, a separate https:// was created in 1997, which has been the primary venue for discussion of auxlangs since then. Besides giving the existing auxlangs with speaker communities a chance to interact rapidly online as well as slowly through postal mail or more rarely in personal meetings, the Internet has also made it easier to publicize new auxlang projects, and a handful of these have gained a small speaker community, including Kotava (published in 1978), Lingua Franca Nova (1998), Slovio (1999), Interslavic (2006), Pandunia (2007), Sambahsa (2007), Lingwa de Planeta (2010), and Globasa (2019).\nZonal auxiliary languages.\nNot every international auxiliary language is necessarily intended to be used on a global scale. A special subgroup are languages created to facilitate communication between speakers of related languages. The oldest known example is a Pan-Slavic language written in 1665 by the Croatian priest Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107. He named this language Ruski jezik (\"Russian language\"), although in reality it was a mixture of the Russian edition of Church Slavonic, his own Southern Chakavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian, and, to a lesser degree, Polish.\nMost zonal auxiliary languages were created during the period of romantic nationalism at the end of the 19th century; some were created later. Particularly numerous are the Pan-Slavic language projects. However, similar efforts at creating umbrella languages have been made for other language families as well: Tutonish (1902), Folkspraak (1995) and other pan-Germanic languages for the Germanic languages; Romanid (1956) and several other pan-Romance languages for the Romance languages; and Afrihili (1973) for the African continent.\nNotable among modern examples is Interslavic, a project first published in 2006 as Slovianski and then established in its current form in 2011 after the merger of several other projects. In 2012 it was reported to have several hundred users.\nScholarly study.\nIn the early 1900s auxlangs were already becoming a subject of academic study. Louis Couturat et\u00a0al. described the controversy in the preface to their book \"International Language and Science\":\nThe question of a so-called world-language, or better expressed, an international auxiliary language, was during the now past Volap\u00fck period, and is still in the present Esperanto movement, so much in the hands of Utopians, fanatics and enthusiasts, that it is difficult to form an unbiased opinion concerning it, although a good idea lies at its basis. (1910,\u00a0p.\u00a0v).\nLeopold Pfaundler wrote that an IAL was needed for more effective communication among scientists:\nAll who are occupied with the reading or writing of scientific literature have assuredly very often felt the want of a common scientific language, and regretted the great loss of time and trouble caused by the multiplicity of languages employed in scientific literature.\nFor Couturat et al., Volap\u00fckists and Esperantists confounded the linguistic aspect of the question with many side issues, and they considered this a main reason why discussion about the idea of an international auxiliary language has appeared unpractical.\nSome contemporaries of Couturat, notably Edward Sapir, saw the challenge of an auxiliary language not as much as that of identifying a descriptive linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to global communicative concerns, but rather as one of promoting the notion of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though interest among scholars, and linguists in particular, waned greatly throughout the 20th century, such differences of approach persist today. Some scholars and interested laymen make concrete language proposals. By contrast, Mario Pei and others place the broader societal issue first. Yet others argue in favor of a particular language while seeking to establish its social integration.\nWriting systems.\nWhilst most IALs use the Latin script, some of them also offer an alternative in the Cyrillic script.\nLatin script.\nThe vast majority of IALs use the Latin script. Several sounds, e.g. /n/, /m/, /t/, /f/ are written with the same letter as in IPA.\nSome consonant sounds found in several Latin-script IAL alphabets are not represented by an ISO\u00a0646 letter in IPA. Three have a single letter in IPA, one has a widespread alternative taken from ISO\u00a0646:\nFour are affricates, each represented in IPA by two letters and a combining marker. They are often written decomposed:\nThat means that two sounds that are one character in IPA and are not ISO\u00a0646, also have no common alternative in ISO\u00a0646: \u0283, \u0292.\nClassification.\nThe following classification of auxiliary languages was developed by Pierre Janton in 1993:\nComparison of sample texts.\nSome examples of the best known international auxiliary languages are shown below for comparative purposes, using the Lord's Prayer (a core Christian prayer, the translated text of which is regularly used for linguistic comparisons).\nAs a reference for comparison, one can find the Latin, English, French, and Spanish versions here:\nMethods of propagation.\nAs has been pointed out, the issue of an international language is not so much which, but how. Several approaches exist toward the eventual full expansion and consolidation of an international auxiliary language.\nPictorial languages.\nThere have been a number of proposals for using pictures, ideograms, diagrams, and other pictorial representations for international communications. Examples range from the original Characteristica Universalis proposed by the philosopher Leibniz in the 17th century, to recent inventions such as Blissymbol, first published in 1949.\nWithin the scientific community, there is already considerable agreement in the form of the schematics used to represent electronic circuits, chemical symbols, mathematical symbols, and the Energy Systems Language of systems ecology. Internationally regularized symbols are further used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the Internet.\nSign languages.\nAn international auxiliary sign language has been developed by deaf people who meet regularly at international forums such as sporting events or in political organisations. Previously referred to as Gestuno but now more commonly known simply as 'international sign', the language has continued to develop since the first signs were standardised in 1973, and it is now in widespread use. International sign is distinct in many ways from spoken IALs; many signs are iconic, and signers tend to insert these signs into the grammar of their own sign language, with an emphasis on visually intuitive gestures and mime. A simple sign language called Plains Indian Sign Language was used by indigenous peoples of the Americas.\nGestuno is not to be confused with the separate and unrelated sign language Signuno, which is essentially a Signed Exact Esperanto. Signuno is not in any significant use, and is based on the Esperanto community rather than based on the international Deaf community.\nCriticism.\nThere has been considerable criticism of international auxiliary languages, both in terms of individual proposals, types of proposals, and in more general terms.\nMuch criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of international auxiliary languages, or on the argumentativeness of proponents and their failure to agree on one language, or even on objective criteria by which to judge them. However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs.\nOne criticism already prevalent in the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the extinction of minority languages.\nAlthough referred to as \"international\" languages, most of these languages have historically been constructed on the basis of Western European languages. Esperanto and other languages such as Interlingua and Ido have been criticized for being too European and not global enough. The term \"Euroclone\" was coined to refer to such languages in contrast to \"worldlangs\" with global vocabulary sources.\nSee also.\nSee for a list of designed international auxiliary languages.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After Michael's early death, these setbacks were reversed at the Battle of Khotyn in 1673 by his successor, John III Sobieski, who defeated an Austrian candidate in the election.\nIn 1670 Michael I was married to Eleonora Maria of Austria (1653\u20131697), daughter of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, by his third wife Eleonora Gonzaga. They had one son, who died at birth.\nBiography.\nMichael was the son of Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki and his wife Gryzelda Konstancja Zamoyska. His parents likely met each other in September 1637 in Warsaw during the crowning of Cecilia Renata of Austria, the Queen of Poland and consort to W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV. They were engaged on 13 February 1638, over a month after the death of Gryzelda's father, Tomasz Zamoyski.\nThe wedding took place in Zamo\u015b\u0107 on 27 February 1639, and over a year later, on 31 May 1640, Michael Korybut was most likely born in the village of Bia\u0142y Kamie\u0144 as Micha\u0142 Tomasz Wi\u015bniowiecki. The infant was then taken to Zamo\u015b\u0107, where he spent first two years of his life under care of his grandmother Katarzyna Zamoyska (n\u00e9e Ostrogska). In 1642, Micha\u0142 was taken by his mother to Lubny. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, he fled Left-bank Ukraine with his family and first settled in Wi\u015bniowiec in Volhynia, before arriving in Zamo\u015b\u0107 in autumn 1648.\nJeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki died in 1651, when most of his enormous estate remained under Cossack control. From 1651 \u2013 1655, young Micha\u0142 was under the care of Karol Ferdynand Vasa, the bishop of Wroc\u0142aw and P\u0142ock. The boy stayed at the residence of the Bishops of P\u0142ock, in the town of Brok. After the death of Bishop Vasa on 9 May 1655, he was taken in by his wealthy uncle, Jan Zamoyski, Voivode of Sandomierz, who funded his education. Sometime in mid-1655, Micha\u0142 found himself at the court of King John II Casimir.\nFollowing the Swedish invasion of Poland, Michael, together with the royal court, fled to G\u0142og\u00f3wek in Upper Silesia. On 18 November 1655, following the request of the king, he went to Nysa, to study at the Jesuit College Carolinum and stayed there until March 1656.\nIn mid-1656, thanks to the support of Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, Micha\u0142 Korybut began studying at Charles University in Prague. He returned to Poland in June 1660, but soon afterwards, headed to Dresden and Vienna to meet Empress Eleonora Gonzaga. There he saw his future wife Eleanor of Austria, who was a child at that time, for the first time. On this trip, Michael improved his knowledge of languages; he spoke Latin, German, Italian, French and also likely Tatar and Turkish as well.\nIn 1663, Michel took part in the Russo-Polish War, and during the Lubomirski Rebellion, he loyally supported the king.\nElection.\nOn 16 September 1668, John II Casimir abdicated the Polish throne and left the country to live in France, making a new election necessary. The Bishop of Che\u0142mno, Andrzej Olszowski, suggested that Micha\u0142 Korybut should be listed as one of candidates for the throne. Wi\u015bniowiecki was supported by the Polish nobility, who sensed that a poor and inexperienced prince would not pose a threat to their rights enshrined in the \"Golden Liberty\".\nThe Free election of 1669 took place in May and June of that year. Micha\u0142 Korybut Wi\u015bniowiecki was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania on 19 June and became known as Michael I. Most of the gathered nobility voted for him as they wished to choose a native, Polish candidate (the so-called \"Piast\"), over foreign candidates. Wi\u015bniowiecki won 11,271 votes and was crowned on 29 September 1669 in Krak\u00f3w.\nHis election was immediately opposed by the pro-French camp, led by Primate of Poland Miko\u0142aj Prazmowski and Crown Hetman John Sobieski.\nOn 27 February 1670 Michael I married Austrian princess Eleanor, and the ceremony was celebrated by Papal Nuncio, Cardinal Galeazzo Marescotti, as Primate Prazmowski refused to attend. The reception took place at the Denhoff Palace in Kruszyna.\nInternal conflicts.\nFollowing the 1669 election, the Commonwealth was divided between two camps \u2013 pro-French, and royal. The pro-French camp had several influential members, including Primate Prazmowski, Hetman Sobieski, Andrzej Morsztyn, Voivode of Krak\u00f3w Aleksander Micha\u0142 Lubomirski, Voivode of Ruthenia Stanis\u0142aw Jan Jab\u0142onowski, Voivode of Pozna\u0144 Krzysztof Grzymultowski, and Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Andrzej Trzebicki.\nIn November 1669, the French camp broke the Coronation Sejm, hoping to dethrone Michael and elect Count Charles-Paris d'Orl\u00e9ans-Longueville. In 1670, the internal struggle moved to the local sejmiks, during which the nobility demanded to bring a Sejm lawsuit against Hetman Sobieski. To defend their commander, Sobieski's soldiers formed a Confederation near Trembowla.\nTo make matters worse, the divided Commonwealth was under constant Turkish threat. In 1671, the king supported a rebellion of a unit of Stanis\u0142aw Wy\u017cycki, who, against the explicit order of Sobieski, abandoned Volhynia, leaving the province defenceless. King Michael ordered Wy\u017cycki and his men to spend the winter of 1671/72 in the wealthy \"starostwo\" of Sambor, and paid them their salaries, while Sobieski and his soldiers did not receive any money.\nIn 1672, the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Commonwealth, and the Polish\u2013Ottoman War of 1672\u201376 began. Despite this, the situation in the Polish Crown was still chaotic, with the danger of a civil war. The nobility formed a confederation near Go\u0142\u0105b, demanding the removal of Primate Prazmowski. Its members looted real estate owned by Hetman Sobieski and his family. On 22 November 1672 Lithuanian soldiers formed their own confederation in Kobry\u0144, declaring their support for the Go\u0142\u0105b confederation. In response, soldiers under Sobieski formed a confederation in Szczebrzeszyn. John Sobieski, together with his troops, headed to \u0141owicz, to meet Primate Prazmowski.\nNegotiations between the two factions were carried out by Papal Nuncio Francesco Buonvisi and Bishop of Krak\u00f3w Andrzej Trzebicki. Furthermore, Sultan Mehmed IV of the Ottoman Empire sent an offensive letter to Warsaw, demanding complete subordination of the Commonwealth. This greatly enraged the Poles but due to chaotic internal situation of the Commonwealth, both sides of the conflict reached an agreement in March 1672.\nWar with the Ottoman Empire.\nIn June 1672, a 100,000-strong Ottoman army, under Mehmed IV, besieged the city of Kamieniec Podolski, which capitulated after 26 days. The invaders then approached Lw\u00f3w, which paid a ransom. Mounted Crimean Tatar units penetrated as far as Hrubiesz\u00f3w, Jas\u0142o and Biecz.\nIn October 1672, Hetman John Sobieski, upon request of the senators, tried to stop the invaders, defeating them in the Battle of Niemir\u00f3w, Battle of Komarno, and Battle of Petranka. Meanwhile, the Treaty of Buchach was signed on 18 October, in which the king ceded Podolia to the Ottomans and agreed to pay a yearly tribute. Under these terms, the once mighty Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was humbled by the Turks.\nSoon afterwards, Michael I began preparation for a new military campaign against the Ottomans. On 8 October 1673 at Skwarzawa near Z\u0142ocz\u00f3w, some 40,000 Polish soldiers concentrated, with 50 cannons. Due to poor health, the king handed the command of the army to Sobieski, and the Poles marched southwards, to Chocim.\nDeath, funeral, and legacy.\nKing Michael I Korybut died in the Palace of the Archbishops of Lw\u00f3w, on 10 November 1673. His early demise seems to have been brought about by a severe case of food poisoning, although rumours persisted that he had been murdered by traitorous generals angered at the declining power of the Commonwealth.\nThe day after his death, John Sobieski won the Battle of Chocim, which reversed some of the losses under Michael I's reign. On 19 May 1674 Hetman John Sobieski was elected the new monarch after the Free election of 1674.\nAfter the funeral, the heart of the king was buried at a Camedule Monastery in the Bielany district of Warsaw. The bowels were placed in a wall of the Latin Cathedral in Lw\u00f3w, while the body was buried in Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w on 31 January 1676, the same day that John Sobieski was crowned as John III.\nMichael's reign was considered to be less than successful as his ability to be a capable monarch were greatly hurt by Poland's quarrelling factions. His father's military fame notwithstanding, Michael lost the first phase of the Polish\u2013Ottoman War of 1672\u20131676.\nIn popular culture.\nWi\u015bniowiecki appears as a minor supporting character in the second season of the Netflix comedy series 1670, where he is portrayed by Mikolaj Chrobozek.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The town area spreads along the valley of the river Lahn and has a population of approximately 76,000.\nHaving been awarded town privileges in 1222, Marburg served as capital of the landgraviate of Hessen-Marburg during periods of the 15th to 17th centuries. The University of Marburg was founded in 1527 and dominates the public life in the town to this day.\nMarburg is a historic centre of the pharmaceutical industry in Germany, and there is a plant in the town (by BioNTech) to produce vaccines to tackle COVID-19.\nHistory.\nFounding and early history.\nLike many settlements, Marburg developed at the crossroads of two important early medieval highways: the trade route linking Cologne and Prague and the trade route from the North Sea to the Alps and on to Italy, the former crossing the river Lahn here. A first mention of the settlement dates from 822 in the \"https://\". The settlement was protected and customs were raised by a small castle built during the ninth or tenth century by the Giso. Marburg has been a town since 1140, as proven by coins. From the Gisos, it fell around that time to the Landgraves of Thuringia, residing on the Wartburg above Eisenach.\nSt. Elizabeth of Hungary.\nIn 1228, the widowed princess-landgravine of Thuringia, Elizabeth of Hungary, chose Marburg as her dowager seat, as she did not get along well with her brother-in-law, the new landgrave. The countess dedicated her life to the sick and would become after her early death in 1231, aged 24, one of the most prominent female saints of the era. She was canonized in 1235.\nCapital of Hessen.\nIn 1264, St Elizabeth's daughter Sophie of Brabant, succeeded in winning the Landgraviate of Hessen, hitherto connected to Thuringia, for her son Henry. Marburg (alongside Kassel) was one of the capitals of Hessen from that time until about 1540. Following the first division of the landgraviate, it was the capital of Hessen-Marburg from 1485 to 1500 and again between 1567 and 1605. Hessen was one of the more powerful second-tier principalities in Germany. Its \"old enemy\" was the Archbishopric of Mainz, the seat of one of the prince-electors, who competed with Hessen in many wars and conflicts for coveted territory, stretching over several centuries.\nAfter 1605, Marburg became just another provincial town, known mostly for the University of Marburg. It became a virtual backwater for two centuries after the Thirty Years' War (1618\u201348), when it was fought over by Hessen-Darmstadt and Hesse-Kassel. The Hessian territory around Marburg lost more than two-thirds of its population, which was more than in any later wars (including World War I and World War II) combined.\nReformation.\nMarburg is the seat of the oldest existing Protestant-founded university in the world, the University of Marburg (Philipps-Universit\u00e4t-Marburg), founded in 1527. It is one of the smaller \"university towns\" in Germany. These include Greifswald, Erlangen, Jena, and T\u00fcbingen, as well as the city of Gie\u00dfen, which is located 30\u00a0km south of Marburg.\nIn 1529, Philipp I of Hesse arranged the Marburg Colloquy, to propitiate Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli.\nRomanticism.\nOwing to its neglect during the entire 18th century, Marburg \u2013 like Rye or Chartres \u2013 survived as a relatively intact Gothic town, simply because there was no money spent on any new architecture or expansion. When Romanticism became the dominant cultural and artistic paradigm in Germany, Marburg became a centre of activities once again, and many of the leaders of the movement lived, taught, or studied in Marburg. They formed a circle of friends that was of great importance, especially in literature, philology, folklore, and law.\nThe group included Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the most important jurist of his day and father of the Roman Law adaptation in Germany, as well as the poets, writers, and social activists Achim von Arnim, Clemens Brentano, and especially Bettina von Arnim, Clemens Brentano's sister, who became Achim von Arnim's wife. Most famous internationally, however, were the Brothers Grimm, who collected many of their fairy tales here. The best-known illustrations for the fairy tale editions are by the painter Otto Ubbelohde, who also lived in and near Marburg. The original building inspiring his drawing \"Rapunzel's Tower\" stands in Am\u00f6nau near Marburg. Across the Lahn hills, in the area called Schwalm, the costumes of little girls included a red hood.\nPrussian town.\nIn the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Prince-elector of Hessen had backed Austria. Prussia won and took the opportunity to invade and annex the Electorate of Hessen (as well as Hanover, the city of Frankfurt, and other territories) north of the Main River. However, the pro-Austrian Hesse-Darmstadt remained independent. For Marburg, this turn of events was very positive, because Prussia decided to make Marburg its main administrative centre in this part of the new province Hessen-Nassau and to turn the University of Marburg into the regional academic centre. Thus, Marburg's rise as an administrative and university city began. As the Prussian university system was one of the best in the world at the time, Marburg attracted many respected scholars. However, there was hardly any industry to speak of, so students, professors, and civil servants \u2013 who generally had enough but not much money and paid very little in taxes \u2013 dominated the town.\nEarly 20th century.\nFranz von Papen, vice-chancellor of Germany in 1934, delivered an anti-Nazi speech at the University of Marburg on 17 June.\nDuring World War II, Marburg suffered much less compared to its neighbours Giessen, Siegen and Frankfurt. The city was not seen as a target of opportunity by the Allies and lacked any important industrial sites. Nonetheless, it was still bombed 13 times by the United States Army Air Forces during the bombing of Marburg. From 1942 to 1945, the entire city of Marburg was turned into a hospital, with schools and government buildings turned into wards to augment the existing hospitals. By the spring of 1945, there were over 20,000 patients \u2013 mostly wounded German soldiers. The most significant damage happened at the north side of the city and along the marshalling yards, but the inner city was largely spared, meaning that it survived the war largely intact.\nIn May 1945, the Monuments men officer Walker Hancock set up the first so-called Central Collecting Point in the Marburg State Archives. But since the capacity of the archive building was not sufficient to store the many objects and since other collecting points, for example in Munich, had been set up in the American occupation zone in the meantime, the Marburg facility was closed after more than a year in favor of the Wiesbaden Collecting Point. With the relocation of the sarcophagus of Field Marshal and President Paul von Hindenburg (1847\u20131934) to the Elisabethkirche in August 1946 the project ended. Milton Mayer's 1955 book \"They Thought They Were Free\", which attempted to gage how ordinary German citizens felt about Nazi Germany, used interviews of ten men from Marburg (which it called \"Kronenberg\") as its case study.\nMarburg from 1945.\nPost-war developments included population growth at first due to war refugees, then to increasing significance of the pharmaceutical industry based in Marburg, and an increase in staff and students for the university. The historic town was in danger of thorough decay, but was renovated from 1972. The university now has about 21,000 students (2023).\nGeography.\nMarburg lies on the river Lahn, 25\u00a0km north of Gie\u00dfen. The federal road Bundesstra\u00dfe 3 connects it with Gie\u00dfen and Kassel. It is served by Marburg (Lahn) station (long-distance and local trains) and Marburg S\u00fcd station (local trains).\nThe city is divided into the following 25 boroughs (\"Ortsbezirke\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics.\nAs a larger mid-sized city, Marburg, like six other such cities in Hessen, has a special status as compared to the other municipalities in the district. This means that the city takes on tasks more usually performed by the district so that in many ways it is comparable to an urban district (\"kreisfreie Stadt\"). Before 1974, the city was a district-free city.\nThe mayor of Marburg, Thomas Spies, in office since December 2015, and his predecessor Egon Vaupel (directly elected in January 2005), are members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. His deputy, the head of the building and youth departments, Nadine Bernshausen, is from Alliance '90/The Greens. Following the city parliament elections of March 2021, the majority in the 59-seat city parliament is held by a coalition of Green party (15 seats), SPD (14 seats) and Klimaliste (4 seats) members. Also represented are the factions of the Christian Democratic Union (13 seats), The Left (7 seats), the Free Democratic Party (2 seats), a CDU splinter group MBL (\"Marburger B\u00fcrgerliste\" \u2013 2 seats), the BfM (\"B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr Marburg\" \u2013 2 seats), Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (1 seat), and the Pirate Party (1 seat).https://\nAmong the left wing groups are ATTAC, the Worldshop movement, an autonomist-anarchist scene, and a few groups engaged in ecological or human-rights concerns.\nThe city of Marburg, similar to the cities of Heidelberg, T\u00fcbingen and G\u00f6ttingen, has a rich history of student fraternities or \"Verbindungen\" of various sorts, including Corps, Landsmannschaften, Burschenschaften, Turnierschaften, etc.\nTransport.\nThe nearest airport is Frankfurt Airport, located to the south of Marburg.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nMarburg is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCoat of arms.\nMarburg's coat of arms shows a Hessian landgrave riding a white horse with a flag and a shield on a red background. The shield shows the red-and-white-striped Hessian lion, also to be seen on Hessen's state arms, and the flag shows a stylized M, blue on gold (or yellow). The arms are also the source of the city flag's colors. The flag has three horizontal stripes colored, from top to bottom, red (from the background), white (from the horse) and blue (from the shield).\nThe coat of arms, which was designed in the late nineteenth century, is based on a landgrave seal on a municipal document. It is an example of a very prevalent practice of replacing forgotten coats of arms, or ones deemed not to be representative enough, with motifs taken from seals.\nMarburg virus.\nThe city's name is connected to a filovirus, the Marburg virus, because this disease, a viral hemorrhagic fever resembling ebola, was first recognized and described during an outbreak in the city. In 1967, workers were accidentally exposed to infected green monkey tissue at the city's former industrial plant, the Behring-Werke, then part of Hoechst and today of CSL Behring, founded by Marburg citizen and first Nobel Prize in Medicine winner, Emil Adolf von Behring. During the outbreak, 31 people became infected and seven of them died. The virus is named after the city following the custom of naming viruses after the location of their first recorded outbreak.\nGreen city.\nMany homes have solar panels and in 2008 a law was passed to make the installation of solar systems on new buildings or as part of renovation projects mandatory. 20 percent of heating system requirements ought to have been covered by solar energy in new buildings. Anyone who fails to install solar panels would have been fined \u20ac1,000. The new law, approved on 20 June 2008, should have taken effect in October 2008, however, this law was stopped by the Regierungspr\u00e4sidium Giessen in September 2008.\nLandmarks.\nMarburg remains a relatively unspoilt, spire-dominated, castle-crowned Gothic or Renaissance city on a hill partly because it was isolated between 1600 and 1850. Architecturally, it is famous both for its castle Marburger Schloss and its medieval churches. The Elisabethkirche, as one of the two or three first purely Gothic churches north of the Alps outside France, is an archetype of Gothic architecture in Germany.\nMuch of the physical attractiveness of Marburg is due to Hanno Drechsler who was Lord Mayor between 1970 and 1992. He promoted urban renewal and the restoration of the Oberstadt (upper town) and established one of the first pedestrian zones in Germany. Marburg's \"Altstadtsanierung\" (since 1972) has received many awards and prizes.\nParks in the town include the Old Botanical Garden, as well as the new Botanical Garden outside the town proper.\nThe Marktplatz is the heart of Marburg's old town. In the center is a fountain dedicated to St George, a popular meeting place for young people. To the south is the old town hall and the path running north leads to the palace overlooking the town.\nThe University of Marburg, founded in 1527, is one of Germany's oldest. It is spread over two campuses: Firmanei in the centre of Marburg and Lahnberge to the east of the town near the Botanischer Garten (Botanical Garden).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nIn English\nIn German\nIn Italian"}

As a soldier and later commander, he fought in the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the Russo-Polish War and during the Swedish invasion known as the Deluge. Sobieski demonstrated his military prowess during the war against the Ottoman Empire and established himself as a leading figure in Poland and Lithuania. In 1674, he was elected monarch of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth following the sudden and unexpected death of King Michael.\nSobieski's 22-year reign marked a period of the Commonwealth's stabilization, much needed after the turmoil of previous conflicts. Popular among his subjects, he was an able military leader, most famously for his victory over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. The defeated Ottomans named Sobieski the \"Lion of Lechistan\", and the Pope hailed him as the saviour of Western Christendom. Suffering from poor health and obesity in later life, Sobieski died in 1696 and was buried at Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w. He was succeeded by Augustus II of Poland and Saxony.\nBiography.\nYouth.\nJohn Sobieski was born on 17 August 1629, in Olesko, now in Ukraine, then part of the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth to a renowned noble family de Sobieszyn Sobieski of Janina coat of arms. His father, Jakub Sobieski, was the Voivode of Ruthenia and Castellan of Krak\u00f3w; his mother, Zofia Teofillia Dani\u0142owicz was a granddaughter of Hetman Stanis\u0142aw \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski. John Sobieski spent his childhood in \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiew. After graduating from Bart\u0142omiej Nowodworski College in Krak\u00f3w in 1643, young John Sobieski then graduated from the philosophical faculty of the University of Krak\u00f3w in 1646. After finishing his studies, John and his brother Marek Sobieski left for western Europe, where he spent more than two years travelling. They visited Leipzig, Antwerp, Paris, London, Leiden, and The Hague. During that time, he met influential contemporary figures such as Louis II de Bourbon, Charles II of England and William II, Prince of Orange, and learned French, German, and Italian, in addition to Latin.\nBoth brothers returned to the Commonwealth in 1648. Upon receiving the news of the death of king W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa and the hostilities of the Khmelnytsky Uprising, they volunteered for the army. They both fought in the siege of Zamo\u015b\u0107. They founded and commanded their own banners (\"chor\u0105giew\") of cavalry (one light, \"cossack\", and one heavy, of Polish hussars). Soon, the fortunes of war separated the brothers. In 1649, Jakub fought in the Battle of Zboriv. In 1652, Marek died in Tatar captivity after his capture at the Battle of Batih. John was promoted to the rank of \"pu\u0142kownik\" and fought with distinction in the Battle of Berestechko. In 1653, he voluntarily spent time as a hostage in the Crimean Tatar capital of Bakhchysarai. A promising commander, John was sent by King John II Casimir as one of the envoys in the diplomatic mission of Miko\u0142aj Bieganowski to the Ottoman Empire. There, Sobieski learned the Tatar language and the Turkish language and studied Ottoman military traditions and tactics. It is likely he participated as part of the briefly allied Polish-Tatar forces in the 1655 Battle of Okhmativ.\nAfter the start of the Swedish invasion of Poland, also known as \"The Deluge\", John Sobieski was among the Greater Polish regiments led by Krzysztof Opali\u0144ski, Palatine of Pozna\u0144 which capitulated at Uj\u015bcie, and swore allegiance to King Charles X Gustav of Sweden. However, around late March 1656, he abandoned their side, returning to the side of Polish king John II Casimir Vasa, enlisting under the command of hetmans Stefan Czarniecki and Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski.\nCommander.\nBy 26 May 1656, he received the position of the \"chor\u0105\u017cy koronny\" (Standard-bearer of the Crown). During the three-day-long battle of Warsaw of 1656, Sobieski commanded a 2,000-man strong regiment of Tatar cavalry. He took part in a number of engagements over the next two years, including the Siege of Toru\u0144 in 1658. In 1659, he was elected a deputy to the Sejm (Polish parliament), and was one of the Polish negotiators of the Treaty of Hadiach with the Cossacks. In 1660, he took part in the last offensive against the Swedes in Prussia, and was rewarded with the office of \"starost\" of Stryj. Soon afterward he took part in the war against the Russians, participating in the Battle of Slobodyshche and Battle of Lyubar, and later that year he again was one of the negotiators of a new treaty with the Cossacks (the Treaty of Cudn\u00f3w).\nThrough personal connections, he became a strong supporter of the French faction in the Polish royal court, represented by Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga. His pro-French allegiance was reinforced in 1665, when he married Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d'Arquien and was promoted to the rank of the Crown Grand Marshal.\nIn 1662, he was again elected a deputy to the Sejm, and took part in the work on reforming the military. He was also a member of the Sejm in 1664 and 1665. In between he participated in the Russian campaign of 1663. Sobieski remained loyal to the King during the Lubomirski Rebellion of 1665\u201366, though it was a difficult decision for him. He participated in the Sejm of 1665, and after some delays, accepted the prestigious office of the Marshal of the Crown on 18 May that year. Around late April or early May 1666 he received another high office of the Commonwealth, that of the Field Crown Hetman. Soon afterward, he was defeated at the Battle of M\u0105twy, and signed the Agreement of \u0141\u0119gonice on 21 July, which ended the Lubomirski Rebellion.\nIn October 1667, he achieved another victory over the Cossacks of Petro Doroshenko and their Crimean Tatar allies in the Battle of Podhajce during the Polish\u2013Cossack\u2013Tatar War (1666\u201371). This allowed him to regain his image as a skilled military leader. Later that year, in November, his first child, James Louis Sobieski was born in Paris. On 5 February 1668, he achieved the rank of Grand Hetman of the Crown, the highest military rank in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, and thereby the \"de facto\" commander-in-chief of the entire Polish Army. Later that year he supported the French candidacy of Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9 for the Polish throne, and after this candidacy fell apart, Philip William, Elector Palatine. Following the election of Micha\u0142 Korybut Wi\u015bniowiecki he joined the opposition faction; he and his allies helped veto several sejms (including the coronation ones), and his attitude once again resulted in him losing popularity among the regular \"szlachta\". While his pro-French stance in politics alienated some, his military victories against invading Tatars in 1671 helped him gain other allies. \nThe year 1672 saw internal politics destabilizing the Commonwealth, as the pro-French faction of Sobieski and pro-court faction of King Micha\u0142 formed two confederations, which despite major Ottoman incursions in the south seemed more concerned with one another than with uniting to defend the country. The court faction called openly for confiscation of his estates and dismissal from office, and declared him an \"enemy of the state\". This division culminated in the humiliating Treaty of Buchach, where the Commonwealth was forced to cede territories to the Ottomans, but promise an annual tribute. Sobieski eventually succeeded in balancing politics and national defense, and a combination of his military victories over the invaders, and successful negotiations at the Sejm in April 1673, led to a compromise in which the court faction dropped its demands and challenges against him.\nIn the year 1672, the Polish-Lithuanian Tatars rose up in open rebellion against the Commonwealth. This was the widely remembered Lipka rebellion. Thanks to the efforts of Sobieski, who was held in great esteem by the Tatar soldiers, many of the Lipkas seeking asylum and service in the Ottoman Army returned to his command.\nOn 11 November 1673, Sobieski added a major victory to his list, this time defeating the Ottomans in the Battle of Khotyn and capturing the fortress located there. The news of the battle coincided with the death of King Michal the day before the battle. This made Sobieski one of the leading figures of the state, so on 19 May the following year, he was elected monarch of the Commonwealth. His candidacy was almost universally supported, with only a dozen or so members of the diet opposing him (mainly centered around magnates of the Lithuanian Pac family). In light of the war, requiring Sobieski to be on the front lines, the coronation ceremony was significantly delayed \u2013 he was crowned John III almost two years later, on 2 February 1676.\nKing of Poland.\nThough Poland-Lithuania was at that time the largest and one of the most populous states of Europe, Sobieski became a king of a country devastated by almost half a century of constant war. The treasury was almost empty and the court had little to offer the powerful magnates, who often allied themselves with foreign courts rather than the state.\nSobieski had a number of long-term plans, including establishing his own dynasty in the Commonwealth, regaining lost territories, and strengthening the country through various reforms. One of his ambitions was to unify Christian Europe in a crusade to drive the Turks out of Europe. At the beginning of his reign, however, the Polish state was in dire fiscal straits and faced military threats to the north. King Louis XIV of France promised to mediate a truce between the Ottomans and Poland so that Sobieski could focus his attentions on Prussia. The negotiations ended in failure and Sobieski's Baltic goals had to be tempered by the immediate reality of the Ottoman threat to the south.\nIn the autumn of 1674, he recommenced the war against the Ottomans and managed to recapture a number of cities and fortresses including Bratslav, Mogilev, and Bar, which re-established a strongly fortified line defending Poland's southern border in Ukraine. In 1675, Sobieski defeated a Turkish and Tatar offensive aiming at Lviv. In 1676, the Tatars began a counter-offensive and crossed the Dneper, but could not retake the strategic town of \u017b\u00f3rawno, and a peace treaty (the Treaty of \u017burawno) was signed soon afterwards. Although Kamieniec Podolski and much of Podolia remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, Poland gained the return of the towns of Bila Tserkva and Pavoloch.\nThe treaty with the Ottomans began a period of peace that was much needed for the repair of the country and strengthening of the royal authority. Sobieski managed to reform the Polish army completely. The army was reorganised into regiments, the infantry finally dropped pikes, replacing them with battle-axes, and the Polish cavalry adopted hussar and dragoon formations. Sobieski also greatly increased the number of cannon and introduced new artillery tactics.\nSobieski wanted to conquer Prussia with Swedish troops and French support. Regaining control of this autonomous province was in the Commonwealth's best interest, and Sobieski also hoped for it to become part of his family domain. To this end he made the secret Treaty of Jawor\u00f3w (1675), but he achieved nothing. The wars with the Ottoman Empire were not decisively won by the Commonwealth, the ruler of Brandenburg-Prussia made treaties with France, Prussia defeated the Swedish invasion, and Sobieski's plans for the Commonwealth's own military campaign against Prussia was opposed by Commonwealth magnates, many of them taking the Prussian side. Backed by Brandenburg and Austria, internal enemies of Sobieski even planned to dethrone him and elect Charles of Lorraine.\nThe French-Prussian treaty of 1679 meant that Sobieski lost the major foreign ally for his planned campaign against Prussia; consequently, he started to distance himself from the pro-French faction, which, in turn, resulted in the cooling down of the Polish-French relations. During the Sejm of 1683, the French ambassador was expelled for involvement with a plan to dethrone Sobieski, which definitely marked the end of the Polish-French alliance. At the same time Sobieski made peace with the pro-Habsburg faction and started to gravitate towards an alliance with Austria. This did not end the existence of strong internal opposition to Sobieski; however, it changed a number of allegiances, and further opposition was temporarily weakened through the king's successful political maneuvering, including granting the Grand Hetman office to one of the opposition's chief leaders, Stanis\u0142aw Jan Jab\u0142onowski.\nConscious that Poland lacked allies and risked war against most of its neighbours (a situation similar to the Deluge), Sobieski allied himself by 1683 with Leopold I, of the Holy Roman Empire. Both sides promised to come to one's another aid if their capitals were threatened. The alliance was signed by royal representatives on 31 March 1683 and ratified by the Emperor and Polish parliament within weeks. Although aimed directly against the Ottomans and indirectly against France, it had the advantage of gaining internal support for the defense of Poland's southern borders. This was a beginning of what would become the Holy League, championed by Pope Innocent XI to preserve Christendom.\nMeantime, in the spring of 1683, royal spies uncovered Ottoman preparations for a military campaign. Sobieski feared that the target might be the Polish cities of Lw\u00f3w and Krak\u00f3w. To counteract the threat, Sobieski began the fortification of the cities and ordered universal military conscription. In July, the Austrian envoy asked for Polish assistance. Soon afterward, the Polish army started massing for an expedition against the Ottomans, and in August was joined by Bavarians and Saxon allies under Charles of Lorraine.\nBattle of Vienna.\nSobieski's greatest success came in 1683, with his victory at the Battle of Vienna, in joint command of Polish, Austrian and German troops, against the invading Ottomans under Kara Mustafa. Upon reaching Vienna on 12 September, with the Ottoman Army close to breaching the walls, Sobieski ordered a full attack. In the early morning, the united army of about 65,000\u201376,000 men (including 22,000,\u201327,000 Poles) attacked a Turkish force of about 143,000 men. At about 5:00 pm, after observing the infantry battle from the Kahlenberg hilltop, Sobieski led the Polish cavalry along with Austrians and Germans in a massive charge down the hillside. Soon, the Ottoman battle line was broken and the Ottoman forces scattered in disarray. At 5:30 pm, Sobieski entered the deserted tent of Kara Mustafa and the Battle of Vienna ended.\nThe Pope and other foreign dignitaries hailed Sobieski as the \"Savior of Vienna and Western European civilization.\" In a letter to his wife, he wrote, \"All the common people kissed my hands, my feet, my clothes; others only touched me, saying: 'Ah, let us kiss so valiant a hand!'\"\nThe war against the Ottomans was not yet over, and Sobieski continued the campaign with the Battle of P\u00e1rk\u00e1ny on 7\u20139 October. After early victories, the Polish found themselves a junior partner in the Holy League, gaining no lasting territorial or political rewards. The prolonged and indecisive war also weakened Sobieski's position at home. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories.\nLater years and death.\nAlthough the King spent much time on the battlefields, which could suggest a good state of health, towards the end of his life he became seriously and increasingly ill.\nKing John III Sobieski died in Wilan\u00f3w, Poland on 17 June 1696 from a sudden heart attack. His wife, Marie Casimire Louise, died in 1716 in Blois, France, and her body was returned to Poland. They are interred together in Wawel Cathedral, Krak\u00f3w, although his heart is interred separately in the Church of the Transfiguration in Warsaw, Poland. He was succeeded by Augustus II.\nLegacy and significance.\nSobieski is remembered in Poland as a \"hero king\", victor at Vienna who defeated the Ottoman threat, an image that became particularly well recognized after his story was told in many works of 19th-century literature. In the \"Polish Biographical Dictionary\" he is described as \"an individual above his contemporaries, but still one of them\"; an oligarch and a magnate, interested in personal wealth and power. His ambitions for the most part were instilled in him by his beloved wife, whom he undoubtedly loved more than any throne (when being forced to divorce her and marry the former Queen as a condition to gain the throne, he immediately refused the throne) and tended to obey, at times blindly.\nHe failed to reform the ailing Commonwealth, and to secure the throne for his heir. At the same time, he displayed high military prowess, he was well educated and literate, and a patron of science and arts. He supported the astronomer Johannes Hevelius, mathematician Adam Adamandy Kocha\u0144ski and the historian and poet Wespazjan Kochowski. His Wilan\u00f3w Palace became the first of many palaces that would dot the lands of the Commonwealth over the next two centuries.\nIn 2024, the city of Vienna rejected a monument to King Jan Sobieski due to concerns about Islamophobia and anti-Turkish sentiment.\nFamily.\nOn 5 July 1665, he married the widow of Jan \"Sobiepan\" Zamoyski, Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d'Arquien (1641\u20131716), of Nevers, Burgundy, France. Their children were:\nPopular culture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When he turned to go back to the camp, he discovered that there was another man up on this hill, a stone's throw away: some kind of monk or holy man, perhaps, as he was dressed in a rough sackcloth robe, with no finery. But then the bloke whipped out a sword. It was not one of your needle-thin rapiers, such as fops pushed at each other in the streets of London and Paris, but some kind of relic of the Crusades, a two-handed production with a single crossbar instead of a proper guard\u2014the sort of thing Richard the Lionhearted might've used to slay camels in the streets of Jerusalem. This man went down on one knee in the dirt, and he did it with verve and enthusiasm. You see your rich man kneeling in church and it takes him two or three minutes, you can hear his knees popping and sinews creaking, he totters this way and that, creating small alarums amongst the servants who are gripping his elbows. But this brute knelt easily, even \"lustily\" if such a thing were possible, and facing toward the city of Vienna, he planted his sword in the ground so that it became a steel cross. The morning light was shining directly into his grizzled face and glinting from the steel of the blade and glowing in some indifferent colored jewels set into the weapon's hilt and crossbar. The man bowed his head and took to mumbling in Latin. The hand that wasn't holding the sword was thumbing through a rosary\u2014Jack's cue to exit stage right. But as he was leaving he recognized the man with the broadsword as King John Sobieski.\u2014\u200a\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48308", "revid": "33688363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48308", "title": "Dartmouth Dam", "text": "Dartmouth Dam is a large rock-fill embankment dam with an uncontrolled chute spillway across the Mitta Mitta, Gibbo and Dart rivers, the Morass Creek and a number of small tributaries. The dam is located near Mount Bogong in the north-east of the Australian state of Victoria. The dam's purpose includes irrigation, the generation of hydro-electric power, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Dartmouth Reservoir, sometimes called Lake Dartmouth. The Dartmouth Power Station, a hydro-electric power station that generates power to the national grid, is located near the dam wall. The dam is Australia's tallest dam, at .\nA smaller pond, called the Dartmouth Dam Regulating Pond or Banimboola Pondage, approximately downstream of the main dam, also across the Mitta Mitta River, is located adjacent the Banimboola Hydroelectric Power Station and forms part of the Dartmouth Dam complex of facilities.\nLocation and features.\nDesigned by the State Rivers &amp; Water Supply Commission of Victoria, construction commenced in 1973 and was completed in 1979 by Thiess Brothers, at a cost of A$179\u00a0million. The embankment dam wall is constructed with an earth core and rock fill, rising to a height of from the lowest part of the foundation to the roadway across the top of the dam, making the dam wall the highest in Australia. \nThe core component materials of the wall include of rock, of filter material made from crushed quarried rock, and of earth for the core. The reservoir has a capacity of , or approximately 6.7 times the capacity of Sydney Harbour; and can release a maximum outflow of approximately per day in normal operation.\nThe crest of the uncontrolled spillway is AHD and is approximately long. When full, flood flows spill over the crest and down an concrete chute. The water then returns to the river via an open rock cascade which gradually widens to at river level. Once Dartmouth Reservoir reaches 99% capacity, it is considered to be 'operationally full'. Releases are then set to pass inflows downstream to prevent the level rising further.\nReleases are passed through the outlet works and power station whenever possible. Water will only flow over the spillway if significant flood inflows enter from upstream when the storage is close to full. This approach reduces the chance of downstream flooding, maximises operating flexibility for hydro-power generation, and protects the spillway.\nThe Dartmouth Dam stores water from the Victorian High Country's snow fields for summer release into the Mitta Mitta, and the downstream Lake Hume, and into the greater Murray River for irrigation. The reservoir's inflow and outflow capacity is quite small considering its size, meaning that its levels vary little compared with some other dams on the Murray and their tributaries.\nThe reservoir is a popular recreational trout fishery, being regularly restocked by the Victorian Department of Primary Industries.\nHydro-electric power generation.\nDesigned by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, and constructed by Lewis Constructions, and commissioned in January 1981, Dartmouth Power Station has one Francis turbine-generator, with a generating capacity of , the largest single installed hydroelectric turbine in Australia. It is owned and operated by AGL Energy.\nPower station damage.\nOn 2 May 1990, the 180 MW Francis turbine-generator running at full speed was instantaneously stopped by a foreign body left in the penstock following maintenance. The installation shifted about 2 m within the base of the earth and rock fill gravity dam wall of the 3,906 GL reservoir. After initial consternation regarding the integrity of the wall, declared safe after lengthy assessment), the hydro installation was repaired/replaced, but was off-line for several years. \nA breach of the wall would have obliterated a couple of small towns and a sparsely settled agricultural area in the relatively narrow 120\u00a0km Mitta Mitta valley below the dam. More significantly, it would have resulted in the over-topping and probable failure of the earthen walls of the , 3,038 GL Lake Hume, 200\u00a0km downstream on the Murray River. This is immediately upstream of the regional cities of Albury and Wodonga, and a much more intensively settled irrigation area, and consequences would have been disastrous.\nIn May 1990, the turbine casing and concrete machine block surrounding the power station were destroyed, when two steel beams entered the turbine. The resulting force ruined the power station and the dam's control systems, making it impossible to gradually release water from the near-capacity dam by conventional means. An improvised system, placing large pipes over the spillway to siphon water over it, was soon installed. The inflow from an unusually wet spring meant that the dam would have overflowed anyway, leading to a spectacular cascade over the huge rock steps, formed when the rock used for the dam was quarried from the valley walls. The station was re-built and recommissioned in 1993.\nPondage expansion.\nIn 2003, the capacity of the regulating pondage was increased to further optimise the power station's generation flexibility. The station is connected to the electricity grid via a 220 kV transmission line to Mount Beauty, away.\nEcological impact on the Murray\u2013Darling Basin.\nThe construction and operation of Dartmouth Dam has caused significant changes to the flow patterns and ecology of the Mitta Mitta and Murray rivers. In particular, the unnaturally cold water released from the dam, up to 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) colder than it naturally should be, contributed directly to the disappearance of the Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch from the Mitta Mitta River within the first few years of the start of the dam's existence. Cold water pollution caused by Dartmouth Dam is also considered to have contributed to the disappearance of the freshwater catfish from the upper reaches of the Murray River.\nClimate.\nClimate data for the region are sourced at the bottom of the dam wall, in a relatively sheltered spot at above sea level, just outside the town of Dartmouth on Horsfall Rd. Rainfall records began in 1918. Temperature records began in 1975.

It is based on a system of coordinates to identify each square on the board uniquely. It is now almost universally used by books, magazines, newspapers and software, and is the only form of notation recognized by FIDE, the international chess governing body.\nAn early form of algebraic notation was invented by the Syrian player Philip Stamma in the 18th century. In the 19th century, it came into general use in German chess literature and was subsequently adopted in Russian chess literature. Descriptive notation, based on abbreviated natural language, was generally used in English language chess publications until the 1980s. Similar descriptive systems were in use in Spain and France. A few players still use descriptive notation, but it is no longer recognized by FIDE, and may not be used as evidence in the event of a dispute.\nThe term \"algebraic notation\" may be considered a misnomer, as the system is unrelated to algebra.\nNaming the squares.\nEach square of the board is identified by a unique coordinate pair\u2014a letter and a number\u2014from White's point of view. The vertical columns of squares, called \"&lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;files&lt;/dfn&gt;\", are labeled \"a\" through \"h\" from White's left (the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;queenside&lt;/dfn&gt;) to right (the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;kingside&lt;/dfn&gt;). The horizontal rows of squares, called \"&lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;ranks&lt;/dfn&gt;\", are numbered \"1\" to \"8\" starting from White's side of the board. Thus each square has a unique identification of file letter followed by rank number. For example, the initial square of White's king is designated as \"e1\".\nNaming the pieces.\nEach piece type (other than pawns) is identified by an uppercase letter. English-speaking players use the letters \"K\" for king, \"Q\" for queen, \"R\" for rook, \"B\" for bishop and \"N\" for knight. Different initial letters are used by other languages.\nIn modern chess literature, especially that intended for an international audience, the language-specific letters are usually replaced by universally recognized piece symbols; for example, \u265ec6 in place of Nc6. This style is known as \"figurine algebraic notation\". The Unicode Miscellaneous Symbols set includes all the symbols necessary for figurine algebraic notation.\nNotation for moves.\nIn standard (or short-form) algebraic notation, each move of a piece is indicated by the piece's uppercase letter, plus the coordinates of the destination square. For example, Be5 (bishop moves to e5), Nf3 (knight moves to f3). For pawn moves, a letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, c5 (pawn moves to c5).\nCaptures.\nWhen a piece makes a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;capture&lt;/dfn&gt;, an \"x\" is inserted immediately before the destination square. For example, Bxe5 (bishop captures the piece on e5). When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn. For example, exd5 (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5).\n\"En passant\" captures are indicated by specifying the capturing pawn's file of departure, the \"x\", the destination square (not the square of the captured pawn) and (optionally) the suffix \"e.p.\" indicating the capture was \"en passant\". For example, exd6 e.p.\nSometimes a multiplication sign (\u00d7) or a colon (:) is used instead of \"x\", either in the middle (B:e5) or at the end (Be5:). Some publications, such as the \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\" (\"ECO\"), omit any indication that a capture has been made; for example, Be5 instead of Bxe5; ed6 instead of exd6 or exd6\u00a0e.p.\nWhen it is unambiguous to do so, a pawn capture is sometimes described by specifying only the files involved (exd or even ed). These shortened forms are sometimes called \"abbreviated algebraic notation\" or \"minimal algebraic notation\".\nDisambiguating moves.\nWhen two (or more) identical pieces can move to the same square, the moving piece is uniquely identified by specifying the piece's letter, followed by (in descending order of preference):\nIf neither file nor rank alone is sufficient to identify the piece (such as when three or more pieces of the same type can move to the same square), then both are specified (double disambiguation).\nIn the diagram, both black rooks could legally move to f8, so the move of the d8-rook to f8 is disambiguated as Rdf8. For the white rooks on the a-file which could both move to a3, it is necessary to provide the rank of the moving piece, i.e., R1a3.\nIn the case of the white queen on h4 moving to e1, neither the rank nor file alone are sufficient to disambiguate from the other white queens. As such, this move is written Qh4e1.\nAs above, an \"x\" can be inserted to indicate a capture; for example, if the final case were a capture, it would be written as Qh4xe1.\nPawn promotion.\nWhen a pawn promotes, the piece promoted to is indicated at the end. For example, a pawn on e7 promoting to a queen on e8 may be variously rendered as e8Q, e8=Q, e8(Q), e8/Q etc.\nCastling.\nCastling is indicated by the special notations 0-0 (for &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;kingside&lt;/dfn&gt; castling) and 0-0-0 (&lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;queenside&lt;/dfn&gt; castling). O-O and O-O-O (letter O rather than digit 0) are also commonly used.\nCheck.\nA move that places the opponent's king in check usually has the symbol \"+\" appended. Alternatively, sometimes a dagger (\u2020) or the abbreviation \"ch\" is used. Some publications indicate a discovered check with an abbreviation such as \"dis ch\", or with a specific symbol. Double check is usually indicated the same as check, but is sometimes represented specifically as \"dbl ch\" or \"++\", particularly in older chess literature. Some publications such as \"ECO\" omit any indication of check.\nCheckmate.\nCheckmate at the completion of moves is represented by the symbol \"#\" in standard FIDE notation and PGN. The word \"mate\" is commonly used instead; occasionally a double dagger (\u2021) or a double plus sign (++) is used, although the double plus sign is also used to represent \"double check\" when a king is under attack by two enemy pieces simultaneously. A checkmate is represented by \"\u2260\" (the not equal sign) in the macOS chess application. In Russian and ex-USSR publications, where captures are indicated by \":\", checkmate can also be represented by \"X\" or \"x\".\nDraw offer.\nFIDE specifies draw offers to be recorded by an equals sign with parentheses \"(=)\" after the move on the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;score sheet&lt;/dfn&gt;. This is not usually included in published game scores.\nEnd of game.\nThe notation 1\u20130 at the completion of moves indicates that White won, 0\u20131 indicates that Black won and \u00bd\u2013\u00bd indicates a draw. In case of &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;forfeit&lt;/dfn&gt;, the scores 0\u20130, \u00bd\u20130 and 0\u2013\u00bd are also possible. In case of loss by default, results are +/\u2212, \u2212/+ or \u2212/\u2212.\nExcept in the case of checkmate, there is no information in the notation regarding the circumstance of the final result. Merely 1\u20130 or 0\u20131 is written whether a player resigned, lost due to time control or forfeited; in the case of a draw \u00bd\u2013\u00bd is written whether the draw was decided by mutual agreement, repetition, stalemate, 50-move rule or dead position. Sometimes direct information is given by words such as \"resigns\", \"draw agreed\" etc., but this is not considered part of the notation, rather a part of the narrative text.\nSimilar notations.\nBesides standard (or short form) algebraic notation already described, several similar systems have been used.\nLong algebraic notation.\nIn long algebraic notation, also known as fully expanded algebraic notation, both the starting and ending squares are specified, for example: e2e4. Sometimes these are separated by a hyphen, e.g. Nb1-c3, while captures are indicated by an \"x\", e.g. Rd3xd7. Long algebraic notation takes more space and is no longer commonly used in print; however, it has the advantage of clarity. Both short and long algebraic notation are acceptable for keeping a record of the moves on a scoresheet, as is required in FIDE rated games.\nA form of long algebraic notation (without piece names) is also used by the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) standard, which is a common way for graphical chess programs to communicate with chess engines, e.g. e2e4, e1g1 (castling), e7e8q (promotion).\nICCF numeric notation.\nIn international correspondence chess the use of algebraic notation may cause confusion, since different languages employ different names (and therefore different initial letters) for the pieces, and some players may be unfamiliar with the Latin alphabet. Hence, the standard for transmitting moves by post or email is ICCF numeric notation, which identifies squares using numerical coordinates, and identifies both the departure and destination squares. For example, the move 1.e4 is rendered as 1.5254. In recent years, the majority of correspondence games have been played on on-line servers rather than by email or post, leading to a decline in the use of ICCF numeric notation.\nPGN.\nPortable Game Notation (PGN) is a text-based file format for storing chess games, which uses standard English algebraic notation and a small amount of markup. PGN can be processed by almost all chess software, as well as being easily readable by humans. For example, the Game of the Century could be represented as follows in PGN:\nFormatting.\nA game or series of moves is generally written in one of two ways; in two columns, as White/Black pairs, preceded by the move number and a period:\n1. e4 e5\n2. Nf3 Nc6\n3. Bb5 a6\nor horizontally:\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6\nMoves may be interspersed with commentary, called \"annotations\". When the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;game score&lt;/dfn&gt; resumes with a Black move, an ellipsis (...) fills the position of the White move, for example:\n1. e4 e5 2. Nf3\nWhite attacks the black e-pawn.\n2... Nc6\nBlack defends and develops simultaneously.\n3. Bb5\nWhite plays the Ruy Lopez.\n3... a6\nBlack elects Morphy's Defense.\nAnnotation symbols.\nThough not technically a part of algebraic notation, the following are some symbols commonly used by annotators, for example in publications \"Chess Informant\" and \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\", to give editorial comment on a move or position. \nThe symbol chosen is appended to the end of the move notation, for example, in the Soller Gambit: 1.d4 e5?! 2.dxe5 f6 3.e4! Nc6 4.Bc4+/\u2212. \nHistory.\nDescriptive notation was usual in the Middle Ages in Europe. A form of algebraic chess notation that seems to have been borrowed from Muslim chess, however, appeared in Europe in a 12th-century manuscript referred to as \"MS. Paris Fr. 1173 (PP.)\". The files run from \"a\" to \"h\", just as they do in the current standard algebraic notation. The ranks, however, are also designated by letters, with the exception of the 8th\u00a0rank which is distinct because it has no letter. The ranks are lettered in reverse \u2013 from the 7th to the 1st: \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"o\", \"p\", \"q\".\nAnother system of notation using only letters appears in a book of Mediaeval chess, Rechenmeister Jacob K\u00f6bel's \"Schachzabel Spiel\" of 1520.\nAlgebraic notation exists in various forms and languages and is based on a system developed by Philipp Stamma in the 1730s. Stamma used the modern names of the squares (and may have been the first to number the ranks), but he used \"p\" for pawn moves and the capital original &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;file&lt;/dfn&gt; of a piece (\"A\" through \"H\") instead of the initial letter of the piece name as used now. Piece letters were introduced in the 1780s by Moses Hirschel, and Johann Allgaier with Aaron Alexandre developed the modern castling notation in the 1810s.\nAlgebraic notation was described in 1847 by Howard Staunton in his book \"The Chess-Player's Handbook\". Staunton credits the idea to German authors, and in particular to \"Alexandre, Jaenisch and the \"Handbuch\" [\"des Schachspiels\"]\". While algebraic notation has been used in German and Russian chess literature since the 19th century, the Anglosphere was slow to adopt it, using descriptive notation for much of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, algebraic notation gradually became more common in English language publications, and by 1980 it had become the prevalent notation. In 1981, FIDE stopped recognizing descriptive notation, and algebraic notation became the accepted international standard.\nPiece names in various languages.\nThe table contains names for all the pieces as well as the words for chess, check and checkmate in several languages. Several languages use the Arabic loanword \"alfil\" for the piece called \"bishop\" in English; in this context it is a chess-specific term which no longer has its original meaning of \"elephant\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their specific form and offerings can vary significantly by country.\nHistory.\nThe first \"milk bar\" was established in 1896 by a milk farmer Stanis\u0142aw D\u0142u\u017cewski who established \"Nad\u015bwidrza\u0144ska\" at Nowy \u015awiat in Warsaw. Food items of Nad\u015bwidrza\u0144ska's menu included: premium quality milk and butter, twaro\u017cek (sour cottage cheese spread), kefir, zsiad\u0142e mleko (soured milk served cold with cooked potatoes and sprinkled with dill), white coffee, offered along with baked goods, such as freshly baked rye sourdough bread (\"chleby pytlowy\"), crispy Warsaw Kaiser rolls, \"rogaliki\", \"maglowniczki\", \"solanki\", and scrambled egg. \nNad\u015bwidrza\u0144ska was a response to a contemporary emerging health culture, offering simple, natural products; kefir was commonly consumed among the middle class. The clientele was diverse and included working class, working people with university educations, artists, and socialites. \nBy 1918, the concept of milk bars, known as \"mleczarnia\" or \"bar mleczny\", had become widespread throughout Poland. They were subsidized by the government as a poverty reduction measure, providing affordable and nutritious meals. Visits to the milk bars increased during the interwar period, particularly during the Great Depression. Later on, milk bars would also offer ice cream as an item on their menu.\nBy the 1930s, the idea reached Britain from the US. In 1933, a milk farmer Robert William Griffiths established one of Britain's first milk bar in Colwyn Bay which later grew into a chain known as National Milk Bar company. The concept soon spread in Great Britain further, encouraged by the Temperance Society as a morally acceptable alternative to the pub, and over 1,000 milk bars had opened nationally by the end of 1936.\nMilk bars were known in the United States at least as early as 1940 as evidenced by contemporary radio recordings. By the late 1940s, milk bars had evolved to not only sell groceries, but were also places where young people could buy ready-made food and non-alcoholic drinks, and could socialise. Milk bars often had jukeboxes and pinball machines (later upgraded to video games), with tables and chairs to encourage patrons to linger and spend more money.\nThe milk bar as a social venue was gradually replaced by fast food franchises, such as McDonald's, and shopping malls. Much of the elaborate decor has disappeared from the remaining milk bars. They are still found in many areas, often serving as convenience stores.\nModern day.\nAmerica.\nUnited States.\nA \"dairy bar\" is the term for a similar restaurant/store common in the Northeastern United States, especially upstate New York, which is a large producer of dairy products. A \"malt shop\" (named for the ingredient in a malted milkshake) is very similar to a milk or dairy bar, serving milkshakes and soft drinks as well as limited foods, such as hamburgers and sandwiches. Although there are still a few around, these have largely fallen out of fashion in favor of fast food.\nEurope.\nPoland.\nThe term bar mleczny (lit.\u2009'milk bar') continues to be used in Poland to describe cafeterias offering nutritious, often traditional Polish, food for low prices. While historically known for their dairy-based dishes, milk bars today also serve a wide variety of other affordable meals. In 2011, the Polish government began to withdraw their subsidies which led to protests by people opposed to their closure. However, they continue to be supported by the state.\nThe menu of milk bars in Poland would typically include the following dishes:\nThese dishes are now associated with wider Polish cuisine. While milk bars today may offer a wider range of dishes, including some with meat, the core remains dairy-centric meals that were historically central to their identity.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Milk Bar franchise was founded in 1933 by Robert William Griffiths as an ordinary caf\u00e9/restaurant chain which is related to the original milk bars in name only. Once numbering around 20 outlets, which were located in Wales and in England near the Welsh border, now only one remains. In the UK, corner shops serve a similar function to milk bars in modern Australia, providing everyday groceries, sweets, newspapers and such.\nThere is a campaign in the United Kingdom to encourage schoolchildren to consume more dairy products, by installing 'milk bars' in schools. The idea is that if the dairy products are attractively presented and properly stored, the children will be more willing to buy them. The organisers behind the project work to develop links with school caterers, so that the handling of milk and dairy produce can be improved, and they promote milk consumption and encourage milk drinking to become a habit that will be carried into adulthood. The milk bar project has been extremely successful in Scotland for 18 years, and it is currently being extended across England and Wales.\nOceania.\nIn Australia, a milk bar is a suburban local general store which can include delicatessens or \"delis\" and corner shops or corner stores. Similar, but not identical, establishments include tuck shops. Milk bars are traditionally a place where people buy newspapers, and fast-food items such as fish and chips, hamburgers, milkshakes, and snacks. They are essentially a smaller-scale suburban form of the convenience store but are more likely to be \"mum and dad\" small businesses rather than larger franchised operations. The term is also found in New Zealand, alongside the more local term dairy.\nMilk bars in Australia today almost universally sell ice creams, lollies, chocolate bars, soft drinks, newspapers, bread, cigarettes and occasionally fast food. Most generally serve milk (in cartons or bottles) or other dairy related products. Although there are far fewer milk bars than there were during the 1970s and 80s due to changing shopping habits, most people living in suburban areas still have a milk bar within walking distance or a short drive of their home. Today, many of them are owned by immigrants of different generations. In conducting researches on the linguistic changes occurring in Sydney, Horvath (1985) discussed the case of immigrant milk bar owners and how diverse their social status can be. Some of them run a small family business while others own several chains. This proved relevant for a new approach to concepts of status and class in Australia as opposed to the United States.\nThe term dairy is also used for these establishments in some places, particularly in New Zealand.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together, they make up the largest waterfall system in the world. The falls divide the river into the upper and lower Iguazu. The Iguazu River rises near the heart of the city of Curitiba. For most of its course, the river flows through Brazil; however, most of the falls are on the Argentine side. Below its confluence with the San Antonio River, the Iguazu River forms the border between Argentina and Brazil.\nThe name \"Iguaz\u00fa\" comes from the Guarani or Tupi words , meaning 'water', and , meaning 'big'. Legend has it that a deity planned to marry a beautiful woman named Naip\u00ed, who fled with her mortal lover Tarob\u00e1 in a canoe. In a rage, the deity sliced the river, creating the waterfalls and condemning the lovers to an eternal fall. The first European to record the existence of the falls was the Spanish Conquistador \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca in 1541. It was inscribed into the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2013.\nGeology and geography.\nThe staircase character of the falls consists of a two-step waterfall formed by three layers of basalt. The steps are in height. The columnar basalt rock sequences are part of the Serra Geral formation within the Paleozoic-Mesozoic Paran\u00e1 Basin. The tops of these sequences are characterized by of highly resistant vesicular basalt and the contact between these layers controls the shape of the falls. Headwater erosion rates are estimated at . Numerous islands along the edge divide the falls into many separate waterfalls and cataracts, varying between high. The number of these smaller waterfalls fluctuates from 150 to 300, depending on the water level. About half of the river's flow falls into a long and narrow chasm called the Devil's Throat ( in Spanish or in Portuguese).\nThe Devil's Throat canyon is wide and deep. Left of this canyon, another part of the river forms 160\u2013200 individual falls, which merge into a single front during the flood stage. The largest falls are named San Mart\u00edn, Adam and Eva, Penoni, and Bergano.\nAbout of the length does not have water flowing over it. The water of the lower Iguazu collects in a canyon that drains into the Paran\u00e1 River, a short distance downstream from the Itaipu Dam. The junction of the water flows marks the border between Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Some points in the cities of Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Brazil, Puerto Iguaz\u00fa, Argentina, and Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, have access to the Iguazu River, where the borders of all three nations may be seen, a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the three cities.\nThe layout of Iguazu Falls resembles a reversed letter \"J\". The Argentina\u2013Brazil border runs through the Devil's Throat. On the right bank is the Brazilian territory, which is home to more than 95% of the Iguazu River basin but has just over 20% of the jumps of these falls, and the left side jumps are Argentine, which make up almost 80% of the falls.\nAccess.\nThe falls may be reached from two main towns, with one on either side of the falls: Foz do Igua\u00e7u in Brazil and Puerto Iguaz\u00fa in Argentina, as well as from Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, on the other side of the Paran\u00e1 River from Foz do Igua\u00e7u, each of those three cities having commercial airports. The falls are shared by the Iguaz\u00fa National Park (Argentina) and Igua\u00e7u National Park (Brazil). The two parks were designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1984 and 1986, respectively.\nThe first proposal for a Brazilian national park aimed at providing a pristine environment to \"future generations\", just as \"it had been created by God\" and endowed with \"all possible preservation, from the beautiful to the sublime, from the picturesque to the awesome\" and \"an unmatched flora\" located in the \"magnificent Igua\u00e7u waterfalls\". These were the words used by Andr\u00e9 Rebou\u00e7as, an engineer, in his book \"Provinces of Paran\u00e1, Railways to Mato Grosso and Bolivia\", which started up the campaign aimed at preserving the Igua\u00e7u Falls in 1876. At this time, Yellowstone National Park in the US, the first national park in the world, was four years old.\nOn the Brazilian side, a walkway along the canyon has an extension to the lower base of Devil's Throat. Helicopter rides offering aerial views of the falls have been available from Brazil, but Argentina has prohibited such helicopter tours because of the adverse environmental impact on the flora and fauna of the falls. \nAerol\u00edneas Argentinas has direct flights from Buenos Aires to Iguazu International Airport. Azul, GOL, and LATAM Brasil offer services from main Brazilian cities to Foz do Igua\u00e7u. From Foz do Igua\u00e7u airport, the park may be reached by taking a taxi or bus to the entrance of the park. Their park has an entrance fee on both sides. Once inside, free and frequent buses are provided to various points within the park. The town of Foz do Igua\u00e7u is about away, and the airport is between the park and the town.\nThe Argentine access, across the forest, is by a Rainforest Ecological Train very similar to the one in Disney's Animal Kingdom. The train brings visitors to the entrance of Devil's Throat, as well as the upper and lower trails. The \"Paseo Garganta del Diablo\" is a trail that brings visitors directly over the falls of Devil's Throat, the highest and deepest of the falls. Other walkways allow access to the elongated stretch of falls across the forest on the Argentine side and to the boats that connect to San Martin Island. Also on the Argentine side, inflatable boat services take visitors very close to the falls.\nThe Brazilian transportation system aims at allowing an increase in the number of visitors, while reducing the adverse environmental impact, through an increase in the average number of passengers per vehicle inside the park. The new transportation system has a 72-passenger capacity and panoramic-view, double-deck buses.\nComparison with other notable falls.\nUpon seeing Iguazu, the United States First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt reportedly exclaimed, \"Poor Niagara!\" (which, at 50 m or 165 feet, are a third shorter). Often, Iguazu also is compared with Victoria Falls in Southern Africa, which separates Zambia and Zimbabwe. Iguazu is wider but is split into roughly 275 distinct falls and large islands, whereas Victoria has the largest curtain of water in the world, at more than wide and over in height (in low flow, Victoria is split into five by islands but in high flow, it may be uninterrupted). The only wider falls are extremely large rapid-like falls, such as the Boyoma Falls (Stanley Falls).\nWith the flooding of the Gua\u00edra Falls in 1982, Iguazu currently has the sixth-greatest average annual flow of any waterfall in the world, following number five Niagara, with an average rate of . Its maximum recorded flow was on 9 June 2014. By comparison, the average flow of Niagara Falls is , with a maximum recorded flow of . The average flow at Victoria Falls is , with a maximum recorded flow of .\nClimate.\nThe Iguazu Falls experience a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\", according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification) with abundant precipitation and high temperatures year-round. During the summer of 2006, a severe drought caused the Iguazu River to become diminished, reducing the amount of water flowing over the falls to until early December. This was unusual, as dry periods normally last only a few weeks. The period with the greatest volume of water flowing over the falls is usually December to February, coinciding with one of the periods of greatest rainfall.\nPopular culture.\nIguazu Falls has been featured in several TV shows and films, including:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dulles International Airport (IAD), in Dulles, Virginia, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), in Crystal City, Virginia, are the other two.\nThe airport serves as one of 12 U.S.-based operating bases for Southwest Airlines. In 2023, BWI recorded 12,849,636 passenger enplanements, making it the busiest airport in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area, ranked at #23 in passenger enplanements in the U.S., followed by Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (#24) and Washington/Dulles Int'l Airport (#26).\nIn 2024, BWI ranked second in the Baltimore/Washington area with 27.06 million passengers served (slightly behind the 27.25 million passengers served at Washington/Dulles Int'l Airport), just missing the record set in 2019.\nIn 2005, the airport was named in honor of Thurgood Marshall, a Baltimore native and the first African American to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nPlanning for a new airport on to serve the Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area began in 1944, just prior to the end of World War II, when the Baltimore Aviation Commission announced its decision that the best location to build a new airport would be on a tract of land near Linthicum Heights, Maryland. The cost of building the airport was estimated at $9\u00a0million.\nThe site was chosen because it was a 15-minute drive from Downtown Baltimore, close to the Pennsylvania Railroad line, the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad line, and the proposed Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway, and visibility at the site was generally good. An alternate site along Gov. Ritchie Highway at Furnace Branch was rejected by the United States Department of War, and another possible site at Lipin's Corner was deemed too far from Baltimore. The State Aviation Commission approved of the Linthicum Heights site in 1946.\nMuch of the land was purchased from Friendship Methodist Church in 1946, and ground was broken on May 2, 1947. Friendship Methodist Church held its last service on Easter Sunday in 1948. Friendship Methodist Church was razed to make room for the new airport. In addition, several pieces of land were bought, and 170 bodies buried in a cemetery were moved. Baltimore\u2013Fort Meade Road was moved to the west to make way for the airport's construction.\nFriendship International Airport was dedicated on June 24, 1950, by President Harry S. Truman. Truman arrived in a Douglas DC-6, then the official presidential airplane, from nearby Washington National Airport. Accompanying Truman were the Governor of Maryland, William Preston Lane Jr., and Baltimore Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., who was taking his first aircraft flight. The cost to construct the airport totaled $15\u00a0million. The following month, the airlines moved to the new airport from the old Baltimore Municipal Airport at Harbor Field in southeast Baltimore at . Eastern Airlines flew the first scheduled flight, a DC-3, into the airport at 12:01 am on July 23, 1950. Seven minutes later, the same plane was also the first flight to depart from the airport. Three hundred spectators came to watch the first flights arrive and depart.\nThe \"Official Airline Guide\" reports 52 weekday departures from the airport as of April 1957: 19 Eastern, 12 Capital, 8 American, four National, three TWA, three United, two Delta, and one Allegheny. The departures included a couple nonstop flights to Miami, but westward nonstop flights did not reach beyond Ohio. The airport's reach expanded when jet service started. The early Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s could not use Washington National Airport, and Dulles International Airport, which opened in 1962, had not yet opened, so Baltimore became Washington, D.C.'s jet airport from May 1959 to June 1959, when American and TWA began transcontinental 707 flights. By 1963, Friendship Int'l Airport was equipped with a 9,450 foot (2,880 m) runway, which could handle any commercial jet aircraft at that time.\nIn 1972, the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) purchased Friendship International Airport from the City of Baltimore for $36 million. Under MDOT, the Maryland State Aviation Administration took over airfield operations, and the airport grew from three employees to more than 200. Plans to upgrade, improve, and modernize all Maryland airport facilities were announced almost immediately by Harry Hughes, then Maryland Secretary of Transportation and later Governor of Maryland.\nOn November 16, 1973, in an effort to attract passengers from the Washington metropolitan area, particularly Montgomery and Prince George's counties in suburban Maryland, the airport was renamed Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Its IATA code, originally BAL, was changed to BWI by the International Air Transport Association on April 20, 1980, and the change became official six months later, on October 26. The BWI code had previously been used by an airport in Bewani, Papua New Guinea.\nIn 1974, the first phase of the airport's modernization was completed at a cost of $30 million. Upgrades included improved instrument landing capabilities and runway systems, and construction of three new air cargo terminals, expanding the airport's freight capacity to .\nIn 1979, the terminal renovation program was completed, representing the most dramatic work of the airport's modernization, which was designed by DMJM along with Peterson &amp; Brickbauer. The renovations more than doubled the size of BWI's terminal to , and the number of gates increased from 20 to 27. The total cost was $70 million. To continue the work, the BWI Development Council was established to support initiatives for airport development.\nIn 1980, the BWI Rail Station opened, providing a connection for passengers on the Northeast Corridor through Amtrak. BWI was the first airport in the U.S. with a dedicated intercity rail station. The station provided rail transit access to Washington, D.C., something that Dulles International Airport did not achieve until late 2022.\nBWI added a new international terminal (Concourse E), designed by STV Group and William Nicholas Bodouva &amp; Associates, in 1997. Dulles, though, continues to hold the lion's share of the region's international flights. BWI has not attracted as many long-haul international carriers.\nThe first transatlantic nonstops were on World Airways about 1981; British Airways arrived at BWI a few years later. Aer Lingus, Air Jamaica, Air Aruba, Air Canada, Air Greenland, Condor, El Al, KLM, Ladeco, and Mexicana all previously flew to BWI.\nOver the first half of the 1990s, runway 15L/33R was extended from to its current length of , allowing it to be used by small passenger jets like the Boeing 737.\nBeginning in the 1980s and for much of the 1990s, BWI was a hub for Piedmont Airlines and successor , but that airline's financial problems in the wake of the dot-com bust, the September 11 attacks, and low fare competition forced it to cut back. The airport has been a haven for low-cost flights in the Baltimore/Washington Metropolitan Area since Southwest Airlines' arrival in September 1993 and subsequent expansion in the early 2000s. Southwest is the airport's largest carrier, accounting for 56.12% of the airport's passengers in 2011. Southwest Airlines currently serves on average 245 daily departures to the U.S., Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n21st century.\nIn January 2000, the BWI USO opened, the largest in the world at that time. Space-A flights operated by the U.S. Air Force's Air Mobility Command continue to have a significant presence at BWI. Flights from Ramstein Air Base and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst occur frequently. The facility serves 99 percent of military personnel traveling to and from duty stations in Europe, Southwest Asia, and the United States.\nIn July 2000, Ghana Airways began service from BWI to Accra. The airline operated the flight with McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and sought to serve the many people of West African origin residing in the region.\nFour years later, in July 2004, the U.S. federal government prohibited Ghana Airways from flying to the U.S. According to officials, the company was operating on an expired license and had disobeyed orders to stop flying an unsafe plane.\nIn 2005, to accommodate Southwest's extensive presence at the airport, Concourses A and B were expanded, renovated, and integrated with one another to house all of that airline's operations there for their major operating base. The new facility, designed by URS Corporation, opened on May 22, 2005. On October 1 of that year, the airport was renamed Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, to honor former U.S. Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, a native of Baltimore.\nIn June 2006, North American Airlines introduced a link to Accra via Banjul, The Gambia, marking the restoration of direct flights between Baltimore and Africa. The carrier employed Boeing 767s on the route. Afterward, it made the Accra flight nonstop and added a route to Lagos. North American ended all scheduled service in May 2008.\nIn 2008, \"Health\" magazine named BWI the second-healthiest airport in the United States. In 2009 the airport had a six percent increase in air travelers due to the proliferation of discount flights. In a 2009 survey of airport service quality by Airports Council International, BWI was the world's top ranking airport in the 15-to-25-million-passenger category. BWI also ranked seventh, in medium-sized airports, based on customer satisfaction conducted by J.D. Power and Associates.\nOn August 5, 2014, the airport's little-used runway, 04\u201322, was permanently closed. It was long and used primarily when the main runways needed to be closed for repairs. The last operation on the runway was a Southwest Airlines flight from Chicago Midway Airport, which arrived at 4:18\u00a0AM.\nIn 2015, Norwegian Air Shuttle announced it would begin flights from the airport to Guadeloupe and Martinique. In an interview with \"The Baltimore Sun\", Norwegian Air Shuttle CEO Bjorn Kjos said, \"Baltimore is high on the list for long-haul destinations\", hinting at further expansion into Europe. In mid-2018, however, the airline ceased all flights out of Baltimore, attributing the cessation to heavy financial losses.\nIn early 2016, a partnership between the airport and Towson University's WTMD radio station was announced, including a new concert series that takes place at the terminal's baggage claim on the lower level. Local bands included Wye Oak and others. The new series followed the release event of Animal Collective's new album \"Painting With\" on November 25, 2015, where the new album was streamed throughout the airport.\nIn late 2018, construction began on a $60 million, five-gate expansion of terminal A for Southwest Airlines. The new expansion began operations in 2021. 2018 also marked a new annual record for passenger traffic at BWI Marshall Airport with over 27.1 million passengers.\nIn 2021, commuter airline Southern Airways Express ended its hub at BWI and switched its East Coast hub to Dulles International Airport. In addition, the airport's international growth continued with the addition of a twice-weekly flight by Air Senegal to Blaise Diagne International Airport in Dakar, Senegal, via a stop in Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York City. However, in January 2023, Air Senegal ceased the New York City to Baltimore portion of this route, dropping Baltimore back down to only two year-round transatlantic flights. In 2022, Play Airlines began daily nonstop flights from Baltimore to Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, which was quickly followed a few weeks later by Icelandair also resuming flights from BWI to Reykjav\u00edk.\nOn January 26, 2023, Copa Airlines announced they would start operating direct flights to Panama City, making it the first Central America-based airline to operate out of the airport. The flights began as scheduled in late June 2023.\nIn August 2024, Icelandair announced that they would be partnering with Southwest Airlines to better connect their customers, and that the initial North American gateway between the airlines would be BWI.\nFrom 2024 to 2025, BWI lost service from five airlines: Air Canada, Allegiant Air, Condor, Contour, JetBlue, and Play Airlines.\nRenovations and expansion.\nIn October 2022, a proposed renovation and expansion to BWI Airport was announced. It has been described as the \"largest capital project in the history of BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport\". This project includes major upgrades to the airports' Baggage Handling System as well as a renovation and expansion to the airports' A/B Connector, which will provide passengers with a direct connection between concourses A and B.\nThe project (according to airport management as well as Clark Construction, the company hired for the project) is expected to \"transform the customer experience by adding a direct connection between concourses, expanding airline hold rooms, creating new food and retail concession spaces, enhancing restrooms, and introducing a new, fully in-line baggage handling system for Southwest.\" The project is estimated to cost $425 million and is expected to be fully completed in summer 2026.\nFacilities.\nRunways.\nCurrent runways.\nBWI Airport covers of land and has three active runways:\nTerminal.\nBaltimore/Washington International Airport has five concourses with 78 gates. Of these, 14 are international (all 11 gates in Concourse E are international gates, five of E's gates (E2, E7, E9, E10, E12) are arrival-only (these 5 gates are used by Southwest, Spirit, Frontier and Bermudair for non-pre-cleared international flights), and three gates in Concourse D are also international gates).\nGround transportation.\nBWI was ranked one of the \"Top 10 Easiest U.S. Airports to Get to\" by Aviation.com in 2007.\nBWI is located at the southeast terminus of Interstate 195, a spur route providing connections to the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway and Interstate 95. The airport has a variety of parking options, ranging from a garage within walking distance to the concourses to remote parking lots that require shuttles to access.\nA light rail station, with service to downtown Baltimore and other locations via Baltimore Light RailLink, is located next to Concourse E.\nAmtrak and MARC trains regularly serve the BWI Rail Station, located on airport grounds but about a mile from the terminal, with free shuttle bus service connecting the destinations. Trains on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, Acela, and MARC's Penn Line stop at the station and proceed to destinations including Union Station in Washington, D.C. and Penn Station in Baltimore.\nLocal buses that stop at the airport terminal include the Maryland Transit Administration's 75 route to Patapsco station on Light RailLink and Arundel Mills Mall, as well as route 201, which connects the airport to Shady Grove station on the Washington Metro.\nPassenger van service to and from the Eastern Shore and Western Maryland is available through BayRunner Shuttle with services to and from BWI to Kent Island, Easton, Cambridge, Salisbury, Ocean Pines, and Ocean City (for the Eastern Shore) and Grantsville, Frostburg, Cumberland, Hancock, Hagerstown, and Frederick (for Western Maryland). There are also numerous private car, rental car, and cab services, as well as shuttles that go to and from BWI to local hotels; Baltimore and Washington and their suburbs; and Central and Western Maryland.\nSome former ground transportation services have been discontinued, including bicycle-sharing system from the Boston-based company Zagster and the Washington Metro's B30 bus, which was an express service to Greenbelt station.\nOther facilities.\nIn 1985, the BWI Business District was established as a way to formalize businesses and hotels operating adjacent to the airport. The district comprises two smaller districts located to the north (West Nursery Hotel District) and west (Stoney Run District) of the airport. Numerous traveler resources and employment centers are located within both districts, such as the BWI Rail Station and BWI Rental Car Facility in the Stoney Run District, and the BWI Business District Light Rail Station, the NSA Friendship Annex, and dozens of hotel facilities in the West Nursery District.\nA U.S. Department of Homeland Security facility is located in the lower level of the main terminal, near the international arrivals area / Concourse E Baggage Claim. This facility also includes a Global Entry Enrollment Center, as well as a TSA PreCheck enrollment facility.\nIn the early 1990s, BWI Airport opened the Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area at Friendship Park. The observation plaza features a playground and a terrace overlooking the southern approach to the airport's 15R-33L runway. From this vantage point, several planes can be viewed simultaneously as they prepare for landing. The southern loop of the 13.3 mile BWI Trail travels through the park, providing cyclist and pedestrian access to the park.\nIn addition to the Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area, which provides spotters with views of aircraft landing on runway 33L, spotters can use one of several parking garages to view arrivals to runway 15R, with some arrivals appearing to be below the spotter.\nThe Maryland Aviation Administration has its headquarters on the third floor of the terminal building.\nIn popular culture.\nBWI has been a backdrop in six films, \"Goldfinger\" (1964), \"Broadcast News\" (1987), \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991), \"Company Business\" (1991), \"Home for the Holidays\" (1995), and \"Twelve Monkeys\" (1995).\nIt was also featured in the reality TV series \"Airline\" (2004\u20132005), an episode of the TV series \"House of Cards\", and the TV documentaries \"Honor Flight\" (2007) and \"Eatin' Crabs Chesapeake Style\" (2009).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the father of painters Ambrosius and Hans the Younger.\nLife.\nHolbein was born in the free imperial city of Augsburg (Germany), and died in Issenheim, Alsace (now France). He belonged to a celebrated family of painters; his father was Michael Holbein; his brother was Sigmund Holbein (died 1540). He had two sons, both artists and printmakers: Ambrosius Holbein (c. 1494 \u2013 c. 1519) and Hans Holbein the Younger (c. 1497 \u2013 1543), who both had their first painting lessons from their father.\nThe date of Holbein's birth is unknown. His name appears in the Augsburg tax books in 1494, superseding that of his father. As early as 1493, Holbein had a following, and he worked that year at the abbey at Weingarten, creating the wings of an altarpiece representing Joachim's Offering, the Nativity of the Virgin Mary's Presentation in the Temple, and the Presentation of Christ. Today they hang in separate panels in the cathedral of Augsburg.\nHolbein painted richly colored religious works. His later paintings show how he pioneered and led the transformation of German art from the (Late) International Gothic to the Renaissance style. In addition to the altar paintings that are his principal works, he also designed church windows and woodcuts. The surviving prints that can be attributed to him are few and a new one has recently been added to the group, an \"Annunciation to the Virgin\" in the collection of the Universit\u00e4tbibliothek in Erlangen. He also made a number of portrait drawings that foreshadow the work of his famous son, Hans Holbein the Younger.\nHolbein first appears at Augsburg, partnered with his brother Sigismund (who died in 1540 at Bern, Switzerland). Augsburg, at the time of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, cultivated art with a Flemish style, and felt the influence of the schools of Bruges and Brussels, even though it was near Italy, with close commercial connections to Venice. Sigismund was also a painter, but Hans had the lead of the partnership and signed all the works they produced. \nIn 1514 his sons left Augsburg and eventually both settled in Basel. After 1516 Holbein was declared a tax defaulter in Augsburg, which forced him to accept commissions abroad. He had worked in Alsace in 1509, and he seemed to have maintained some contacts there. At Issenheim in Alsace, where Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald was employed at the time, Holbein found patrons and was contracted to complete an altarpiece. His brother Sigismund and others sued him in Augsburg for unpaid debts. Pursued by Augsburg authorities, he fled Issenheim, abandoning his work and equipment, and went to Basel. He died two years later at an unknown location. After 1524 his name no longer appeared on the register of the Augsburg guild.\nHolbein the Elder portrayed himself and his two sons in the left-hand panel of the 1504 altar-piece triptych the \"Basilica of St. Paul\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the elder brother, by about three years, of Hans Holbein the Younger, but he appears to have died in his mid-twenties, leaving behind only a small body of work.\nBiography.\nLike his younger brother, he was born in Augsburg (which today is in Bavaria, but then was a free imperial city), a center of art, culture, and trade at that time. His father Hans Holbein the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. In his studio, both his sons, Ambrosius and Hans, received their first painting lessons as well as an introduction to the crafts of the goldsmith, jeweller, and printmaker.\nThe young Holbein, alongside his brother and his father, is pictured in the left-hand panel of Holbein the Elder's 1504 altarpiece triptych the \"Basilica of St. Paul\", which is displayed at the Staatsgalerie in Augsberg.\nIn 1515, Ambrosius is assumed to have lived in the Swiss town of Stein am Rhein, where he helped a painter from Schaffhausen named Thomas Schmid with the murals in the main hall of the St. George monastery. The next year saw Ambrosius, as well as his brother Hans, in Basel, where he initially worked as a journeyman in Hans Herbster's studio. In 1517 he registered as a member of the Basel painters' guild, and on 6 June 1518 he was naturalized as a citizen of Basel. The goldsmith J\u00f6rg Schweiger, whom Holbein had portrayed before, was his guarantor. However, he disappears from records soon after and is assumed to have died around 1519. Franny Moyle writes, \"There is no record of Ambrosius's death, but the abrupt cessation of his work in a year [1519] where so many were falling prey to sickness suggests that he either caught the disease that began with a headache, or the plague that came in its wake, and died. Another alternative is that his financial worries had pressed him into mercenary service ... though with the Italian Wars in momentary pause, this seems unlikely.\"\nThe \"Portrait of a Boy with Blond Hair\" and its companion, the \"Portrait of a Boy with Brown Hair\", are among Ambrosius\u2019 best works of this period. Both are now in the Basel Kunstmuseum.\nAmbrosius Holbein ranks among the most important of Basel's illustrators and prominent \"small format\" artists.\nWorks.\nAlso, Krannert Art Museum in Illinois has a painting labelled \"Portrait of girl\" by Ambrosius Holbein. The painting used to be a part of Austrian Imperial connection, and given the outfit of the young woman is an example of very early 16th century Spanish fashion, closely resembling tomb of Queen Juana I of Castille, it might be an unidentified portrait of her.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are 110 recent species of lagomorph, of which 109 species in twelve genera are extant, including ten genera of rabbits (42 species), one genus of hare (33 species), and one genus of pika (34 species); and in which one monospecific genus is recently extinct, that of the Sardinian pika.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"lagomorph\" is derived from two Ancient Greek terms: () 'hare' and () 'form'. Together, they describe an animal that is \"hare shaped\". The title is first attested to in the 19th century. It was coined by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt in 1855, who called for a reorganization of the subdivision of rodents containing the rabbits, hares, and pikas, but the term \"Lagomorpha\" was only a suborder and was not formally described as an order until American palaeontologist James W. Gidley described it as such in 1912.\nTaxonomy and evolutionary history.\nOther names used for this order, now considered synonymous, include: \"Duplicidentata\" (Illiger, 1811); \"Leporini\" and \"Leporinorum\" (Fischer, 1917); \"Leporida\" (Averianov, 1999); \"Neolagomorpha\" (Averianov, 1999); \"Ochotonida\" (Averianov, 1999); and \"Palarodentia\" (Haeckel, 1895; Lilian, 2016). The lagomorphs were first described as a group distinct from the rest of the rodents, as they were first classified, in 1811 by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger when he erected Duplicidentata. At the time, the rabbit, pikas, and hares were contained in only two genera, \"Lepus\" and \"Lagomys\" (the hares and the pikas), and it was seen as necessary to further distinguish these animals from rodents based on their teeth, specifically the lagomorphs' four upper incisors. Naturalists would apply various names to this grouping through the following decades, with one of these names being Leporidae, which would later be used to describe just the hares and rabbits. Johann Friedrich von Brandt created the name Lagomorpha in 1855, and this name was solidified as an order in 1912.\nThe evolutionary history of the lagomorphs is still not well understood. In the late 20th century, it was generally agreed that \"Eurymylus\", which lived in eastern Asia and dates back to the late Paleocene or early Eocene, was an ancestor of the lagomorphs. Examination of the fossil evidence in the 21st century suggested that the lagomorphs may have instead descended from mimotonids, mammals present in Asia during the Paleogene with similar body size and dental structure to early European rabbits such as \"Megalagus turgidus\", while \"Eurymylus\" was more closely related to rodents (although not a direct ancestor). The leporids first appeared in the late Eocene and rapidly spread throughout the Northern Hemisphere; they show a trend towards increasingly long hind limbs as the modern leaping gait developed. The pikas appeared somewhat later in the Oligocene of eastern Asia.\nLagomorphs were certainly more diverse in the past than in the present, with around 75 genera and over 230 species represented in the fossil record and many more species in a single biome. This is evidence that lagomorph lineages are declining.\nA 2008 study suggests an Indian origin for the order, having possibly evolved in isolation when India was an island continent in the Paleocene.\nCharacteristics.\nLagomorphs are similar to other mammals in that they all have hair, four limbs (i.e., they are tetrapods), and mammary glands and are endotherms. Lagomorphs possess a moderately fused postorbital process to the cranium, unlike other small mammals. They differ in that they have a mixture of \"basal\" and \"derived\" physical traits.\nDifferences between lagomorphs and other mammals.\nLagomorphs and rodents form the clade or grandorder Glires. Despite the evolutionary relationship between lagomorphs and rodents, the two orders have some major differences.\nLagomorphs have four incisors in the upper jaw (smaller peg teeth behind larger incisors), whereas rodents only have two. They are similar to rodents in that their incisors grow continuously, thus necessitating constant chewing on fibrous food to prevent the teeth from growing too long. In addition, all lagomorph teeth grow continuously, while for most rodents, only the incisors grow continuously. Lagomorph and rodent incisors are structured differently. Lagomorphs have more cheek teeth than rodents. Both have a large diastema.\nLagomorphs are almost strictly herbivorous, unlike rodents, many of which will eat both meat and vegetable matter. Lagomorphs have no paw pads; instead, the bottoms of their paws are entirely covered with fur, a trait they share with red pandas. Similar to the rodents, bats, and some mammalian insectivores, they have a smooth-surfaced cerebrum. Lagomorphs are unusual among terrestrial mammals in that the females are larger than males and that the testes of males are usually located in front of the penis. Male lagomorphs do not have an os penis. Females have two to five pairs of mammary glands.\nDifferences between families of lagomorphs.\nRabbits and hares move by jumping, pushing off with their strong hind legs and using their forelimbs to soften the impact on landing. Pikas lack certain skeletal modifications present in leporids, such as a highly arched skull, an upright posture of the head, strong hind limbs and pelvic girdle, and long limbs. Also, pikas have a short nasal region and entirely lack a supraorbital foramen, while leporids have prominent supraorbital foramina and nasal regions.\nPikas.\nPikas, also known as conies, are entirely represented by the family Ochotonidae and are small mammals native to mountainous regions of western North America and Central Asia. They are mostly about long and have greyish-brown, silky fur, small rounded ears, and almost no tail. Their four legs are nearly equal in length. Some species live in scree, making their homes in the crevices between broken rocks, while others construct burrows in upland areas. The rock-dwelling species are typically long-lived and solitary, having one or two small litters each year contributing to stable populations. The burrowing species, in contrast, are short-lived, gregarious and have multiple large litters during the year. These species tend to have large swings in population size. The gestation period of the pika is around one month long, and the newborns are altricial (eyes and ears closed, no fur). The social behaviour of the two groups also differs: the rock dwellers aggressively maintain scent-marked territories, while the burrowers live in family groups, they interact vocally with each other and defend a mutual territory. Pikas are diurnal and are active early and late in the day during hot weather. They feed on all sorts of plant material. As they do not hibernate, they make \"haypiles\" of dried vegetation which they collect and carry back to their homes to store for use during winter.\nHares.\nHares, members of genus \"Lepus\" of family Leporidae, are medium size mammals native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. North American jackrabbits are actually hares. Species vary in size from in length and have long powerful back legs, and ears up to in length. Although usually greyish-brown, some species turn white in the winter. They are solitary animals. Newborns are precocial (eyes and ears open, fully furred). Several litters are born during the year in a form (a nest above ground, usually under a bush). They are preyed upon by large mammalian carnivores and birds of prey.\nRabbits.\nRabbits, members of the Leporidae family (excluding \"Lepus\" (hares)) are generally much smaller than hares and include the rock hares and the hispid hare. They are native to Europe, parts of Africa, Central and Southern Asia, North America and much of South America. They inhabit both grassland and arid regions. They vary in size from and have long, powerful hind legs, shorter forelegs and a tiny tail. The colour is some shade of brown, buff or grey and there is one black species and two striped ones. Domestic rabbits come in a wider variety of colours. Newborn rabbits are altricial (eyes and ears closed, no fur). Although most species live in burrows, the cottontails and hispid hares have forms (nests above ground, usually under a bush). Most of the burrowing species are colonial, and feed together in small groups. Rabbits play an important part in the terrestrial food chain, eating a wide range of forbs, grasses, and herbs, and being part of the staple diet of many carnivorous species. Domestic rabbits can be litter box trained, and\u2014assuming they are given sufficient room to run and a good diet\u2014can live long lives as house pets.\nDistribution.\nLagomorphs are widespread around the world and inhabit every continent except Antarctica. However, they are not found in the West Indies or Madagascar, nor on many islands. Although they are not native to Australia, humans have introduced them there and they have successfully colonized many parts of the country and caused disruption to native species. Though they are not native there, European hares exist in much of the southern cone of South America.\nBiology.\nDigestion.\nEasily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract and expelled as regular feces. But in order to get nutrients out of hard to digest fiber, lagomorphs ferment fiber in the cecum (in the GI tract) and then expel the contents as cecotropes, which are reingested (cecotrophy). The cecotropes are then absorbed in the small intestine to utilize the nutrients.\nLike rodents, they are not able to vomit.\nBirth and early life.\nMany lagomorphs breed several times a year and produce large litters. This is particularly the case in species that live in underground, protective environments, such as burrows. The young of rabbits and pikas (called kits) are born after a short gestation period and the mother can become pregnant again almost immediately after giving birth. The mothers are able to leave these young safely and go off to feed, returning at intervals to feed them with their unusually rich milk. In some species, the mother only visits and feeds the litter once a day but the young grow rapidly and are usually weaned within a month.\nHare young are called leverets. Adults have a strategy to prevent predators from tracking down their litter by following the adults' scent. They approach and depart from the nesting site in a series of immense bounds, sometimes moving at right angles to their previous direction. Each litter of hares have a small number of young and are born after a longer gestation period.\nSociality and safety.\nMany species of lagomorphs, particularly the rabbits and the pikas, are gregarious and live in colonies, whereas hares are generally solitary species, although many hares travel and forage in groups of two, three, or four. Many rabbits and pikas rely on their burrows as places of safety when danger threatens, but hares rely on their long legs, great speed and jinking gait to escape from predators.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a population of 104,681 at the 2020 census, it is the second-most-populous community in Maryland, after Baltimore. Columbia, located between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., is part of the Baltimore metropolitan area and is tracked by the United States Census Bureau as a census-designated place. Columbia proper consists only of territory governed by the Columbia Association, a not-for-profit management company. The United States Postal Service also uses the name for other communities that predate Columbia, including Simpsonville and Atholton; the Census Bureau also counts part of Clarksville as Columbia.\nDeveloper James Rouse founded Columbia in 1967, aiming to create a community that would avoid the inconveniences of then-current subdivision design; eliminate racial, religious and class segregation; and reduce leapfrog and spot zoning development.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nBefore European colonization in the 1600s, the area that is now Columbia served as farming and hunting grounds for indigenous peoples including the Piscataway and Susquehannock peoples. Columbia was founded in 1967 by James W. Rouse, a native of Easton, Maryland. In 1935, Rouse obtained a job in Baltimore with the Federal Housing Administration, a New Deal agency whose purpose was to promote home ownership and home construction. This position exposed Rouse to all phases of the housing industry. Later in the 1930s he co-founded a Baltimore mortgage banking business, the Moss-Rouse Company. In the 1950s his company, by then known as James W. Rouse and Company, branched out into developing shopping centers and malls. In 1957, Rouse formed Community Research and Development, Inc. (CRD) for the purpose of building, owning and operating shopping centers throughout the country. Community Research and Development, Inc., which was managed by James W. Rouse and Company, became a publicly traded company in 1961. In 1966, Community Research and Development, Inc. changed its name to The Rouse Company, after it had acquired James W. Rouse and Company in exchange for company stock.\nBy the early 1950s Rouse was also active in organizations whose goals were to combat blight and promote urban renewal. Along the way, he came to recognize the importance of comprehensive planning and action to address housing issues. A talented public speaker, Rouse's speeches on housing matters attracted media attention. By the mid-1950s he was espousing his belief that in order to be successful, cities had to be places where people succeeded. In a 1959 speech he declared that the purpose of cities is for people, and that the objective of city planning should be to make a city into neighborhoods where men, women, and their families can live and work, and, most importantly, grow in character, personality, religious fulfillment, brotherhood, and the capacity for joyous living.\nIn the early 1960s, Rouse decided to develop a new model city. Rouse's ideas about what a new model city should be like were informed by a number of factors, including his personal Christian faith as well as the goal for his company to earn a profit, influences that he did not consider to be incompatible with one another. After exploring possible new city locations near Atlanta, Georgia, and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, Rouse focused his attention between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., in Howard County, Maryland.\nHoward County land acquisition.\nIn April 1962, Mel Berman, a longtime Howard County resident who was also a member of the CRD's Board of Directors, saw a sign on Cedar Lane in Howard County advertising for sale. Berman reported the option to the CRD and a decision was made to purchase the land. This was the first of 165 land purchases made by Rouse over the next year-and-a-half. In order to keep land costs low, Jack Jones, an attorney from Rouse's firm of Piper Marbury, set up a grid system to secretly buy land through dummy corporations like the \"Alaska Iron Mines Company\". Some of these straw purchasers included Columbia Industrial Development Corporation, 95-32 Corporation, 95-216 Corporation, Premble, Inc., Columbia Mall, Inc., Oakland Ridge Industrial Development Corporation, and Columbia Development Corporation. Robert Moxley's firm Security Realty Company (now Security Development Group Inc), negotiated many of the land deals for Jones, becoming his best client. CRD accumulated , 10 percent of Howard County, from 140 separate owners. Rouse was turned down in financing from David Rockefeller, who had recently cancelled a planned Rouse \"Village\" concept called Pocantico Hills. The $19,122,622 acquisition was then funded by Rouse's former employer Connecticut General Life Insurance in October 1962 at an average price of $1,500 per acre ($0.37/m2). The town center land of Oakland Manor was purchased from Isadore Guldesky who was turned down from building high-rises on the site by Rob Moxley's brother, County Commissioner and land developer Norman E. Moxley. Sensing that he had a key property, he requested $5 million for his , signing an agreement by hand on a land plat. The competition between Rouse and Guldesky carried over to the competing Tysons Corner Center and Tysons Galleria projects, with each hiring their competitor's employees.\nBy late 1962, citizens had elected an all-Republican three-member council. J. Hubert Black, Charles E. Miller, and David W. Force who campaigned on a low-density growth ballot, but later approved the Columbia project. The Howard County Planning Commission Chairman Wilmer Sanner declared, \"if this adds to the orderly development of the county, that's what we are looking for.\" That July, Sanner sold the majority of his Simpsonville farm to Howard Research prior to the public announcement. In October 1963, the acquisition was revealed to the residents of Howard County, putting to rest rumors about the mysterious purchases. These had included theories that the site was to become a medical research laboratory or a giant compost heap. Despite the moniker of being a \"planned city\", the planning for the city occupied Rouse officials for most of 1964 after the announcement while marketing director Scott Ditch was brought from Baltimore's Cross Keys development to promote the project to community groups. \nIn December 1964 the zoning was rejected by planning director Tom Harris Jr. for handing nearly all planning control to the developer. A media push was instituted to approve the zoning by Dorris Thompson of \"The Howard County Times\", Seymour Barondes of the Howard County Civic Association, and Anita Iribe of the League of Women Voters. In June 1965 zoning was approved for the project, and Howard Research and Development entered into a $37.5 million construction deed backed by the property. Development was temporarily stalled in October 1965 when James and Anna Hepding of Simpsonville sued the planning board, stating New Town zoning was a form of spot zoning benefiting a sole property owner. The case was dropped when developer Homer Gudelsky purchased the estate. Ten years later, former Councilman Charles E. Miller stated that if he could do it over again, he wouldn't have voted to approve Columbia. He felt exploited and felt the subsidized housing would become a problem for the rest of the county. Miller had been defeated in the November 1974 Howard County Council elections, in part as a result of the changed political landscape that Columbia's development brought. In early 1976, a \"Columbia Flier\" editorial charged that Miller was a fear-mongering reactionary who had a personal vendetta against Columbia, Rouse and Columbia residents.\nUnveiling and growth.\nAt the unveiling on June 21, 1967, James Rouse described Columbia as a planned new city which would avoid the leap-frog and spot-zoning development threatening the county. The new city would be complete with jobs, schools, shopping, and medical services, and a range of housing choices. Property taxes from commercial development would cover the additional services with which housing would burden the county. The urban planning process for Columbia included not only planners, but also a convened panel of nationally recognized experts in the social sciences, known as the Work Group. The fourteen member group of men and one woman, Antonia Handler Chayes, met for two days, twice a month, for half a year starting in 1963. The Work Group suggested innovations for planners in education, recreation, religion, and health care, as well as ways of improving social interactions. Columbia's open classrooms, interfaith centers, and the then-novel idea of a health maintenance organization (HMO) with a group practice of medical doctors (the Columbia Medical Plan) sprung from these meetings. The community's physical plan, with neighborhood and village centers, was also decided. Columbia's \"New Town District\" zoning ordinance gave developers great flexibility about what to put where, without requiring county approval for each specific project.\nIn 1968, vice-presidential candidate Spiro Agnew referenced Columbia to reporters, saying, \"Government should act as a catalyst to encourage the local governments to encourage industry and business to move next to a planned community,\" and \"I want to lessen the density in the ghettos, and concurrently rebuild the ghetto areas.\" In 1969, County Executive Omar J. Jones felt that the increase in tax base was lagging behind the need for infrastructure as the operating budget doubled to $15 million in three years. Crime rates shot up around the county by 30\u201350% a year, with hot spots around the development. By 1970, the project required additional financing to continue, borrowing $30 million from Connecticut General, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, and Morgan Guaranty. In 1972, amendments to New Town zoning proposing to place a maximum height for buildings and maintain the original density limit of 2.2 units per acre were opposed by Rouse allies including the Columbia Association, the Ellicott City Businessman's Association and the Columbia Democratic Club. By 1974, the amount owed reached $100,000 million, prompting partner Connecticut General to consider bankruptcy. An effort to create a special taxing district in 1978 and an effort to incorporate with a mayor in 1979 failed. In 1985 Cigna (Connecticut General) divested itself of the project for $120 million. By 1990 Howard Research and Development owed $125,162,689. In 2004 the project was sold to General Growth Properties, which went bankrupt in 2008. General Growth Properties submitted a plan for increasing density throughout Columbia in 2004 which was unanimously voted down. Ownership of the project fell to the previous Rouse subsidiary the Howard Hughes Corporation. Howard Hughes submitted a new plan to increase density in 2010 under the Ulman administration that passed unanimously.\nColumbia has never incorporated; some governance, however, is provided by the non-profit Columbia Association, which manages common areas and functions as a homeowner association with regard to private property. The first boards were filled entirely with Rouse Company appointees. The first manager of the Columbia Association was John Estabrook Slayton (d. 1967). For Slayton's contributions to the early planning of Columbia, the community center in the Wilde Lake village, Slayton House, was named for him. Wilde Lake was the first village area to be developed in Columbia; accordingly, the town's first high school was Wilde Lake High School, which opened in 1971 as a \"model school for the nation\". Constructed in the open classroom style, it was razed in 1994 and reconstructed on the same site, reopening in 1996.\nMaster plan.\nTo achieve the goals set forth by the Work Group, Columbia's Master Plan called for a series of ten self-contained villages, around which day-to-day life would revolve. The centerpiece of Columbia would be The Mall in Columbia and man-made Lake Kittamaqundi.\nVillages and neighborhoods.\nThe village concept aimed to provide Columbia a small-town feel (like Easton, Maryland, where James Rouse grew up). Each village comprises several neighborhoods. The village center may contain middle and high schools. All villages have a shopping center, recreational facilities, a community center, a system of bike/walking paths, and homes. Four of the villages have interfaith centers, common worship facilities which are owned and jointly operated by a variety of religious congregations working together.\nMost of Columbia's neighborhoods contain single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and apartments, though some are more exclusive than others. The original plan, following the neighborhood concept of Clarence Perry, would have had all the children of a neighborhood attend the same school, melding neighborhoods into a community and ensuring that all of Columbia's children get the same high-quality education. Rouse marketed the city as being \"color blind\" as a proponent of Senator Clark's fair housing legislation. If a neighborhood was filled with too many purchasers of a single race, houses would be blocked until the desired ratio was met.\nColumbia takes its street names from famous works of art and literature: for example, the neighborhood of Hobbit's Glen takes its street names from the work of J. R. R. Tolkien; Running Brook, from the poetry of Robert Frost; and Clemens Crossing, from the work of Mark Twain. The book \"Oh, You Must Live in Columbia!\" chronicles the artistic, poetic, and historical origins of the street and place names in Columbia.\nFurther expansion.\n\"The Downtown Columbia Plan\" is a 2010 amendment to the county's General Plan of expansion. It is a framework for the revitalization of Downtown Columbia over the next thirty years. Development plans for downtown projects in the years ahead will include details for that project such as neighborhood design guidelines, environmental restoration, public amenities and infrastructure. These development plans must adhere to the framework of the Downtown Columbia Plan as required by the zoning legislation. Over the life of the Downtown Columbia development project, as much as 13 million square feet of retail, commercial, residential, hotel and cultural development is planned.\nTo be accomplished in three phases, the plan calls for the formation of the non-profit Columbia Downtown Housing Corporation to build an additional 5,500 units of low income housing placed downtown in exchange for increased zoning density for other projects. Additional development includes 4.3 million square feet of commercial office space, 1.25 million square feet of retail space, 640 hotel rooms, Merriweather Post Pavilion redevelopment and a multi-modal transportation system.\nColumbia's master developer, the Howard Hughes Corporation, is heading up the expansion project. The project is projected to cost $90 million and will outline development in the community for the next 40 years.\nGeography.\nColumbia is located in central Maryland, southwest of Baltimore, northeast of Washington, D.C., and northwest of Annapolis. The community lies in the Piedmont region of Maryland, with its eastern edge at the fall line. The climate tends to hot, humid summers and cool to cold and wet winters. There are occasional large amounts of snowfall that happen every year.\nThe primary landforms in Columbia are rolling hills and stream valleys; Columbia's road network is laid out to follow the terrain, with many winding streets and cul-de-sacs. Elevations range from about above sea level. Most of Columbia is drained by the Middle Patuxent and Little Patuxent rivers. There are three artificial lakes, created by damming tributary streams during community construction. In 1965, the Rouse Company leased of farmland staged for development, and earmarked of oak forest for timber harvesting. The company developed a sapling planter to replant sections of cleared land that would use Columbia's W.R. Grace-developed fertilizers. An outer ring of greenspace was abandoned early in the project because the combination with the already required river buffers would have reduced land available for building. Along with Symphony Woods, many other stands of mature trees have been temporarily maintained in Columbia, including the large Middle Patuxent Environmental Area in the western part of the community between Harper's Choice and River Hill villages, protecting much of the river valley from development.\nBecause Columbia is unincorporated, there is confusion over its exact boundaries. In the strictest definition, Columbia comprises only the land governed under covenants by the Columbia Association. This is a considerably smaller area than the census-designated place (CDP) as defined by the United States Census Bureau. The CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.80%, is water. The CDP includes a number of older communities which do not lie within the CA's purview, including the Holiday Hills, Diamondback, and Allview subdivisions and the former town of Simpsonville, as well as some land on the east side of Clarksville. These areas are not part of the \"new town\", and are not directly served by its amenities. Some of these areas are included in Columbia ZIP codes by the post office, and some are not.\nClimate.\nColumbia has a humid subtropical climate, with cool winters and hot, muggy summers.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nThe 2009-2013 census estimates report the median income for a household in the CDP was $99,877. The per capita income for the CDP was $46,374. About 4.1% of families and 6.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.8% of those under age 18 and 6.4% of those age 65 or over.\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 88,254 people, 34,199 households, and 23,118 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 35,281 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 66.52% White, 21.47% Black or African American, 0.26% Native American, 7.30% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 1.63% from other races, and 2.76% from two or more races. 4.12% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 14% of Columbia's residents were German, 11% Irish, 10% English, 5% Italian, 4% Polish, 2% Russian, 2% Scottish, 2% Indian, 2% Chinese, 2% Korean, 2% Sub-Saharan African, 2% French, and 2% West Indian.\nThere were 34,199 households, out of which 35.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.4% were married couples living together, 11.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.4% were non-families. 25.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.54 and the average family size was 3.09.\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out, with 26.3% under the age of 18, 6.7% from 18 to 24, 34.1% from 25 to 44, 25.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.7 males.\nEconomy.\nJames Rouse conceived of a city, not a suburban bedroom community, and a large area on the eastern edge was allocated for industrial purposes. The centerpiece of this aspect of the development was a General Electric appliance plant on a site previously operated as a cattle farm. After an injunction attempt was blocked in 1969, the plant began operations in 1972, peaking at 2,300 of the predicted 12,000 jobs. It was closed in 1990, with all but of the property being sold back to Howard Research and Development. One section of the property was subsequently redeveloped for big box retail; the remainder became the large Gateway Commerce office complex, still being expanded. In 1968, Bendix Field Engineering moved to a new facility on the historic Woodlawn Plantation where it was used for engineering activity. Howard County purchased the vacant facility creating the Maryland Center for Entrepreneurship in 2011, which relocated to the vacant Patuxent Publishing building in 2014. There is still a smaller industrial area to the south of this, but by and large East Columbia is dominated by commercial real estate\u2014office, retail, and wholesale\u2014in contrast to the original plan, which saw the Town Center area as the commercial center of Columbia.\nThe U.S. federal government is the source of many jobs for Columbians. Several large U.S. Department of Defense installations and R&amp;D facilities surround Columbia, the largest being the National Security Agency at Fort George G. Meade, and the Applied Physics Laboratory south of Columbia, both pre-dating the establishment of Columbia. Companies which have had research facilities in the area include W.R. Grace and Company. Further afield, many Columbians commute to government and government contractor jobs in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area.\nCompanies based in Columbia include W.R. Grace and Company, Sourcefire, PetMeds, MICROS Systems, Martek Biosciences, Integral Systems, GP Strategies Corporation, Corporate Office Properties Trust, and the consumer research company Nielsen Audio (formerly Arbitron). When MaggieMoo's was an independent company, its headquarters was in Columbia.\nShopping.\nThe Mall in Columbia, located in Town Center, is a large regional shopping mall with three anchor department stores, a multiplex movie theater, and more than 200 stores and restaurants.\nThere are several other major competing shopping centers in East Columbia, including Dobbin Center strip mall opened in 1983, Snowden Square big box retail on the remainder of the GE industrial site, Columbia Crossing I and II big box retail started in 1997, and Gateway Overlook.\nColumbia's nine \"village centers\" provide residents with nearby shopping as well, often including supermarkets, filling stations, liquor stores, dry cleaners, restaurants, and hair salons. The village centers are laid out so that individual stores are not visible from the road, unlike traditional strip malls. The arrangement is criticized because it makes it difficult for newcomers and non-residents to know what shopping is available; it is praised for eliminating much of the garishness of roadside America.\nThe village centers have evolved over time. Oakland Mills Village Center in Oakland Mills had a traditional layout\u2014stores located off a central corridor\u2014until its demolition in the late 1990s. The Rouse Company abandoned the village center concept in 2002, selling off the assets to Kimco Realty for $120 million. The Kings Contrivance Village Center in Kings Contrivance underwent major construction in 2007 and 2008 when a new supermarket was added to the center, but maintained the original character of stores around a central corridor and plaza. Owen Brown village center is now managed by GFS Realty, and the Long Reach Village center was declared blighted and purchased by Howard County for resale in 2014.\nArts and culture.\nEntertainment and performing arts.\nMerriweather Post Pavilion, a well-known outdoor concert venue, attracts many prominent performers. In addition, there are several performing arts organizations that present professional theater, including Toby's Dinner Theatre, Columbia Center for Theatrical Arts and the Young Columbians which have produced the area premieres of several musicals.\nColumbia also offers chamber music concerts, children's programs, community outreach programs, master classes, and pre-concert lectures and discussions through the Candlelight Concert Society, a non-profit organization formed by Columbia residents to provide chamber music concerts since 1972.\nHoward County Library System.\nHoward County Library System (HCLS) is consistently top rated among the nation's public library systems according to Hennen's American Public Library Ratings (HAPLR). Two of the six branches of the Howard County Library System are in Columbia, including the Central Branch in Town Center and the East Columbia Branch in Owen Brown.\nHistoric sites.\nThere are four historic National Register of Historic Places sites in Columbia: Christ Church Guilford, Dorsey Hall, Woodlawn, and the Oakland Mills Blacksmith House and Shop. Most historic buildings, mills and plantations within Columbia that qualified for the register, such as Oakland Manor, were not submitted by Rouse company affiliates.\nReligion.\nRouse, a devout Episcopalian, commissioned a study concerning how places of worship would be integrated into plans for the new town. Dr. Stanley Hallet advised this 1964 work group to economically abandon \"The extravagance of church life\" in favor of ecumenical establishments that focused resources on retreat centers and non-profit religious corporations. The Rouse Company discouraged individual congregations from purchasing land from the company. In 1966, the Columbia Religious Facilities Corporation was founded to lease interfaith centers to congregations. On June 22, 1969, $2.5 million in church donations applied to the CFRC to purchase Columbia land and build an interfaith facility in the village of Wilde Lake. The organization formed the Interfaith Housing Corporation (now the Columbia Housing Corporation) to purchase 300 units of low and moderate income housing in the development with Federal Housing Authority funding. \nParks and recreation.\nColumbia has numerous recreation centers. The homeowners association, the Columbia Association, known to many in Howard County as \"CA\", builds, operates and maintains most of these facilities. CA operates a variety of recreational facilities, including 23 outdoor swimming pools, five indoor pools, two water slides, ice and roller skating rinks, an equestrian center, a sports park with miniature golf, a skateboard park, batting cages, picnic pavilions, clubhouse and playground, three athletic clubs, numerous indoor and outdoor tennis, basketball, volleyball, squash, pickleball, and racquetball courts, and running tracks.\nThere are three lakes (Lake Kittamaqundi, Lake Elkhorn, and Wilde Lake) surrounded by parkland for sailing, fishing, and boating; of paths for jogging, strolling and biking; and 148 tot lots and play areas.\nNine village centers, 15 neighborhood centers, and four senior centers provide space for a large variety of community activities. There are a variety of fairs and celebrations throughout the year, including entertainment on the lakefront of Lake Kittamaqundi during the summer and the Columbia Festival of the Arts.\nColumbia also has garden plots for rent, under the guidance of the Columbia Gardeners, which has been in existence since the 1970s. There are about 350 garden plots at three sites in Columbia.\nChiara D'Amore's Community Ecology Institute's Freetown Farm, founded in 2016, uses hands-on gardening to educate people and cultivates communities where people thrive together. Freetown farm was built on the site of Columbia's last working farm. The name \"Freetown farm\" refers to the area's historical name and its ties to the Underground Railroad. It features an NAACP garden and donates much of the food that is raise to local food banks.\nEducation.\nColumbia's public schools are operated by the Howard County Public School System. As of the 2007\u20132008 school year, the following high schools served some part of Columbia:\nMost of these schools also serve students from outside Columbia, as is also the case with some of the middle and elementary schools.\nColleges and universities.\nThere are no conventional four-year colleges or universities in Columbia, but several college-level programs have facilities there. Howard Community College is located near the town center, while the University of Phoenix, Lincoln College of Technology, Loyola University Maryland, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Maryland University of Integrative Health, and Johns Hopkins University have facilities on the east side of town at Columbia Gateway Business Park. In addition to its original campus in Columbia, HCC also has satellite campuses in Mount Airy, Laurel, and East Columbia, in the Columbia Gateway Business Park.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nPublic transit.\nColumbia's initial plan called for a minibus system connecting the village centers on a distinct right-of-way that allowed denser development along the route. The routes were not constructed, though minibuses were operated by the Columbia Association under the name \"ColumBus\". These were eventually taken over by Howard County. Six Howard Transit bus routes served Columbia and connected it with its neighboring areas (such as Ellicott City and the BWI Airport) until they were replaced by Regional Transportation Agency of Central Maryland (RTA) in 2014. Several Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) routes provide access to and from both Washington and Baltimore; MTA weekday commuter bus service connects Columbia to the Washington Metro system. There are no rail stations within Columbia, although the Dorsey MARC Train station is served by RTA buses.\nRoads.\nColumbia has a number of roadways that serve the community (see below). All of these highways allow Columbia access to nearby Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Annapolis.\nHealthcare.\nMedical care is available at Howard County General Hospital, affiliated with Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Columbia Medical Plan was founded in 1967 as a health maintenance organization (HMO) available to citizens of Columbia. In more recent years, however, this plan has divided into separate medical groups that simply share the Twin Knolls buildings. Today, there is a Kaiser Permanente facility located in the Columbia Gateway industrial park. There are also a number of clinics, such as the Righttime Medical Care center and Patient First.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn popular culture.\nColumbia is mentioned in the novel, \"Butchers Hill\", by Laura Lippman. The novel is largely set in Baltimore City and describes Columbia as a utopian experiment with huge homes and affluent residents. The residents are portrayed as racially homogeneous and largely white. The novel was written in 1998 and Lippman herself lived in Columbia in the 1970s.\nSister cities.\nColumbia is a sister city to Cergy-Pontoise, France, Tres Cantos, Spain, Tema, Ghana, Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Haiti, and Liyang, China. The Columbia Association International and Multicultural Programs Advisory Committee organizes a summer exchange program for French and Spanish students enrolled in Howard County Public Schools. In 2013, CA announced its new sister city relationship with Tema, a port city in Ghana. The occasion was marked with a Ghana Fest on November 17, 2013, and the official agreement was signed in 2014. In 2016, Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Haiti became a sister city followed by Liyang, China in 2018. The sister city agreement with Liyang included a requirement that Columbia support the China government's One China principle.\nRelated cities.\nThe Rouse Company, now owned by the Howard Hughes Corporation, owns and operates multiple HUD Title VII-New Town planned community developments along with Columbia. These include The Woodlands, Texas, Bridgeland Community, Texas, and Summerlin, Nevada.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the Commonwealth period he was a colleague and friend of John Milton. A metaphysical poet, his poems range from the love-song \"To His Coy Mistress\", to evocations of an aristocratic country house and garden in \"Upon Appleton House\" and \"The Garden\", the political address \"An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland\", and the later personal and political satires \"Flecknoe\" and \"The Character of Holland\".\nEarly life.\nMarvell was born in Winestead, East Riding of Yorkshire on 31 March 1621. He was the son of a Church of England clergyman also named Andrew Marvell. The family moved to Hull when his father was appointed Lecturer at Holy Trinity Church, and Marvell was educated at Hull Grammar School.\nAged 13, Marvell attended Trinity College, Cambridge and eventually received a BA degree. A portrait of Marvell, attributed to Godfrey Kneller, hangs in Trinity College's collection.\nFrom the middle of 1642 onwards, Marvell probably travelled in continental Europe. He may well have served as a tutor for an aristocrat on the Grand Tour, but the facts are not clear on this point. While England was embroiled in the civil war, Marvell seems to have remained on the continent until 1647. During his visit to Rome in 1645, he probably met the Villiers brothers, Lord Francis and the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, as well as Richard Flecknoe. He later wrote a satirical poem about Flecknoe. His travel route is unclear, except that Milton later reported that Marvell had mastered four languages, including French, Italian and Spanish.\nFirst poems and Marvell's time at Nun Appleton.\nMarvell's first poems, which were written in Latin and Greek and published when he was still at Cambridge, lamented a visitation of the plague and celebrated the birth of a child to King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria. He belatedly became sympathetic to the successive regimes during the Interregnum after Charles I's execution on 30 January 1649. His \"Horatian Ode\", a political poem dated to 1650, responds with sadness to the regicide, despite the overall praise towards Oliver Cromwell's return from Ireland.\nCirca 1650\u201352, Marvell served as tutor to the daughter, Mary, of Lord General Fairfax, who had recently relinquished command of the Parliamentary army to Cromwell. During this period, Marvell lived at Nun Appleton Hall, near York, where he continued to write poetry. One of his works, \"Upon Appleton House, To My Lord Fairfax\", uses a description of the estate as a way of exploring Fairfax's and Marvell's own social situation in a time of war and political change. Probably the best-known poem Marvell wrote at this time is \"To His Coy Mistress\".\nAnglo-Dutch War and employment as Latin secretary.\nDuring the period of increasing tensions leading up to the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652, Marvell wrote the satirical \"Character of Holland\". It repeated the contemporary stereotype of the Dutch as \"drunken and profane\": \"This indigested vomit of the Sea,/ Fell to the Dutch by Just Propriety.\"\nHe became a tutor to Cromwell's ward, William Dutton, in 1653, and moved to live with his pupil at John Oxenbridge's house in Eton. Oxenbridge previously made two trips to Bermuda, this most-likely inspired Marvell to write his poem \"Bermudas\". He also wrote several poems praising Cromwell, who was Lord Protector of England at that point. In 1656 Marvell and Dutton travelled to France, to visit the Protestant Academy of Saumur.\nIn 1657, Marvell joined Milton (who was now blind) in service as Latin secretary to Cromwell's Council of State at a salary of \u00a3200 a year. This was enough for decent financial security. Oliver Cromwell died in 1658 and was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard. In 1659 Marvell was elected Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was paid a rate of 6 shillings, 8 pence per day during sittings of parliament, a financial support derived from the contributions of his constituency. He was re-elected MP for Hull in 1660 for the Convention Parliament.\nAfter the Restoration.\nThe monarchy was restored in England in 1660 with Charles II as king. Marvell avoided punishment for his own co-operation with Cromwell and republicanism more broadly. Furthermore, he helped to convince the King not to execute John Milton for his anti-monarchical writings and revolutionary activities. The closeness of the relationship between the two former colleagues is indicated by the fact that Marvell contributed an eloquent prefatory poem, entitled \"On Mr. Milton's Paradise Lost\", to the second edition of Milton's epic \"Paradise Lost\". According to a biographer: \"Skilled in the arts of self-preservation, he was not a toady.\"\nIn 1661 Marvell was re-elected MP for Hull in the Cavalier Parliament. He eventually came to write several long and bitterly satirical verses against the corruption of the court. This work was mostly circulated in less public manuscript form, however some was anonymously published in print. The verses were too politically sensitive and too dangerous to be published under his name until well after the writer's death. Marvell took up opposition to the 'court party', and satirised them as his main target. In his longest verse of satire, \"Last Instructions to a Painter\", written in 1667, Marvell responded to the political corruption that had contributed to English failures during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The poem was only published in print after the Revolution of 1688\u20139. The poem instructs an imaginary painter on how to portray the state without a proper navy to defend them. The state is led by men without intelligence or courage, a corrupt and dissolute court, and dishonest officials. Of another such satire, Samuel Pepys, himself a government official, commented in his diary, \"Here I met with a fourth Advice to a Painter upon the coming in of the Dutch and the End of the War, that made my heart ake to read, it being too sharp and so true.\"\nFrom 1659 until his death in 1678, Marvell served as London agent for the Hull Trinity House shipmasters' guild. He went on two missions to the continent; one to the Dutch Republic, and the other encompassing Russia, Sweden, and Denmark. He spent some time living in a cottage on Highgate Hill in north London. His stay there is now recorded by a bronze plaque that bears the following inscription:Four feet below this spot is the stone step, formerly the entrance to the cottage in which lived Andrew Marvell, poet, wit, and satirist; colleague with John Milton in the foreign or Latin secretaryship during the Commonwealth; and for about twenty years M.P. for Hull. Born at Winestead, Yorkshire, 31st March, 1621, died in London, 18th August, 1678, and buried in the church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. This memorial is placed here by the London County Council, December, 1898. A floral sundial in the nearby Lauderdale House bears an inscription quoting lines from his poem \"The Garden\".\nAndrew Marvell died suddenly in 1678, while attending a popular meeting of his old constituents at Hull. His health had been remarkably good; and some people theorised of his poisoning by his political or clerical enemies. This is unproven. Marvell was buried in the church of St Giles in the Fields in central London. His monument, erected by a very grateful constituency, bears the following inscription:Near this place lyeth the body of Andrew Marvell, Esq., a man so endowed by Nature, so improved by Education, Study, and Travel, so consummated by Experience, that, joining the peculiar graces of Wit and Learning, with a singular penetration and strength of judgment; and exercising all these in the whole course of his life, with an unutterable steadiness in the ways of Virtue, he became the ornament and example of his age, beloved by good men, feared by bad, admired by all, though imitated by few; and scarce paralleled by any. But a Tombstone can neither contain his character, nor is Marble necessary to transmit it to posterity; it is engraved in the minds of this generation, and will be always legible in his inimitable writings, nevertheless. He having served twenty years successfully in Parliament, and that with such Wisdom, Dexterity, and Courage, as becomes a true Patriot, the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, from whence he was deputed to that Assembly, lamenting in his death the public loss, have erected this Monument of their Grief and their Gratitude, 1688.\nProse.\nMarvell also wrote anonymous prose satires: criticizing the monarchy and Roman Catholicism, defending Puritan dissenters, and denouncing censorship.\n\"The Rehearsal Transpros'd\", an attack on Samuel Parker, was published in two parts in 1672 and 1673.\n\"Mr. Smirke; or The Divine in Mode\", (1676) criticised Church of England intolerance, and was published together with a \"Short Historical Essay, concerning General Councils, Creeds, and Impositions, in matters of Religion.\"\nMarvell's pamphlet \"An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in England\", published in late 1677, alleged that: \"There has now for diverse Years, a design been carried on, to change the Lawfull Government of \"England\" into an Absolute Tyranny, and to convert the established Protestant Religion into down-right Popery\". John Kenyon described it as \"one of the most influential pamphlets of the decade\" and G. M. Trevelyan called it: \"A fine pamphlet, which throws light on causes provocative of the formation of the Whig party\".\nA 1678 work published anonymously (\"by a Protestant\") in defense of John Howe against the attack of his fellow-dissenter, the severe Calvinist Thomas Danson, is also probably by Marvell. Its full title is \"Remarks upon a late disingenuous discourse, writ by one T.D. under the pretence de causa Dei, and of answering Mr. John Howe's letter and postscript of God's prescience, &amp;c., affirming, as the Protestant doctrine, that God doth by efficacious influence universally move and determine men to all their actions, even to those that are most wicked\".\nViews.\nAlthough Marvell became a Parliamentarian and was opposed to episcopacy, he was not a Puritan. Later in life especially, he seems to have been a conforming Anglican. Marvell positively identifies himself as \"a Protestant\" in pamphlets. He had flirted briefly with Catholicism as a youth, and was described in his thirties (on the Saumur visit) as \"a notable English Italo-Machiavellian\".\nHis strong Biblical influence is clear in poems such as \"The Garden\", the \"Coronet\" and \"The Bermudas\".\nVincent Palmieri noted that Marvell is sometimes known as the \"British Aristides\" for his incorruptible integrity in life and poverty at death. Many of his poems were not published until 1681, three years after his death, from a collection owned by Mary Palmer, his housekeeper. After Marvell's death she laid dubious claim to having been his wife, from the time of a secret marriage in 1667.\nMarvell's poetic style.\nMarvell is said to have adhered to the established stylized forms of his contemporary neoclassical tradition. These include the carpe diem lyric tradition which also forms the basis of his famous lyric \"To His Coy Mistress\". He adopted familiar forms and infused them with his unique conceits, analogies, reflections and preoccupations with larger questions about life and death. T.S. Eliot wrote of Marvell's style that \"It is more than a technical accomplishment, or the vocabulary and syntax of an epoch; it is, what we have designated tentatively as wit, a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace\". He also identified Marvell and the metaphysical school with the \"dissociation of sensibility\" that occurred in 17th-century English literature; Eliot described this trend as \"something which ... happened to the mind of England...it is the difference between the intellectual poet and the reflective poet\". Poets increasingly developed a self-conscious relationship to tradition, which took the form of a new emphasis on craftsmanship of expression and an idiosyncratic freedom in allusions to Classical and Biblical sources.\n\"To His Coy Mistress\", Marvell's most celebrated poem, combines an old poetic conceit (the persuasion of the speaker's lover by means of a carpe diem philosophy) with Marvell's typically vibrant imagery and easy command of rhyming couplets. Other works incorporate topical satire and religious themes.\nLegacy.\nA secondary school in Hull, the Andrew Marvell Business and Enterprise College, is named after him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called \"the Younger\" to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school.\nHolbein was born in Augsburg but worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first, he painted murals and religious works, and designed stained glass windows and illustrations for books from the printer Johann Froben. He also painted an occasional portrait, making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus. When the Reformation reached Basel, Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons. His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, as well as by Renaissance humanism. The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own.\nHolbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work with a recommendation from Erasmus. He was welcomed into the humanist circle of Thomas More, where he quickly built a high reputation. He returned to Basel for four years, then resumed his career in England in 1532 under the patronage of Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell. By 1535, he was King's Painter to Henry VIII. In this role, he produced portraits and festive decorations, as well as designs for jewellery, plate, and other precious objects. His portraits of the royal family and nobles are a record of the court in the years when Henry was asserting his supremacy over the Church of England.\nHolbein's art was prized from early in his career. French poet and reformer Nicholas Bourbon (the elder) dubbed him \"the Apelles of our time\", a typical accolade at the time. Holbein has also been described as a great \"one-off\" in art history since he founded no school. Some of his work was lost after his death, but much was collected and he was recognized among the great portrait masters by the 19th century. Recent exhibitions have also highlighted his versatility. He created designs ranging from intricate jewellery to monumental frescoes.\nHolbein's art has sometimes been called realist, since he drew and painted with a rare precision. His portraits were renowned in their time for their likeness, and it is through his eyes that many famous figures of his day are pictured today, such as Erasmus and More. He was never content with outward appearance, however; he embedded layers of symbolism, allusion, and paradox in his art, to the lasting fascination of scholars. In the view of art historian Ellis Waterhouse, his portraiture \"remains unsurpassed for sureness and economy of statement, penetration into character, and a combined richness and purity of style.\"\nBiography.\nEarly career.\nHolbein was born in the free imperial city of Augsburg during the winter of 1497\u201398. He was a son of the painter and draughtsman Hans Holbein the Elder, whose trade he and his older brother, Ambrosius, followed. Holbein the Elder ran a large and busy workshop in Augsburg, sometimes assisted by his brother Sigmund, also a painter.\nBy 1515, Hans and Ambrosius had moved as journeymen painters to the city of Basel, a centre of learning and the printing trade. There they were apprenticed to Hans Herbster, Basel's leading painter. The brothers found work in Basel as designers of woodcuts and metalcuts for printers. In 1515, the preacher and theologian Oswald Myconius invited them to add pen drawings to the margin of a copy of \"The Praise of Folly\" by the humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. The sketches provide early evidence of Holbein's wit and humanistic leaning. His other early works, including the double portrait of Basel's mayor Jakob Meyer zum Hasen and his wife , follow his father's style. With Meyer zum Hasen, Holbein maintained a close working relationship until the latter was sacked in 1521. \nThe young Holbein, alongside his brother and his father, is pictured in the left-hand panel of Holbein the Elder's 1504 altar piece triptych the \"Basilica of St. Paul\", which is displayed at the Staatsgalerie in Augsburg.\nIn 1517, father and son began a project in Lucerne (Luzern), painting internal and external murals for the merchant Jakob von Hertenstein. While in Lucerne, Holbein also designed cartoons for stained glass. The city's records show that on 10 December 1517, he was fined five livres for fighting in the street with a goldsmith called Caspar, who was fined the same amount. That winter, Holbein probably visited northern Italy, though no record of the trip survives. Many scholars believe he studied the work of Italian masters of fresco, such as Andrea Mantegna, before returning to Lucerne. He filled two series of panels at Hertenstein's house with copies of works by Andrea Mantegna, including \"The Triumphs of Caesar\".\nIn 1519, Holbein moved back to Basel. His brother fades from the record at about this time, and it is usually presumed that he died. Holbein re-established himself rapidly in the city, running a busy workshop. He joined the painters' guild and took out Basel citizenship. He married Elsbeth Binsenstock-Schmid in 1519, a widow a few years older than he was, who had an infant son, Franz, and was running her late husband's tanning business. She bore Holbein a son of his own, Philipp, in their first year of marriage a girl called Katharina in 1526 and two more children, Jacob and K\u00fcngold in later years. \nHolbein was prolific during this period in Basel, which coincided with the arrival of Lutheranism in the city. He undertook a number of major projects, such as external murals for \"The House of the Dance\" and internal murals for the Council Chamber of the Town Hall. The former are known from preparatory drawings. The Council Chamber murals survive in a few poorly preserved fragments. Holbein also produced a series of religious paintings and designed cartoons for stained glass windows.\nIn a period of a revolution in book design, he illustrated for the publisher Johann Froben. His woodcut designs included those for the \"Dance of Death\", cut by the formschneider Hans L\u00fctzelburger the \"Icones\" (illustrations of the Old Testament), and the title page of Martin Luther's bible. Additionally he designed twelve alphabets, of those a Greek and Latin for Froben. The letters were ornamented with depictions of Greek and Roman gods, heads of Caesars, poets and philosophers. Through the woodcut medium, Holbein refined his grasp of expressive and spatial effects. \nHolbein also painted the occasional portrait in Basel, among them the double portrait of Jakob and Dorothea Meyer, and, in 1519, that of the young academic Bonifacius Amerbach. According to art historian Paul Ganz, the portrait of Amerbach marks an advance in his style, notably in the use of unbroken colours. For Meyer, he painted an altarpiece of the Madonna which included portraits of the donor, his wife, and his daughter. In 1523, Holbein painted his first portraits of the great Renaissance scholar Erasmus, who required likenesses to send to his friends and admirers throughout Europe. These paintings made Holbein an international artist. Holbein visited France in 1524, probably to seek work at the court of Francis I. When Holbein decided to seek employment in England in 1526, Erasmus recommended him to his friend the statesman and scholar Thomas More. \"The arts are freezing in this part of the world,\" he wrote, \"and he is on the way to England to pick up some angels\".\nEngland, 1526\u20131528.\nHolbein broke his journey towards Antwerp, where he delivered a recommendation from Erasmus to Pieter Gillis. In Antwerp, he also bought some oak panels and may have met the painter Quentin Matsys. Gillis then seemed to have sent Holbein to the Court of England, where Sir Thomas More welcomed him to and found him a series of commissions. \"Your painter, my dearest Erasmus,\" he wrote, \"is a wonderful artist\". Holbein painted the famous \"Portrait of Sir Thomas More\" and another of More with his family. The group portrait, original in conception, is known only from a preparatory sketch and copies by other hands. According to art historian Andreas Beyer, it \"offered a prelude of a genre that would only truly gain acceptance in Dutch painting of the seventeenth century\". Seven fine-related studies of More family members also survive.\nDuring this first stay in England, Holbein worked largely for a humanist circle with ties to Erasmus. Among his commissions was the portrait of William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, who owned a Holbein portrait of Erasmus. Holbein also painted the Bavarian astronomer and mathematician Nicholas Kratzer, a tutor of the More family whose notes appear on Holbein's sketch for their group portrait. Although Holbein did not work for the King during this visit, he painted the portraits of courtiers such as Sir Henry Guildford and his wife Lady Mary, and of Anne Lovell, identified in 2003 or 2004 as the subject of \"Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling\". In May 1527, \"Master Hans\" also painted a panorama of the siege of Th\u00e9rouanne for the visit of French ambassadors. With Kratzer, he devised a ceiling covered in planetary signs, under which the visitors dined. The chronicler Edward Hall described the spectacle as showing \"the whole Earth, environed with the sea, like a very map or cart\".\nBasel, 1528\u20131532.\nIn August 1528, Holbein bought a house in Basel in St.Johanns-Vorstadt and became the neighbor of Hieronymus Froben. For this house he paid a third in advance. He presumably returned home to preserve his citizenship, since he had been granted only a two-year leave of absence. Enriched by his success in England, Holbein bought a second neighboring house in 1531 for which he initially advanced only a seventh of the price and was to pay a yearly rate during the following six years. \nDuring this period in Basel, he painted \"The Artist's Family\", showing Elsbeth with the couple's two eldest children, Philipp and Katherina, evoking images of the Virgin and Child with St John the Baptist. Art historian John Rowlands sees this work as \"one of the most moving portraits in art, from an artist, too, who always characterized his sitters with a guarded restraint\".\nBasel had become a turbulent city in Holbein's absence. Reformers, swayed by the ideas of Zwingli, carried out acts of iconoclasm and banned imagery in churches. In April 1529, the free-thinking Erasmus felt obliged to leave his former haven for Freiburg im Breisgau. The iconoclasts probably destroyed some of Holbein's religious artwork, though the paintings on the organ doors of the Basel Minster were saved. Evidence for Holbein's religious views is fragmentary and inconclusive. \"The religious side of his paintings had always been ambiguous,\" suggests art historian John North, \"and so it remained\". According to a register compiled to ensure that all major citizens subscribed to the new doctrines: \"Master Hans Holbein, the painter, says that we must be better informed about the [holy] table before approaching it\". In 1530, the authorities called Holbein to account for failing to attend the reformed communion. Shortly afterwards, however, he was listed among those \"who have no serious objections and wish to go along with other Christians\".\nHolbein evidently retained favour under the new order. The reformist council paid him a retaining fee of 50 florins and commissioned him to resume work on the Council Chamber frescoes. They now chose themes from the Old Testament instead of the previous stories from classical history and allegory. Holbein's frescoes of Rehoboam and of the meeting between Saul and Samuel were more simply designed than their predecessors. Holbein worked for traditional clients at the same time. His old patron Jakob Meyer paid him to add figures and details to the family altarpiece he had painted in 1526. Holbein's last commission in this period was the decoration of two clock faces on the city gate in 1531. The reduced levels of patronage in Basel may have prompted his decision to return to England early in 1532.\nEngland, 1532\u20131540.\nHolbein returned to England, where the political and religious environment was changing radically. In 1532, Henry VIII was preparing to repudiate Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, in defiance of the pope. Among those who opposed Henry's actions was Holbein's former host and patron Sir Thomas More, who resigned as Lord Chancellor in May 1532. Around this time, Holbein is supposed to have decorated the mortuary roll of John Islip, abbot of Westminster, one of the last mortuary rolls created. Holbein seems to have distanced himself from More's humanist milieu on this visit, and \"he deceived those to whom he was recommended\", according to Erasmus. The artist found favour instead within the radical new power circles of the Boleyn family and Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell became the king's secretary in 1534, controlling all aspects of government, including artistic propaganda. More was executed in 1535 along with John Fisher, whose portrait Holbein had also drawn.\nHolbein's commissions in the early stages of his second English period included portraits of Lutheran merchants of the Hanseatic League. The merchants lived and plied their trade at the Steelyard, a complex of warehouses, offices, and dwellings on the north bank of the Thames. Holbein rented a house in Maiden Lane nearby, and he portrayed his clients in a range of styles. His portrait of Georg Giese of Gda\u0144sk shows the merchant surrounded by exquisitely painted symbols of his trade. His portrait of Derich Berck of Cologne, on the other hand, is classically simple and possibly influenced by Titian. For the guildhall of the Steelyard, Holbein painted the monumental allegories \"The Triumph of Wealth\" and \"The Triumph of Poverty\", both now lost. The merchants also commissioned a street tableau of Mount Parnassus for Anne Boleyn's coronation eve procession of 31 May 1533.\nHolbein also portrayed various courtiers, landowners, and visitors during this time, and his most famous painting of the period was \"The Ambassadors\". This life-sized panel portrays Jean de Dinteville, an ambassador of Francis I of France in 1533, and Georges de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur who visited London the same year. The work incorporates symbols and paradoxes, including an anamorphic (distorted) skull. According to scholars, these are enigmatic references to learning, religion, mortality, and illusion in the tradition of the Northern Renaissance. Art historians Oskar B\u00e4tschmann and Pascal Griener suggest that in \"The Ambassadors\", \"Sciences and arts, objects of luxury and glory, are measured against the grandeur of Death\".\nNo certain painted portraits survive of Anne Boleyn by Holbein, perhaps because her memory was purged following her execution for treason, incest, and adultery in 1536, although there is a drawing, as made from life by Holbein preparatory to painting a portrait. It is clear, however, that Holbein worked directly for Anne and her circle. He designed a cup engraved with her device of a falcon standing on roses, as well as jewellery and books connected to her. He also sketched several women attached to her entourage, including her sister-in-law Jane Parker. At the same time, Holbein worked for Thomas Cromwell as he masterminded Henry VIII's reformation. Cromwell commissioned Holbein to produce reformist and royalist images, including anti-clerical woodcuts and the title page to Myles Coverdale's English translation of the Bible. Henry VIII had embarked on a grandiose programme of artistic patronage. His efforts to glorify his new status as Supreme Head of the Church of England culminated in the building of Nonsuch Palace, which started in 1538.\nBy 1536, Holbein was employed as the King's Painter on an annual salary of 30 pounds\u2014though he was never the highest-paid artist on the royal payroll. Royal \"pictor maker\" Lucas Horenbout earned more, and other continental artists also worked for the King. In 1537, Holbein painted his most famous image: Henry VIII standing in a heroic pose with his feet planted apart. The left section has survived of Holbein's cartoon for a life-sized wall painting at Whitehall Palace showing the King in this pose with his father behind him. The mural also depicted Jane Seymour and Elizabeth of York. It was destroyed by fire in 1698, but is known from engravings and from a 1667 copy by Remigius van Leemput. An earlier half-length portrait shows Henry in a similar pose, but all the full-length portraits of him are copies based on the Whitehall pattern. The figure of Jane Seymour in the mural is related to Holbein's sketch and painting of her.\nJane died in October 1537, shortly after bearing Henry's only legitimate son Edward VI. Holbein painted a portrait of the infant prince about two years later, clutching a sceptre-like gold rattle. Holbein's final portrait of Henry dates from 1543 and was perhaps completed by others, depicting the King with a group of barber surgeons.\nHolbein's portrait style altered after he entered Henry's service. He focused more intensely on the sitter's face and clothing, largely omitting props and three-dimensional settings. He applied this clean, craftsman-like technique to miniature portraits such as that of Jane Small, and to grand portraits such as that of Christina of Denmark. He travelled with Philip Hoby to Brussels in 1538 and sketched Christina for the King, who was appraising the young widow as a prospective bride. John Hutton, the English ambassador in Brussels, reported that another artist's drawing of Christina was \"sloberid\" (slobbered) compared to Holbein's. In Wilson's view, Holbein's subsequent oil portrait is \"the loveliest painting of a woman that he ever executed, which is to say that it is one of the finest female portraits ever painted\". \nThe same year, Holbein and Hoby went to France to paint Louise of Guise and Anna of Lorraine for Henry VIII. Neither portrait of these cousins has survived. Holbein found time to visit Basel, where he was f\u00eated by the authorities and granted a pension. On the way back to England, he apprenticed his son Philipp to Basel-born goldsmith Jacob David in Paris.\nHolbein painted Anne of Cleves at Burgau Castle, posing her square-on and in elaborate finery. This was the woman whom Henry married at D\u00fcren at the encouragement of Thomas Cromwell in the summer of 1539. English envoy Nicholas Wotton reported that \"Hans Holbein hath taken the effigies of my Lady Anne and the lady Amelia [Anne's sister] and hath expressed their images very lively\". Henry was disillusioned with Anne in the flesh, however, and he divorced her after a brief, unconsummated marriage. There is a tradition that Holbein's portrait flattered Anne, derived from the testimony of Sir Anthony Browne.\nHenry said that he was dismayed by her appearance at Rochester, having seen her pictures and heard advertisements of her beauty\u2014so much that his face fell. No one other than Henry ever described Anne as repugnant; French Ambassador Charles de Marillac thought her quite attractive, pleasant, and dignified, though dressed in unflattering, heavy German clothing, as were her attendants. Some of the blame for the King's disillusionment fell on Thomas Cromwell, who had been instrumental in arranging the marriage and had passed on some exaggerated claims of Anne's beauty. This was one of the factors that led to Cromwell's downfall.\nLast years and death, 1540\u20131543.\nHolbein had deftly survived the downfall of his first two great patrons, Thomas More and Anne Boleyn, but Cromwell's sudden arrest and execution on trumped-up charges of heresy and treason in 1540 undoubtedly damaged his career. Though Holbein retained his position as King's Painter, Cromwell's death left a gap no other patron could fill. It was, ironically, Holbein's portrait of Anne of Cleves which largely led to Cromwell's downfall: furious at being saddled with a wife he found entirely unattractive, the King directed all his anger at Cromwell. Granted, Cromwell had exaggerated her beauty, but there is no evidence that Henry blamed Holbein for supposedly flattering Anne's looks.\nApart from routine official duties, Holbein now occupied himself with private commissions, turning again to portraits of Steelyard merchants. He also painted some of his finest miniatures, including those of Henry Brandon and Charles Brandon, sons of Henry VIII's friend Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk and his fourth wife, Catherine Willoughby. Holbein managed to secure commissions among those courtiers who now jockeyed for power, in particular from Anthony Denny, one of the two chief gentlemen of the bedchamber. He became close enough to Denny to borrow money from him. He painted Denny's portrait in 1541 and two years later designed a clock-salt for him. Denny was part of a circle that gained influence in 1542 after the failure of Henry's marriage to Catherine Howard. The King's marriage in July 1543 to the reformist Catherine Parr, whose brother Holbein had painted in 1541, established Denny's party in power.\nHolbein may have visited his wife and children in late 1540, when his leave of absence from Basel expired. None of his work dates from this period, and the Basel authorities paid him six months' salary in advance. The state of Holbein's marriage has intrigued scholars, who base their speculations on fragmentary evidence. Apart from one brief visit, Holbein had lived apart from Elsbeth since 1532. His will reveals that he had two infant children in England, of whom nothing is known except that they were in the care of a nurse. \nHolbein's unfaithfulness to Elsbeth may not have been new. Some scholars believe that Magdalena Offenburg, the model for the \"Darmstadt Madonna\" and for two portraits painted in Basel, was for a time Holbein's mistress. Others dismiss the idea. One of the portraits was of Lais of Corinth, mistress of Apelles, the famous artist of Greek antiquity after whom Holbein was named in humanist circles. Whatever the case, it is likely that Holbein always supported his wife and children. When Elsbeth died in 1549, she was well off and still owned many of Holbein's fine clothes; on the other hand, she had sold his portrait of her before his death.\nHans Holbein died between 7 October and 29 November 1543 at the age of 45. Karel van Mander stated in the early 17th century that he died of the plague. Wilson regards the story with caution since Holbein's friends attended his bedside; and Peter Claussen suggests that he died of an infection. Describing himself as \"servant to the king's majesty\", Holbein made his will on 7 October at his home in Aldgate. The goldsmith John of Antwerp and a few German neighbours signed as witnesses. \nHolbein may have been in a hurry, because the will was not witnessed by a lawyer. On 29 November, John of Antwerp, the subject of several of Holbein's portraits, legally undertook the administration of the artist's last wishes. He presumably settled Holbein's debts, arranged for the care of his two children, and sold and dispersed his effects, including many designs and preliminary drawings that have survived. The site of Holbein's grave is unknown and may never have been marked. The churches of St Katherine Cree or St Andrew Undershaft in London are possible locations, being located near his house.\nArt.\nInfluences.\nThe first influence on Holbein was his father, Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished religious artist and portraitist who passed on his techniques as a religious artist and his gifts as a portraitist to his son. The young Holbein learned his craft in his father's workshop in Augsburg, a city with a thriving book trade, where woodcut and engraving flourished. Augsburg also acted as one of the chief \"ports of entry\" into Germany for the ideas of the Italian Renaissance. By the time Holbein began his apprenticeship under Hans Herbster in Basel, he was already steeped in the late Gothic style, with its unsparing realism and emphasis on line, which influenced him throughout his life. In Basel, he was favoured by humanist patrons, whose ideas helped form his vision as a mature artist.\nDuring his Swiss years, when he may have visited Italy, Holbein added an Italian element to his stylistic vocabulary. Scholars note the influence of Leonardo da Vinci's \"sfumato\" (smoky) technique on his work, for example in his \"Lais of Corinth\". From the Italians, Holbein learned the art of single-point perspective and the use of antique motifs and architectural forms. In this, he may have been influenced by Andrea Mantegna. The decorative detail recedes in his late portraits, though the calculated precision remains. Despite assimilating Italian techniques and Reformation theology, Holbein's art in many ways extended the Gothic tradition.\nHis portrait style, for example, remained distinct from the more sensuous technique of Titian, and from the Mannerism of William Scrots, Holbein's successor as King's Painter. Holbein's portraiture, particularly his drawings, had more in common with that of Jean Clouet, which he may have seen during his visit to France in 1524. He adopted Clouet's method of drawing with coloured chalks on a plain ground, as well as his care over preliminary portraits for their own sake. During his second stay in England, Holbein learned the technique of limning, as practised by Lucas Horenbout. In his last years, he raised the art of the portrait miniature to its first peak of brilliance.\nReligious works.\nHolbein followed in the footsteps of Augsburg artists like his father and Hans Burgkmair, who largely made their living from religious commissions. Despite calls for reform, the church in the late 15th century was medieval in tradition. It maintained an allegiance to Rome and a faith in pieties such as pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and prayer for dead souls. Holbein's early work reflects this culture. The growing reform movement, led by humanists such as Erasmus and Thomas More, began, however, to change religious attitudes. Basel, where Martin Luther's major works were first published, became the main centre for the transmission of Reformation ideas.\nThe gradual shift from traditional to reformed religion can be charted in Holbein's work. His \"Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb\" of 1522 expresses a humanist view of Christ in tune with the reformist climate in Basel at the time. The \"Dance of Death\" (1523\u201326) refashions the late-medieval allegory of the \"Danse Macabre\" as a reformist satire. Holbein's series of woodcuts shows the figure of \"Death\" in many disguises, confronting individuals from all walks of life. None escape Death's skeleton clutches, even the pious.\nIn addition to the \"Dance of Death\" Holbein completed \"Icones\" or \"Series of the Old Gospel\" (It contains two works: \"The images of the stories of the Old Gospel\" and \"Portraits or printing boards of the story of the Old Gospel\"). These works were arranged by Holbein with Melchior &amp; Gaspar Trechsel in about 1526, later printed and edited in Latin by Jean &amp; Francois Frellon with 92 woodcuts. These two works also share the first four figures with the \"Dance of Death\".\nIt appears that the Trechsel brothers initially intended to hire Holbein for illustrating Bibles. In fact, some of Holbein's \"Icones\" woodcuts appear in the recently discovered \"Biblia cum Glossis\" by Michel De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus). Holbein woodcuts appear in several other works by Servetus: his Spanish translation of \"The images of the stories of the Old Gospel\", printed by Juan Stelsio in Antwerp in 1540 (92 woodcuts), and also of his Spanish versification of the associated work \"Portraits or printing boards of the story of the Old Gospel\", printed by Francois and Jean Frellon in 1542 (same 92 woodcuts plus 2 more), as it was demonstrated in the International Society for the History of Medicine, by the expert researcher in Servetus, Gonz\u00e1lez Echeverr\u00eda, who also proved the existence of the other work of Holbein &amp; De Villeneuve, \"Biblia cum Glossis\" or \" Lost Bible\".\nHolbein painted many large religious works between 1520 and 1526, including the \"Oberried Altarpiece\", the \"Solothurn Madonna\", and the \"Passion\". Only when Basel's reformers turned to iconoclasm in the later 1520s did his freedom and income as a religious artist suffer.\nHolbein continued to produce religious art, but on a much smaller scale. He designed satirical religious woodcuts in England. His small painting for private devotion, \"Noli Me Tangere\", has been taken as an expression of his personal religion. Depicting the moment when the risen Christ tells Mary Magdalene not to touch him, Holbein adheres to the details of the bible story. The 17th-century diarist John Evelyn wrote that he \"never saw so much reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture\".\nHolbein has been described as \"the supreme representative of German Reformation art\". The Reformation was a varied movement, however, and his position was often ambiguous. Despite his ties with Erasmus and More, he signed up to the revolution begun by Martin Luther, which called for a return to the Bible and the overthrow of the papacy. In his woodcuts \"Christ as the Light of the World\" and \"The Selling of Indulgences\", Holbein illustrated attacks by Luther against Rome. At the same time, he continued to work for Erasmians and known traditionalists. After his return from England to a reformed Basel in 1528, he resumed work both on Jakob Meyer's Madonna and on the murals for the Council Chamber of the Town Hall. The Madonna was an icon of traditional piety, while the Old Testament murals illustrated a reformist agenda.\nHolbein returned to England in 1532 as Thomas Cromwell was about to transform religious institutions there. He was soon at work for Cromwell's propaganda machine, creating images in support of the royal supremacy and (in the case of \"An Allegory of the Old and New Testaments\") Lutheranism. The painting identified the Old Testament with the \"Old Religion\". During the period of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, he produced a series of small woodcuts in which biblical villains were dressed as monks. Scholars have detected subtler religious references in his portraits. In \"The Ambassadors\", for example, details such as the Lutheran hymn book and the crucifix behind the curtain allude to the context of the French mission. Holbein painted few religious images in the later part of his career. He focused on secular designs for decorative objects, and on portraits stripped of inessentials.\nPortraits.\nFor Holbein, \"everything began with a drawing\". A gifted draughtsman, he was heir to a German tradition of line drawing and precise preparatory design. Holbein's chalk and ink portraits demonstrate his mastery of outline. He always made preparatory portraits of his sitters, though many drawings survive for which no painted version is known, suggesting that some were drawn for their own sake. Holbein produced relatively few portraits during his years in Basel. Among these were his 1516 studies of Jakob and Dorothea Meyer, sketched, like many of his father's portrait drawings, in silverpoint and chalk.\nHolbein painted most of his portraits during his two periods in England. In the first, between 1526 and 1528, he used the technique of Jean Clouet for his preliminary studies, combining black and coloured chalks on unprimed paper. In the second, from 1532 to his death, he drew on smaller sheets of pink-primed paper, adding pen and brushwork in ink to the chalk. Judging by the three-hour sitting given to him by Christina of Denmark, Holbein could produce such portrait studies quickly. Some scholars believe that he used a mechanical device to help him trace the contours of his subjects' faces. Holbein paid less attention to facial tones in his later drawings, making fewer and more emphatic strokes, but they are never formulaic. His grasp of spatial relationships ensures that each portrait, however sparely drawn, conveys the sitter's presence.\nHolbein's painted portraits were closely founded on drawing. Holbein transferred each drawn portrait study to the panel with the aid of geometrical instruments. He then built up the painted surface in tempera and oil, recording the tiniest detail, down to each stitch or fastening of costume. In the view of art historian Paul Ganz, \"The deep glaze and the enamel-like lustre of the colouring were achieved by means of the metallic, highly polished crayon groundwork, which admitted of few corrections and, like the preliminary sketch, remained visible through the thin layer of colour\".\nThe result is a brilliant portrait style in which the sitters appear, in Foister's words, as \"recognisably individual and even contemporary-seeming\" people, dressed in minutely rendered clothing that provides an unsurpassed source for the history of Tudor costume. Holbein's humanist clients valued individuality highly. According to Strong, his portrait subjects underwent \"a new experience, one which was a profound visual expression of humanist ideals\".\nCommentators differ in their response to Holbein's precision and objectivity as a portraitist. What some see as an expression of spiritual depth in his sitters, others have called mournful, aloof, or even vacant. \"Perhaps an underlying coolness suffuses their countenances,\" wrote Holbein's 19th-century biographer Alfred Woltmann, \"but behind this outward placidness lies hidden a breadth and depth of inner life\". Some critics see the iconic and pared-down style of Holbein's later portraits as a regression. Kenyon Cox, for example, believes that his methods grew more primitive, reducing painting \"almost to the condition of medieval illumination\". Erna Auerbach relates the \"decorative formal flatness\" of Holbein's late art to the style of illuminated documents, citing the group portrait of Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons' Company. Other analysts detect no loss of powers in Holbein's last phase.\nUntil the later 1530s, Holbein often placed his sitters in a three-dimensional setting. At times, he included classical and biblical references and inscriptions, as well as drapery, architecture, and symbolic props. Such portraits allowed Holbein to demonstrate his virtuosity and powers of allusion and metaphor, as well as to hint at the private world of his subjects. His 1532 portrait of Sir Brian Tuke, for example, alludes to the sitter's poor health, comparing his sufferings to those of Job. The depiction of the Five wounds of Christ and the inscription \"INRI\" on Tuke's crucifix are, according to scholars B\u00e4tschmann and Griener, \"intended to protect its owner against ill-health\". Holbein portrays the merchant Georg Giese among elaborate symbols of science and wealth that evoke the sitter's personal iconography. However, some of Holbein's other portraits of Steelyard merchants, for example that of Derich Born, concentrate on the naturalness of the face. They prefigure the simpler style that Holbein favoured in the later part of his career.\nStudy of Holbein's later portraits has been complicated by the number of copies and derivative works attributed to him. Scholars now seek to distinguish the true Holbeins by the refinement and quality of the work. The hallmark of Holbein's art is a searching and perfectionist approach discernible in his alterations to his portraits. In the words of art historian John Rowlands:\nThis striving for perfection is very evident in his portrait drawings, where he searches with his brush for just the right line for the sitter's profile. The critical faculty in making this choice and his perception of its potency in communicating decisively the sitter's character is a true measure of Holbein's supreme greatness as a portrait painter. Nobody has ever surpassed the revealing profile and stance in his portraits: through their telling use, Holbein still conveys across the centuries the character and likeness of his sitters with unrivalled mastery.\nMiniatures.\nDuring his last decade, Holbein painted a number of miniatures, which are small portraits worn as a kind of jewel. His miniature technique derived from the medieval art of manuscript illumination. His small panel portrait of Henry VIII shows an interpenetration between his panel and miniature painting. Holbein's large pictures had always contained a miniature-like precision. He now adapted this skill to the smaller form, somehow retaining a monumental effect. The twelve or so certain miniatures by Holbein that survive reveal his mastery of \"limning\", as the technique was called. \nHis miniature portrait of Jane Small, with its rich blue background, crisp outlines, and absence of shading, is considered a masterpiece of the genre. According to art historian Graham Reynolds, Holbein \"portrays a young woman whose plainness is scarcely relieved by her simple costume of black-and-white materials, and yet there can be no doubt that this is one of the great portraits of the world. With remarkable objectivity Holbein has not added anything of himself or subtracted from his sitter's image; he has seen her as she appeared in a solemn mood in the cold light of his painting-room\".\nDesigns.\nThroughout his life, Holbein designed both large-scale decorative works such as murals and smaller objects, including plate and jewellery. In many cases, his designs, or copies of them, are the sole evidence for such works. For example, his murals for the Hertenstein House in Lucerne and for the House of the Dance in Basel are known only through his designs. As his career progressed, he added Italian Renaissance motifs to his Gothic vocabulary.\nMany of the intricate designs etched into suits of Greenwich armour, including King Henry's own personal tournament harnesses, were based on designs by Holbein. His style continued to influence the unique form of English armour for nearly half a century after his death.\nHolbein's cartoon for part of the dynastic Tudor wall painting at Whitehall reveals how he prepared for a large mural. It was made of 25 pieces of paper, each figure cut out and pasted onto the background. Many of Holbein's designs for glass painting, metalwork, jewellery, and weapons also survive. All demonstrate the precision and fluidity of his draughtsmanship. In the view of art historian Susan Foister, \"These qualities so animate his decorative designs, whether individual motifs, such as his favoured serpentine mermen and women, or the larger shapes of cups, frames, and fountains, that they scintillate on paper even before their transformation into precious metal and stone\".\nHolbein's way of designing objects was to sketch preliminary ideas and then draw successive versions with increasing precision. His final draft was a presentation version. He often used traditional patterns for ornamental details such as foliage and branches. When designing precious objects, Holbein worked closely with craftsmen such as goldsmiths including Cornelis Hayes. His design work, suggests art historian John North, \"gave him an unparalleled feel for the textures of materials of all kinds, and it also gave him the habit of relating physical accessories to face and personality in his portraiture\". Although little is known of Holbein's workshop, scholars assume that his drawings were partly intended as sources for his assistants.\nLegacy and reputation.\nHolbein's fame owes something to that of his sitters. Several of his portraits have become cultural icons. He created the standard image of Henry VIII. In painting Henry as an iconic hero, however, he also subtly conveyed the tyranny of his character. Holbein's portraits of other historical figures, such as Erasmus, Thomas More, and Thomas Cromwell, have fixed their images for posterity. The same is true for the array of English lords and ladies whose appearance is often known only through his art. For this reason, John North calls Holbein \"the cameraman of Tudor history\". In Germany, on the other hand, Holbein is regarded as an artist of the Reformation, and in Europe of humanism.\nIn Basel, Holbein's legacy was secured by his friend Amerbach and by Amerbach's son Basilius, who collected his work. The Amerbach-Kabinett later formed the core of the Holbein collection at the Kunstmuseum Basel. Although Holbein's art was also valued in England, few 16th-century English documents mention him. Archbishop Matthew Parker (1504\u201375) observed that his portraits were \"delineated and expressed to the resemblance of life\". At the end of the 16th century, the miniature portraitist Nicholas Hilliard spoke in his treatise \"Arte of Limning\" of his debt to Holbein: \"Holbein's manner have I ever imitated, and hold it for the best\". No account of Holbein's life was written until Karel van Mander's often inaccurate \"Schilder-Boeck\" (Painter-Book) of 1604.\nHolbein's followers produced copies and versions of his work, but he does not seem to have founded a school. Biographer Derek Wilson calls him one of the great \"one-offs\" of art history. The only artist who appears to have adopted his techniques was John Bettes the Elder, whose \"Man in a Black Cap\" (1545) is close in style to Holbein. Scholars differ about Holbein's influence on English art. In Foister's view: \"Holbein had no real successors and few imitators in England. The disparity between his subtle, interrogatory portraits of men and women whose gazes follow us, and the stylised portraits of Elizabeth I and her courtiers can seem extreme, the more so as it is difficult to trace a proper stylistic succession to Holbein's work to bridge the middle of the century\". \nNevertheless, \"modern\" painting in England may be said to have begun with Holbein. That later artists were aware of his work is evident in their own, sometimes explicitly. Hans Eworth, for example, painted two full-length copies in the 1560s of Holbein's Henry VIII derived from the Whitehall pattern and included a Holbein in the background of his \"Mary Neville, Lady Dacre\". The influence of Holbein's \"monumentality and attention to texture\" has been detected in Eworths' work. According to art historian Erna Auerbach: \"Holbein's influence on the style of English portraiture was undoubtedly immense. Thanks to his genius, a portrait type was created which both served the requirements of the sitter and raised portraiture in England to a European level. It became the prototype of the English Court portrait of the Renaissance period\".\nA fashion for Old Masters in England after the 1620s created demand for Holbein, led by the connoisseur Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel. Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, offered to buy Holbein portraits from a friend and supply faithful copies as substitutes. The Flemish artists Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens discovered Holbein through Arundel. Arundel commissioned engravings of his Holbeins from the Czech Wenceslaus Hollar, some of works now lost. From this time, Holbein's art was also prized in the Netherlands, where the picture dealer Michel Le Blon became a Holbein connoisseur. The first \"catalogue raisonn\u00e9\" of Holbein's work was produced by the Frenchman Charles Patin and the Swiss Sebastian Faesch in 1656. They published it with Erasmus's \"Encomium mori\u00e6\" (\"The Praise of Folly\") and an inaccurate biography that portrayed Holbein as dissolute.\nIn the 18th century, Holbein found favour in Europe with those who saw his precise art as an antidote to the Baroque. In England, the connoisseur and antiquarian Horace Walpole (1717\u201397) praised him as a master of the Gothic. Walpole hung his neo-Gothic house at Strawberry Hill with copies of Holbeins and kept a Holbein room. From around 1780, a re-evaluation of Holbein set in, and he was enshrined among the canonical masters. A new cult of the sacral art masterpiece arose, endorsed by the German Romantics. This view suffered a setback during the famous controversy known as the \"Holbein-Streit\" (Holbein dispute) in the 1870s. It emerged that the revered Meyer \"Madonna\" at Dresden was a copy, and that the little-known version at Darmstadt was the Holbein original. Since then, scholars have gradually removed the attribution to Holbein from many copies and derivative works. The current scholarly view of Holbein's art stresses his versatility, not only as a painter but as a draughtsman, printmaker, and designer. Art historian Erika Michael believes that \"the breadth of his artistic legacy has been a significant factor in the sustained reception of his oeuvre\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a member of the Hanseatic League, and part of an important merchant family who had offices in London and Danzig.\nBiography.\nGiese was born in Danzig, in the Kingdom of Poland, to the influential and wealthy merchant Patrician family Giese (or Gisze). The Giese family had emigrated from Unna, near Giesen, Cologne in 1430. They were part of the Hanseatic League, that had come to dominate European trade in the 14th and 15th-centuries. The Giese family maintained offices in London, at the \"Steelyard\", where Hanseatic and foreign merchants congregated and his sons appear to have managed the London branch.\nAlbrecht studied at the Universities of Greifswald, Wittenberg and Heidelberg. As was the custom of the time for Hanseatic merchants, he toured Europe for several years to learn different languages after his formal studies, as was necessary for a long-distance trader. In 1564, on his return to Danzig, he married Elisabeth Langenbeck, whose uncle, Johann Ferber, had been the Mayor of Danzig. The following year, Giese became a councilman. Over the next six years, he was Danzig's delegate at several Hanse meetings in L\u00fcbeck.\nGiese served as a member of a delegation from Danzig to the diet of Lublin in December 1569, along with Mayors Georg Kleefeld, Constantin I Ferber, and Johann Proite. The delegation was imprisoned for four months as part of an ongoing conflict between Polish King Sigismund August and the Danzig city authorities over the creation and activities of the Polish Sea Commission (Komisja Morska) in supporting privateer raids that negatively affected trade in Danzig. The city representatives (including Giese) were ultimately released and returned to Danzig on 17 December 1570. \nGiese ultimately became Mayor of Danzig. In 1579, Giese was named royal burgrave of Danzig by the Polish king, a position that entailed the supervision of the judiciary system of the city.\nAlbrect and Elisabeth Giese had at least seven children. Two of his sons enjoyed prominent careers. One of his older sons, Tiedemann Giese, became the Bishop of Che\u0142m (Culm) and later, Prince-Bishop of Warmia (Ermland), while one of the younger sons, Georg Giese became a merchant and who is noted for having his portrait painted by Hans Holbein the younger.\nAlbrecht Giese died in 1580 in Danzig.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48329", "revid": "49214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48329", "title": "Celestial pole", "text": "Imaginary sky rotation points\nThe north and south celestial poles are the two points in the sky where Earth's axis of rotation, indefinitely extended, intersects the celestial sphere. The north and south celestial poles appear permanently directly overhead to observers at Earth's North Pole and South Pole, respectively. As Earth spins on its axis, the two celestial poles remain fixed in the sky, and all other celestial points appear to rotate around them, completing one circuit per day (strictly, per sidereal day).\nThe celestial poles are also the poles of the celestial equatorial coordinate system, meaning they have declinations of +90 degrees and \u221290 degrees (for the north and south celestial poles, respectively). Despite their apparently fixed positions, the celestial poles in the long term do not actually remain permanently fixed against the background of the stars. Because of a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, the poles trace out circles on the celestial sphere, with a period of about 25,700 years. The Earth's axis is also subject to other complex motions which cause the celestial poles to shift slightly over cycles of varying lengths (see nutation, polar motion and axial tilt). Finally, over very long periods the positions of the stars themselves change, because of the stars' proper motions. To take into account such movement, celestial pole definitions come with an epoch to specify the date of the rotation axis; J2000.0 is the current standard.\nAn analogous concept applies to other planets: a planet's celestial poles are the points in the sky where the projection of the planet's axis of rotation intersects the celestial sphere. These points vary because different planets' axes are oriented differently (the apparent positions of the stars also change slightly because of parallax effects).\nFinding the north celestial pole.\nThe north celestial pole currently is within one degree of the bright star Polaris (named from the Latin \"stella polaris\", meaning \"pole star\"). This makes Polaris, colloquially known as the \"North Star\", useful for navigation in the Northern Hemisphere: not only is it always above the north point of the horizon, but its altitude angle is always (nearly) equal to the observer's geographic latitude (though it can, of course, only be seen from locations in the Northern Hemisphere).\nPolaris is near the north celestial pole for only a small fraction of the 25,700-year precession cycle. It will remain a good approximation for about 1,000 years, by which time the pole will have moved closer to Alrai (Gamma Cephei). In about 5,500 years, the pole will have moved near the position of the star Alderamin (Alpha Cephei), and in 12,000 years, Vega (Alpha Lyrae) will become the \"North Star\", though it will be about six degrees from the true north celestial pole.\nTo find Polaris, from a point in the Northern Hemisphere, face north and locate the Big Dipper (Plough) and Little Dipper asterisms. Looking at the \"cup\" part of the Big Dipper, imagine that the two stars at the outside edge of the cup form a line pointing upward out of the cup. This line points directly at the star at the tip of the Little Dipper's handle. That star is Polaris, the North Star.\nFinding the south celestial pole.\nThe south celestial pole is visible only from the Southern Hemisphere. It lies in the dim constellation Octans, the Octant. Sigma Octantis is identified as the south pole star, more than one degree away from the pole, but with a magnitude of 5.5 it is barely visible on a clear night.\nMethod one: The Southern Cross.\nThe south celestial pole can be located from the Southern Cross (Crux) and its two \"pointer\" stars \u03b1 Centauri and \u03b2 Centauri. Draw an imaginary line from \u03b3 Crucis to \u03b1 Crucis\u2014the two stars at the extreme ends of the long axis of the cross\u2014and follow this line through the sky. Either go four-and-a-half times the distance of the long axis in the direction the narrow end of the cross points, or join the two pointer stars with a line, divide this line in half, then at right angles draw another imaginary line through the sky until it meets the line from the Southern Cross. This point is 5 or 6 degrees from the south celestial pole. Very few bright stars of importance lie between Crux and the pole itself, although the constellation Musca is fairly easily recognised immediately beneath Crux.\nMethod two: Canopus and Achernar.\nThe second method uses Canopus (the second-brightest star in the sky) and Achernar. Make a large equilateral triangle using these stars for two of the corners. But where should the third corner go? It could be on either side of the line connecting Achernar and Canopus, and the wrong side will not lead to the pole. To find the correct side, imagine that Archernar and Canopus are both points on the circumference of a circle. The third corner of the equilateral triangle will also be on this circle. The corner should be placed clockwise from Achernar and anticlockwise from Canopus. The third imaginary corner will be the south celestial pole. If the opposite is done, the point will land in the middle of Eridanus, which isn't at the pole. If Canopus has not yet risen, the second-magnitude Alpha Pavonis can also be used to form the triangle with Achernar and the pole. In this case, go anticlockwise from Achernar instead of clockwise, form the triangle with Canopus, and the third point, the pole, will reveal itself. The wrong way will lead to Aquarius, which is very far away from the celestial pole.\nMethod three: The Magellanic Clouds.\nThe third method is best for moonless and clear nights, as it uses two faint \"clouds\" in the Southern Sky. These are marked in astronomy books as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (the LMC and the SMC). These \"clouds\" are actually dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way. Make an equilateral triangle, the third point of which is the south celestial pole. Like before, the SMC, LMC, and the pole will all be points on an equilateral triangle on an imaginary circle. The pole should be placed clockwise from the SMC and anticlockwise from the LMC. Going in the wrong direction will land you in the constellation of Horologium instead.\nMethod four: Sirius and Canopus.\nA line from Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, through Canopus, the second-brightest, continued for the same distance lands within a couple of degrees of the pole. In other words, Canopus is halfway between Sirius and the pole.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48331", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48331", "title": "Measure word", "text": "Words that measure quantities\nIn linguistics, measure words are words (or morphemes) that are used in combination with a numeral to indicate an amount of something represented by some noun. Many languages use measure words, and East Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean use them very extensively in the form of number classifiers.\nDescription.\nMeasure words denote a unit of measurement and are used with mass nouns (uncountable nouns), and in some cases also with count nouns. For instance, in English, \"mud\" is a mass noun and thus one cannot say \"three muds\", but one can say \"three drops of mud\", \"three pails of mud\", etc. In these examples, \"drops\" and \"pails\" function as measure words. One can also say \"three pails of shells\"; in this case the measure word \"pails\" accompanies a count noun (\"shells\").\nThe term \"measure word\" is also sometimes used to refer to numeral classifiers, which are used with count nouns in some languages. For instance, in English no extra word is needed when saying \"three people\", but in many East Asian languages a numeral classifier is added, just as a measure word is added for uncountable nouns in English. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere are numerous Chinese measure words, and nouns differ in what measure words they can use. While many linguists maintain a distinction between measure words and numeral classifiers, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. For instance, materials for teaching Chinese as a second language generally refer to Chinese classifiers as \"measure words\". The corresponding Chinese term is (), which can be directly translated as \"quantity word\".\nMost measure words in English correspond to units of measurement or containers, and are themselves count nouns rather than grammatical particles:\nThough similar in construction, fractions are not measure words. For example, in \"seven-eighths of an apple\" the fraction acts as a noun. Compare that to \"seven slices of apple\" where \"apple\" is a mass noun and does not require the article \"an\". Combining the two, e.g. \"seven-eighths of a slice of apple\", makes it clear the fraction must be a noun referring to a part of another countable noun.\nIn many languages, including the East Asian languages referred to above, the analogous constructions do not include any equivalent of the English \"of\". In German, for example, \"ein Glas Bier\" means \"a glass [of] beer\". This is interesting since both languages are West Germanic languages, making them closely related to each other. However, the equivalent of the English \"of\" is common in Romance languages such as \"a glass of beer\":\n \nClassifiers versus measure words.\nClassifiers play a similar role to measure words, except that measure words denote a particular quantity of something (a drop, a cupful, a pint, etc.), rather than the inherent countable units associated with a count noun. Classifiers are used with count nouns; measure words can be used with mass nouns (e.g. \"two pints of mud\"), and can also be used when a count noun's quantity is not described in terms of its inherent countable units (e.g. \"two pints of acorns\").\nHowever, the terminological distinction between classifiers and measure words is often blurred \u2013 classifiers are commonly referred to as measure words in some contexts, such as Chinese language teaching, and measure words are sometimes called \"mass-classifiers\" or similar.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
