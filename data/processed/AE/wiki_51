A small passenger ferry with multiple stops, like those in Venice, Italy, is sometimes referred to as a water taxi or water bus.\nFerries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels. Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the Baltic Sea) may also be called ferry services, and many carry vehicles.\nHistory.\nThe profession of the ferryman is embodied in Greek mythology in Charon, the boatman who transported souls across the River Styx to the Underworld.\nSpeculation that a pair of oxen propelled a ship having a water wheel can be found in 4th century Roman literature \"Anonymus De Rebus Bellicis\". The concept was refined to use horses turning a capstan or a treadmill; this was a precursor to steam to drive paddlewheel boats. These were known as team boats. An example was the \"Experiment\", which was used on Lake Champlain in 19th-century America. \nIn 1850 the roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) ferry, \"Leviathan\" designed to carry freight wagons efficiently across the Firth of Forth in Scotland started to operate between Granton, near Edinburgh, and Burntisland in Fife. The vessel design was highly innovative and the ability to move freight in great quantities and with minimal labour signalled the way ahead for sea-borne transport, converting the ro-ro ferry from an experimental and marginal ship type into one of central importance in the transport of goods and passengers.\nIn 1871, the world's first car ferry crossed the Bosphorus in Istanbul. The iron steamship, named \"Suhulet\" (meaning 'ease' or 'convenience') was designed by the general manager of \u015eirket-i Hayriye (Bosporus Steam Navigation Company), Giritli H\u00fcseyin Haki Bey and built by the Greenwich shipyard of Maudslay, Sons and Field. It weighed 157 tons, was long, wide and had a draft of . It was capable of travelling up to 6 knots with the side wheel turned by its 450-horsepower, single-cylinder, two-cycle steam engine. Launched in 1872, Suhulet's unique features consisted of a symmetrical entry and exit for horse carriages, along with a dual system of hatchways. The ferry operated on the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar-Kabata\u015f route, which is still serviced by modern ferries today.\nNotable services.\nAsia.\nIn Hong Kong, Star Ferry carries passengers across Victoria Harbour. Other carriers ferry travelers between Hong Kong Island and outlying islands like Cheung Chau, Lantau Island and Lamma Island.\nIn the Philippines, the Philippine Nautical Highway System forms the backbone of the nationwide transport system by integrating ports with highway systems; the system has three main routes. Another known ferry service is the Pasig River Ferry Service, which is the only water-based transportation in Metro Manila. This system cruises the Pasig River.\nIndia.\nIndia's ro-ro ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej was inaugurated on 22 October 2017. It aims to connect South Gujarat and Saurashtra currently separated by of roadway to of ferry service. It is a part of the larger Sagar Mala project.\nWater transport in Mumbai consists of ferries, hovercraft, and catamarans, operated by various government agencies as well as private entities. The Kerala State Water Transport Department (SWTD), operating under the Ministry of Transport, Government of Kerala, India regulates the inland navigation systems in the Indian state of Kerala and provides inland water transport facilities. It stands for catering to the passenger and cargo traffic needs of the inhabitants of the waterlogged areas of the Districts of Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kollam, Ernakulam, Kannur and Kasargode. SWTD ferry service is also one of the most affordable modes to enjoy the beauty of the scenic Kerala backwaters.\nFerry operates between Port Blair, Havelock &amp; Neil Islands\u00a0in the Andaman Islands while Boat Operates For Ross Island, North Bay, Elephanta Beach, Red Skin, Jolly Bouy. Ferries and catamarans are operated by Green Ocean, Makruzz, ITT Majestic, Nautika.\nThe Kochi Water Metro is a public water transport system serving the Kochi metropolitan area in the Indian state of Kerala. It operates as an extension of the city\u2019s urban transit network and the Kochi Metro, linking the mainland with surrounding islands through a series of scheduled ferry routes. Managed by Kochi Metro Rail Limited, the system employs battery-powered electric boats and includes multiple terminals across the Kochi backwaters. The service was inaugurated in April 2023 and represents one of the first organized water metro projects in India designed for regular commuter use.\nIndonesia.\nAs the largest archipelagic country, Indonesia has several ferry routes which is managed mostly by PT. ASDP Indonesia Ferry (Persero) and several private companies. ASDP_Indonesia_Ferry or ASDP is a state-owned company engaged in the business of integrated ferry and port services and waterfront tourist destinations. ASDP operates a ferry fleet of more than 160 units handling more than 300 routes in 36 ports throughout Indonesia.\nJapan.\nJapan used to rely heavily on ferries for passenger and goods transportation among the four main islands of Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. However, as highway and railway bridges and undersea tunnels (such as the Seikan Tunnel and Honsh\u016b\u2013Shikoku Bridge Project) have been constructed, the ferry transportation has recently become for short-distance sightseeing passengers with or without car, and for long-distance truck drivers hauling goods.\nMalaysia.\nThe Malaysian state of Penang is home to the oldest ferry service in the country. The first regular ferry service operating across the Penang Strait between George Town and Province Wellesley (now Seberang Perai) was launched in 1894 by Quah Beng Kee and his brothers. The iconic yellow double-deck roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferries were introduced in 1957. Between 1959 and 2002, a total of 15 vessels were commissioned for the service.\nCurrently operated by Penang Port Sdn Bhd, the ferry service has evolved over the decades. The RORO ferries were retired in 2021, with speedboats temporarily replacing them. In 2023, these speedboats were succeeded by four newly-built catamarans, which now serve only passengers and motorcyclists. These catamarans operate between the Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal in George Town and the Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal in Seberang Perai.\nRussian Federation.\nDue to the geographical features of Russia, it has a large number of both sea and river ferry crossings. Car ferries operate from the continental part of Russia to Sakhalin, Kamchatka and Japan. The Ust-Luga \u2013 Kaliningrad ferry also runs, until February 2022 ferries also ran from St. Petersburg to different cities of the Baltic Sea. Before the construction of the Kerch Bridge, there was a ferry across the Kerch Strait, whose service was resumed after the Kerch bridge explosion.\nThere are also more than 100 ferry crossings on different rivers in Russia. These are usually symmetrical through ferries with two ramps for quick entry and exit of cars. For some categories of car owners, these ferries may be free if there is no alternative crossing of the river.\nEurope.\nScotland.\nIn Scotland, ferry services form a vital part of the national transport network, connecting the mainland with more than sixty inhabited islands and linking remote peninsulas to the rest of the country. Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac), operating under contract with Transport Scotland, runs the largest network, serving communities across the west coast and the Hebrides. A range of smaller operators, including local authorities and private companies, provide additional river, coastal, and inter-island services. Ferries have long played an important role in Scotland\u2019s transport history, and they remain essential today for residents, freight, and tourism owing to the country\u2019s rugged coastline and widely dispersed island communities. \nEngland.\nThe busiest seaway in the world, the English Channel, connects England and mainland Europe, with ships sailing from the English ports of Dover, Newhaven, Poole, Portsmouth and Plymouth to French ports, such as Calais, Dunkirk, Dieppe, Roscoff, Cherbourg-Octeville, Caen, St Malo and Le Havre. The busiest ferry route to France is the Dover to Calais crossing with approximately 9,168,000 passengers using the service in 2018. Ferries from England also sail to Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Ireland. Some ferries carry mainly tourist traffic, but most also carry freight, and some are exclusively for the use of freight lorries. In England, car-carrying ferries are sometimes referred to as RORO (roll-on, roll-off) for the ease by which vehicles can board and leave.\nDenmark.\nThe busiest single ferry route in terms of the number of departures is across the northern part of \u00d8resund, between Helsingborg, Scania, Sweden and Elsinore, Denmark. Before the \u00d8resund bridge was opened in July 2000, car and \"car and train\" ferries departed up to seven times every hour (every 8.5 minutes). This has since been reduced, but a car ferry still departs from each harbor every 15 minutes during daytime. The route is around and the crossing takes 22 minutes. Today, all ferries on this route are constructed so that they do not need to turn around in the harbors. This also means that the ferries lack stems and sterns, since the vessels sail in both directions. Starboard and port-side are dynamic, depending on the direction the ferry sails. Despite the short crossing, the ferries are equipped with restaurants (on three out of four ferries), cafeterias, and kiosks. Passengers without cars often make a double or triple return journey in the restaurants; for this, a single journey ticket is sufficient. Passenger and bicycle passenger tickets are inexpensive compared with longer routes.\nBaltic Sea.\nLarge cruiseferries sail in the Baltic Sea between Finland, \u00c5land, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Saint Petersburg, Russia. In many ways, these ferries are like cruise ships, but they can also carry hundreds of cars on car decks. Besides providing passenger and car transport across the sea, Baltic Sea cruiseferries are a popular tourist destination unto themselves, with multiple restaurants, nightclubs, bars, shops and entertainment on board. Helsinki was the busiest international passenger ferry port in the world in 2017 with over 11.8 million passengers whilst the second business international ferry port, Dover, had 11.7 million passengers. The Helsinki-Tallinn route alone accounted for nine million passengers. In 2022 the port of Helsinki had almost 8 million passengers, of which 6.3 million travelled between Helsinki and Tallinn. Additionally many smaller ferries operate on domestic routes in Finland, Sweden and Estonia.\nThe south-west and southern parts of the Baltic Sea has several routes mainly for heavy traffic and cars. The ferry routes of R\u00f8dby-Puttgarden, Trelleborg-Rostock, Trelleborg-Travem\u00fcnde, Trelleborg-\u015awinouj\u015bcie, Gedser-Rostock, Gdynia-Karlskrona, and Ystad-\u015awinouj\u015bcie are all typical \"transports\" ferries. On the longer of these routes, simple cabins are available. Some of these routes previously also carried trains, but since 2020 these trains are instead routed around the Baltic via the Great Belt fixed link and Jutland.\nTurkey.\nIn Istanbul, ferries connect the European and Asian shores of Bosphorus, as well as Princes' Islands and nearby coastal towns. In 2014, \u0130DO transported 47\u00a0million passengers, the largest ferry system in the world.\nItaly.\nThe largest ferry system in Italy is in Venice. The city's \"water taxis\" (Italian: \"taxi d'acqua\") provide service all around the city's canals. They can carry up to 10 people. They operate on a series of lines that stop at different locations around Venice.\nSweden.\nThe world's shortest ferry line is the Ferry Lina in T\u00f6reboda, Sweden. It takes around 20\u201325 seconds and is hand powered.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nDue to the numbers of large freshwater lakes and length of shoreline in Canada, various provinces and territories have ferry services.\nOn Canada's west coast, BC Ferries operates the third largest ferry service in the world. Travellers are carried from various points on the British Columbia mainland to destinations such as Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands and Haida Gwaii. In 2015, BC Ferries carried more than 8\u00a0million vehicles and 20\u00a0million passengers. \nOther operations include the Seabus, a part of Vancouver's public transit system which crosses Burrard Inlet, and False Creek Ferries, a privately operated service that operates in and around False Creek. Multiple inland ferries also operate across various lakes and rivers throughout the province. \nThe east coast has been home to numerous inter- and intra-provincial ferry and coastal services, including a large network operated by the federal government under CN Marine and later Marine Atlantic. Private and publicly owned ferry operations in eastern Canada include Marine Atlantic, serving the island of Newfoundland, as well as Bay Ferries, Northumberland Ferries, CTMA, Coastal Transport, and STQ. Canadian waters in the Great Lakes once hosted numerous ferry services, but these have been reduced to those offered by Owen Sound Transportation Company and several smaller operations. There are also several commuter passenger ferry services operated in major cities, such as Metro Transit in Halifax, and Toronto Island ferries in Toronto. There is also the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des traversiers du Qu\u00e9bec.\nUnited States.\nDue to the North Carolina coast's geography, consisting of numerous sounds, inlets, tidal arms, and islands, ferry transportation is essential in the region. The state operates twelve routes, eight of which are under the oversight of the North Carolina Department of Transportation Ferry Division, three of which are under the direct oversight of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and one of which is under the oversight of the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation. Three of the Ferry Division routes are tolled, and all ferry routes operated by the North Carolina Department of Transportation carry both vehicles and pedestrians, although certain vessels only carry pedestrians and cyclists. The National Park Service additionally works with private companies to offer ferry service to locations such as Cape Lookout and Portsmouth. Internationally, ferry services like ferry to Ireland from UK provide critical connections across the Irish Sea, akin to North Carolina's coastal network. \nWashington State Ferries operates the most extensive ferry system in the continental United States and the second largest in the world by vehicles carried, with ten routes on Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca serving terminals in Washington and Vancouver Island. In 2016, Washington State Ferries carried 10.5\u00a0million vehicles and 24.2\u00a0million riders in total.\nThe Alaska Marine Highway System provides service between Bellingham, Washington, and various towns and villages throughout Southeast and Southwest Alaska, including crossings of the Gulf of Alaska. AMHS provides affordable access to many small communities with no road connection or airport.\nThe Staten Island Ferry in New York City, sailing between the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island, is the nation's single busiest ferry route by passenger volume. Unlike riders on many other ferry services, Staten Island Ferry passengers do not pay any fare to ride it. New York City also has a network of smaller ferries, or \"water taxis\", that shuttle commuters along the Hudson River from locations in New Jersey and Northern Manhattan down to the midtown, downtown and Wall Street business centers. Several ferry companies also offer service linking midtown and lower Manhattan with locations in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, crossing the city's East River. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in February 2015 that city would begin an expanded Citywide Ferry Service, and launched as NYC Ferry in 2017, linking heretofore relatively isolated communities such as Manhattan's Lower East Side, Soundview in The Bronx, Astoria and the Rockaways in Queens and such Brooklyn neighborhoods as Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, and Red Hook with existing ferry landings in Lower Manhattan and Midtown Manhattan. A second expansion phase connected Staten Island to the West Side of Manhattan, and added a stop in Throgs Neck, in the Bronx. NYC Ferry is now the largest passenger fleet in the United States.\nThe New Orleans area also has many ferries that carry both vehicles and pedestrians. Most notable is the Algiers Ferry, which has been in continuous operation since 1827 and is one of the oldest operating ferries in North America.\nIn New England, vehicle-carrying ferry services between mainland Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket are operated by The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority, which sails year-round between Woods Hole and Vineyard Haven as well as Hyannis and Nantucket. Seasonal service is also operated from Woods Hole to Oak Bluffs during the summer and fall. As there are no bridges or tunnels connecting the islands to the mainland, The Steamship Authority ferries in addition to being the only method for transporting private cars to or from the islands, also ferry heavy freight and supplies, such as construction materials and fuel, competing with tug and barge companies. Additionally, Hy-Line Cruises operates high-speed catamaran service from Hyannis to both islands, and several smaller operations run seasonal passenger-only service primarily geared towards tourist day-trippers from other mainland ports, including New Bedford, (New Bedford Fast Ferry) Falmouth, (Island Queen ferry and Falmouth Ferry) and Harwich (Freedom Cruise Line). Ferries also bring riders and vehicles across Long Island Sound to such Connecticut cities as Bridgeport and New London, and to Block Island in Rhode Island from points on Long Island.\nTransbay commuting in the San Francisco Bay Area was primarily ferry-based until bridges were built from the 1920s to the 1960s. Prior to the bridges, car ferries were popular. Large trains were also moved across the water on ferries, reducing the time to go around the rivers and bay. By the 1970s, ferries were primarily used by tourists with Golden Gate Ferry, an organization under the ownership of the same governing body as the Golden Gate Bridge, left as the sole commute operator. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake prompted the restoration of service to the East Bay. The modern ferry network is primarily under the authority of San Francisco Bay Ferry, connecting with cities as far as Vallejo. Tourist excursions are also offered by Blue &amp; Gold Fleet and Red &amp; White Fleet. A ferry serves Angel Island (which also accepts private craft). Alcatraz is served exclusively by ferry service administered by the National Park Service.\nUntil the completion of the Mackinac Bridge in the 1950s, ferries were used for vehicle transportation between the Lower and the Upper Peninsulas of Michigan, across the Straits of Mackinac in the United States. Ferry service for bicycles and passengers continues across the straits for transport to Mackinac Island, where motorized vehicles are almost completely prohibited. This crossing is made possible by two ferry lines Shepler's Ferry and Mackinac Island Ferry Company (formerly Star Line).\nA ferry service runs between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Muskegon, Michigan operated by Lake Express. Another ferry SS Badger operates between Manitowoc, Wisconsin and Ludington, Michigan. Both cross Lake Michigan.\nNumerous additional inland ferry routes exist in the United States, such as the Cave-In-Rock Ferry across the Ohio River, and the Benton-Houston Ferry across the Tennessee River.\nMexico.\nMexico has ferry services run by Baja Ferries that connect La Paz located on the Baja California Peninsula with Mazatl\u00e1n and Topolobampo. Passenger ferries also run from Playa del Carmen to the island of Cozumel.\nSouth America.\nThere are several ferries in South America.\nChacao Channel has ferry lines.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, two Spirit of Tasmania ferries carry passengers and vehicles across Bass Strait, the body of water that separates Tasmania from the Australian mainland, often under turbulent sea conditions. These run overnight but also include day crossings in peak time. Both ferries are based in the northern Tasmanian port city of Devonport and sail to Geelong. Before Geelong this ferry used to sail to Melbourne.\nThe double-ended Freshwater-class ferry cuts an iconic shape as it makes its way up and down Sydney Harbour New South Wales, Australia between Manly and Circular Quay.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, ferries connect Wellington in the North Island with Picton in the South Island, linking New Zealand's two main islands. The route is , and is run by two companies \u2013 government-owned Interislander, and independent Bluebridge, who say the trip takes three and half hours.\nTypes.\nFerry designs depend on the length of the route, the passenger or vehicle capacity required, speed requirements and the water conditions the craft must deal with.\nDouble-ended.\nDouble-ended ferries have interchangeable bows and sterns, allowing them to shuttle back and forth between two terminals without having to turn around. Well-known double-ended ferry systems include the BC Ferries, the Staten Island Ferry, Washington State Ferries, Star Ferry, several ferries on the North Carolina Ferry System, and the Lake Champlain Transportation Company. Most Norwegian fjord and coastal ferries are double-ended vessels. All ferries from southern Prince Edward Island to the mainland of Canada were double-ended. This service was discontinued upon completion of the Confederation Bridge. Some ferries in Sydney, Australia and British Columbia are also double-ended. Many double-ended ferries are also constructed in Greece, in the shipyards of Perama and Salamis. Greek double-ended ferries are exported to other countries, such as Russia, where they are popular for short distance routes.\nIn 2008, BC Ferries launched the first of the Coastal-class ferries, which at the time were the world's largest double enders. These were surpassed as the world's largest double-enders when P&amp;O Ferries launched their first double-ender, called the P&amp;O Pioneer, which entered service in June 2023 replacing Pride of Kent.\nHydrofoil.\nHydrofoils have the advantage of higher cruising speeds, succeeding hovercraft on some English Channel routes where the ferries now compete against the Eurotunnel and Eurostar trains that use the Channel Tunnel. Passenger-only hydrofoils also proved a practical, fast and relatively economical solution in the Canary Islands, but were recently replaced by faster catamaran \"high speed\" ferries that can carry cars. Their replacement by the larger craft is seen by critics as a retrograde step given that the new vessels use much more fuel and foster the inappropriate use of cars in islands already suffering from the impact of mass tourism.\nHovercraft.\nHovercraft were developed in the 1960s and 1970s to carry cars. The largest was the massive SR.N4 which carried cars in its centre section with ramps at the bow and stern between England and France. The hovercraft was superseded by catamarans which are nearly as fast and are less affected by sea and weather conditions. Only one service now remains, a foot passenger service between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight run by Hovertravel. From 1984 to 1994 Scandinavian Airlines to operated a hovercraft service between Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen Airport as a connecting \"flight\" for passengers from southern Sweden. The service was replaced by a regular boat in 1994 and by the \u00d6resund bridge in 2000.\nCatamaran.\nSince 1990 high speed catamarans have revolutionised ferry services, replacing hovercraft, hydrofoils and conventional monohull ferries. In the 1990s there were a variety of builders, but the industry has consolidated to two builders of large vehicular ferries between 60 and 120 metres. Incat of Hobart, Tasmania favours a Wave-piercing hull to deliver a smooth ride, while Austal of Perth, Western Australia builds ships based on SWATH designs. Both these companies also compete in the smaller river ferry industry with a number of other ship builders.\nStena Line once operated the largest catamarans in the world, the Stena HSS class, between the United Kingdom and Ireland. These waterjet-powered vessels, displaced 19,638 tonnes, accommodating 375 passenger cars and 1,500 passengers. Other examples of these super-size catamarans are found in the Condor Ferries fleet with the Condor Voyager and Rapide.\nRoll-on/roll-off.\nRoll-on/roll-off ferries (RORO) are large conventional ferries named for the ease by which vehicles can board and leave.\nCruiseferry / RoPax.\nA cruiseferry is a ship that combines the features of a cruise ship with a roll-on/roll-off ferry. They are also known as RoPax for their combined Roll on/Roll Off and passenger design.\nFast RoPax ferry.\nFast RoPax ferries are conventional ferries with a large garage intake and a relatively large passenger capacity, with conventional diesel propulsion and propellers that sail over . Pioneering this class of ferries was Attica Group, when it introduced Superfast I between Greece and Italy in 1995 through its subsidiary company Superfast Ferries.\nTurntable ferry.\nThis type of ferry allows vehicles to load from the \"side\". The vehicle platform can be turned. When loading, the platform is turned sideways to allow sideways loading of vehicles. Then the platform is turned back, in line with the vessel, and the journey across water is made.\nPontoon ferry.\nPontoon ferries and flat-bottomed boats such as punts carry passengers and vehicles across rivers and lakes and are widely used in less-developed countries with large rivers where the cost of bridge construction is prohibitive. One or more vehicles are carried on such ferries with ramps at either end for vehicles or animals to board. Cable ferries are usually pontoon ferries. In the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany many such small cable ferries exist and are called p\u00fcntes.\nTrain ferry.\nA train ferry is a ship designed to carry railway vehicles. Typically, one level of the ship is fitted with railway tracks, and the vessel has a door at either or both of the front and rear to give access to the wharves.\nFoot ferry.\nFoot ferries are small craft used to ferry foot passengers, and often also cyclists, over rivers. These are either self-propelled craft or cable ferries. Such ferries are for example to be found on the lower River Scheldt in Belgium and in particular the Netherlands. Regular foot ferry service also exists in the capital of the Czech Republic, Prague, and across the Yarra River in Melbourne, Australia at Newport. Restored, expanded ferry service in the Port of New York and New Jersey uses boats for pedestrians only.\nThe UK has a variety of historic foot ferries such as the Butley Foot Ferry across Butley Creek which dates back to 1383.\nCable ferry.\nVery short distances may be crossed by a cable or chain ferry, which is usually a pontoon ferry (see above), where the ferry is propelled along and steered by cables connected to each shore. Sometimes the cable ferry is human powered by someone on the boat. Reaction ferries are cable ferries that use the perpendicular force of the current as a source of power. Examples of a current propelled ferry are the four Rhine ferries in Basel, Switzerland. Cable ferries may be used in fast-flowing rivers across short distances. With an ocean crossing of approximately 1900 metres, the cable ferry between Vancouver Island and Denman Island in British Columbia; is the longest one in the world.\nFree ferries operate in some parts of the world, such as at Woolwich in London, England (across the River Thames); in Amsterdam, Netherlands (across the IJ waterway); along the Murray River in South Australia, and across many lakes in British Columbia. Many cable ferries operate on lakes and rivers in Canada, among them a cable ferry that charges a toll operates on the Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies between Laval-sur-le-Lac and \u00cele Bizard in Quebec, Canada. In Finland there were 40 road ferries (cable ferries) in 2009, on lakes, rivers and on sea between islands.\nAir ferries.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, travel on an \"air ferry\" was possible\u2014airplanes, often ex-military, specially equipped to take a small number of cars in addition to foot passengers. These operated various routes including between the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Companies operating such services included Channel Air Bridge, Silver City Airways, and Corsair.\nThe term is also applied to any \"ferrying\" by air, and is commonly used when referring to airborne military operations.\nDocking.\nFerries often dock at specialized facilities designed to position the boat for loading and unloading, called a ferry slip. If the ferry transports road vehicles or railway carriages there will usually be an adjustable ramp called an apron that is part of the slip. In other cases, the apron ramp will be a part of the ferry itself, acting as a wave guard when elevated and lowered to meet a fixed ramp at the terminus \u2013 a road segment that extends partially underwater or meet the ferry slip.\nRecords.\nGross tonnage.\nThe world's largest ferries are typically those operated in Europe, with different vessels holding the record depending on whether length, gross tonnage or car vehicle capacity is the metric.\nOldest.\nThe sole contender as oldest ferry in continuous operation is the Mersey Ferry from Liverpool to Birkenhead, England. In 1150, the Benedictine Priory at Birkenhead was established. The monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the estuary. In 1330, Edward III granted a charter to the Priory and its successors for ever: \"the right of ferry there... for men, horses and goods, with leave to charge reasonable tolls\". However, there may have been a short break following the Dissolution of the monasteries after 1536.\nOn 11 October 1811, inventor John Stevens' ship the \"Juliana\", began operation as the first steam-powered ferry (service was between New York City, and Hoboken, New Jersey).\nThe Elwell Ferry, a cable ferry in North Carolina, travels a distance of , shore to shore, with a travel time of five minutes.\nFastest.\nThe gas turbine powered \"Luciano Federico L\" operated by Montevideo-based Buquebus, holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest car ferry in the world, in service between Montevideo, Uruguay and Buenos Aires, Argentina: its maximum speed, achieved in sea trials, was . It can carry 450 passengers and 52 cars along the route.\nSustainability.\nThe contributions of ferry travel to climate change have received less scrutiny than land and air transport, and vary considerably according to factors like speed and the number of passengers carried. Average carbon dioxide emissions by ferries per passenger-kilometre seem to be . However, ferries between Finland and Sweden produce of CO2, with total emissions equalling a CO2 equivalent of , while ferries between Finland and Estonia produce of CO2 with total emissions equalling a CO2 equivalent of .\nAlternative fuels.\nWith the price of oil at high levels, and with increasing pressure from consumers for measures to tackle global warming, a number of innovations for energy and the environment were put forward at the Interferry conference in Stockholm. According to the company Solar Sailor, hybrid marine power and solar wing technology are suitable for use with ferries, private yachts and even tankers.\nAlternative fuels are becoming more widespread on ferries. The fastest passenger ferry in the world Buquebus, runs on LNG, while Sweden's Stena converted one of its ferries to run on both diesel and methanol in 2015. Both LNG and methanol reduce CO2 emissions considerably and replace costly diesel fuel.\nMegawatt-class battery electric ferries operate in Scandinavia, with several more scheduled for operation. As of 2017, the world's biggest purely electric ferry was the , which operates on the Helsing\u00f8r\u2013Helsingborg ferry route across the \u00d8resund between Denmark and Sweden. The ferry weights 8414 tonnes, and has an electric storage capacity of more than 4 MWh.\nSince 2015, Norwegian ferry company Norled has operated e-ferry on the Lavik-Opedal connection on the E39 north of Bergen. Further north on the Norwegian west coast, the connection between Anda and Lote will be the world's first route served only by e-ferries. The first of two ships, MF \"Gloppefjord\", was put into service in January 2018, followed by MF \"Eidsfjord\". The owner, Fjord1, has commissioned a further seven battery-powered ferries to be in operation from 2020. A total of 60 battery powered car ferries are expected to be operational in Norway by 2021.\nSince 15 August 2019, \u00c6r\u00f8 Municipality have operated between the southern Danish ports of Fynshav and S\u00f8by, on the island of \u00c6r\u00f8. The e-ferry is capable of carrying 30 vehicles and 200 passengers and is powered by a battery \"with an unprecedented capacity\" of . The vessel can sail up to between charges \u2013 seven times further than previously possible for an e-ferry. It will now need to prove it can provide up to seven return trips per day. The European Union, which supported the project, aims to roll out 100 or more of these ferries by 2030.\nA special feature is the Danish Udbyh\u00f8j cable ferry in Randers Fjord which has a land-based power supply by means of a retractable submarine cable.\nAccidents.\nThe following notable maritime disasters involved ferries:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was met with overwhelming dislike from both audiences and critics, and has been recognized as one of the most hated characters in \"Star Wars\" and film history in general, with some commentators arguing that the character was based on stereotypes of black people, especially Jamaicans. The hate affected Best personally, who rejected the idea that the character was based on racist stereotypes.\nIn 2010, Adult Swim released \"\" which included a sketch where Jar Jar, voiced by Ahmed Best himself, revealed that he was a Sith Lord throughout the six films, and had manipulated Palpatine himself. Five years later, in 2015, a Reddit user posted a fan theory that Jar Jar was originally going to be revealed as a manipulative villain, but this plot point was removed due to the character's unpopularity. The theory gained popularity on the internet, and was even encouraged by Best, who implied that it could have been partially true.\nThe character's reception has changed as he has been championed by fans who had seen the prequels at the time of their release as children. Best cited the audience reaching adulthood as well as their perspective as some of the reasons for the character's reassessment, as well as the newfound appreciation for the prequel trilogy. He has also been defended by members of the prequels' production team.\nConception.\nGeorge Lucas was inspired to develop Jar Jar based on the Disney character Goofy. Singer Michael Jackson wanted to play the role, but wished to portray the character using prosthetics while Lucas wanted him to be all CGI. Ahmed Best was cast based on his work in the production of \"Stomp\", as Lucas wanted someone athletic for the role. During his audition he performed several martial arts moves and flips, which according to Best was a contrast to how Lucas pictured the character, more in line with comedic silent actors such as Buster Keaton. After Lucas walked out of the audition, Best felt he had failed it. Terryl Whitlatch created the final designs for the \"cowardly and insecure\" character.\nBest wore a prosthetic costume to portray Jar Jar, which cost about $100,000 and served as a reference for the actors to interact with, animators to base the performance on, and digital artists to match the lighting. He was the first computer-generated supporting character in a live-action film, although in a small number of shots (such as those only showing the character's hands or feet), the costume was not replaced with CGI.\nAppearances.\nFilms.\nJar Jar appears in only the films of the prequel trilogy.\n\"The Phantom Menace\".\nJar Jar Binks first appears in \"\" as a bumbling, foolish Gungan from the planet Naboo who is banished by his tribe as punishment for his clumsiness. He is nearly killed by a Trade Federation transport, only to be saved at the last minute by Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). Qui-Gon and his padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), persuade Jar Jar's tribe to release him to their custody as a guide. He later goes with the Jedi and Padm\u00e9 Amidala (Natalie Portman) to the planet Tatooine, where he meets and befriends nine-year-old slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd).\nJar Jar later appears in the film's climactic battle scene, where he leads his fellow Gungans, as a general in the Gungan army, in defeating the Trade Federation. After the battle, he appears at the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn and in the ending parade with his fellow Gungans.\n\"Attack of the Clones\".\nJar Jar's role in \"\" is much smaller, but his actions are significant. Ten years after helping save his planet, he is a delegate to the Galactic Senate and, as such, plays a role in bringing two of his old friends, Obi-Wan and Anakin (Hayden Christensen), back to Coruscant, where he greets them with enthusiasm. Later, on behalf of Naboo, he gives a speech to the assembled Senate in favor of granting Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) vast emergency powers.\n\"Revenge of the Sith\".\nJar Jar appears in only a few scenes in \"\", and he has no dialogue (besides a brief \"'scuse me\" at one point). He was originally given some dialogue in the beginning, but this was cut. Another cut scene would have shown Palpatine mocking Jar Jar for putting him in power before crowning himself emperor. He is most prominently featured in Padm\u00e9 Amidala's funeral procession at the end of the film, marching sadly behind her coffin alongside Boss Nass.\n\"The Clone Wars\" television series.\nJar Jar Binks is a supporting character in the animated series \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\", once again voiced by Best, although Phil LaMarr voiced the character in three season one episodes under the pseudonym BJ Hughes. In this series, he is a Senate representative who sometimes accompanies the main characters\u2014Anakin, Obi-Wan, Padm\u00e9, and Anakin's padawan Ahsoka Tano\u2014on their adventures. He and Jedi Master Mace Windu are the two main characters of the two-part episode \"The Disappeared\" in which they had to search for missing elders and rescue a queen, who was Jar Jar's past love interest.\nLiterature.\n\"Aftermath: Empire's End\".\nChuck Wendig's 2017 novel \"\", set after the events of \"Return of the Jedi\", finds Jar Jar as a street performer who entertains refugee children but is loathed by adults who blame him for his part in the rise of the Empire. Chris Taylor of Mashable wrote that the situation reflects real life in that adults disliked Jar Jar in the prequel films, but children were entertained by him.\nIn an interview, director J. J. Abrams suggested that Jar Jar's death might be referenced in \"\", but this did not happen.\n\"Legends\".\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film \"Star Wars\" were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.\nIn the game \"\", Jar Jar is shown to have been frozen in carbonite by an Imperial officer and kept in his trophy room.\nVideo games.\nJar Jar appears as a playable character in the \"Lego Star Wars\" video games, and appears as an Angry Bird with a hook move called \"Jar Jar Wings\" in \"Angry Birds Star Wars II\".\nOther appearances.\nAhmed Best was signed on to portray Binks in the show \"Star Wars Detours\".\nReception.\nInitial response.\nEven before the release of \"The Phantom Menace\", Jar Jar Binks became the subject of significant media and popular attention. After the film's release, Binks became symbolic of what many reviewers such as Brent Staples (\"The New York Times\"), David Edelstein (\"Slate\"), and Eric Harrison (\"Los Angeles Times\") considered to be creative flaws of the film. The character was widely rejected and often ridiculed by people who felt that Jar Jar was included solely to appeal to children (a criticism first leveled at the Ewoks in \"Return of the Jedi\"). Bruce Handy of \"Vanity Fair\" wrote that \"Jar Jar has come to symbolize what many fans see as the faults of the prequel trilogy: characters no one much cares about; a sense of humor geared toward the youngest conceivable audience members; an over-reliance on computer graphics; and story lines devoted to the kinds of convoluted political machinations which wouldn't have been out of place in adaptations of \"I, Claudius\" or \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\", but which fit less snugly in films with characters like Jar Jar Binks.\" One fan, Mike J. Nichols, created and distributed, free of charge, a modified version of the film, entitled \"The Phantom Edit\", which cut out several scenes featuring what Nichols dubbed 'Jar Jar antics.' The character was also lampooned on an episode of the television show \"South Park\" entitled \"Jakovasaurs\", in \"The Fairly OddParents\" (Episode: \"Abra-Catastrophe!\"), \"The Simpsons\" (Episode: \"Co-Dependents' Day\"), as well as the parody of \"Robot Chicken\", in which Best reprised the role in voice-over form.\nIn response to the criticism, \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas stated that he feels there is a section of the fanbase upset that \"the movies are for children but they don't want to admit that\u00a0... There is a small group of fans that do not like comic sidekicks. They want the films to be tough like \"The Terminator\", and they get very upset and opinionated about anything that has anything to do with being childlike.\"\nIn 2018, Best said that the widespread criticism of his character negatively impacted his career and led him to consider suicide. After these comments were reported by \"The Guardian\", fans expressed their support for Best on social media, with many, including Frank Oz (the actor portraying Yoda), denouncing the vitriol Best experienced. Oz wrote, \"I LOVED Jar Jar Binks. I know I'll get raked over the coals for saying that but I just will never understand the harshness of people's dislike of him. I do character work. He is a GREAT character!\"\nAllegations of racial caricature.\nIn an article for \"The Wall Street Journal\", film critic Joe Morgenstern described the character as a \"Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit on platform hoofs, crossed annoyingly with Butterfly McQueen.\" Legal scholar Patricia J. Williams argued that many aspects of Jar Jar Binks' characterization were reminiscent of the blackface archetypes in minstrel shows, while academic Paul J. Ford suggested the character is a \"laid-back clown character\" which utilized stereotypes of Afro-Caribbean people. Lucasfilm denied any racist intention in the character's creation. George Lucas further stated that \"those criticisms are made by people who've obviously never met a Jamaican\u00a0... How in the world could you take an orange amphibian and say that he's a Jamaican?\". Ahmed Best also rejected such claims, stating that \"Jar Jar has nothing to do with the Caribbean\".\nSpeculations of villainy.\nOn December 19, 2010, Adult Swim released ', an animated comedy special parody of \"Star Wars\". In the first sketch, titled \"The Emperor's Back\", Emperor Palpatine feels remorse for his actions and calls Jar Jar, voiced by Ahmed Best himself, on the telephone, apologizing to him for manipulating him into granting Palpatine emergency powers in the senate during '. Jar Jar pretends to accept this apology, feigning innocence, but after he hangs up he reveals that he was in fact a Sith Lord, named Darth Jar Jar, who only pretended to be manipulated by Palpatine and actually manipulated Palpatine himself. This sketch was in reference to a popular in-joke among \"Star Wars\" fans. Five years later, in late October 2015, a Reddit user by the name of \"Lumpawarroo\" (the name of Chewbacca's son) published a detailed theory speculating that Jar Jar was originally written as a major antagonist of the series, a manipulative, prominent collaborator of Palpatine, before being written off from his major villain's role due to the character's negative reception. This theory was related to an earlier interview with actor Ahmed Best in /r/IAmA, where he claimed that Jar Jar had been displaced from the story's main focus due to the backlash, implying at the same time that the hate received by the character was not entirely unintentional.\nThe post quickly became popular and received significant media coverage internationally by independent bloggers and major news outlets like \"The Guardian\", \"The Washington Post\", and \"The New York Times\", which included analysis of his actions in \"The Phantom Menace\" and gave him the nickname of \"Darth Jar Jar\". Journalist Andrew Street from \"The Guardian\" called it a \"classic twist\", comparing it to Yoda's role in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", while Matt Hickey from \"Forbes\" went to the extent of contacting George Lucas about the question, but received no answer.\nIn response to the speculations, Best tweeted, \"I will say this, it feels really good when the hidden meaning behind the work is seen. No matter how long it takes,\" apparently confirming the theory. Some months later, he expanded upon his tweet in a YouTube interview, stating, \"there is a lot about [the theory] that is true, there are some things about it that are not true\u00a0... Could Jar Jar have evolved into that? I think the answer is yes. Because of the backlash, and rightfully so, Lucasfilm backed off of Jar Jar a lot, but a lot of the influence that I put into the character mirrored a lot of what was already in the \"Star Wars\" universe.\" Best concluded only Lucas could unveil the actual role of Binks, yet he also claimed that a deleted scene from \"Attack of the Clones\" would have still shown Palpatine darkly confiding his plans about the Empire to Jar Jar.\nJ. J. Abrams, who directed two installments of the franchise's sequel trilogy after its buyout by Disney, personally approved of the theory about the villainous Jar Jar. He described Lumpawarroo's argumentation as an \"unbelievably lengthy analysis, in a very seriously thought-out way, as to why it's obviously true he's [evil].\"\nIn 2019, when questioned about it, Best stated again only Lucas could answer, but he confirmed the theorists' idea of Jar Jar's antics being actually a disguised fighting style akin to drunken boxing, revealing that he based his performance on Jackie Chan's role in the 1978 film \"Drunken Master\". He said, \"the Darth Jar Jar theory caught it - caught it. I never thought anybody would see that\".\nThe Darth Jar Jar theory is referenced in the animated miniseries \"\", in which a Jedi relic accidentally rewrites reality and turns Jar Jar (reprised by Best) into a Sith Lord.\nIn 2025, Jar Jar was added to \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" as part of the \"Star Wars\"-themed \"Galactic Battle\" season, where he is depicted as a Sith Lord capable of using Force Lightning.\nCharacter reassessment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI actually felt terrible that Ahmed Best suffered so much. I remember when he came out to [ILM headquarters] Kerner and I met him, showed him around, and I said, \"We're really interested in having your interpretation of this character. You're going to bring a lot to this, the personality is something that we have not experienced that yet. And that's going to be your part in it.\"\nAnd he was this kid in his twenties, who did that beautiful Stomp, that show that he was involved in, which we all got to see. George let us see a special [performance] of that -- yeah, that was during a company meeting. There was a big theater up there in San Rafael, and the company meeting turned out to be a little bit of conversation and then we got to see Stomp. Ahmed was in that thing, and I was just like, \"This is so cool!\" It was just wonderful.\nSo here he was, this kid I think had hoped that this was going to be something that transformed his life in a really great way. Who wouldn't think that? It's an opportunity to work on a \"Star Wars\" movie.\n\u2014Digital model designer Jean Bolte remembers meeting actor Ahmed Best.\nSince the release of \"The Phantom Menace\", cast and crew who have worked on the \"Star Wars\" films and viewers have defended Jar Jar Binks (as well as Ahmed Best).\nGeorge Lucas defended Jar Jar by clarifying that the \"Star Wars\" films were made for 12-year-old children. He has said from the beginning in early interviews for \"A New Hope\" that the series was intended for children. In April 2019, during the annual \"Star Wars\" Celebration event ahead of the 20th anniversary panel for \"The Phantom Menace\", George Lucas named Jar Jar as his favorite \"Star Wars\" character.\nIn an interview with IGN during the premiere of \"\", Yoda's performer Frank Oz stated that Jar Jar Binks is his favorite character: \"I love Jar Jar Binks. I swear to god I do\u00a0... When I saw that script I thought he was a fantastic character and I don't know what the heck happened\u00a0... I thought he was fantastic; he was hysterical. He reminded me of Abbott and Costello.\"\nActor Liam Neeson praised Ahmed Best for his portrayal of Jar Jar: \"I know a lot of fans and critics didn't like it. [Best] received a lot of criticism, to the point where it really hurt his career. And I have to say that when he was making that movie, with Best as Jar Jar Binks and with Ewan McGregor as young Obi-Wan Kenobi, he was probably one of the funniest and most talented guys I've ever worked with. I remember calling\u00a0... my old ex-agent\u00a0... and saying, 'Listen, I think I just worked with the new Eddie Murphy.' And I still believe it.\"\nDuring the 20th anniversary of \"The Phantom Menace\", many members of the prequel production team have defended the character and appreciated the public's acceptance at the \"Star Wars\" Celebration panel. Visual effects supervisor John Knoll reflected: \"Well, I think it's good to see [his newfound popularity], because I think George took a lot of the criticism pretty harshly. It was kind of painful for me to see how cruel people were about it and how personally George took it. I think the movies didn't deserve as much hate as they received. It hurt me to see how much George took those things.\" He also said, \"I thought [the Star Wars Celebration panel] was great, especially the warm reaction there was to Ahmed. I know he took all the vicious comments people had about Jar Jar very hard. That's not his fault, he didn't write that character. He's an actor who did a really good job and worked hard to get it right. Seeing the really warm reaction of the crowd made me feel\u00a0... It was moving.\"\nAnimation director Rob Coleman said that twenty years later he still has younger people coming up to him and telling him that Jar Jar is their favorite character.\nDigital model designer Jean Bolte cited Jar Jar as one of her favorite characters to work with alongside Sebulba and Yoda, saying, \"Going to Star Wars Celebration and seeing and hearing the fans so interested in which one was our contribution\u00a0... It really completely changed my point of view about being privileged to have had anything to do with these films.\"\nIn an interview with Europa Press during the premiere of \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\", a journalist asked actress Felicity Jones who she would like to receive a gift from if she were in the \"Star Wars\" galaxy at Christmas time and she said either Jar Jar or C-3P0.\nFollowing the reassessment of Jar Jar (as well as the reappraisal of the prequel trilogy), C-3PO actor Anthony Daniels reflected in his memoirs that \"the years have been kinder to this, the first Prequel. Many, who were young at the time, still hold it, and Jar Jar Binks as their dearest memory of the Saga.\" \nBest was moved by people's appreciation for Jar Jar: \"It was definitely the kids. I had to start looking at Jar Jar through their eyes, and that's what made me smile again. Now those kids, they are between 20 and 30 years old. They have a different perspective on\u00a0\"The Phantom Menace\". \"The Phantom Menace\", for them, is their \"Star Wars\". \"[Episodes] IV\", \"V\" and \"VI\", that's their parents' \"Star Wars\", and \"VII\", \"VIII\" and \"IX\", that's their children's \"Star Wars\". But the prequels, that's theirs, and they defend the prequels. So I see the same thing. I see the resurgence of \"The Phantom Menace\".\" He then talked about his experience of going to \"Star Wars\" Celebration: \"To be very honest, I was very afraid to go to Celebration. Every time I'm in a\u00a0\"Star Wars\"\u00a0setting, I spend most of my time defending our work and defending Jar Jar. And I just don't want to do that anymore. So I was very reluctant to come to Celebration because of that, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't the case at all. I just felt nothing but love and respect and admiration for the work we did. I couldn't have been more proud and I couldn't have been happier. I wish George was there because I think we're at a time right now where we have to stand in that work. We have to say, \"We did it,\" and step into that in a very proud way, because it stands the test of time.\"\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrinted sources"}

He is a supporting character portrayed by Denis Lawson in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, and voiced by David Ankrum in \"Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope\" (1977) and \"Rogue One\" (2016). He is also featured in the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe, most notably as the lead character in most of the ' novels. Antilles has also appeared in the sequel trilogy film ' (2019), with Lawson reprising his role; in the 2014 animated series \"Star Wars Rebels\", voiced by Nathan Kress; and in the 2023 second volume of \"\", voiced again by Lawson.\nBefore defecting to the Rebel Alliance, Antilles was an Imperial cadet (callsign: TIE SS25) of the Skystrike Academy. Antilles founded Rogue Squadron with his friend Luke Skywalker. His superior piloting skills, in-depth knowledge of Imperial military doctrine, and tactical leadership quickly propelled him through the ranks to become Marshal of the Alliance Starfighter Corps. Antilles is notable for having participated in more starfighter battles ending with decisive Alliance victories than any other character: he led the allied assault during the Battle of Exegol and Jakku; supported Project Starhawk; piloted a snowspeeder in the defense of Echo Base on Hoth; and is the only Rebel starfighter pilot to have survived both attack runs on the Death Stars at the battles of Yavin and Endor.\nDepiction.\nWedge Antilles was first seen in the 1977 film \"A New Hope\" in the Rebels' Death Star attack briefing. In this scene he was portrayed by Colin Higgins and voiced by David Ankrum, who dubbed the character throughout the film. For the remaining scenes filmed in the X-wing cockpit, the character was played by Denis Lawson. Higgins was originally cast in the role of Antilles but reportedly had difficulty remembering his lines, and was consequently replaced by Lawson for subsequent scenes, but Higgins' scene remained in the final cut of the film. The discrepancy became a popular subject in \"Star Wars\" fandom, and Higgins acquired the nickname \"Fake Wedge\".\nLawson reprised the role of Antilles in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Return of the Jedi\" and \"The Rise of Skywalker\". Lawson used his own voice in these films, masking his natural Scottish accent with an imitation of an American accent. Ankrum was also the voice of Antilles in \"Rogue One.\" Coincidentally, Denis Lawson is the maternal uncle of Ewan McGregor, who made his first appearance in the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy.\nAppearances.\nFilms.\nWedge Antilles appears towards the end of \"Star Wars\" as \"Red Two\", an X-wing pilot and a member of Red Squadron. His considerable dogfighting prowess is shown during the Battle of Yavin when he saves Luke Skywalker from being shot down by a TIE fighter pilot that he could not shake off, picking off the hostile with a point blank, high deflection angle shot. Along with Skywalker and Biggs Darklighter, Antilles is one of only three X-wing pilots to survive until the final attack runs along the Death Star's trench. However, his X-wing is damaged, and he is forced to disengage before the Death Star is destroyed. He and Luke are the only two X-wing pilots to survive the battle, along with a Y-wing and the \"Millennium Falcon\".\nAntilles appears in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as a member of the newly formed Rogue Squadron. He flies a snowspeeder under the callsign \"Rogue Three\" against the Empire's AT-AT ground assault with Wes Janson as his harpoon gunner. Their snowspeeder inflicts the first casualty against the AT-AT attack group by firing a harpoon trailing a tow cable into one of the walker's legs and circling the walker several times, causing it to trip and fall and allowing Rebel forces to destroy the walker. After the battle, Antilles is seen and heard wishing Luke a safe trip.\nAntilles appears towards the end of \"Return of the Jedi\" as the leader of Red Squadron in the Battle of Endor. Along with Lando Calrissian, who pilots the \"Millennium Falcon\" with Nien Nunb, he leads the fighter attack on the second Death Star. His dogfighting prowess is shown again in this battle, as Antilles personally shoots down a number of Imperial TIE fighters, and appears to easily navigate the narrow and treacherous flight spaces inside the Death Star that lead to its core. When he and Calrissian reach the Death Star's core, Antilles destroys the power regulator on the core's north tower, while Calrissian destroys the core itself. He later appears at the victory celebration at the Ewok village on Endor, apparently the only surviving member of his fleet.\nAntilles appears, once again played by Denis Lawson, in the final installment of the \"Star Wars\" sequel trilogy, '. He is seen manning a gun turret on the \"Millennium Falcon\" during the battle between the Resistance and the Sith Eternal, shortly after the death of his stepson Snap. Lawson had previously been asked to appear as Wedge Antilles in ', in the narrative role the character Poe Dameron was ultimately created for, but declined due to scheduling conflicts.\nAntilles is not seen on screen in the spinoff film \"Rogue One\", but his voice is briefly heard over the intercom in the Rebel base on Yavin 4. He was intentionally omitted from the film's climactic battle in order to avoid a continuity error with the first \"Star Wars\" film, which takes place immediately after \"Rogue One\". In that film, he utters the phrase \"Look at the size of that thing!\" which would have made less sense if he had already seen the Death Star at Scarif.\nTelevision.\nIn the television series \"Star Wars Rebels\", Wedge Antilles is voiced by Nathan Kress. He first appeared in the episode \"The Antilles Extraction\", the fourth episode of the third season. The episode establishes Antilles's canon backstory as an Imperial TIE fighter pilot who with the help of Sabine Wren defected from the Empire, and joined the Rebel Alliance. Antilles later appeared in the episode \"Double Agent Droid,\" the nineteenth episode of the third season, and again in both parts of the third-season finale \"Zero Hour\", the twenty-first and twenty-second episodes, respectively. Antilles' last appearance in \"Rebels\" was in the first part of \"In the Name of the Rebellion\", the third episode of the fourth season.\nNovels.\nWedge Antilles is featured in the \"Star Wars: Aftermath\" trilogy by Chuck Wendig, consisting of the novels \"\" (2015), \"Life Debt\" (2016), and \"Empire's End\" (2017). In this series, Antilles establishes a new unit called Phantom Squadron, which sees action on the planets Kashyyyk and Jakku. Following the Battle of Jakku, which ends the Galactic Civil War, Antilles relocates to Hosnian Prime, where he serves as a flight instructor.\nAntilles makes a brief appearance in Claudia Gray's 2015 novel \", in which he recruits Thane Kyrell, one of the novel's protagonists, into the Rebel Alliance.\nAntilles later moves to the planet Akiva where he retires with Norra Wexley. The two appear in the 2019 novel \" where they join a Resistance mission to save some political prisoners on Corellia. He is the stepfather of Resistance fighter pilot Snap Wexley, played in the sequel trilogy by Greg Grunberg.\n\"Legends\".\nIn April 2014, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film \"Star Wars\" were rebranded by Lucasfilm as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise.\nWedge Antilles appears in the 1983 Marvel \"Star Wars\" comic \"Hoth Stuff!\", in which it is revealed that he went missing during the Battle of Hoth. Aboard his ship, Luke and Leia listen to his log tape recounting how he survived the Imperial invasion by hiding with Janson in the AT-AT Luke took down. They were later prevented from contacting the Rebellion by orbiting TIE fighters and had to face wampas and other dangers. Janson was eventually killed by scavengers; Antilles then stole one of their ships to escape the planet and contact the Rebellion. He suddenly appears outside one of the windows, after working on the ship from space. Leia also states that he and Luke grew up together on Tatooine, which Antilles seems to confirm in his log by mentioning a girlfriend he had there.\n\"Star Wars Legends\" literature explains that Antilles' parents were killed when their starship-refueling depot exploded. He piloted a freighter before joining the Rebel Alliance as a starfighter pilot.\nAntilles is the lead character in most of the ' novels by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston, set in the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe. Several Dark Horse Comics series focus on Antilles and Rogue Squadron, and the character also appears in other expanded universe works including \"The New Jedi Order\" and \"Legacy of the Force\" novels. Antilles is one of two main player characters in the ' video game series (Luke Skywalker is the other), and Antilles appears as a minor character in ', helping the player during one mission. He is also a playable character in '.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Introduced in the original \"Star Wars\" film in 1977, Leia is a princess of the planet Alderaan, a member of the Imperial Senate, and an agent of the Rebel Alliance. She thwarts the Sith Lord Darth Vader and helps bring about the destruction of the Empire's superweapon, the Death Star. In \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), Leia commands a Rebel base and evades Vader as she falls in love with the smuggler Han Solo. In \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), she helps to rescue Han from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and is revealed to be Vader's daughter and the twin sister of Luke Skywalker. Leia is portrayed by Carrie Fisher in the original film trilogy and the sequel trilogy.\nThe 2005 prequel film \"\" reveals that Leia's mother is Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala of Naboo, who dies after childbirth. Her father is Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi who falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader. After her mother's death, Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and his wife, Queen Breha. In the sequel trilogy, Leia is a founder and General of the Resistance, which fights against the First Order. She and Han have a son named Ben Solo, who turned to the dark side and became the First Order warlord Kylo Ren. In \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (2019), it is revealed that Leia was trained as a Jedi by Luke sometime after the events of \"Return of the Jedi\". Leia is now the mentor of Rey, the last remaining Jedi. Leia dies towards the end of the film but returns as a Force spirit alongside Luke.\nOne of the more popular \"Star Wars\" characters, Leia has been called a 1980s icon, a feminist hero and model for other adventure heroines. She has appeared in many derivative works and merchandising, including the now-noncanonical \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe, and has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films. Her \"cinnamon bun\" hairstyle from \"Star Wars\" (1977) and metal bikini from \"Return of the Jedi\" have become cultural icons. Fisher was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress for \"Star Wars\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". She also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress for ' and ', the latter being a posthumous nomination.\nCreation and casting.\nLeia was created by \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas, who in 1999 explained his early development of the main characters:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first [version] talked about a princess and an old general. The second version involved a father, his son, and his daughter; the daughter was the heroine of the film. Now the daughter has become Luke, Mark Hamill's character. There was also the story of two brothers where I transformed one of them into a sister. The older brother was imprisoned, and the young sister had to rescue him and bring him back to their dad.\nThe character Princess Leia went through various changes as George Lucas wrote and refined the \"Star Wars\" screenplay. In one early draft, she is the spoiled teenage daughter of King Kayos and Queen Breha of Aquilae. In a later version, she is Luke's cousin and the daughter of Owen Lars and his wife Beru. A subsequent story synopsis establishes her as Leia Antilles, the child of Bail Antilles from the peaceful world of Organa Major. In the fourth draft, she is Leia Organa of Alderaan, which is how she appears in the finished film.\nCarrie Fisher was 19 when she was cast as Princess Leia. She was cast over Karen Allen, Glenn Close, Farrah Fawcett, Anjelica Huston, Amy Irving, Jessica Lange, Terri Nunn, Linda Purl, Meryl Streep and Cindy Williams. \nJodie Foster was offered the role and was almost cast, but ultimately had to turn it down as she was under a contract with Disney, and was obliged to star in the adventure film \"Candleshoe\" (1977), simultaneously while the first movie was in production.\nIn his early story development for \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Lucas intended for Luke to have a twin sister\u2014not Leia\u2014who would be the focus of another episode. Following the production of \"Empire\", Lucas was burnt out and decided not to make his planned sequel trilogy. Needing to explain the identity of the other potential Jedi mentioned by Yoda, Lucas decided that Leia would be revealed as Luke's twin.\nIn the second draft of the \"Return of the Jedi\" screenplay, Obi-Wan tells Luke he has a twin sister. She and their mother were \"sent to the protection of friends in a distant system. The mother died shortly thereafter, and Luke's sister was adopted by Ben's friends, the governor of Alderaan and his wife.\" Fisher explained in 1983: \"Leia's real father left her mother when she was pregnant, so her mother married this King Organa. I was adopted and grew up set apart from other people because I was a princess.\"\nCharacterization.\nAnthony Breznican of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described Leia as a diplomat, spy, warrior, and undercover agent. Fisher told \"Rolling Stone\" in 1983:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are a lot of people who don't like my character in these movies; they think I'm some kind of space bitch. She has no friends, no family; her planet was blown up in seconds ... so all she has is a cause. From the first film [\"Star Wars\"], she was just a soldier, front line and center. The only way they knew to make the character strong was to make her angry. In \"Return of the Jedi\", she gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more affectionate.\nShe said in 2014:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I would rather have played Han Solo. When I first read the script I thought that's the part to be, always wry and sardonic. He's always that. I feel like a lot of the time Leia's either worried or pissed or, thank God, sort of snarky. But I'm much more worried and pissed than Han Solo ever was, and those aren't fun things to play ... I had a lot of fun killing Jabba the Hutt. They asked me on the day if I wanted to have a stunt double kill Jabba. No! That's the best time I ever had as an actor. And the only reason to go into acting is if you can kill a giant monster.\nAppearances.\nOriginal trilogy.\n\"Star Wars\".\nIntroduced in \"Star Wars\" (1977), Princess Leia of Alderaan is a member of the Imperial Senate and a leader in the Rebel Alliance. She is captured when Darth Vader boards her ship, demanding that she reveal the location of stolen architectural plans for the Death Star, the Galactic Empire's battle station. Before her interrogation, Leia hid the plans inside the droid R2-D2, and sent him to find one of the last remaining Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Vader takes Leia to the Death Star and tortures her, but she offers him no information. The Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin threatens to destroy Alderaan unless she reveals the location of the Rebel base. She provides the location of an abandoned headquarters on Dantooine, but Tarkin obliterates Alderaan anyway. Leia is rescued by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Chewbacca. They escape aboard Han's ship, the \"Millennium Falcon\". After analyzing the Death Star schematics, the Rebels find a small weakness in the battle station, which allows Luke to destroy it with torpedoes launched from his X-wing. After the victory, Leia honors Luke, Han and Chewbacca for their heroism.In 2015, Alyssa Rosenberg of \"The Washington Post\" praised Leia's courage and resiliency while experiencing imprisonment, torture, and the destruction of her home planet. Rosenberg also notes that while Han is almost immediately attracted to Leia, they end up in conflict because she insists on asserting command and he automatically resists, even as she proves herself to be worthy of it.\nFisher told \"Rolling Stone\" in 1980 that in the original script, when Luke and Han arrive to rescue Leia, she is unconscious, her eyes are yellow and she is hanging upside down, imagery which alludes to the 1973 horror film \"The Exorcist\". Fisher explained that the scene was changed because Chewbacca would have had to carry Leia for an extended period of time.\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\".\nIn \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), Leia is commanding the Rebel base on Hoth. As Han prepares to leave the base to pay off Jabba, he tries to make Leia admit that she has romantic feelings for him. When Imperial forces arrive and assault the base, Leia leads an evacuation. She then flees with Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO in the \"Falcon\". While hiding in an asteroid field, Leia and Han share a kiss. With the ship needing repairs, Han seeks out his old friend Lando Calrissian in Cloud City. Lando welcomes the group graciously, but has betrayed them to the Empire. He turns them over to Vader, who hopes to use them as bait to capture Luke. Leia confesses her love for Han as he is frozen in carbonite and handed over to the bounty hunter Boba Fett. As Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca escape from Cloud City, Leia senses that Luke is in trouble, and she orders Chewbacca to turn the ship around and rescue him. He was wounded during a lightsaber duel with Vader, and used the Force to contact Leia.\nCommenting on Han's attempt to pry a confession of affection out Leia, Rosenberg asserts that \"Han's not wrong that if Leia doesn't figure out that she's a person with needs, she's going to burn out ... In a way, it's an early confession of love: Han's anxious about the bounty hunters who are still pursuing him ... But he would stay and give his love and support to Leia if she could just acknowledge that she needs him.\"\n\"Return of the Jedi\".\nIn \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), Leia infiltrates Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine disguised as the Ubese bounty hunter Boushh. She frees Han from the carbonite, but they are both recaptured by Jabba, who chains Leia and outfits her in a metal bikini. After Luke arrives and kills Jabba's rancor, the crime lord sentences Luke, Han and Chewbacca to be fed to a Sarlacc, a deadly ground-dwelling beast. The group overpowers their captors, and Leia strangles Jabba to death with her chain. The companions then escape the planet and return to the Rebel base. Later, they travel to the forest moon of Endor to disable a shield protecting the second Death Star. There, Luke reveals to Leia that he is her twin brother and that Vader is their father. After joining forces with a tribe of Ewoks, the Rebels manage to destroy the Death Star and defeat the Empire.\nFollowing the release of \"Return of the Jedi,\" Fisher commented on the way Leia is depicted: \"[She] gets to be more feminine, more supportive, more affectionate. But let's not forget that these movies are basically boys' fantasies. So the other way they made her more female in this one was to have her take off her clothes.\"\n\"Revenge of the Sith\".\nIn the prequel film \"Revenge of the Sith\" (2005), Anakin Skywalker's wife Padm\u00e9 Amidala is pregnant with twins near the end of the Clone Wars. After Anakin turns to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader, Padm\u00e9 gives birth to Luke and Leia on Polis Massa and then dies. Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and his wife, Queen Breha.\nSequel trilogy.\n\"The Force Awakens\".\nLeia returns in \"\" (2015), which takes place thirty years after the events of \"Return of the Jedi\". She is the leader of the Resistance, an organization she formed to fight the First Order. She is also trying to find her brother Luke, who disappeared years earlier. After a battle on the planet Takodana, she reunites with Han. They discuss their son, Ben Solo, who left Jedi training and fell to the dark side of the Force, becoming the First Order warlord Kylo Ren. Leia believes Ren can be brought back from the dark side, and urges Han to bring him home. When Han encounters Ren on Starkiller Base, he asks him to abandon the First Order. Ren refuses and instead kills his father. Leia senses Han's death through the Force, and later shares a moment of grief with the scavenger Rey, who viewed Han as a father figure.\nAlthough Leia appears as a Jedi in various \"Star Wars\" \"Legends\" works, she is not depicted that way in \"The Force Awakens\". The film's director, J.J. Abrams, explained that Leia's decision to lead the Resistance instead of training as a Jedi was \"simply a choice that she made\". Nevertheless, he affirmed that Leia's strength with the Force is an intrinsic part of her character. Asked to describe Leia in the film, Fisher said she is under \"a lot of pressure\" and is likely feeling \"somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed.\" Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.\n\"The Last Jedi\".\nFisher returns as Leia in \"The Last Jedi\", the 2017 sequel to \"The Force Awakens.\" When Leia's ship is attacked by the First Order, she is expelled into space, but uses the Force to pull herself back onboard. After recovering, she shoots and stuns the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, who mutinied against Vice Admiral Holdo. From his self-imposed exile on Ahch-To, Luke uses the Force to project himself to the Resistance stronghold on Crait. He reunites with Leia and apologizes for Ben's fall to the dark side. Leia says that her son is gone, but Luke assures her that nobody is ever truly gone. While Luke distracts Ren and his troops, Leia and the remaining Resistance forces escape in the \"Falcon\". The filming of Fisher's scenes was completed shortly before her death on December 27, 2016.\n\"The Rise of Skywalker\".\nFollowing Fisher's death, \"Variety\" reported that she was slated to appear in \"\" (2019). However, Lucasfilm stated that it was not planning to create a digital version of Fisher for the film. Several months later, Fisher's family granted Lucasfilm the right to use previously-filmed footage of her in the film; it was later announced that Fisher would appear using unseen footage from \"The Force Awakens\". Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd, who portrays Lieutenant Connix in all three sequel trilogy films, stepped in as Leia for a brief flashback scene. Her face was digitally replaced by Fisher's, using imagery from \"Return of the Jedi\".\nIn the film, Leia continues to lead the Resistance while guiding Rey in her Jedi training; a flashback presented later reveals that Leia abandoned her own Jedi instruction with Luke after seeing a vision of her son's death. While Rey and Ren duel on Kef Bir, Leia uses all of her remaining strength to reach out to Ren through the Force. Rey impales him while he is distracted, then heals his wound as Leia dies. During the climactic battle on Exegol, a transformed Ben Solo utilizes the remainder of his life force to revive a comatose Rey, then vanishes into the Force at the same time as his mother. Rey travels to the Lars homestead on Tatooine and buries the lightsabers that had belonged to Leia and Luke. As the Force spirits of her two mentors look on, Rey tells a passerby that her name is \"Rey Skywalker.\"\n\"Rogue One\".\nLeia makes a brief appearance in the final scene of the 2016 film \"Rogue One\". She receives the stolen plans for the Death Star as a lead-up to the beginning of \"Star Wars\". Since \"Rogue One\" takes place just prior to the original trilogy, a young Leia was required. To create this effect, a computer-generated image of a young Carrie Fisher was superimposed over the face of the actress Ingvild Deila. Archival audio of Fisher was used to voice the character.\nSeries.\nA teenage Princess Leia, voiced by Julie Dolan, appears in a 2016 episode of the animated series \"Star Wars Rebels\", which is set between \"Revenge of the Sith\" and \"Star Wars\". In the episode, Leia is sent on a secret mission for the Rebel Alliance. Dave Filoni, the executive producer of \"Rebels\", said the intention was to show Leia developing her leadership abilities. He added that in the series, Leia is \"part of the Empire. She doesn't believe in the Empire, but she is acting the part, almost a double agent.\" Leia also appears in the web series \"Forces of Destiny\" (2017\u20132018) voiced by Shelby Young, and in \"Star Wars Resistance\", voiced by Rachel Butera and Carolyn Hennesy.\nLeia appears as a ten-year-old child in the 2022 live-action series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\", portrayed by Vivien Lyra Blair. Of Blair's casting, series writer Joby Harold said the show wanted an actor who would embody a young Carrie Fisher, and Eric Deggans of NPR later wrote that Blair \"practically channels Carrie Fisher's subversive, wisecracking spirit\".\nNovels.\nLeia makes her first literary appearance in \"\", the novelization of the original 1977 film \"Star Wars\", which was released six months before the film in November 1976. Credited to Lucas but ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster, the novel was based on Lucas' screenplay. Leia later appeared in the novelizations \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) by Donald F. Glut and \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983) by James Kahn. She is also a point-of-view character in the of \"The Force Awakens\" by Foster.\nFoster's 1978 novel \"Splinter of the Mind's Eye\" was commissioned by Lucas as the basis for a potential low-budget sequel to \"Star Wars\" should the film prove unsuccessful.

In 2008, Leia was selected by \"Empire\" magazine as the 89th greatest film character of all time, and in 2010 UGO Networks listed Leia as one of the best heroes of all time.\nThe character has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films, and is celebrated in cosplay. In 2013, cartoonist Jeffrey Brown published the bestselling \"Star Wars: Vader's Little Princess\", a comic strip-style book featuring Darth Vader and a young Leia in humorous father-daughter situations.\nLeia has also been used in a wide range of \"Star Wars\" merchandise, including statuettes, action figures and other toys, household items and clothing, office supplies, food products, and bubble bath and shampoo in Leia-shaped bottles with her head as the cap. In her one-woman show \"Wishful Drinking\", Fisher called the Princess Leia Pez dispenser one of the \"merchandising horrors\" of the series. In a 2011 interview, Fisher said:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I signed away my likeness for free. In those days, there was no such thing as a \"likeness\" ... There was no merchandising tied to movies. No one could have known the extent of the franchise. Not that I don't think I'm cute or anything, but when I looked in the mirror, I didn't think I was signing away anything of value. Lately I feel like I'm Minnie Mouse\u2014the identity of Princess Leia so eclipses any other identity that I've ever had.\nAfter the 2012 acquisition of LucasFilm by the Walt Disney Company, the Disney Store stated in May 2014 that the company had \"no plans for Leia products\". After public criticism, Disney told \"Time\" in June 2014 that it would be releasing several Leia products. Funko has since produced several versions of Leia (at least one for each film) in their POP! line of 4.5-inch vinyl figures in the Japanese super deformed style. In 2016, Hasbro released an action figure of Leia as she appears in the \"Star Wars Rebels\" animated series.\n\"Cinnamon buns\" hairstyle.\nLeia's unique hairdo in \"Star Wars\"\u2014arranged in two large buns, one on each side of her head\u2014has come to be known as the \"doughnut\" or \"cinnamon buns\" hairstyle, and is iconic of the character and series. When asked in a 2002 interview about the origins of Leia's hairstyle, Lucas said he was aiming for \"a kind of Southwestern Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look\" from \"turn-of-the-century Mexico.\" An exhibit at the Denver Art Museum credited a particular revolutionary\u2014later identified as Clara de la Rocha\u2014as an inspiration for the coiffure. The museum stated that Leia's hair arrangement was also influenced by a hairstyle worn by indigenous Hopi women of North America. \"Empire\" suggested that Leia's hairdo was based on that of Queen Fria, a character from the 1930s \"Flash Gordon\" comic serial. Lucas had originally wanted to film an adaptation of \"Flash Gordon\", but unable to obtain the rights, he began developing an original project which would become \"Star Wars\".\nA February 1978 cover story for the British teen magazine \"Jackie\" included step-by-step instructions on how to replicate Leia's hair buns. In the 1978 short film parody \"Hardware Wars\", Princess Anne-Droid has actual cinnamon buns on the side of her head. Miss Piggy of \"The Muppet Show\" copied the hairdo in a \"Star Wars\"-themed episode of the series in February 1980. In the 1987 Mel Brooks comedy film \"Spaceballs\", Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) appears to have the hairstyle, which is soon revealed to in fact be a large pair of headphones. In the parody film \"Thumb Wars\", the role of Leia was filled by a character named Princess Bunhead, who has two cinnamon rolls for hair. In 2015, Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd's character in the horror-comedy TV series \"Scream Queens\", a rich and disaffected sorority girl known as Chanel No. 3, wears earmuffs in every scene as an homage to Fisher's iconic Leia hairstyle. Lourd also has a cameo in \"The Force Awakens\" (2015) in which she wears Leia's distinctive hair buns.\nFeminist analysis.\nLeia has been the subject of feminist analysis. David Bushman, television curator at the Paley Center for Media, said in 2012, \"From the male perspective ... Princess Leia was a very creditable character for her time\u2014not perfect, but certainly defiant, assertive, and strong.\" Alyssa Rosenberg of \"The Washington Post\" wrote in 2015, \"Leia wasn't just the first great heroine of science fiction and fantasy to capture my imagination. She was one of the first characters I encountered whose power came from her political conviction and acumen.\" In her 2007 article \"Feminism and the Force: Empowerment and Disillusionment in a Galaxy Far, Far Away\", Diana Dominguez cited Leia as a welcome change from the previous portrayals of women in film and TV. She wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Here was a woman who could play like and with the boys, but who didn't have to become one of the boys and who could, if and when she wanted to, show she liked the boys, a woman who is outspoken, unashamed, and, most importantly, unpunished for being so. She isn't a flirty sex-pot, tossing her hair around seductively to distract the enemy ... She doesn't play the role of \"Maternal caretaker\", although she does display caring and compassion, or \"the sweet innocent damsel\" who stands passively by while the men do all the work, but does step aside to let them do what they're good at when it is wise to do so ... Leia is a hero without losing her gendered status; she does not have to play the cute, helpless sex kitten or become sexless and androgynous to get what she wants. She can be strong, sassy, outspoken, bossy, and bitchy, and still be respected and seen as feminine.\nRosenberg writes that, though at first Luke is an apolitical innocent in search of adventure and Han is a detached opportunist in search of money, both are \"influenced by Leia's passion [and] take their places as full participants in the Rebellion\". She notes, \"Everyone else eventually comes around to Leia's view of the world.\" Leia herself, singularly dedicated to her political movement against the Empire, \"finds a partner in Han, acknowledging that personal happiness can help her sustain her commitment to building a better galactic order\". Rosenberg cites \"Leia's willingness to see the best in him, and Han's desire to live up to her belief in him\" as a foundation of their relationship, also pointing out his attempts to make her recognize that she has needs like anyone else and should acknowledge that she needs him.\nIn their 2012 essay \"Lightsabers, Political Arenas, and Marriages\", Ray Merlock and Kathy Merlock Jackson cite Leia as the successor of earlier science fiction heroines Wilma Deering of \"Buck Rogers\" and Dale Arden of \"Flash Gordon\", and the embodiment of \"a new stage in the ongoing presentation of the fairy-tale princess in jeopardy\". Writing that \"after Leia, no longer would princesses be passive and salvaged simply with a kiss,\" they note the reflection of the character in later Disney Princess animated films and in woman warriors such as Ellen Ripley from the \"Alien\" franchise and Xena of the adventure TV series \"\". A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" described Leia as \"a foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless latter-day Disney princesses. She also foretold the recent, somewhat belated feminist turn in the \"Star Wars\" cycle itself\".\nMark Hamill described Fisher's performance as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She was effortlessly feminist, you know? She wasn't some shrinking violet that needed a guy to come to rescue her. In fact, she made Han and Luke look like chumps. She was anything but what I expected. I mean, I sort of thought, \"Well, she's 19, that's barely out of high school.\" And in many ways, she was a lot older and wiser than I was.\nFisher herself described Leia as a \"huge\" feminist icon, dismissing the suggestion that the character was ever a \"damsel in distress\". Fisher said of Leia, \"She bossed them around. I don't know what your idea of distress is, but that wasn't it! And I wasn't some babe running through the galaxy with my tits bouncing around. So I wasn't threatening to women\". She added, \"I \"like\" Princess Leia. I like how she was feisty. I like how she killed Jabba the Hutt\". \"I think I am Princess Leia, and Princess Leia is me. It's like a M\u00f6bius striptease.\"\nMetal bikini.\nLeia's slave costume when she is held captive by Jabba the Hutt at the beginning of \"Return of the Jedi\"\u2014made of brass and dubbed Leia's \"Metal Bikini\" or \"Gold Bikini\"\u2014immediately made the character (and Fisher) a \"generational sex symbol\" celebrated by pin-up posters, and later merchandising and cosplay. Philip Chien of \"Wired\" wrote in 2006, \"There's no doubt that the sight of Carrie Fisher in the gold sci-fi swimsuit was burned into the sweaty subconscious of a generation of fanboys hitting puberty in the spring of 1983.\" Fisher said in 2015, \"I am not a sex symbol, so that's an opinion of someone. I don't share that\".\nAllie Townsend of \"Time\" wrote in 2011 that the so-called \"slave Leia\" outfit has gained a cult following of its own. Rosenberg noted that \"the costume has become culturally iconic in a way that has slipped loose from the context of the scenes in which Leia wore it and the things she does after she is forced into the outfit.\" Acknowledging the opinion of some that the \"slave Leia\" iconography tarnishes the character's position as \"feminist hero\", Rosenberg argued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Leia may be captive in these scenes, but she's not exactly a compliant fantasy. Instead, she's biding her time for the moment when she can put that fury into action, carrying out a carefully laid plan to rescue her lover. And when that moment comes, the bikini doesn't condemn Leia to passivity. She rises, and uses the very chains that bind her to strangle the creature who tried to take away her power by turning her into a sex object.\nThe science fiction filmmaker Letia Clouston concurred, saying \"Sci-fi has had a long history of strong female characters. Yes, Princess Leia was in a gold bikini, but she was also the one who single-handedly killed Jabba. When you take into account movies and TV shows like \"Terminator\", \"Aliens\", \"Battlestar Galactica\", and even video games like \"Metroid\", you can see sci-fi has consistently promoted the strength of women more than any other genre.\" Peter W. Lee argues that the bikini connotes Leia's hopelessness and helplessness, but even in that demeaning costume she retains her dignity and remains an icon of feminism. Noah Berlatsky argued in \"The Guardian\" for a deeper significance to the costume beyond its function as a sex symbol, stating that the outfit represents an important stage in Princess Leia's complicated relationship with Han Solo.\nThe outfit was created by Aggie Guerard Rodgers and Nilo Rodis-Jamero, costume designers for \"Return of the Jedi\". According to Rodgers, the design was inspired by the work of fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. Author Rikke Schubart suggested the design was also inspired by the work of science fiction illustrator Earle K. Bergey. The outfit featured a sculpted metal string bikini top, paired with a bottom consisting of sculpted metal plates in the front and back covering a red silk loincloth. Fisher wore leather boots, serpentine jewelry and a collar and chain that bound her to her captor, which she ultimately uses to strangle him. Multiple versions of the metal bikini were created to accommodate different scenes in the film, including metal pieces by sculptor Richard Miller for scenes in which Fisher remained still, and a rubber version she and stuntwoman Tracy Eddon could wear comfortably while performing stunts. The costume designers made a mold of Fisher's torso so it could be designed to a custom fit. Fisher quipped that the bikini was \"what supermodels will eventually wear in the seventh ring of hell.\"\nFisher posed in the costume for a 1983 cover story in \"Rolling Stone\". The costume has been parodied in various TV series and films, including \"Friends\" (1996), \"Family Guy\" (2000) and \"Fanboys\" (2009). Yvonne Strahovski's appearance wearing the costume in \"Chuck\" (2009) prompted \"Wizard\" to rank her No. 24 of the 25 sexiest women on TV in 2008. \"IGN\" gave Strahovski the top honor in a similar list. Comedian Amy Schumer wore a replica of the outfit for the August 2015 cover of \"GQ\".\nAn original rubber version of the costume sold for $96,000 at auction in 2015, and another version sold for $175,000 in 2024.\nDespite its iconic status among many fans of the franchise, the slave Leia outfit has sometimes incited controversy. In response to a 2015 news segment in which parents described difficulties explaining toys featuring the costume (including a chain around Leia's neck) to their children, Fisher said, \"Tell [the kids] that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn't like it.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is introduced in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) as a friend of Han Solo and the administrator of Cloud City on the planet Bespin. Prior to the events of the film, Lando made a career as a gambler, con artist, playboy, mining engineer, and businessman, and was the owner of the \"Millennium Falcon\" until losing the ship to Han in a bet. In the film, when Cloud City is threatened by the Galactic Empire, Lando reluctantly betrays Han to Darth Vader, but later helps Han's friends escape from the Empire. In \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), after becoming a general in the Rebel Alliance, Lando helps rescue Han from Jabba the Hutt and leads the attack on the second Death Star.\nLando is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the original trilogy, as well as the sequel film \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (2019). Donald Glover portrays a younger Lando in the standalone film \"\" (2018), which depicts the beginning of his relationship with Han. Lando also appears in novels, comics and video games.\nWilliams was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lando in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". Glover's performance in \"Solo\" was also well received, being hailed as one of the film's highlights. A further film starring Glover as the character, tentatively titled \"Lando\", is currently in development.\nConcept and creation.\nDevelopment.\nWhen writing \"The Empire Strikes Back\", George Lucas planned to introduce a gambler-type character, which developed into Lando Calrissian. Wanting the character to be a foil to the \"rough\" swashbuckler Han Solo (possibly an old friend), Lucas envisioned Lando as a cool con man with the elegance of James Bond and wit of \"Star Trek\"'s Spock. He would support the Empire, thinking that he could outsmart the Imperials before coming to see the Rebellion as a more worthy cause.\nLucas thought Lando could superficially look like a normal human but\u2014drawing from the Clone Wars mentioned in the original \"Star Wars\" film\u2014be a clone from a ruling clan of others just like him (causing Princess Leia to distrust him). His faction, from one of many planets of clone countries, was probably \"partly responsible for the war\". Lucas saw the character as a Rudolph Valentino character, \"almost too perfect looking\" due to his genes being manipulated in the cloning process.\nActor Yaphet Kotto was an early choice for the role, but he chose to appear in the prison drama \"Brubaker\" instead. Billy Dee Williams later stated that he built the character around two features he found interesting; the cape and the Armenian name \"Calrissian\". The original teaser trailer for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" introduced the character as Landau Calrissian.\nLando's cane in \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (2019) was designed to resemble Cloud City. Though \"The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" says the Aurebesh text on it reads \"Baron Lando Calrissian\", the cane was shown at a press junket for \"The Rise of Skywalker\", and fans translated its text as \"Landonis Balthazar Calrissian III\".\nPortrayal.\nIn 2018, \"The Verge\" noted that despite Han Solo's first name being written as \"Han\" and Lucas also pronouncing the name as \"Han\" () off-screen, within the films most characters, including Luke Skywalker, pronounce it as \"Hahn\" (). \"The Verge\" also noted how Williams's Lando seems to be the only character to pronounce it as \"Han\" like Lucas, and that when, in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Lando is choked by Chewbacca for betraying Han, Lando causes most other characters to shift to \"Han\". In \"\", Glover decided to deliberately use \"Han\" instead of \"Hahn\" in order to honor the character's trait.\nAhead of the release of \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\", co-writer Jonathan Kasdan suggested that Lando is pansexual and stated, \"There's a fluidity to [Donald Glover] and Billy Dee's [portrayal of Lando's] sexuality ... I would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly LGBT character into this movie. I think it's time, certainly, for that, and I love the fluidity \u2015 sort of the spectrum of sexuality that Donald appeals to and that droids are a part of. He doesn't make any hard and fast rules.\" When asked about a scene where L3-37 jokes about Lando's being flirtatious towards Han, writer Lawrence Kasdan said, \"That is her personality. Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn't.\" When asked about Lando's pansexuality, Donald Glover stated, \"How can you not be pansexual in space? There's so many things to have sex with.\" In recent years, Marvel LGBT pride-themed series of comic covers have featured Lando, canonizing the character's LGBT status.\nAppearances.\nFilm.\nLando is portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), and \"The Rise of Skywalker\" (2019), and by Donald Glover in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" (2018).\nOriginal trilogy.\nLando Calrissian first appears in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as the administrator of Cloud City, an old friend of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and the previous owner of Han's ship, the \"Millennium Falcon\". When Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) arrive at Cloud City, Lando welcomes them as guests of honor \u2013 only to betray them to Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), who plans to use them as bait to ensnare Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Lando had reluctantly agreed to betray Han and company after Vader threatened the city if he refused. Lando allows Vader to freeze Han in carbonite and give him to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch); when Vader takes Leia and Chewbacca prisoner, however, Lando's conscience gets the better of him in light of Vader's capriciousness altering his agreement at will. In the ensuing evacuation of Cloud City, he helps them escape in the \"Falcon\". He later assists in rescuing Luke from the underside of Cloud City. Afterwards, he promises to help find Han.\nIn \"Return of the Jedi\", Lando goes undercover to help Luke rescue Han from crime lord Jabba the Hutt. During a battle with Jabba's thugs, Han saves Lando from being devoured by the sarlacc; Lando then helps Han and the others destroy Jabba's barge. He is made a general in the Rebel Alliance for his heroics. Lando then takes the pilot chair in his old ship, the \"Millennium Falcon\", and leads the attack on the second Death Star. He leads the Rebel strike on the battle station, and personally destroys its power core, causing the station to explode. He then joins the other Rebels on Endor in celebrating their victory and the end of the Empire.\nSequel trilogy.\nLando did not appear in the first film of the sequel trilogy, \" (2015). According to Williams, the reason Lando did not return may have been that he did not fit into the storyline. His absence from the casting announcement caused the displeasure of some fans.\nLando was also absent from \" (2017). During the early development of the film, director Rian Johnson briefly considered bringing back Lando as the codebreaker that Resistance members Finn (John Boyega) and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) seek in the coastal city of Canto Bight, but Lando was finally written out of the film's script, with the codebreaker role ultimately going to Benicio del Toro's character DJ.\nLando finally reappeared in 2019's \"The Rise of Skywalker\", marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history. In the backstory to the film, in the years of peace after the Galactic Civil War, Lando attempted to start a family, and had a daughter, who was kidnapped by unknown culprits when she was two years old. In time, it became clear that the First Order was behind both her abduction and those of other children of former Rebel leaders, who had become stormtroopers, thereby leaving them reluctant to order any action against the fledgling organisation, lest they unwittingly kill their own children. After the tragedy of losing his daughter and his failure in a quest with Luke Skywalker to find answers about the growing darkness in the Force, Lando left his wife and settled on the desert planet of Pasaana, adopting a life of solitude.\nLando returns in \"The Rise of Skywalker\" on Pasaana, appearing jovial and guiding Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn, and Chewbacca toward a clue for the whereabouts of the Sith wayfinder. Poe asks Lando to aid the Resistance, but Lando refuses, saying he does not fly anymore, but sends his regards to Leia. Lando reappears much later in the film, upon Leia's death, and he tells a grieving Poe that he, Luke, Leia, and Han were similarly unprepared when they were fighting the Empire, but that they were able to succeed because they had each other. This inspires Poe to launch an offensive against the Sith Eternal forces, including the Final Order, with Lando traveling the galaxy to recruit Rebel veterans and other supporters of the Resistance's cause to help in the final battle. Just as the Resistance appears most overwhelmed in the battle, Lando, Chewbacca, and Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) arrive in the \"Millennium Falcon\" alongside a massive fleet of Resistance sympathizers, allies, and veterans, and they help to win the battle and the war. At the end of the film, as the galaxy is celebrating the Resistance's victory against Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and the Sith Eternal, Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a former stormtrooper, approaches Lando and says she does not know where she is from; he tells her that they will find out together.\n\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\".\nDonald Glover portrays a younger Lando in the 2018 standalone film \"\", which takes place roughly thirteen years before \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Glover had the opportunity to speak with Billy Dee Williams and seek his input. \"He said, 'Just be charming'. Which is the best advice.\"\nIn the film, Lando is introduced as a gambler and semi-retired smuggler who owns a ship fast enough for Han and his associates to use in stealing a load of raw starship fuel. Han tries to win the ship (the \"Millennium Falcon\") from him in a game of sabacc, but Lando cheats and cleans Han out. However, Lando agrees to join the team in exchange for a percentage of the profits from the mission. During the heist and subsequent escape, Lando is injured and his droid co-pilot L3-37 is irreparably damaged, but Han brings the \"Falcon\" to safety with help from L3's navigational database after he hotwires it into the ship's computer. Lando later takes the \"Falcon\" and abandons the team, but Han tracks him down and wins it from him in another game of sabacc, having stolen the card Lando had up his sleeve to let him cheat.\nIn December 2020, Disney announced a \"Lando\" streaming series for Disney+, with Justin Simien as showrunner. In July 2023, it was reported that Donald Glover was attached to reprise his role from \"Solo\" and would co-write the project with his brother Stephen, who that September announced that the project was now planned as a feature film.\nTelevision series.\nBilly Dee Williams returned to the role in the \"Star Wars Rebels\" episodes \"Idiot's Array\" and \"The Siege of Lothal\".\nIn \"Idiot's Array\", Lando wins Chopper (voiced by Dave Filoni), the repair droid of the crew of the \"Ghost\", in a game of sabacc, forcing the crew to assist him with a dangerous smuggling run to get their droid back. The crew become Lando's reluctant business partners following the ordeal, leading to their first encounter with the crime boss Azmorigan (voiced by James Hong). In \"The Siege of Lothal\", the crew of the \"Ghost\" approach Lando for help in getting off of Lothal, which is under Imperial occupation. He is also mentioned on occasion in various other episodes, becoming one of a couple of aliases employed by Ezra Bridger (voiced by Taylor Gray).\nVideo games.\nBilly Dee Williams reprises his role as Lando Calrissian in various games, including as a playable character in \"Star Wars Battlefront\" and \"Battlefront II\".\nLando Calrissian, portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the original Star Wars trilogy, makes a notable appearance in Star Wars: Outlaws, an open-world action-adventure video game developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft. Released in 2024, Outlaws is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, during a time when Lando is navigating his new role after the events of the former film. In Star Wars: Outlaws, Lando is shown as a charismatic, smooth-talking gambler and entrepreneur, true to his classic character traits. He interacts with the game's protagonist, Kay Vess, providing assistance and engaging in several missions that align with the underworld of the galaxy. His involvement in the game adds a nostalgic touch for longtime Star Wars fans, bringing an iconic character into the expansive universe of Outlaws.\nLando's appearance in the game has been widely praised for its faithful recreation of his persona, with voice acting by Lindsay Owen Pierre.\nComics.\nLando Calrissian appears in Marvel Comics' \"Lando\" (2015), a five-issue miniseries set shortly before the original trilogy. Lando has a brief appearance in the miniseries \"\" (2015), which takes place after \"Return of the Jedi\". Lando is also featured in the comic \"Lando: Double or Nothing\" (2018), a five-issue miniseries set just before \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\".\nThe 2020 relaunch of Marvel's \"Star Wars\" series, picking up at the tail end of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", reveals that Lando returns to Cloud City to retrieve Lobot and help Luke look for his lightsaber.\nBooks.\nThe novel \"Star Wars: Last Shot\" reveals that between \"Return of the Jedi\" and \"The Force Awakens\", Lando is considering settling down with a Twi'lek girlfriend.\n\"Star Wars Legends\".\nFollowing the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise. The \"Legends\" works comprise a separate narrative universe.\nLando is featured in the \"Star Wars\" comic book series released by Marvel Comics. In the series, he has a crime lord nemesis named Drebble, and Lando frequently made use of his foil's name as a cover identity so that any animosity he generates while using the alias will be brought against the real Drebble, not Lando himself. This eventually backfires when \"Drebble's\" exploits are recognized by the Rebellion and Lando\u2014being the only person who knows of him\u2014has to present the real Drebble with an award for his own activities.\nLando is a supporting character in \"Legends\" novels that took place after \"Return of the Jedi\" commonly depicted Lando as getting involved in a variety of entrepreneurial schemes, including Nomad City in Timothy Zahn's \"Thrawn\" trilogy and the Kessel Spice Mines in the works of Kevin J. Anderson. During \"The Corellian Trilogy\", Lando goes on a galaxy-wide hunt for a rich wife, ultimately marrying Tendra Risant. With his in-laws' money and his entrepreneurial abilities, he opens a mining facility on the Outer Rim planet of Dubrillion. In \"The New Jedi Order\" and beyond, Lando continues being a valuable ally and friend to the Skywalker/Solo family. In \"Fury\", the seventh novel of the \"Legacy of the Force\" series, Lando announces to Han and Leia that he and Tendra are having a child.\nKevin J. Anderson stated that Lucasfilm toyed with the idea of killing off Lando, noting the character had run his course for Expanded Universe authors in the 1990s.\n\"The Lando Calrissian Adventures\".\nThe Lando Calrissian Adventures is a 1983 trilogy of science fiction novels by L. Neil Smith. Set in the \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe, the novels chronicle Lando's smuggling days before the events of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy.\nThe series has been described as \"space pulp\", and highlights the differences between Lando and Han Solo. The books were released in July, October, and December 1983, and were the first \"Star Wars\" books released since \"The Han Solo Adventures\" (1979\u20131980); both trilogies were originally published by Del Rey, a division of Ballantine Books. They were also among the last novels in the franchise until Timothy Zahn's \"Thrawn\" trilogy was released in the early 1990s.\nThe series is set 3\u20132 years before the original \"Star Wars\" film, and is brought into chronological context with the rest of the Expanded Universe in \"Rebel Dawn \" (1998), the final book of A.\u00a0C. Crispin's \"Han Solo Trilogy\".\nFor the duration of the trilogy, Lando is accompanied by a droid named Vuffi Raa. The novelization of \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" makes reference to the events of the first book as a previous adventure of Lando's, which he recounts while composing his autobiographical \"Calrissian Chronicles\". He further estimates that it will be the first in a trilogy of his adventures.\nLando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu is the first novel in Smith's \"Lando Calrissian\" trilogy, published by Del Rey on 1 July 1983. It is noted as being more of a psychedelic fantasy novel than hard science fiction.\nThe book begins shortly after Lando wins the \"Millennium Falcon\" in a game of sabacc, as well as a robot which must be picked up in the Rafa system. Upon the planet of Rafa IV, convicts are made to harvest mind-draining \n\"life-crystals\" which prolong the life of elite citizens. Lando is arrested and brought before the colony's corrupt governor and the sorcerer Rokur Gepta, who will let him keep his life and liberty if he can locate the legendary Mindharp of the ancient and long-lost Sharu civilization. The Mindharp is revealed to be kept inside a multidimensional pyramid with mind-altering properties, which provides a strange adventure for the daring Lando.\nLando Calrissian and the Flamewind of Oseon is the second novel in the trilogy, published on 1 October 1983. After selling a load of life-crystals, and accompanied by his droid Vuffi Raa, Lando attempts a career as an honest freighter captain. After some bad luck, he is soon nostalgic for his old trade. Fortunately, he is invited to a sabacc game on Oseon celebrating an event called Flamewind, but is followed by Rokur Gepta. After an explosion rocks the hull of the \"Falcon\", they safely land. During the sabacc game, Lando is distracted by the apparent sabotage of his ship, and is assaulted. He comes under trial for having a weapon, illegal on the planet. He is offered a smuggling deal as an alternative to execution.\nLando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka is the third novel, published on 1 December 1983. Nearly a year after Lando and Vuffi Raa have left the Oseon system, while traveling in deep space they encounter Lehesu, a vacuum-breathing creature. Able to establish communication, they find out he is also on an adventure away from his home, the ThonBoka nebula. A month later, Lando and Raa receive word that ThonBoka is under attack from the Imperial Centrality Navy. Lehesu's exploration of the Centrality apparently provoked the attack on his species. Lando and Raa rush to assist their friend.\nThe Imperial blockade makes Lando nervous, but he cons his way through the fleet. When the \"Millennium Falcon\" strays from its course and is ordered to return, they dump explosives and go into hyperspace to fake the \"Falcon\"'s destruction. Meanwhile, Rokur Gepta forms an alliance with a confederate squadron. Lando and Raa reunite with Lehesu, and hear of a negotiation attempt which only results in an outbreak of battle. The vacuum-breathing creatures use their projection and hyperspace abilities to fool the Imperial Navy, which fires on its allied ships. As Vuffi Raa pilots the \"Falcon\", Lando engages the enemy in battle from the quad-gun in one of their last adventures before Raa is resummoned to his original programming.\nVideo games.\nWilliams reprised his role as Lando in \"Legends\" videogame \", where he assists Kyle Katarn through the second half of the Nar Shaadaa levels and helps him reach Bespin.\nIn \", Calrissian is an unlockable playable character, having the characteristic of being able to kiss Leia's hand if she is nearby. Lando is also a playable character as a hero character for the Rebels in the video games \"Star Wars Battlefront\" and \"Star Wars: Battlefront II\".\nReception.\nAuthor Adilufu Nama wrote in 2008 that Lando \"offered a new benchmark in the status of black representation in science fiction cinema\". According to Alyssa Rosenberg of \"The Washington Post\", Lando is a \"fascinating and fraught part of the '\"Star Wars\"' legacy and the conversation around race in science fiction\". She added that \"Lando's the only character in '\"Star Wars\"' with a truly comfortable sense of style.\" On his portrayal, she wrote, \"One of Williams's accomplishments in '\"Empire\"' and '\"Return of the Jedi\"' is how much he [feels] like an old-fashioned movie star in a futuristic setting without making the performance seem incongruous.\"\nIn 2015, Billy Dee Williams publicly admitted that he received backlash from children who were angered by Lando's betrayal of Han in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Williams felt that the situation would have been different if Lando had been played by a white actor. Williams wrote that \"Lando is not black or white, he's just Lando. Above and beyond the arguments or discussions of bygone eras, he is of the future.\" He further stated,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The one thing I always find myself explaining is that Lando didn't betray Han and his friends. He was dealing, as best he could, with a situation that was presented to him by the Empire upon their arrival. One of the most amusing moments for me was that Lando decided to challenge Darth Vader (for about three seconds) until he realized that maybe he'd better back down and figure out another way to save his friends.\nWriting for \"The Verge\", Megan Farokhmanesh criticized Jonathan Kasdan's assertion that Lando is pansexual as \"a piss-poor shot at representation\", and argued that Kasdan was conflating pansexuality with promiscuity. Farokhmanesh compared the assertion to J.\u00a0K. Rowling's statement that her character Albus Dumbledore is gay, despite no \"Harry Potter\" media depicting this. In 2019, Billy Dee Williams criticized the decision as well, blaming \"Solo\"'s underperformance at the box office on its focus on this \"topical\" issue.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

First appearing in the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" (1978), where he was voiced by Don Francks, he is an armored bounty hunter featured in both the original and prequel film trilogies. In the original trilogy, the character is a supporting antagonist and was mainly portrayed by Jeremy Bulloch and voiced by Jason Wingreen. Notable for his taciturn demeanor and for never removing his helmet, Fett appears in both \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), employed by the Galactic Empire, and \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), serving the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. While seemingly killed in \"Return of the Jedi\" after falling into a sarlacc, he has since appeared in \"Star Wars\" media set after the film, confirming his survival within the new canon, portrayed by Temuera Morrison. Daniel Logan plays a preteen Boba in the prequel film ' (2002), which reveals the character's origins as the genetic clone and adoptive son of Jango Fett, also a famous bounty hunter. Morrison appeared first in Star Wars media playing Jango. The animated series ' further reveals Boba to have been born Alpha, and to have a biological sister, . The series also reveals that he has another sister named .\nThe character also appears in many forms of \"Star Wars\" media outside of the films, such as books, comics, television series, and video games, many of which depict him as an antihero rather than a villain, and explore his background, motivations, and morality. Daniel Logan reprised his role as the younger version of Fett in the animated series \"\", while Temuera Morrison, who also portrayed Jango in \"Attack of the Clones\", has portrayed an adult Boba in most of his \"Star Wars\" appearances since that film, most prominently in the live-action Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\" and its spin-off series \"The Book of Boba Fett\", in which he assumes control over Tatooine with his partner Fennec Shand as the planet's new daimyo.\nDuring the development of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Fett was originally conceived as a member of a group of white-armored Imperial \"supercommandos\" before the idea was scrapped in favor of a solitary bounty hunter. This concept later evolved into the Mandalorians, a cultural group with strong warrior traditions, who sport armor and helmets similar to Fett's. In several \"Star Wars\" works, Fett himself is portrayed as a Mandalorian or at least connected to the Mandalorian culture through his armor, with his father Jango confirmed to have been a Mandalorian foundling and war veteran in \"The Mandalorian\".\nThe character of Boba Fett quickly became a fan favorite despite his limited presence in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy and is now a widely recognized figure in popular culture. His popularity within the \"Star Wars\" fanbase has earned him a cult following.\nConcept and development.\n\"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas created Boba Fett in his April 1978 screenplay draft of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", basing the character on Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone's Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) from the \"Dollar Trilogy\". The character needed to be designed quickly, as Lucas had agreed for him to be featured in the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\" later that year. The character's design stemmed from initial concepts for Darth Vader, who was originally conceived as a rogue bounty hunter. While Vader became less of a mercenary and more of a dark knight, the bounty hunter concept remained, and Fett became \"an equally villainous\" but \"less conspicuous\" character. Concept artist Ralph McQuarrie influenced Fett's design, which was finalized by and is credited to Joe Johnston.\nNorman Reynolds and the film's art department built the costume. Fett's armor was originally designed for \"super troopers\", and was adapted for Fett as the script developed. Screen-tested in all-white, Fett's armor eventually garnered a subdued color scheme intended to visually place him between white-armored \"rank-and-file\" Imperial stormtroopers and Vader, who wears black. This color scheme had the bonus of conveying the \"gray morality\" of his character. The character's armor was designed to appear to have been scavenged from multiple sources, and it is adorned with trophies. A description of Fett's armor in the mid-1979 \"Bantha Tracks\" newsletter catalyzed \"rampant speculation\" about his origins. By 1979, Fett's backstory included having served in an army of Imperial shock troops which had battled the clone troopers of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.\nDespite two years of widespread publicity about Fett's appearance in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", script rewrites significantly reduced the character's presence in the film. Fett's musical theme, composed by John Williams, is \"not music, exactly\" but \"more of a gurgly, viola-and-bassoon thing aurally cross-pollinated with some obscure static sounds.\" Sound editor Ben Burtt added the sound of jangling spurs, created and performed by the Foley artist team of Robert Rutledge and Edward Steidele, to Fett's appearance in Cloud City, intending to make the character menacing and the scene reminiscent of similar gunfighter appearances in Western films. At one point in \"Return of the Jedi\"'s development, Fett was conceived as being a main villain, but he was finally replaced with the Emperor when Lucas decided to not make a third trilogy of \"Star Wars\". Lucas also considered having Fett fight Lando Calrissian during the sarlacc sequence.\nAn official reference book states that Fett charges \"famously expensive\" fees, and that he undertakes only those missions which meet \"his harsh sense of justice\". Daniel Keys Moran, who wrote a few stories featuring Boba Fett, cited Westerns as an influence on his development of the character. Moran said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLucas at one point considered depicting Vader and Fett as brothers in the prequel films, but discounted it as too \"hokey\". In continuing to develop the character in the prequel films, Lucas closed some avenues for expanding the character's story while opening others by establishing that Fett is a clone of a similar bounty hunter, Jango Fett. Lucas considered modifying later editions of \"Return of the Jedi\" by adding a shot of Fett escaping the sarlacc, but decided against it because it would have detracted from the story's focus. Lucas also said that, had he known Fett would be so popular, he would have made the character's death \"more exciting\". In 2014, after Lucas had sold Lucasfilm to Disney, \"Star Wars\" historian Jonathan W. Rinzler revealed that Lucas had privately acknowledged that Fett escaped from the sarlacc. This was canonically established with Fett's appearances in \"The Mandalorian\" six years later portrayed by Temuera Morrison, which led to a spin-off focused on the character, \"The Book of Boba Fett\", starring Morrison. Joe Johnston and Morrison himself criticized the decision to portray the character without his helmet, Morrison noting it was done to avoid comparisons with the titular character of \"The Mandalorian\".\nFilm casting and production.\nBoba Fett is primarily played by Jeremy Bulloch in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". Bulloch's half-brother alerted him to the role. He was cast as Fett because the costume happened to fit \"as if a Savile Row tailor had come out and made it\"; he did not have to do a reading or screen test, and Bulloch never worked from a script for either film.\nFilming the role for \"Empire\" lasted three weeks. The actor was pleased with the costume and used it to convey the character's menace. Bulloch based his performance on Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name in \"A Fistful of Dollars\"; similar to the Western character, Bulloch cradled the blaster prop, made the character seem ready to shoot, slightly tilted his head, and stood a particular way. Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character, and said later that \"the less you do with Boba Fett, the stronger he becomes\". Playing Fett in \"Empire\" was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played; Bulloch said donning the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role.\nBulloch spent four weeks on \"Return of the Jedi\". He was unaware of Fett's demise before filming began and was \"very upset\" by the development; he would like to have done more with Fett. Still, Bulloch believed killing Fett made the character stronger, and that his \"weak\" death makes fans want the character to return. Bulloch thought a\u00a0scene created for the 1997 Special Edition in which Fett flirts with one of Jabba the Hutt's dancers was not in keeping with the character's nature.\nA younger version of the character was played by Daniel Logan in \"Attack of the Clones\", which establishes that Boba is a clone of his father, Jango. Logan had not seen any of the \"Star Wars\" films before being cast as Fett, but he watched the original trilogy at Lucas' request. The actor had to rely on his imagination for the bluescreen filming. Both Bulloch and Logan had also expressed interest in reprising their role of Fett in the planned \"\" TV series, but the series remains undeveloped.\nOther portrayals.\nAccording to the official \"Star Wars\" website, Fett was voiced by Don Francks in the \"Holiday Special\". Bulloch wore Fett's costume in \"Empire\" and \"Jedi\", but John Morton filled in during one scene for \"Empire\", and Jason Wingreen voiced the character in \"Empire\". His brief appearance in the Special Edition of the original film, \"Episode IV\"\u00a0\u2013 \"A New Hope\", was performed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic creature animator Mark Austin. The character's appearance in the Special Edition footage of \"Jedi\" was performed by Don Bies and Nelson Hall. For the 2004 rereleases, Temuera Morrison replaced the character's original voice for continuity with \"Attack of the Clones\", in which Morrison portrays Jango Fett.\nThe character's voice in National Public Radio's \"Star Wars\" radio dramas was provided by Alan Rosenberg in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and Ed Begley Jr. in \"Return of the Jedi\". Brian Daley scripted a scene between Fett and C-3PO in Jabba's palace however, Anthony Daniels rejected the idea insisting the two characters should not be on friendly terms. Fett was replaced by Arica (Mara Jade in disguise) from Timothy Zahn's \"Tales from Jabba's Palace\". His voice was also provided by Tim Glovatsky in the audio adaptation of \"Dark Forces: Rebel Agent\", Joe Hacker in an audio adaptation of the \"Dark Empire\" comics, Temuera Morrison for ', ' and ', Dee Bradley Baker in \"The Force Unleashed\", \"The Force Unleashed II\" and ', Chris Cox in ', Tom Kane in ', ' and ', and Daniel Logan for \"The Clone Wars\" animated TV series and \"\".\nThe first live-action depiction of Fett outside the theatrical films was in the second season of the original Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\", wherein Morrison reprised the role.\nThe character also made a cameo appearance in a live-action mockumentary filmed on the set of \"Return of the Jedi\" titled \"Return of the Ewok\" (1982). Post-production was never completed, and it has never been officially released.\nAppearances.\nThe character of Boba Fett made his first public appearance at the San Anselmo Country Fair parade on 24 September 1978. In the parade, the Boba Fett costume was worn by Duwayne Dunham, who was working at the time as an assistant film editor before later becoming a film and television director. The character debuted on television two months later in an animated segment produced by Toronto-based animation firm Nelvana Productions for the \"Star Wars Holiday Special\". Fett appears as a mysterious figure who saves Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 from a giant monster, only to be revealed as a bounty hunter working for Darth Vader. After his image and identity were revealed in the \"Holiday Special\", costumed Fett characters appeared in shopping malls and special events, putting up wanted posters of the character to distinguish him from the franchise's Imperial characters.\nSkywalker saga.\nOriginal trilogy.\nFett's theatrical film debut was as an unnamed bounty hunter in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as the \"next major villain\" beside Darth Vader. He is one of six bounty hunters assembled by Darth Vader, who promises a reward to whoever captures the crew of the \"Millennium Falcon\". Fett tracks the starship to Cloud City, where Vader captures its passengers and tortures its captain, Han Solo. Aiming to collect the bounty Jabba the Hutt has placed on Solo (established in the original film), Fett questions Vader regarding the carbon freeze, which Vader intends to use on his true target, Luke Skywalker. Vader promises that the Empire will compensate Fett if Solo dies, but the smuggler survives and Vader turns him over to Fett, who leaves to deliver him to Jabba in his ship, the \"Slave I\".\n\"Return of the Jedi\" features Boba Fett at Jabba's palace on Tatooine, where Han Solo's friends are captured while trying to save him. Fett aims his weapon at Princess Leia (disguised as bounty hunter Boushh) when she threatens Jabba with a thermal detonator, and he later travels on Jabba's sail barge to the Great Pit of Carkoon (home of a sessile carnivorous creature known as a sarlacc) to witness the prisoners' execution. When the prisoners revolt and fight back, Fett flies over and briefly fights Luke. Chewbacca later warns Solo, who is still blind after being frozen in carbonite, that Fett is near. As Solo turns around, he inadvertently hits Fett's rocket pack, setting it off and propelling Fett into the side of the sail barge, from which he falls into the sarlacc's mouth. The 1997 Special Edition release of the film includes an additional scene of Fett flirting with some of Jabba's female dancers.\nIn the 1997 Special Edition of \"A New Hope\", Fett briefly appears in a reintroduced cut scene outside the \"Millennium Falcon\" while Jabba confronts Han Solo. The character had yet to be created during the filming of the scene and was thus superimposed onto the image.\nPrequel trilogy.\nA preteen Boba Fett (played by Daniel Logan) appears in the 2002 prequel film \"Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones\", which reveals that he is an unaltered clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), who had him created on Kamino to be raised as his son as part of his price to serve as the template for the Grand Army of the Republic's clone army. Boba helps Jango escape from Obi-Wan Kenobi and accompanies him to Geonosis, where he witnesses Jango's death by beheading at the hands of Mace Windu during the first battle in the Clone Wars. After the battle ends, he is last seen mourning over his father's helmet, which he takes and places in front of his head, foreshadowing his future as a bounty hunter wearing his father's armor.\nTelevision.\n\"The Story of the Faithful Wookiee\".\nBoba Fett appeared in the animated segment of the non-canon 1978 Holiday Special, set after the events of \"A New Hope\". This marks his first appearance in the franchise. He is first seen when he rescues Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 from a Panna dragon. Fett presents himself as an ally to the heroes but it is later revealed that he was working for Darth Vader the whole time - to reveal the location of the Rebels to the Empire. Fett ignites his jetpack before leaving and promising that they will meet again.\n\"Droids\".\nBoba Fett appeared in the non-canon 1985 animated series, \"\", set 15 years before the original trilogy. The series was produced by the same studio that created the animated segment of the 1978 \"Holiday Special\", and Fett was again voiced by Don Francks (who had been uncredited for his original role in the \"Holiday Special\"). In the episode \"A Race to the Finish\", he is hired by the Fromms to help them get revenge on the masters of the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. Fett later turns on them after failing their request, and decides to accept Jabba's bounty on the Fromms as compensation.\n\"The Clone Wars\".\nLogan reprised his role as the voice of Fett in the 2008 animated series \"\". The final three episodes of the of the series, entitled \"\", \"R2 Come Home\" and \"Lethal Trackdown\", were aired on April 30, 2010, and attracted an average of 2.756\u00a0million viewers during the original broadcast. The finale is significant for ending \"with twin fandom bangs, courtesy of Boba Fett and a mammoth beast inspired by Godzilla\". Fett's entrance in the series commemorates the 30-year anniversary of the character's appearance in \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\nIn the story arc, Boba infiltrates Mace Windu's flagship in the guise of a clone trooper cadet, hoping to exact revenge against the Jedi for killing his father. After a failed attempt to bomb Windu in his quarters, he sabotages the ship's engines, causing it to crash on a nearby planet. He and his bounty hunter accomplices then take hostages from the ship's crew, whom they try to use to bait the Jedi Master. Throughout the ordeal, Fett balks at committing violence against his fellow clones, which comes to a head when his mentor Aurra Sing executes Windu's clone trooper second-in-command. Plo Koon and Ahsoka Tano eventually track Fett and his compatriots to pirate Hondo Ohnaka's base. Fett is ultimately captured by the Jedi and sentenced to prison on Coruscant; although he expresses regret for the collateral damage he has caused, he vows to never forgive Windu.\nFett escapes prison in the fourth-season episode \"Deception\". He later forms his bounty hunter syndicate, Krayt's Claw, which includes Bossk and Dengar (both of whom first appeared in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" alongside Fett). In the episode \"Bounty\", Krayt's Claw is hired to deliver a package to a dictator. When the bounty hunters discover that their cargo is a young woman destined for a forced marriage to the despot, Fett is indifferent to her plight and insists the team proceed with their mission. Temporary member Asajj Ventress, enraged, turns on Fett; she strangles him with the Force, binds, and gags him, and shoves him into the container in the captive's place, whereupon he is delivered to the nonplussed client.\n\"The Mandalorian\".\nBoba Fett's presence in the original Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\" was first hinted at in the first-season episode \"\", which ends with a mysterious figure wearing boots and seemingly a cape approaching the body of assassin Fennec Shand on Tatooine.\nIn June 2020, it was reported that Temuera Morrison would appear as Fett in the second season of \"The Mandalorian\". As the series takes place five years following \"Return of the Jedi\", this would confirm the character's survival after his fall into the sarlacc's mouth and retcon his apparent death. In the second season's premiere, \", it is explained that Fett's armor was salvaged by Jawas after his supposed death, and then bought by Cobb Vanth, a character first introduced in the \" trilogy of novels, who used it to protect the Tatooinian village of Mos Pelgo from various threats. In the episode, the armor is eventually obtained by the Mandalorian after Vanth relinquishes it so that it could be returned to its rightful owners: the Mandalorian people. As he leaves with the armor, the Mandalorian is watched from the distance by a heavily scarred Fett.\nFett's first full appearance in the series occurred in the episode \"\", in which it is explained that he saved Fennec's life after she was mortally wounded, leaving her in his debt and that he is looking to retrieve his armor from the Mandalorian. Fett and Fennec follow him in the \"Slave I\" to the planet Tython, where the former explains that his armor belonged to his late father Jango, a Mandalorian foundling, and is, thus, Fett's birthright. In exchange for the armor's return, Fett and Fennec ensure the safety of Grogu, an alien infant the Mandalorian has adopted. When Moff Gideon's Imperial forces attack the group, Fett dons his old armor and kills most of the stormtroopers deployed to capture Grogu with a gaffi stick. Despite this, the child is ultimately taken by Gideon's Dark Troopers. Fett insists that he and Fennec shall remain indebted to the Mandalorian until Grogu is safe, and they subsequently aid his efforts to rescue the child in \"\" and \"\", which show Fett in a now clean and repainted armor.\nIn the latter episode, Fett is initially at odds with Bo-Katan Kryze, the former ruler of Mandalore and one of the allies that the Mandalorian tries to recruit to help save Grogu because she calls him a disgrace to his Mandalorian armor due to his origins as a clone. Despite this, the two reluctantly work together to rescue the child from Moff Gideon, with Fett creating a distraction that allows the rest of the crew to board Gideon's ship. After this, Fett flies into hyperspace and is not seen again until a post-credits scene, in which he and Fennec return to Tatooine after their debt is paid off. Fett kills Bib Fortuna, who has been in charge of Jabba's palace since his death, and then sits on the throne that once belonged to Jabba, with Fennec at his side.\n\"The Bad Batch\".\nBoba Fett is mentioned in \",\" a CGI-animated sequel and spin-off from \"The Clone Wars\" which premiered in 2021. The episode \"Bounty Lost\" reveals that Boba's original code name is Alpha, and that Omega, an enhanced female clone who joined Clone Force 99 after the rise of the Empire, is a second unaltered replication of Jango and, therefore, Boba's sister. The episode \"Plan 99\" reveals that Emerie Karr is another female clone, therefore, another sister of his.\n\"Visions\".\nBoba Fett appears in the 2021 anime series \"\", voiced by Temuera Morrison in English and by Akio Kaneda in Japanese. He appears in the second episode, \"Tatooine Rhapsody\".\n\"The Book of Boba Fett\".\n\"The Book of Boba Fett\" is a spin-off of \"The Mandalorian\" focused on Boba Fett, which premiered on Disney+ on December 29, 2021. Morrison and Ming-Na Wen reprised their roles as Fett and Fennec Shand, respectively, with Finnegan Garay portraying a young Fett with Daniel Logan's likeness superimposed over his own. The first trailer was released November 1, 2021. In \"The Book of Boba Fett\", Boba Fett and his partner, Fennec Shand, begin rebuilding the old criminal empire of Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. The series was controversial among Star Wars fans for its weakening of the villainous aspects of the bounty hunter.\nOther media.\nIn the first issue of Marvel Comics' \"Darth Vader\" (2015), the title character hires Boba Fett to capture the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. In the concurrent \"Star Wars\" comic (2015), Fett tracks the pilot, Luke Skywalker, to Tatooine, although the latter escapes after a brief fight. Fett then tells Vader the pilot's surname, unknowingly informing the Sith lord (formerly Anakin Skywalker) that he has a son. Fett also features in Marvel's \"Bounty Hunters\" (2020), which is set between \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\". The comic miniseries \"War of the Bounty Hunters\" (2021) is set in the same era, and will be preceded by standalone comics including tie-ins with \"Star Wars\", \"Bounty Hunters\", \"Darth Vader\", and \"Doctor Aphra\".\nFett appears as a playable character in \"Star Wars Battlefront\" (2015) and \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" (2017), as well as several \"Star Wars\" video games for mobile devices.\nOn December 24, 2021, Fett was added as a wearable cosmetic for Fortnite Battle Royale.\nOn February 4, 2022, Indy Stevenson posted a \"The Book of Boba Fett\" comic entitled \"This Place Was Home\" on Twitter to a universally positive critical reception. The comic focused on \"Boba's childhood relationship with [Zam] Wesell\", a mother figure to him.\nFett makes a cameo appearance in \"\" (2023), with Temuera Morrison reprising his role. He appears as part of a side quest in which Cal Kestis fights and defeats bounty hunter Caij Vanda. Fett appears at the end of the fight to collect the bounty on Vanda, with Cal allowing it to happen.\n\"Legends\".\nThe character appears extensively in the \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe of novels, comic books, and video games, dating to as early as the newspaper comic strip and Marvel's \"Star Wars\" series (produced concurrently to the original film trilogy). In April 2014, such works were rebranded by Lucasfilm as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the rest of the franchise to create a blank slate for the sequel trilogy.\nBoba Fett appears in many other works set during the original trilogy, including the choose-your-own-adventure book \"The Bounty Hunter\" (1994), the 1996 \"Shadows of the Empire\" multimedia project, Dark Horse's short comic \"Boba Fett: Salvage\" (1997), volumes of the young-reader series \"Galaxy of Fear\" (1997\u20131998), \"The Bounty Hunter Wars\" book trilogy (1998\u20131999), issues of \"\" (2002\u20132005) and \"Star Wars\" (2013\u201314), and the one-shot comic \"Boba Fett: Overkill\" (2006). Fett appears in the years leading up to \"A New Hope\" in the comic \"Boba Fett: Enemy of the Empire\" (1999), in which Vader hires Fett before trying to kill him, as well as \"Agent of the Empire\" (2012\u20132013), \"Blood Ties\" (2010\u20132012), and \"Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika\" (2000\u20132001).\nA 1983 issue of the original Marvel \"Star Wars\" comic book set just after \"Return of the Jedi\" depicts Fett temporarily escaping the sarlacc pit. Works such as Dark Horse's \"Dark Empire\" series (1991\u20131992) further utilized Fett's survival. by Daniel Keys Moran narrates some of his time in the sarlacc, and by Dave Wolverton narrates how Dengar finds him and restores him to health. In the comic \"Boba Fett: Twin Engines of Destruction\" (1997), while Fett recovers after being freed from the sarlaac, he is impersonated by a bounty hunter named Jodo Kast, whom Fett then hunts. Four \"Boba Fett\" comics set several years after \"Return of the Jedi\" were released between 1995 and 2000. Fett encounters Han Solo in the short story \"\" (1996), set 15 years after the events of the same film, and fights side by side with him in \"The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force\" (2003), set a decade later. He also appears in the e-novella \"Boba Fett: A Practical Man\", set 20 years after \"Jedi\". In the \"Legacy of the Force\" series (2006\u20132008), set some 35 years after \"Jedi\", Han and Leia's daughter, Jaina, asks Fett to train her to help her defeat her corrupted brother, Jacen.\nIn \"The Last One Standing\", Daniel Keys Moran developed a backstory for Fett in which he was once named Jaster Mereel, a \"Journeyman Protector\" lawman who was convicted of treason. His backstory was depicted differently in \"Attack of the Clones\", leading to the Dark Horse comic \"\" (2003) retconning Mereel to Jango's mentor. A young-adult book series called \"Boba Fett\" (2002\u20132004) depicts Fett's roots as a bounty hunter during the Clone Wars. He is guided by a book left to him by his father, whose ship and armor he has inherited, and begins working for Jabba the Hutt.\n\"The Bounty Hunter Wars\".\nThe Bounty Hunter Wars is a trilogy of novels by K. W. Jeter set during the events of the original trilogy. The books were published by Bantam Spectra in July 1998, November 1998, and July 1999, respectively. The trilogy depicts Fett as being more communicative than in the films because its plot requires Fett to show \"an ability to convince people as well as kill them\".\nThe first book, The Mandalorian Armor, starts during the events of \"Return of the Jedi\", shortly after Jabba's sail barge is destroyed. Dengar stays with Fett after the latter's near-death experience and encounters Neelah, a dancer in Jabba's palace who has lost her memory, and thinks Fett can help her. Kuat of Kuat, an Imperial executive, reviews footage from the Great Pit of Carkoon, leading him to suspect that Fett is still alive. It is related in flashbacks set between \"A New Hope\" and \"The Empire Strikes Back\" that Fett stole a bounty Bossk and Zuckuss was hunting on behalf of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After delivering the bounty, Fett accepted a contract to join the Bounty Hunters Guild to break it up. The Emperor met with Darth Vader and Prince Xizor, where the latter revealed that it was he who planned for Fett to join the guild to eliminate its weakest members, leaving only the best for the Empire to exploit.\nIn the second book, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Slave Ship, Fett abandons \"Slave I\" to avoid dispelling rumors of his death, and instead steals Bossk's ship. Riding along, Dengar tells Neelah about the split of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After Bossk killed his father, the guild split into two factions: one composed of the older members, and another composed of Bossk and other younger members. Prince Xizor placed an enormous bounty on a renegade stormtrooper who slaughtered his entire ship's crew. Fett, Bossk, and Zuckuss captured the trooper, but Fett jettisoned his partners in an escape pod.\nIn the third and final book, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Hard Merchandise, it is related that Fett tried to claim his bounty, but found Xizor waiting to kill him to tie up loose ends related to his plot. In an attack on the megalomaniacal prince, Kuat of Kuat had falsified some evidence implicating him in the murder of Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle. This information was on the renegade stormtrooper's ship (which is why Kuat wanted to make sure the bounty hunter was dead) but is retrieved by Fett in the present, as Neelah realizes she is from an elite Kuat family and stops her sinister sister from taking over the now-suicidal Imperial executive's shipyard.\n\"Boba Fett: A Practical Man\".\nBoba Fett: A Practical Man is an e-novella by Karen Traviss, which was published online in August 2006 by Del Rey Books. Set 20 years after the events of \"Return of the Jedi\", it focuses on what led Boba Fett and the Mandalorians to fend off the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaders in \"The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force\" (set a few months later).\nA Yuuzhan Vong named Nom Anor meets Fett on Mandalore and begins giving him and the Mandalorians directions to help their invasion. Fett plans to do as much damage to the invaders as possible, even as he pretends to help them. He instructs a pilot to deliver his plea for help to the New Republic, but with the Vong's next target still unwarned, the world falls without a fight.\nA Vong warrior asks Fett to assist in killing a Jedi; instead, Fett convinces the Jedi to deliver his message.\nThe Jedi returns and confirms that Fett has a deal: the Mandalorians will continue to masquerade as Vong mercenaries while passing intel to the Republic. Fett agrees to have a few of his best commandos train planetary militias to fight the Vong.\nUnproduced works.\nA planned live-action TV series developed by \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas before the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, under the working title \"Star Wars: Underworld\", would have featured Fett.\n\"Star Wars 1313\".\nThe canceled LucasArts video game \"Star Wars 1313\", announced at E3 2012, would have told the story of Boba Fett's career as a young adult bounty hunter between the prequel and original trilogies. Fett would have navigated past the scum of civilization in an underground area of Coruscant known as Level 1313. In 2013, as a result of Disney's acquisition of the franchise, all LucasArts projects then in production were shelved. In a December 2015 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy stated that the concept art for the game was \"unbelievable\" and that, along with \"Underworld\", it was \"something we're spending a lot of time looking at, poring through, discussing, and we may very well develop those things further\".\n\"Level 1313\" appears in \"Star Wars\" media such as \"The Clone Wars\", in which it is visited by Ahsoka Tano, and \"Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle\".\n\"The Clone Wars\" episodes.\nFett was to have appeared in more episodes of \"The Clone Wars\" before its cancellation. A series of Western-inspired episodes would have featured Fett teaming up with Cad Bane to rescue a child kidnapped by Tusken Raiders on Tatooine; Aurra Sing would have appeared as well. The story arc would have depicted Fett donning his Mandalorian armor for the first time, and ended with Bane blasting Fett in the head, creating the iconic dent in his helmet (an idea which came from George Lucas). Animatic footage of the climactic scene was shown at \"Star Wars\" Celebration.\nStandalone film.\nIn early 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the development of a \"Star Wars\" spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg, which \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported would focus on Boba Fett during the original trilogy. In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, but had left the project a year later due to creative differences with Kinberg, causing a teaser for the Fett film to be scrapped from \"Star Wars\" Celebration. In May 2018, it was reported that James Mangold had signed on to write and direct a Fett film, with Kinberg attached as producer and co-writer, but both Mangold and Kathleen Kennedy subsequently denied Mangold's involvement. In July, Daniel Keys Moran stated that Lucasfilm had considered adapting \"The Last One Standing\" into a film. By October, the Fett film was reportedly dead, with the studio instead focusing on \"The Mandalorian\". The Fett film was afterwards reported to have also featured the other bounty hunters from \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\nReception.\nBoba Fett is a \"cult figure\" and one of the most popular \"Star Wars\" characters. In 2008, Boba Fett was selected by \"Empire\" magazine as the 79th greatest movie character of all time, and he is included on \"Fandomania\"'s list of \"The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters\". IGN ranked Boba Fett as the eighth top \"Star Wars\" character, due to his status as a fan-favourite and cult following. He personifies \"danger and mystery\", and Susan Mayse calls Fett \"the unknowable \"Star Wars\" character\" who \"delivers mythic presence.\" Although Tom Bissell asserts that no one knows why Boba Fett has become so popular, nor cares why, both Lucas and Bulloch cite Fett's mysterious nature as reasons for his popularity. Bulloch, who has never fully understood the character's popularity, attributes it to the costume and the respect Fett garners from Darth Vader and Jabba the Hutt. Fett's addition to the Special Edition of \"A New Hope\" was criticized by \"Screen Rant\", which called it \"pointless fan service\".\nThe initial Boba Fett toy, more than Fett's actual film appearance, might be responsible for the character's popularity; Henry Jenkins suggests children's play helped the character \"take on a life of its own\". Moran said Vader's admonition specifically to Fett in \"The Empire Strikes Back\"\u2014\"No disintegrations\"\u2014gives Fett credibility; he was interested in Fett because the character is \"strong, silent, [and] brutal\". Jeter says that even when Fett appears passive, he conveys \"capability and ruthlessness\". Bissell credits Bulloch for giving Fett \"effortless authority\" in his first scene in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", using such nuances as cradling his blaster and slightly cocking his head. Fett's small role in the film may have made the character seem more intriguing. Logan, who was a Young Artist Award nominee for his portrayal of Fett, compares Fett to \"that boy in school who never talks\" and who attracts others' curiosity.\nBissell adds that Boba Fett, along with other minor characters like Darth Maul and Kyle Katarn, appeals to adolescent boys' \"images of themselves: essentially bad-ass but ... honorable about it.\" This tension and the absence of a clear \"evil nature\" (distinct from evil actions) offer Fett dramatic appeal. Furthermore, Fett \"is cool because he was designed to be cool\", presenting a \"wicked ambiguity\" akin to John Milton's portrayal of Satan in \"Paradise Lost\" and Iago in William Shakespeare's \"Othello\". Bissell compares Fett to Beowulf, Ahab, and Huckleberry Finn: characters \"too \"big\"\" for their original presentation, and apt for continued development in other stories. Moran finds Fett reminiscent of the Man with No Name.\nFett has been featured extensively in pop culture and parodies. Breckin Meyer provides his voice in various \"Robot Chicken\" . Nerdcore rapper MC Chris included a \"Star Wars\"-themed song titled \"Fett's Vette\" on his 2001 debut album. The creator of the Spartan helmets for the 2006 film \"300\" painted one of them to look like Fett's helmet.\nThe \"San Francisco Chronicle\" describes Boba Fett fans as \"among the most passionate\", and the character is important to \"Star Wars\" fan culture. Boba Fett's popular following before the character even appeared in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" influenced Damon Lindelof's interest in developing \"Lost\" across multiple media. Between filming \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\", Mark Hamill pitched the idea that Fett was Luke Skywalker's mother to George Lucas, which \"he didn't like\". In about 2000, a feminist campaigned online to have the character unmasked as a woman. Fan parodies include Boba Phat, a cosplay \"intergalactic booty hunter\" created by David James.\nIn \"The Clone Wars\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn Episode II, [Boba Fett] saw his father murdered by Mace Windu, however, he's still got a long way to go before he becomes the battered bounty hunter we know so well. Aurra's an influence, and not much of a nurturing parental figure \u2013 so that plays a part, as well. She preys on his weakness, on his desire for a family. It's pretty dysfunctional, and it sheds an interesting light on both Aurra and Boba. Ultimately, though, Boba's always been a mystery. As much as we reveal, we're not going to take the mystery away from his fans. Not knowing all the answers about Boba is part of what makes him so cool.\nDave Filoni, supervising director for \nIGN reviewer Eric Goldman rated the first episode 8.2/10 and the second 8.8/10, stating \"this was a very layered, exciting episode to end Season 2 on\", though he did not appreciate Boba Fett's limited dialogue. Bryan Young, a writer for \"The Huffington Post\" and Examiner.com, also disliked Fett's responses at the end of the episode when confronting Mace Windu: \"He says something incredibly whiny.\" Young does state, however, that \"[o]verall, this pair of episodes was a satisfying conclusion to season two, which really upped the game in this series in terms of animation, storytelling, and suspense.\" GalacticBinder.com's reviewer Chris Smith wrote, \"Lucasfilm delivers another exciting episode to finish off a tremendous second season.\" Adam Rosenberg writing in MTV Movies Blog discusses Boba Fett's return: \"He's going to have to be put through a lot more hell before he embraces his inner badass. I'll say though... he's off to a mighty good start with the dual blasters he wears on his belt. Sure, they're almost the size of his thighs, but hey... he's still just a kid.\"\nIn \"The Book of Boba Fett\".\nBoba Fett's character in the series has received mixed reviews, while Morrison's portrayal of Fett has been praised. Some have said that, without Morrison portraying Boba Fett, the series might have been a total disaster and that he is the only face that could have brought Fett back to life. \"Decider\"'s Megan O'Keefe wrote, \"Boba Fett is the least interesting character in \"The Book of Boba Fett\".\" Rich Knight from \"CinemaBlend\" stated that he used to not like Fett, but became interested in his character as he was the only one in the series who \"seems like an actual human being\". Chris Edwards of \"The Guardian\" said that Disney+ ruined one of the \"coolest and most mysterious characters\" in \"Star Wars\".\nMerchandising.\nFett is one of the top five best-selling \"Star Wars\" action figures, and Boba Fett-related products are \"among the most expensive\" \"Star Wars\" merchandise. Fett was the first new mail-away action figure created for \"The Empire Strikes Back\"; although advertised as having a rocket-firing backpack, safety concerns led Kenner to sell his rocket attached. Gray called the early toy \"a rare and precious commodity\", and one of the rocket-firing prototypes sold at auction for $16,000 in 2003. In 2018 and 2019, two of the prototypes were sold at auction, for \u00a369,000 ($USD92,000) and \u00a390,000 ($USD120,000), respectively\u2014each setting the world record for the highest auction price of a \"Star Wars\" toy at that time. A fully painted figure with a rare variant on the firing mechanism is planned to be auctioned and estimated to be worth $200,000. In 2024, one of the only two existing hand painted missile firing bounty hunter Boba Fett action figures was sold for record breaking $525,000 at Heritage Auctions.\nIn August 2009, Hasbro released a Fett action figure based on McQuarrie's white-armored concept, and Boba Fett as both a child and bounty hunter have been made into Lego minifigures and a helmet statue of Fett in his armor. Wizards of the Coast's \"Star Wars Trading Card Game\" includes several Boba Fett cards. Hallmark Cards created a Boba Fett Christmas tree ornament.\nIn January 2015, an unopened Boba Fett figure sold for \u00a318,000 at auction in the UK, the figure was in factory-fresh condition and did not have the packaging punched for hanging in a shop.\nIn mid-2021, Lego released a \"Slave I\" set, replacing the ship's name with \"Boba Fett's Starship\". According to the design director of Lego \"Star Wars\", the \"Slave I\" name \"is just something that Disney doesn't want to use anymore\". This prompted some backlash from fans, including Mark Austin, who portrays Fett in the Special Edition of \"A New Hope\". While the ship was not canonically renamed, Disney is likely merely avoiding slavery-related terms in merchandise. In a press release for variant covers for Marvel's \"War of the Bounty Hunters\", the ship is referred to as \"Firespray\", a reference to the ship's fictional class.\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The southernmost member of the Austronesian language family, it is related to Cook Islands M\u0101ori, Tuamotuan, and Tahitian. The M\u0101ori Language Act 1987 gave the language recognition as one of New Zealand's official languages. There are regional dialects of the M\u0101ori language.\nPrior to contact with Europeans, M\u0101ori lacked a written language or script. Written M\u0101ori now uses the Latin script, which was adopted and the spelling standardised by Northern M\u0101ori in collaboration with English Protestant clergy in the 19th century.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, European children in rural areas spoke M\u0101ori with M\u0101ori children. It was common for prominent parents of these children, such as government officials, to use M\u0101ori in the community. M\u0101ori declined due to the increase of the European population and government-imposed educational policies; by the early 20th century its use was banned in school playgrounds and classrooms across the country. The number of speakers fell sharply after 1945, but a M\u0101ori language revival movement began in the late 20th century and slowed the decline. The M\u0101ori protest movement and the M\u0101ori renaissance of the 1970s caused greater social awareness of and support for the language.\nThe 2018 New Zealand census reported that about 190,000 people, or 4% of the population, could hold an everyday conversation in M\u0101ori. As of 2015[ [update]], 55% of M\u0101ori adults reported some knowledge of the language; of these, 64% use M\u0101ori at home and around 50,000 people can speak the language \"well\". As of 2023, around 7% of New Zealand primary and secondary school students are taught fully or partially in M\u0101ori, and another 24% learn M\u0101ori as an additional language.\nIn M\u0101ori culture, the language is considered to be among the greatest of all , or cultural treasures. M\u0101ori is known for its metaphorical poetry and prose, often in the form of , , and , and in performing arts such as , , and .\nName.\nThe English word \"Maori\" is a borrowing from the M\u0101ori language, where it is spelled . In New Zealand, the M\u0101ori language is often referred to as (\"the language\"), short for (\"the M\u0101ori language\").\nThe M\u0101ori-language spelling \u27e8M\u0101ori\u27e9 (with a macron) has become common in New Zealand English in recent years, particularly in M\u0101ori-specific cultural contexts, although the traditional macron-less English spelling is still sometimes seen in general media and government use.\nPreferred and alternative pronunciations in English vary by dictionary, with being most frequent today, and , , and also given, while the 'r' is always a voiced alveolar flap.\nOfficial status.\nNew Zealand has two \"de jure\" official languages: M\u0101ori and New Zealand Sign Language, whereas English acts as a \"de facto\" official language. gained its official status with the passing of the M\u0101ori Language Act 1987.\nMost government departments and agencies have bilingual names\u2014for example, the Department of Internal Affairs is alternatively \u2014and places such as local government offices and public libraries display bilingual signs and use bilingual stationery; some government services now even use the M\u0101ori version solely as the official name. Personal dealings with government agencies may be conducted in M\u0101ori, but in practice, this almost always requires interpreters, restricting its everyday use to the limited geographical areas of high M\u0101ori fluency, and to more formal occasions, such as during public consultation. An interpreter is on hand at sessions of the New Zealand Parliament for instances when a member wishes to speak in M\u0101ori. M\u0101ori may be spoken in judicial proceedings, but any party wishing to do so must notify the court in advance to ensure an interpreter is available. Failure to notify in advance does not preclude the party speaking in M\u0101ori, but the court must be adjourned until an interpreter is available and the party may be held liable for the costs of the delay.\nA 1994 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (then New Zealand's highest court) held the Government responsible under the Treaty of Waitangi (1840) for the preservation of the language. Accordingly, since March 2004, the state has funded M\u0101ori Television, broadcast partly in M\u0101ori. On 28 March 2008, M\u0101ori Television launched its second channel, , broadcast entirely in the M\u0101ori language, with no advertising or subtitles. The first M\u0101ori TV channel, Aotearoa Television Network (ATN) was available to viewers in the Auckland region from 1996 but lasted for only one year.\nIn 2008, Land Information New Zealand published the first list of official place names with macrons. Previous place name lists were derived from computer systems (usually mapping and geographic information systems) that could not handle macrons.\nPolitical dimensions.\nThe official status of M\u0101ori, and especially its use in official names and titles, is a political issue in New Zealand. In 2022 a 70,000 strong petition from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori went to Parliament calling for New Zealand to be officially renamed Aotearoa, and was accepted for debate by the M\u0101ori Affairs select committee. During New Zealand First's successful campaign to return to Parliament in 2023, party leader Winston Peters ridiculed the proposal as \"ideological mumbo jumbo\" and criticised the use of the name in government reports. Peters promised his party would remove M\u0101ori names from government departments, saying \"Te Whatu Ora, excuse me, I don't want to speak the M\u0101ori language when I go to hospital.\" As part of its coalition agreement with New Zealand First, the National-led government agreed to ensure all public service departments had their primary name in English except for those specifically related to M\u0101ori.\nIn 2025, Radio New Zealand reported that education minister Erica Stanford had decided the previous year to exclude most M\u0101ori words from the Education Ministry's \"Ready to Read Phonics Plus\" series. Stanford said that the decision only affected 12 books within the series and that 27 books with M\u0101ori words would be reprinted. The decision was described as \"over-reach\" by the New Zealand Principals' Federation and sharply criticised as an \"act of racism\" by writers and publishers.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAccording to legend, M\u0101ori came to New Zealand from Hawaiki. Current anthropological thinking places their origin in eastern Polynesia, mostly likely from the Southern Cook or Society Islands region (see ), and says that they arrived by deliberate voyages in seagoing canoes, possibly double-hulled, and probably sail-rigged. These settlers probably arrived by AD 1350 at the latest.\nM\u0101ori evolved in isolation from other sister Polynesian languages adapting to New Zealand's unique geographical features and temperate climate (including presence of snow and loss of tropical floral inventory). Six dialectal variations emerged among iwi due to further internal geographical separation. The language had no written form, but historian Sarah J. K. Gallagher has argued that t\u0101 moko, the indigenous art of tattooing, is arguably \"a pre-European textual culture in New Zealand... as the Moko can be read, it can be accepted as a form of communication\". The idea that t\u0101 moko is a written language of sorts has been discussed before.\nSince its origin, the M\u0101ori language has been rich in metaphorical poetry and prose. Forms of this include karakia, whaik\u014drero, whakapapa and karanga, and in performing arts such as m\u014dteatea, waiata and haka. Karakia are M\u0101ori incantations used to invoke spiritual guidance and protection, and are used before eating or gathering, to increase spiritual goodwill and to declare things officially open. Whaik\u014drero is the term given to traditional oratory given on marae, and whakapapa is the story of one's ancestry. According to historian Atholl Anderson, whakapapa used \"mnemonic devices, repetitive patterns [and] rhyme\" to leave a lasting impression. \"Casting knowledge in formulaic or other standarised story forms... helped to fix the information in the minds of speakers and listeners\".\nEuropean contact.\nMissionaries learned to speak M\u0101ori, and introduced the Latin alphabet to M\u0101ori. The Church Mission Society (CMS), including Thomas Kendall; M\u0101ori, including T\u012btore and Hongi Hika; and Cambridge University's Samuel Lee, developed the written form of the language between 1817 and 1830. In 1833, while living in the Paihia mission-house of Anglican priest and the now head of the New Zealand CMS mission, Rev Henry Williams, missioner William Colenso published M\u0101ori translations including parts of books of the Bible, the first books printed in New Zealand. Colenso's 1837 M\u0101ori New Testament was the first indigenous-language translation of the Bible published in the southern hemisphere. Demand for the M\u0101ori New Testament, and for the Prayer Book that followed, grew exponentially, as did Christian M\u0101ori leadership and public Christian services, with 33,000 M\u0101ori soon attending regularly. Literacy and understanding the Bible increased and social and economic benefits. Worship took place in M\u0101ori; it functioned as the language of M\u0101ori homes; M\u0101ori politicians conducted political meetings in M\u0101ori; and some literature appeared in M\u0101ori, along with many newspapers. Before 1880, some M\u0101ori parliamentarians suffered disadvantages because parliamentary proceedings took place in English. However, by 1900, all M\u0101ori members of parliament, such as \u0100pirana Ngata, were university graduates who spoke fluent English.\nSuppression and decline.\nEfforts to culturally assimilate M\u0101ori into European society began in the 19th century. This included policies to educate M\u0101ori based on the English school system, with steps taken that increasingly promoted English as the sole language of use in schools. These adversely affected the use of the Maori language by Maori children. The Education Ordinance Act 1847 set English as the predominant language of schools. This was followed in 1880 by the Native Schools Code, which placed further restrictions on the use of M\u0101ori, establishing the expectation that teachers would have some knowledge of the language solely for the purpose of teaching English to younger pupils. Further restrictions on M\u0101ori followed, to the point that in the early twentieth century, children were forbidden to speak it in the classroom or playground, under penalty of corporal punishment. In recent years, prominent M\u0101ori have spoken with sadness about their experiences or experiences of their family members being caned, strapped or beaten in school.\nIn many cases these policies were accepted or even encouraged by parents who wanted their children to succeed in the P\u0101keh\u0101 world around them; however, it remained government policy to educate M\u0101ori in manual trades rather than academic professions until the mid-twentieth century. Proposals in 1930 to introduce M\u0101ori to the curriculum were blocked on the grounds that the purpose of education was to \"lead the M\u0101ori lad to be a good farmer and the M\u0101ori girl to be a good farmer's wife\".\nMost M\u0101ori people continued to speak M\u0101ori as their first language until World War II. The number of speakers of M\u0101ori began to decline rapidly with the migration of M\u0101ori to urban areas after the war (the urban M\u0101ori). By the 1980s, fewer than 20 per cent of M\u0101ori spoke the language well enough to be classed as native speakers. Even many of those people no longer spoke M\u0101ori in their homes. As a result, many M\u0101ori children failed to learn their ancestral language, and generations of non-M\u0101ori-speaking M\u0101ori emerged.\nIn 1984, Naida Glavish, a tolls operator, was demoted for using the M\u0101ori greeting \"\" with customers. The \"Kia Ora Incident\" was the subject of public and political scrutiny before having her job reinstated by Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, and became a major symbol of long-standing linguicism in New Zealand.\nRevitalisation efforts.\nBy the 1950s some M\u0101ori leaders had begun to recognise the dangers of the loss of . By the 1970s there were many strategies used to save the language. This included M\u0101ori-language revitalisation programs such as the K\u014dhanga Reo movement, which from 1982 immersed infants in M\u0101ori from infancy to school age. There followed in 1985 the founding of the first Kura Kaupapa M\u0101ori (Years 1 to 8 M\u0101ori-medium education programme) and later the first Wharekura (Years 9 to 13 M\u0101ori-medium education programme). In 2011 it was reported that although \"there was a true revival of te reo in the 1980s and early to mid-1990s\u00a0... spurred on by the realisation of how few speakers were left, and by the relative abundance of older fluent speakers in both urban neighbourhoods and rural communities\", the language has continued to decline.\" The decline is believed \"to have several underlying causes\". These include:\nBased on the principles of partnership, M\u0101ori-speaking government, general revitalisation and dialectal protective policy, and adequate resourcing, the Waitangi Tribunal has recommended \"four fundamental changes\":\nThe changes set forth by the Tribunal are merely recommendations; they are not binding upon government.\nThere is, however, evidence that the revitalisation efforts are taking hold, as can be seen in the teaching of in the school curriculum, the use of M\u0101ori as an instructional language, and the supportive ideologies surrounding these efforts. In 2014, a survey of students ranging in age from 18 to 24 was conducted; the students were of mixed ethnic backgrounds, ranging from to M\u0101ori who lived in New Zealand. This survey showed a 62% response saying that was at risk. Albury argues that these results come from the language either not being used enough in common discourse, or from the fact that the number of speakers was inadequate for future language development.\nThe policies for language revitalisation have been changing in attempts to improve M\u0101ori language use and have been working with suggestions from the Waitangi Tribunal on the best ways to implement the revitalisation. The Waitangi Tribunal in 2011 identified a suggestion for language revitalisation that would shift indigenous policies from the central government to the preferences and ideologies of the M\u0101ori people. This change recognises the issue of M\u0101ori revitalisation as one of indigenous self-determination, instead of the job of the government to identify what would be best for the language and M\u0101ori people of New Zealand.\nRevival since 2015.\nBeginning in about 2015, the M\u0101ori language underwent a revival as it became increasingly popular, as a common national heritage and shared cultural identity, even among New Zealanders without M\u0101ori roots. Surveys from 2018 indicated that \"the M\u0101ori language currently enjoys a high status in M\u0101ori society and also positive acceptance by the majority of non-M\u0101ori New Zealanders\".\nAs the status and prestige of the language rose, so did the demand for language classes. Businesses, including Google, Microsoft, Vodafone NZ and Fletcher Building, were quick to adopt the trend as it became apparent that using made customers think of a company as \"committed to New Zealand\". The language became increasingly heard in the media and in politics. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2014who gave her daughter a M\u0101ori middle name, and said she would learn both M\u0101ori and English\u2014made headlines when she toasted Commonwealth leaders in 2018 with a M\u0101ori proverb, and the success of M\u0101ori musical groups such as Alien Weaponry and Maimoa further increased the language's presence in social media. Since 2017, a selected number of Disney movies have received a dubbing in M\u0101ori, the first having been \"Moana\".\nIn August 2017, Rotorua became the first city in New Zealand to declare itself as bilingual in the M\u0101ori and English languages, meaning that both languages would be promoted. In 2019, the New Zealand government launched the \"Maihi Karauna\" M\u0101ori language revitalisation strategy with a goal of 1 million people speaking by 2040. Also in 2019, Kotahi Rau Pukapuka Trust and Auckland University Press began work on publishing a sizeable library of local and international literature in the language, including the Harry Potter books.\nSome New Zealanders have pushed against the revival, debating the replacement of English-language place names with original M\u0101ori names, criticising a police car having M\u0101ori language and graphics, and complaining about being used by broadcasters. In March 2021, the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) said it would no longer entertain complaints regarding the use of the M\u0101ori language in broadcasts. This followed a fivefold increase in complaints to the BSA. The use of M\u0101ori in itself does not breach any broadcasting standards.\nLinguistic classification.\nComparative linguists classify M\u0101ori as a Polynesian language, specifically as an Eastern Polynesian language belonging to the Tahitic subgroup, which includes Cook Islands M\u0101ori, spoken in the southern Cook Islands, and Tahitian, spoken in Tahiti and the Society Islands. Other major Eastern Polynesian languages include Hawaiian, Marquesan (languages in the Marquesic subgroup), and the Rapa Nui language of Easter Island.\nWhile the preceding are all distinct languages, they remain similar enough that Tupaia, a Tahitian travelling with Captain James Cook in 1769\u20131770, communicated effectively with M\u0101ori. Hawaiian newspaper \"Ka Nupepa Kuokoa\" in 1911 covering Ernest Ka\u02bbai and his Royal Hawaiians' band tour of New Zealand reported that Ka\u02bbai himself wrote to them about the band able to communicate with M\u0101ori while visiting their rural maraes. M\u0101ori actors, travelling to Easter Island for production of the film noticed a marked similarity between the native tongues, as did arts curator Reuben Friend, who noted that it took only a short time to pick up any different vocabulary and the different nuances to recognisable words. Speakers of modern M\u0101ori generally report that they find the languages of the Cook Islands, including Rarotongan, the easiest among the other Polynesian languages to understand and converse in.\nGeographic distribution.\nNearly all speakers are ethnic M\u0101ori residents of New Zealand. Estimates of the number of speakers vary: the 1996 census reported 160,000, while a 1995 national survey reported about 10,000 \"very fluent\" adult speakers.\nAs reported in the 2013 national census, only 21.3% of self-identified M\u0101ori had a conversational knowledge of the language, and only around 6.5% of those speakers, 1.4% of the total M\u0101ori population, spoke the M\u0101ori language only. This percentage has been in decline in recent years, from around a quarter of the population to 21%. In the same census, M\u0101ori speakers were 3.7% of the total population.\nThe level of competence of self-professed M\u0101ori speakers varies from minimal to total. Statistics have not been gathered for the prevalence of different levels of competence. Only a minority of self-professed speakers use M\u0101ori as their main language at home. The rest use only a few words or phrases (passive bilingualism).\nM\u0101ori still[ [update]] is a community language in some predominantly M\u0101ori settlements in the Northland, Urewera and East Cape areas. M\u0101ori-immersion kindergartens throughout New Zealand use M\u0101ori exclusively.\nUrbanisation after the Second World War led to widespread language shift from M\u0101ori predominance (with M\u0101ori the primary language of the rural ) to English predominance (English serving as the primary language in the cities). Therefore, M\u0101ori speakers almost always communicate bilingually, with New Zealand English as either their first or second language. Only around 9,000 people speak only in M\u0101ori.\nIn the 2023 school year, around 7.2% of primary and secondary school students in New Zealand were taught fully or partially in M\u0101ori. An additional 24.4% were formally taught M\u0101ori as an additional language, and 37.1% were taught M\u0101ori informally. However, very few students pass through the New Zealand education system without any M\u0101ori language education. For example, only 2.1% of students in Year 1 (aged 5) did not receive any M\u0101ori language education in 2023.\nThe use of the M\u0101ori language in the M\u0101ori diaspora is far lower than in New Zealand itself. Census data from Australia show it as the home language of 11,747, just 8.2% of the total Australian M\u0101ori population in 2016.\nOrthography.\nThe modern M\u0101ori alphabet has 15 letters, two of which are digraphs (character pairs). The five vowels have both short and long forms, with the long forms denoted by macrons marked above them.\nThe order of the alphabet is as follows: A, E, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, R, T, U, W, Ng, Wh.\nThis standard orthography may be tweaked to represent certain dialects of M\u0101ori:\nHistory.\nThere was originally no native writing system for M\u0101ori. It has been suggested that the petroglyphs once used by the M\u0101ori developed into a script similar to the Rongorongo of Easter Island. However, there is no evidence that these petroglyphs ever evolved into a true system of writing. Some distinctive markings among the (rafter paintings) of meeting houses were used as mnemonics in reciting (genealogy) but again, there was no systematic relation between marks and meanings.\nAttempts to write M\u0101ori words using the Latin script began with Captain James Cook and other early explorers, with varying degrees of success. Consonants seem to have caused the most difficulty, but medial and final vowels are often missing in early sources. Anne Salmond records \"aghee\" for aki (in the year 1773, from the North Island East Coast, p.\u00a098), \"Toogee\" and \"E tanga roak\" for Tuki and Tangaroa (1793, Northland, p.\u00a0216), \"Kokramea\", \"Kakramea\" for Kakaramea (1801, Hauraki, p.\u00a0261), \"toges\" for tokis, \"Wannugu\" for Uenuku and \"gumera\" for kumara (1801, Hauraki, pp.\u00a0261, 266 and 269), \"Weygate\" for Waikato (1801, Hauraki, p.\u00a0277), \"Bunga Bunga\" for pungapunga, for tupua and \"gure\" for kur\u012b (1801, Hauraki, p.\u00a0279), as well as \"Tabooha\" for Te Puhi (1823, Northern Northland, p.\u00a0385).\nFrom 1814, missionaries tried to define the sounds of the language. Thomas Kendall published a book in 1815 entitled \"A korao no New Zealand\", which in modern orthography and usage would be . Beginning in 1817, professor Samuel Lee of Cambridge University worked with the Ng\u0101puhi chief T\u012btore and his junior relative Tui (also known as Tuhi or Tupaea), and then with chief Hongi Hika and his junior relative Waikato; they established a definitive orthography based on Northern usage, published as the \"First Grammar and Vocabulary of the New Zealand Language\" (1820). The missionaries of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) did not have a high regard for this book. By 1830 the CMS missionaries had revised the orthography for writing the M\u0101ori language; for example, \"Kiddeekiddee\" was changed to the modern spelling, \"Kerikeri\".\nThe M\u0101ori embraced literacy enthusiastically, and missionaries reported in the 1820s that M\u0101ori all over the country taught each other to read and write, using sometimes quite innovative materials in the absence of paper, such as leaves and charcoal, and flax. Missionary James West Stack recorded the scarcity of slates and writing materials at the native schools and the use sometimes of \"pieces of board on which sand was sprinkled, and the letters traced upon the sand with a pointed stick\".\nLong vowels.\nThe alphabet devised at Cambridge University does not mark vowel length. The examples in the following table show that vowel length is phonemic in M\u0101ori.\nM\u0101ori devised ways to mark vowel length, sporadically at first. Occasional and inconsistent vowel-length markings occur in 19th-century manuscripts and newspapers written by M\u0101ori, including macron-like diacritics and doubling of letters. M\u0101ori writer Hare Hongi (Henry Stowell) used macrons in his \"Maori-English Tutor and Vade Mecum\" of 1911, as does Sir \u0100pirana Ngata (albeit inconsistently) in his \"Maori Grammar and Conversation\" (7th printing 1953). Once the M\u0101ori language was taught in universities in the 1960s, vowel-length marking was made systematic. Bruce Biggs, of Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto descent and professor at the University of Auckland, promoted the use of double vowels (e.g. \"waahine\"); this style was standard at the university until Biggs died in 2000.\nMacrons () are now the standard means of indicating long vowels, after becoming the favoured option of the M\u0101ori Language Commission\u2014set up by the M\u0101ori Language Act 1987 to act as the authority for M\u0101ori spelling and orthography. Most news media now use macrons; Stuff websites and newspapers since 2017, TVNZ and NZME websites and newspapers since 2018.\nTechnical limitations in producing macronised vowels are sometimes resolved by using a diaeresis or circumflex instead of a macron (e.g., w\u00e4hine or w\u00e2hine). In other cases, it is resolved by omitting the macron all together (e.g. wahine).\nDouble vowels continue to be used in a few exceptional cases, including:\nPhonology.\nM\u0101ori has five phonemically distinct vowel articulations, and ten consonant phonemes.\nVowels.\nAlthough it is commonly claimed that vowel realisations (pronunciations) in M\u0101ori show little variation, linguistic research has shown this not to be the case.\nVowel length is phonemic, but four of the five long vowels occur in only a handful of word roots, the exception being . As noted above, it has recently become standard in M\u0101ori spelling to indicate a long vowel with a macron. For older speakers, long vowels tend to be more peripheral and short vowels more centralised, especially with the low vowel, which is long but short . For younger speakers, they are both . For older speakers, is only fronted after ; elsewhere it is . For younger speakers, it is fronted everywhere, as with the corresponding phoneme in New Zealand English. Due to the influence of New Zealand English, the vowel [e] is raised to be near [i], so that \"p\u012b\" and \"k\u0113\" (or \"piki\" and \"kete\") now largely share the very same vowel space.\nBeside monophthongs M\u0101ori has many diphthong vowel phonemes. Although any short vowel combinations are possible, researchers disagree on which combinations constitute diphthongs. Formant frequency analysis distinguish as diphthongs.\nAs in many other Polynesian languages, diphthongs in M\u0101ori vary only slightly from sequences of adjacent vowels, except that they belong to the same syllable, and all or nearly all sequences of nonidentical vowels are possible. All sequences of nonidentical short vowels occur and are phonemically distinct.\nConsonants.\nThe consonant phonemes of M\u0101ori are listed in the following table. Seven of the ten M\u0101ori consonant letters have the same pronunciation as they do in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For those that do not, the IPA phonetic transcription is included, enclosed in square brackets per IPA convention.\nThe pronunciation of \u27e8wh\u27e9 is extremely variable, but its most common pronunciation (its canonical allophone) is the labiodental fricative, IPA (as in the English word \"fill\"). Another allophone is the voiceless bilabial fricative, IPA , which is usually supposed to be the sole pre-European pronunciation, although linguists are not sure of the truth of this supposition. At least until the 1930s, the bilabial fricative was considered to be the correct pronunciation. The fact that English \u27e8f\u27e9 gets substituted by \u27e8p\u27e9 and not \u27e8wh\u27e9 in borrowings (for example, English \"February\" becomes instead of \"*Wh\u0113puere\") would strongly hint that the M\u0101ori did not perceive English to be the same sound as their \u27e8wh\u27e9.\nBecause English stops primarily have aspiration, speakers of English often hear the M\u0101ori nonaspirated stops as English . However, younger M\u0101ori speakers tend to aspirate as in English. English speakers also tend to hear M\u0101ori as English in certain positions (cf. Japanese r).\n can come at the beginning of a word (like 'sing-along' without the \"si\"), which may be difficult for English speakers outside of New Zealand to manage.\nIn some western areas of the North Island, \u27e8h\u27e9 is pronounced as a glottal stop instead of , and the digraph \u27e8wh\u27e9 is pronounced as instead of or .\n is typically a flap, especially before . However, elsewhere it is sometimes trilled.\nIn borrowings from English, many consonants are substituted by the nearest available M\u0101ori consonant. For example, the English affricates and , and the fricative are replaced by , becomes /, and becomes (the is sometimes retained in the southern dialect, as noted below).\nSyllables and phonotactics.\nSyllables in M\u0101ori have one of the following forms: V, VV, CV, CVV. This set of four can be summarised by the notation, , in which the segments in parentheses may or may not be present. A syllable cannot begin with two consonant sounds (the digraphs &lt;ng&gt; and &lt;wh&gt; represent single consonant sounds), and cannot end in a consonant, although some speakers may occasionally devoice a final vowel. All possible CV combinations are grammatical, though \"wo\", \"who\", \"wu\", and \"whu\" occur only in a few loanwords from English such as , \"wool\" and , \"football\".\nAs in many other Polynesian languages, e.g., Hawaiian, the rendering of loanwords from English includes representing every English consonant of the loanword (using the native consonant inventory; English has 24 consonants to 10 for M\u0101ori) and breaking up consonant clusters. For example: \"Presbyterian\" has been borrowed as \"Perehipeteriana\"; no consonant position in the loanword has been deleted, but and have been replaced with and , respectively.\nOnly one acquired couplet is prioritised whenever possible, based on perceived strength of consonants. \"Treaty\" is , but \"tiriti\" also yields a homonym that means \"street\" with an emphasis on the stronger . from \"captain\" follows a similar pattern following the stronger . Medial nasal consonants like succeeded by a final consonant are also reduced this way: the \"an\" in English \"bank\" for example is reduced to the approximant with another as the supporting vowel which merges to elongate as hence \"p\u0113ke\" (or formerly written as \u27e8peeke\u27e9).\nStress is typically within the last four vowels of a word, with long vowels and diphthongs counting double. That is, on the last four moras. However, stressed moras are longer than unstressed moras, so the word does not have the precision in M\u0101ori that it does in some other languages. It falls preferentially on the first long vowel, on the first diphthong if there is no long vowel (though for some speakers never a final diphthong), and on the first syllable otherwise. Compound words (such as names) may have a stressed syllable in each component word. In long sentences, the final syllable before a pause may have a stress in preference to the normal stressed syllable.\nDialects.\nBiggs proposed that historically there were two major dialect groups, North Island and South Island, and that South Island M\u0101ori is extinct. Biggs has analysed North Island M\u0101ori as comprising a western group and an eastern group with the boundary between them running pretty much along the island's north\u2013south axis.\nWithin these broad divisions regional variations occur, and individual regions show tribal variations. The major differences occur in the pronunciation of words, variation of vocabulary, and idiom. A fluent speaker of M\u0101ori has no problem understanding other dialects.\nThere is no significant variation in grammar between dialects. \"Most of the tribal variation in grammar is a matter of preferences: speakers of one area might prefer one grammatical form to another, but are likely on occasion to use the non-preferred form, and at least to recognise and understand it.\" Vocabulary and pronunciation vary to a greater extent, but this does not pose barriers to communication.\nNorthern dialects.\nIn the northern dialects, particularly in Muriwhenua and parts of Ng\u0101puhi, the digraph \"wh\" is not pronounced as \u27e8f\u27e9, as it is in most of the other dialects, but as a voiceless bilabial fricative \u27e8\u0278\u27e9. Some speakers also reduce this sound to \u27e8h\u27e9, particularly in words beginning with the causative prefix \"whaka-\" (e.g. \"whakarongo\"), leading to the pronunciation being heard as \"haka-\" (e.g. \"hakarongo\" or \"'hakarongo\").\nSpeakers of the northern dialect, like other dialects, also have preferences for specific renderings of words (e.g. \"k\u0101hore\" instead of \"k\u0101ore\", \"kaurua/kourua\" instead of \"k\u014drua\", etc.), or entirely unique words (e.g. \"k\u016bkupa\" instead of \"kerer\u016b\", \"whareiti\" instead of \"wharepaku\", etc.)\nEastern and western dialects.\nIn the southwest of the North Island, in the Whanganui and Taranaki regions, the phoneme \u27e8h\u27e9 is a glottal stop and the phoneme \u27e8wh\u27e9 is . This difference was the subject of considerable debate during the 1990s and 2000s over the then-proposed change of the name of the city Wanganui to Whanganui.\nIn T\u016bhoe and the Eastern Bay of Plenty (northeastern North Island) \u27e8ng\u27e9 has merged with \u27e8n\u27e9.\nSpeakers in Waikato\u2013Tainui, also have preferences for renderings of words (e.g. \"ng\u0113tehi\", \"ng\u0101na\" and \"ng\u0113n\u0101\" instead of \"\u0113tahi\", \"\u0101na\" or \"\u0113n\u0101\". \"P\u0113whea\" and \"K\u014dwhatu\" instead of \"p\u0113hea\" and \"p\u014dhatu\".)\nSouthern dialects.\nIn South Island dialects, \"ng\" merged into \"k\" in many regions. Thus \"K\u0101i Tahu\" and \"Ng\u0101i Tahu\" are variations in the name of the same iwi (the latter form is the one used in Acts of Parliament). Since 2000, the government has altered the official names of several southern place names to the southern dialect forms by replacing \"ng\" with \"k\". New Zealand's highest mountain, known for centuries as in southern M\u0101ori dialects that merge \"ng\" with \"k\", and as by other M\u0101ori, was later named \"Mount Cook\". Now its sole official name is \"Aoraki / Mount Cook\", which favours the local dialect form. Similarly, the M\u0101ori name for Stewart Island, , is cognate with the name of the Canterbury town of Rangiora. Likewise, Dunedin's main research library, the Hocken Collections, has the name rather than the northern (standard) . Maarire Goodall and George Griffiths say there is also a voicing of \"k\" to \"g\", which explains why the region of Otago (southern dialect) and the settlement it is named after \u2013 Otakou (standard M\u0101ori) \u2013 vary in spelling (the pronunciation of the latter having changed over time to accommodate the northern spelling).\nThe standard M\u0101ori \"r\" is also found occasionally changed to an \"l\" in these southern dialects and the \"wh\" to \"w\". These changes are most commonly found in place names, such as Lake Waihola, and the nearby coastal settlement of Wangaloa (which would, in standard M\u0101ori, be rendered ), and Little Akaloa, on Banks Peninsula. Goodall and Griffiths suggest that final vowels are given a centralised pronunciation as schwa or that they are elided (pronounced indistinctly or not at all), resulting in such seemingly bastardised place names as The Kilmog, which in standard M\u0101ori would have been rendered , but which in southern dialect would have been pronounced very much as the current name suggests. This same elision is found in numerous other southern placenames, such as the two small settlements called The Kaik (from the term for a fishing village, in standard M\u0101ori), near Palmerston and Akaroa, and the early spelling of Lake Wakatipu as . In standard M\u0101ori, Wakatipu would have been rendered , showing further the elision of a final vowel.\nDespite the dialect being officially regarded as extinct, its use in signage and official documentation is encouraged by many government and educational agencies in Otago and Southland.\nGrammar and syntax.\nM\u0101ori has mostly a verb-subject-object (VSO) word order. It is also analytical, featuring almost no inflection, and makes extensive use of grammatical particles to indicate grammatical categories of tense, mood, aspect, case, topicalisation, among others. The personal pronouns have a distinction in clusivity, singular, dual and plural numbers, and the genitive pronouns have different classes (\"a\" class, \"o\" class and neutral) according to whether the possession is alienable or the possessor has control of the relationship (\"a\" category), or the possession is inalienable or the possessor has no control over the relationship (\"o\" category), and a third neutral class that only occurs for singular pronouns and must be followed by a noun. There is also subject-object-verb (SOV) word order used in agent emphatic sentences. Examples of this include \"N\u0101ku te ngohi i tunu\" (\"I cooked the fish\"; literally \"I the fish cooked\") and \"M\u0101 wai te haka e kaea?\" (\"Who will lead the haka?\"). Agent emphatic sentences can also take the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. In this order the example sentences would be rendered as \"N\u0101ku i tunu te ngohi\" and \"M\u0101 wai e kaea te haka?\"\nBases.\nBiggs (1998) developed an analysis that the basic unit of M\u0101ori speech is the phrase rather than the word. The lexical word forms the \"base\" of the phrase. Biggs identifies five types of bases.\nNoun bases include those bases that can take a definite article, but cannot occur as the nucleus of a verbal phrase; for example: (fish) or (tree). Plurality is marked by various means, including the definite article (singular , plural ), deictic particles (that tree), (those trees), possessives (my house), (my houses). A few nouns lengthen a vowel in the plural, such as (woman); (women). In general, bases used as qualifiers follow the base they qualify, e.g. \"matua wahine\" (mother, female elder) from \"matua\" (parent, elder) \"wahine\" (woman).\nUniversal bases are verbs which can be used passively. When used passively, these verbs take a passive form. Biggs gives three examples of universals in their passive form: (drunk), (wept for), and (said).\nStative bases serve as bases usable as verbs but not available for passive use, such as \"ora\", alive or \"tika\", correct. Grammars generally refer to them as \"stative verbs\". When used in sentences, statives require different syntax than other verb-like bases.\nLocative bases can follow the locative particle \"ki\" (to, towards) directly, such as \"runga\", above, \"waho\", outside, and placenames (\"ki Tamaki\", to Auckland).\nPersonal bases take the personal article \"a\" after \"ki\", such as names of people (\"ki a Hohepa\", to Joseph), personified houses, personal pronouns, \"wai?\" who? and \"mea\", so-and-so.\nParticles.\nLike all other Polynesian languages, M\u0101ori has a rich array of particles, which include verbal particles, pronouns, locative particles, articles and possessives.\nVerbal particles indicate aspectual, tense-related or modal properties of the verb which they relate to. They include:\nLocative particles (prepositions) refer to position in time and/or space, and include:\nPossessives fall into one of two classes of prepositions marked by \"a\" and \"o\", depending on the dominant versus subordinate relationship between possessor and possessed: \"ng\u0101 tamariki a te matua\", the children of the parent but \"te matua o ng\u0101 tamariki\", the parent of the children.\nDeterminers.\nArticles.\nThe definite articles are (singular) and (plural). Several other determiners termed definitives are related to the singular definite article , such as the definitive possessive constructions with and and the demonstrative determiners.\nThe M\u0101ori definite articles are frequently used where the equivalent, \"the\", is not used in English, such as when referring generically to an entire class. In these cases, the singular can even be used with a morphologically plural noun, as in \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nas opposed to \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn other syntactic environments, the definite article may be used to introduce a noun-phrase which is pragmatically indefinite due to the restrictions on the use of as discussed below.\nThe indefinite article is used most frequently in the predicate and occasionally in the subject of the sentence, although it is not allowed in subject position in all sentence types. In the predicate, the indefinite article can introduce either nouns or adjectives. The article either can be translated to the English 'a' or 'some', but the number will not be indicated by . With nouns that show morphological number, may be used either with singular or plural forms. The indefinite article when used with mass nouns like water and sand will always mean 'some'.\nThe indefinite article is highly restricted in its use and is incompatible with a preceding preposition. For this reason, it cannot be used in the grammatical object of the sentence as these are marked prepositionally, either with or . In many cases, speakers simply use the definite articles and in positions where is disallowed, however the indefinite articles and may be used in these situations to emphasise the indefiniteness.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn positions where both and / may occur, there are sometimes differences of meaning between them as the following examples indicate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe proper article is used before personal and locative nouns acting as the subject of the sentence or before personal nouns and pronouns within prepositional phrases headed by prepositions ending in \"i\" (namely , , and ).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe personal nouns are not accompanied by definite or indefinite articles unless they are an intrinsic part of the name, as in Te Rauparaha.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProper nouns are not preceded by the proper article when they are neither acting as the subject of the sentence nor in a prepositional phrase headed by , , or . For example, after the focusing particle , the proper article is not used.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemonstrative determiners and adverbs.\nDemonstratives occur after the noun and have a deictic function, and include , this (near me), , that (near you), , that (far from us both), and , the aforementioned (anaphoric). These demonstratives, having a connection to the definite article are termed definitives. Other definitives include (which?), and , (a certain). The plural is formed just by dropping the \"t\": (this), (these). The related adverbs are (here), (there, near you), (over there, near him).\nPhrases introduced by demonstratives can also be expressed using the definite article or preceding a noun followed by one of the deictic particles , or . The \"t\" of the singular definite article appears in the singular demonstratives but is replaced by \"\u2205\" in the plural, having no connection with in the majority of dialects.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, in dialects of the Waikato area, plural forms of demonstratives beginning with \"ng-\" are found, such as 'these' instead of the more widespread (as well as and possessives such as 'my (plural, inalienable)' instead of ).\nThe following table shows the most common forms of demonstratives across dialects.\nPronouns.\nPersonal pronouns.\nPronouns have singular, dual and plural number. Different first-person forms in both the dual and the plural are used for groups inclusive or exclusive of the person(s) addressed.\nLike other Polynesian languages, M\u0101ori has three numbers for pronouns and possessives: singular, dual and plural. For example: (he/she), (those two), (they, three or more). M\u0101ori pronouns and possessives further distinguish exclusive \"we\" from inclusive \"we\", second and third. It has the plural pronouns: (we, exc), (we, inc), (you), (they). The language features the dual pronouns: (me and another), (me and you), (you two), (those two). The difference between exclusive and inclusive lies in the treatment of the person addressed. refers to the speaker and others but not the person or persons spoken to (\"I and some others but not you\"), and refers to the speaker, the person or persons spoken to and everyone else (\"you, I and others\"):\nPossessive pronouns.\nThe possessive pronouns vary according to person, number, clusivity, and possessive class (a class or o class). Example: (my pen), (my pens). For dual and plural subject pronouns, the possessive form is analytical, by just putting the possessive particle (t\u0101/t\u014d for singular objects or \u0101/\u014d for plural objects) before the personal pronouns, e.g. (our class), (their [dual] house); (our classes). The neuter one must be followed by a noun and only occur for singular first, second and third persons. is my, is my (plural, for many possessed items). The plural is made by deleting the initial [t].\nPhrase grammar.\nA phrase spoken in M\u0101ori can be broken up into two parts: the \"nucleus\" or \"head\" and \"periphery\" (modifiers, determiners). The nucleus can be thought of as the meaning and is the centre of the phrase, whereas the periphery is where the grammatical meaning is conveyed and occurs before and/or after the nucleus.\nThe nucleus can be translated as \"house\", the periphery is similar to an article \"the\" and the periphery indicates proximity to the speaker. The whole phrase, , can then be translated as \"this house\".\nPhrasal particles.\nA definite and declarative sentence (may be a copulative sentence) begins with the declarative particle \"ko\". If the sentence is topicalised (agent topic, only in non-present sentences) the sentence begins with the particle n\u0101 (past tense) or the particle m\u0101 (future, imperfective) followed by the agent/subject. In these cases the word order changes to subject-verb-object or subject-object-verb. These are the agent emphatic sentences discussed earlier. The agent topicalising particles can contract with singular personal pronouns and vary according to the possessive classes: \"n\u0101ku\" can be thought of as meaning \"as for me\" and behave like an emphatic or dative pronoun.\nNegation.\nForming negative phrases in M\u0101ori is quite grammatically complex. There are several different negators which are used under various specific circumstances. The main negators are as follows:\n and are two negators which may be seen in specific dialects or older texts, but are not widely used. The most common negator is , which may occur in one of four forms, with the form only being used in response to a question. Negative phrases, besides using , also affect the form of verbal particles, as illustrated below.\nThe general usage of can be seen in the following examples. The subject is usually raised in negative phrases, although this is not obligatory. Each example of a negative phrase is presented with its analogue positive phrase for comparison.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPassive sentences.\nThe passive voice of verbs is made by a suffix to the verb. For example, -ia (or just -a if the verb ends in [i]). The other passive suffixes, some of which are very rare, are: -hanga/-hia/-hina/-ina/-kia/-kina/-mia/-na/-nga/-ngia/-ria/-rina/-tia/-whia/-whina/. The use of the passive suffix -ia is given in this sentence: \"Kua hangaia te marae e ng\u0101 tohunga\" (The marae has been built by the experts). The active form of this sentence is rendered as: \"Kua hanga ng\u0101 tohunga i te marae\" (The experts have built the marae). It can be seen that the active sentence contains the object marker 'i', that is not present in the passive sentence, while the passive sentence has the agent marker 'e', which is not present in the active sentence.\nPolar questions.\nPolar questions (yes/no questions) can be made by changing the intonation of the sentence. The answers may be \"\u0101e\" (yes) or \"k\u0101o\" (no).\nDerivational morphology.\nAlthough M\u0101ori is mostly analytical there are several derivational affixes:\nInfluence on New Zealand English.\nNew Zealand English has gained many loanwords from M\u0101ori, mainly the names of birds, plants, fishes and places. For example, the kiwi, the national bird, takes its name from . \"Kia ora\" (literally \"be healthy\") is a widely adopted greeting of M\u0101ori origin, with the intended meaning of \"hello\". It can also mean \"thank you\", or signify agreement with a speaker at a meeting. The M\u0101ori greetings (to one person), (to two people) or (to three or more people) are also widely used, as are farewells such as . The M\u0101ori phrase , \"be strong\", is frequently encountered as an indication of moral support for someone starting a stressful undertaking or otherwise in a difficult situation. Many other words such as (meaning \"family\") and (meaning \"food\") are also widely understood and used by New Zealanders. The M\u0101ori phrase meaning 'until I see you again' is quite commonly used.\nIn 2023, 47 words or expressions from New Zealand English, mostly of M\u0101ori etymology, were added to the Oxford English Dictionary.\nOnline translators.\nM\u0101ori is available on Google Translate, Microsoft Translator and Yandex Translate. A popular online dictionary is \"Te Aka M\u0101ori Dictionary\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Star Destroyers were produced by Kuat Drive Yards, later Kuat-Entralla Engineering, and serve as \"the signature vessel of the fleet\" for the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, the First Order, and the Sith Eternal in numerous published works including film, television, novels, comics, and video games.\nA single Star Destroyer could project considerable influence over a star system in the name of the Empire: each can be deployed individually as both a forward operating base and as mobile weapon systems platform responsible for safeguarding multiple planets, trade routes, and systems, and carried enough firepower to subdue an entire planetary system or annihilate a small rebel fleet.\nNotable examples of Star Destroyers include the precursor \"Venator\"-class Star Destroyer (prequel trilogy), the ubiquitous \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyer (original trilogy), and the recent \"Resurgent\"-class and \"Xyston\"-class Star Destroyer (sequel trilogy). Numerous other classes of \"Star Destroyers\" share the basic triangular \"dagger\" hull; the successful v-shaped designs are explained in \"Legends\" as reflecting the Empire's \"Tarkin's Doctrine\" military philosophy and originating from Sith ideological influence, and have been adapted by numerous factions for a wide variety of applications.\nNumerous Star Destroyer models and toys have been released. The iconic scene in \"Star Wars\" (1977) featuring the Imperial Star Destroyer's first appearance where it pursues a Corellian corvette has been called a milestone in special effects history.\nImperial Star Destroyer.\nConcept and design.\nIn draft scripts for the film that would become \"Star Wars\", the term \"Stardestroyer\" refers to two-man fighters flown by what would become the Galactic Empire. The film's second draft features four Star Destroyers chasing a single Rebel ship, but the tremendous costs incurred by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) when production began helped lead Lucas to use a single \"terrifyingly large\" Star Destroyer instead of four. ILM built a shooting model that was about half the size of the model for the \"Tantive IV\" the Star Destroyer was chasing. Lucas asked ILM to build a larger Star Destroyer model to match the \"Tantive IV\"'s scale, but ILM convinced him that the Dykstraflex camera invented for the film made this unnecessary. Nevertheless, they added additional hull details to the Star Destroyer model. The 13-second opening shot was the first special effects piece ILM completed, and its success was an essential test for the Dykstraflex.\nILM built a Star Destroyer, equipped with internal lighting to provide a better sense of scale, for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980). According to chief model maker Lorne Peterson, the new Star Destroyer model was scaled to appear two and a half miles long, though their official length was revised in later sources.\nThe \"Imperial I\"-class Star Destroyers are white, as shown in \"A New Hope\", ', and '. The \"Imperial II\"-class Star Destroyers in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\" are grey.\nDepiction.\nThe iconic \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyer first appears in the opening scene of \"Star Wars\" (1977), where the Imperial Star Destroyer \"Devastator\" (carrying Darth Vader) chases the CR90 Corvette \"Tantive IV\" (carrying Princess Leia) above Tatooine after the latter had fled from Scarif. Background literature describes \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyers as the chief warship of the Imperial Navy and symbol of Imperial might. These enormous capital ships are used to enforce the Emperor's will, bolster Imperial-backed governments, and act as mobile headquarters for senior Imperial commanders. In addition to their powerful armament, a Star Destroyer carries troops and vehicles for ground operations and a full wing of TIE fighters (typically 48 fighters, 12 bombers and 12 boarding craft). A single Star Destroyer is considered sufficient to overwhelm a rebellious planet, though major industrialized worlds may be assaulted by a fleet of six Star Destroyers with support cruisers and supply craft. Deep-crust survival bunkers are regarded as a last refuge in the event of planetary bombardment by Imperial Star Destroyers. At the Empire's height there were over 25,000 Star Destroyers in existence, requiring roughly 925 million crew.\nDarth Vader's \"Devastator\" is the last of the \"Imperial I\"-class ships to be built by Kuat Drive Yards before switching to the \"Imperial II\"-class, a fleet of which take part in the Battle of Hoth as depicted in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980). Designated Death Squadron, this fleet of Star Destroyers is led by Darth Vader aboard the \"Executor\", first in a new class of Super Star Destroyer. Although the battle is won by Imperial forces, Vader orders his Star Destroyers to focus on capturing the \"Millennium Falcon\" rather than hunt down the escaping Rebel transports, allowing many to escape. The \"Falcon\" manages to evade this pursuit by hiding in the sensor blind spot of the Star Destroyer \"Avenger\". These ships play a major role in the Battle of Endor as depicted in \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983). During the battle, Imperial Star Destroyers prove vulnerable to fleets of starfighters flown by skilled Rebel pilots, who exploit the ships' exposed bridges and deflector shield generators to cause damage. A year after their defeat at Endor, the Empire makes a last stand at Jakku. During the battle, Imperial Star Destroyers use their tractor beams to drag New Republic ships down to the planet's surface, where their wrecks form the Graveyard of Ships as seen in \"The Force Awakens\" (2015).\nAnalysis.\nExamining what it would take to realistically build an Imperial Star Destroyer, it was estimated in 2016 that such a vessel would cost $636 billion USD. Using then-current technology and naval vessels as a reference, the ship would weigh 4.44 billion kilograms, generate 146.5 gigawatts of power, and its engines would produce a combined total thrust of 3.5 million newtons. However getting the parts into space to construct the Star Destroyer would require an additional US$44.4 trillion in launch costs, suggesting that asteroid mining and refining technologies would have to be developed first to make it more economical.\nJoe Pappalardo of \"Popular Mechanics\" argues that the Imperial Star Destroyer is a poorly-designed spaceship, being asymmetrical with its superstructure jutting out in one direction. Additionally, while its wedge shape would make sense for atmospheric travel, it serves no purpose in space. He argues a more realistic and effective design would be symmetrical and bowl-shaped like a saucer.\nCultural influence.\nLego has released multiple different Star Destroyer kits over the years, from small sets with just 21 pieces to the largest versions with thousands of pieces. These include two Ultimate Collector Series models, the first of which was released in 2002. Measuring long and , it sold for $269.99 until being retired in 2007. The second UCS Star Destroyer was larger, long and wide, and sold for $699.99 between 2019 and 2022.\nSuper Star Destroyer.\nConcept and design.\nFor \"The Empire Strikes Back\", George Lucas wanted Darth Vader's new flagship, \"Executor\", to be huge and to play a greater role in the film. According to chief model maker Lorne Peterson, the \"Executor\"'s model was long and constructed with over 150,000 individual lights. The resulting model was so heavy it required additional support to keep from overwhelming the Dykstraflex's mechanical structure. The ship was originally scaled to appear long according to Lorne, though later sources would amend this figure.\nDepiction.\nWithin the \"Star Wars\" universe, the term \"Super Star Destroyer\" is a colloquialism used to refer to any ship larger than an Imperial Star Destroyer. The largest and most powerful of these is the \"Executor\", which first appeared in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) as the personal flagship of Darth Vader. The first in a line of \"Executor\"-class Star Dreadnoughts, the ship is over in length, propelled by thirteen colossal engines and a Class 1 hyperdrive. Its armament includes over 5,000 turbolasers, ion cannons and tractor beam projectors and it can carry more than 1,000 vessels. The crew of the \"Executor\" numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Its command tower, rising above the ship's technoscape on a thick stalk, is a standard model found on other Star Destroyers \u2013 including a pair of geodesic domes containing communication transceivers, sensors and deflector shield projectors \u2013 and allows for an unobstructed view of the battlefield. At least twelve of these vessels were built by the Empire, including the \"Executor\", \"Annihilator\", \"Ravager\" and \"Arbitrator\", but the exact number is unknown thanks to Imperial propaganda and black budgets.\nFrom the bridge of the \"Executor\", Darth Vader leads Death Squadron during the Battle of Hoth and afterwards in pursuit of the \"Millennium Falcon\". It later serves as the Imperial command ship during the Battle of Endor. At Endor, intense bombardment by the Rebel Alliance fleet cause the ship's shields to fail, allowing Rebel starfighters to strafe the command tower. During this attack an A-wing piloted by Arvel Crynyd crashes into the command bridge, destroying the main navigation complex and causing the vessel to lose control. The \"Executor\" is lost when the second Death Star's gravity well pulls the ship into its surface, destroying the vessel and damaging the Death Star itself. At Jakku where the Empire made its last stand, the Super Star Destroyer \"Ravager\" is one of the wrecks which make up the Graveyard of Ships.\nAnalysis.\nRhett Allain, an associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, examined the death of the \"Executor\" in a \"Star Wars\" Day-themed article for \"Wired\". According to him, the \"Executor\" impacted the second Death Star traveling at , which\u2014assuming the collision was strictly a result of gravitational interaction between the two objects\u2014would require a super-dense Death Star to achieve such an impact velocity. Additionally, the \"Executor\" had a near constant angular velocity of 0.159 radians/second during the scene where it rotates to face the Death Star. For the crew at the front of the ship, this would result in a centripetal acceleration of 39 G.\nIf a model of the \"Executor\" was built to scale and placed hovering over New York City, it would cast a shadow over the island of Manhattan.\nCultural influence.\nLike the Imperial Star Destroyer, the Super Star Destroyer has also been merchandised. Lego released a 3,152-piece model of the \"Executor\". Kenner wanted to use a less ominous name than \"Executor\" for the toy playset of Darth Vader's meditation chamber. An advertisement agency's list of 153 alternatives included Starbase Malevolent, Black Coven, Haphaestus VII, and Cosmocurse; ultimately, the toy was labeled \"Darth Vader's Star Destroyer\". In 2006, Wizards of the Coast created an \"Executor\" miniature as part of its \"Star Wars\" Miniatures Starship Battles game. An electronic Super Star Destroyer toy released by Hasbro \"is the rarest among Hasbro's Collector Fleet\".\nVenator Star Destroyer.\nConcept and design.\nThe design of the \"Venator\"-class Star Destroyers appearing in ' (2005) are meant to bridge the appearance of the \"Acclamator\"-class transports in ' (2002) and the \"Imperial\"-class in the original trilogy. This included making use of the Imperial Star Destroyer bridge set for interior shots of the Venator as a connecting theme. Additionally, the changing coloration of the Star Destroyers is meant to represent the downfall of the Republic and rise of the Empire. At the start of the film they are given a red paint scheme first established in \"The Phantom Menace\" (1999) as representing the Republic, but by the end they are colorless.\nDepiction.\nThe \"Venator\"-class Star Destroyer makes its first theatrical appearance in \"Revenge of the Sith\" during the opening Battle of Coruscant. Within the \"Star Wars\" setting, these ships are regarded as the most powerful capital ships of the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars, serving double duty as battleships and starfighter carriers. These massive ships require a relatively small crew to operate, a deliberate feature compensating for the fact that the Separatists can produce battle droids faster than the Republic can grow clone troopers. As a true warship, the \"Venator\"-class can feed nearly its entire reactor output (which at maximum power consumes 40,000 tons of fuel per second) into its heavy turbolasers to devastating effect. As a carrier, the Star Destroyer can rapidly deploy hundreds of starfighters, including ARC-170s, V-wings, Z-95 Headhunters and Jedi interceptors, from a -long dorsal flight deck. While strong deflector shielding is employed around the armored bow doors, they are slow to open or close, presenting a weakness in the vessel's design.\nDuring the Clone Wars these Star Destroyers, referred to also as Republic attack cruisers or Jedi cruisers, play an important role combating Separatist fleets and providing supporting fire for ground forces. Thanks to their superior firepower, the \"Venator\"-class has a strong advantage against Separatist warships, and a small flotilla of attack cruisers can easily blast through the deflector shields of a Trade Federation Battleship. At the Battle of Coruscant, over a thousand attack cruisers are deployed to defend the planet, one of which (the Star Destroyer \"Guarlara\") delivers a devastating barrage to the \"Invisible Hand\" at point-blank range. After the end of the Clone Wars and creation of the Galactic Empire, these Star Destroyers will continue to serve for decades in the Imperial Navy until eventually replaced with the \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyer.\nCultural influence.\nThere have been five different Lego sets of the Venator released since 2009, with the most recent one revealed in 2023. This version of the Venator, part of the Ultimate Collector Series, was released in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" TV show. Measuring long, wide and tall, the set consists of 5,374 pieces and comes with a commemorative plaque, at an original retail price of $649.99.\nFor the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, noted modder Sander van der Velden created a custom-built PC made to look like a Venator Star Destroyer. Built around a fully-functional, liquid-cooled PC, the surrounding case was constructed in the shape of a Venator using aluminum and 3D printed material. The final product required 400 hours of work to complete.\nResurgent Star Destroyer.\nIn \"\" (2015), set 30 years after the fall of the Empire, a new class of Star Destroyer is introduced in service to the First Order. The \"Finalizer\", the first of the \"Resurgent\"-class Star Destroyers built in secret by Kuat-Entralla Engineering, serves as the flagship for both Kylo Ren and General Hux.\nConcept and design.\nVarious concept art for a new class of Star Destroyers was created in the development of \"The Force Awakens\", with a finalized designed \u2014 drawn by VFX art director James Clyne \u2014 approved in July 2014. Clyne had experimented with using negative spaces in creating the Star Destroyer, similar to his earlier work on \"Star Trek Into Darkness\". He said he had fun fun working on it as director J. J. Abrams was heavily involved in the process and offered suggestions. Clyne also drew concept art for the \"Finalizer\"'s hangar, and when it came time to build the set at Pinewood Studios, he relocated there for a month to supervise the construction.\nDepiction.\n\"Resurgent\"-class Star Destroyers are described in background literature as a clear violation of the treaties between the New Republic and the First Order. The development of such capital ships was kept a secret for many years by the First Order and were constructed deep within the Unknown Regions, but once they became aware General Leia and the Resistance went to great lengths to track and report on such vessels to the New Republic. However, Leia was considered a warmonger by many in the Senate and so her warnings were dismissed until it was too late.\nWhile evoking the traditional \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyer, the \"Resurgent\"-class is said within \"Star Wars\" literature to incorporate a number of fixes to the former's design flaws. These include a less-exposed command bridge with an emergency backup in case it is destroyed; better-defended shield generators; and a larger fighter complement that can be more quickly launched from dorsal flight decks and side hangers. The ship's turbolasers, powerful enough to slug it out with capital ships or reduce planetary surfaces to molten slag, have greater firepower and faster recharge rates than Imperial models thanks to the use of Kyber focusing crystals. For planetary assaults, the ship carries a full legion of over 8,000 stormtroopers and over a hundred assault vehicles, including walkers. While lacking the resources to produce as many of these ships as once served the Empire, the \"Resurgent\"-class is nevertheless meant to symbolize the First Order's power and return to Imperial glory.\nThe \"Finalizer\" features as the command ship for both Kylo Ren and General Hux during their journeys in \"The Force Awakens\" and ' (2017). However, sometime before as the events of ' (2019), Resistance hero Finn managed to sneak aboard and severely damaged the ship. This forced Ren to transfer his command over to a new \"Resurgent\"-class Star Destroyer, the \"Steadfast\", and reduced Hux to a junior member of the First Order Supreme Council.\nCultural influence.\nWhen the \"Finalizer\"'s name was first revealed, Brent McKnight of MovieWeb felt like it was both silly and frightening, saying \"[i]t sounds like something a little kid would come up with, but it\u2019s also super ominous and intimidating at the same time.\" He also observed the design was instantly recognizable as a Star Destroyer while having appropriate differences to represent the thirty years that took place between its introduction in the story and the original. B. Alan Orange of MovieWeb also felt the design of the \"Finalizer\" was intimidating and scary while still being instantly recognizable as a Star Destoyer. They also believed it had the \"perfect pulp name\", keeping in theme with the movie's new superweapon, Starkiller Base.\nYouTube content creator \"LegoSpencer\" was inspired to build a model of the TIE fighter hangar bay on the \"Finalizer\", a process which took six weeks to complete.\nMega Star Destroyer.\nThe \"Mega\"-class Star Dreadnought \"Supremacy\" made its first theatrical appearance in \"\" (2017). Described as the command ship for Supreme Leader Snoke, it was stated to be wide, making it significantly larger than any previous Super Star Destroyer.\nConcept and design.\nDirector Rian Johnson came up for the idea of basing the \"Supremacy\" on a flying wing, picking the final exterior look from concept art created by design supervisor Kevin Jenkins. \"It's a big flying city,\" said Jenkins. \"Vader's \"Executor\" is simply a headquarters, but Snoke doesn't have a planet, so he lives on the ship.\" The \"Supremacy\"'s bridge was also designed by Jenkins, who wanted it to mirror the wideness of the ship itself.\nDepiction.\nDescribed as the only \"Mega\"-class Star Destroyer in the galaxy, the \"Supremacy\" served not only as the flagship but as the capital of the First Order. Rather than choosing one of the settled planets claimed by the First Order, this decision for a mobile headquarters was said to represent the Order's dream of restoring the Empire and expanding upon it. Built at a staggering cost within the Unknown Regions, the existence of \"Snoke's boudoir\" was only a rumor among Resistance personnel until it finally revealed itself.\nThousands of heavy turbolasers, antiship missile batteries, heavy ion cannons and tractor beam projectors gives the ship firepower equivalent to an entire fleet. The vessel also possesses an industrial capacity that would rival most planets, with asteroid mining complexes, foundries, production lines, research labs and training centers. Six external and two internal stations allow \"Resurgent\"-class Star Destroyers to dock with the \"Supremacy\". A majority of the ship's 2,225,000 crew are adolescents still in training to become stormtroopers and officers.\nThe \"Supremacy\" reveals itself in \"The Last Jedi\" at the head of the fleet pursuing the Resistance after their flight from D'Qar, having used the immense processing power of its vast number of computer arrays to track them through hyperspace. This pursuit continues in realspace, with the \"Supremacy\" destroying the majority of the Resistance fleet while the \"Raddus\" continues to survive thanks to its experimental deflector shields. However, running low on fuel, the Resistance hatches a plan to secretly escape aboard cloaked U-55 Orbital Loadlifters to nearby Crait. The plan is foiled when the cloaked ships are revealed by DJ (Benicio del Toro) and the \"Supremacy\" turns its cannons on the helpless shuttles. Desperate, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) turns the \"Raddus\" around and rams the \"Supremacy\" at lightspeed, splitting the vessel in two.\nAnalysis.\nMartin Docherty of Space.com looked at the possible physics behind the scene in \"The Last Jedi\" where Vice Admiral Holdo destroys the \"Supremacy\" by ramming it at lightspeed with the \"Raddus\". Using the estimate that the \"Raddus\" massed 8.88 billion kilograms and was traveling at 99.9% of the speed of light, it would have a Lorentz factor of 22.366 and impact with a final kinetic energy of 17x1027 joules. Such an impact would create shrapnel which, while moving slower than lightspeed, would still cause immense damage, as was seen in the movie.\nRhett Allain, an associate professor at Southeastern Louisiana University, examined the turbolaser shots fired by the \"Supremacy\" in \"The Last Jedi\" and observed how these shots arced through space as opposed to flying straight as in previous movies. Noting that these shots took 1.58 seconds to reach the \"Raddus\", he estimated they were traveling 100,000 meters per second with an apparent vertical acceleration of 2.4 x 104 meters per second squared.\nCultural influence.\nUpon the first reveal of the \"Supremacy\", B. Alan Orange noted that, despite the ship's unique design, it still retained a familiar shape which immediately identified it as belonging to the First Order. Corey Larson of Screen Rant believed that, regardless of the film's wider reputation, the introduction of the \"Supremacy\" and its subsequent destruction during \"The Last Jedi\" represented one of the coolest additions to the franchise from the Star Wars sequel trilogy. John Orquiola meanwhile felt the ship represented an ongoing superweapon problem with the franchise. While crediting Rian with not introducing another Death Star-like weapon, it still showed that the First Order, like the Empire before it, was obsessed with equating size with power and creating \"unbeatable\" superweapons which are eventually destroyed.\nSith Star Destroyer.\nIn \"\" (2019), a resurrected Darth Sidious unveils a new class of Star Destroyer as part of the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order.\nDepiction.\nIdentified by in-universe sources as \"Xyston\"-class but referred to informally as Sith Star Destroyers, these ships resemble the older \"Imperial I\"-class Star Destroyers but much larger and with more automation to reduce crew requirements. They are built on Exegol by automated factories described as dating back to the old Sith Wars, but which Darth Sidious modernized upon the creation of the Empire. The distinguishing feature of these Sith Star Destroyers is an axial superlaser powerful enough to shatter a planet. Such power is made possible by a solar ionization reactor channeling the energy of a miniature sun through kyber crystals. However, hangar space and storage are sacrificed to make room for the superlaser, and the connection between superlaser and reactor presents a vulnerability should the vessel lose its deflector shielding.\n\"Star Wars Legends\".\nIn April 2014, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels, games, and comics produced since 1976 (and prior to 2014), were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Star Wars Legends; and therefore declared non-canon to the franchise.\nStar Destroyers feature in numerous \"Legends\" publications, with a considerable amount of additional notable information. According to West End Games' \"\" sourcebooks and other texts, \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyers are constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and hold a distinguished place in the Imperial Navy, symbolizing the Empire's military might with a peak number of more than 25,000 vessels. Like the \"Venator\" and \"Victory\"-class ships that precede it, the \"Imperial\"-class is a multi-role capital ship combining the roles of a battleship, starfighter carrier, and troopship. Notable for its massive size and overwhelming firepower compared to its fore-bearers; a single \"Imperial\"-class ship is capable of singlehandedly taking on a fleet of enemy vessels or \"reducing the surface of a planet to a slag\" (known as \"Base Delta Zero\"), and its mere presence is often enough to deter rebellion. At long, \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyers are crewed by 9,235 Officers, 27,850 enlisted personnel, and 275 Gunners. The \"Imperial I\" is armed with 60 turbolasers, 60 ion cannons, and 10 tractor beam projectors for space combat. The standard complement is 72 TIE fighters (including 12 TIE Bombers and 12-24 TIE Interceptors), and a variety of support craft including shuttles and transports. Unlike other comparable capital ships like the Mon Calamari MC80 Star Cruiser of the Rebel Alliance (later New Republic), an \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyer carries a full array of ground forces (including 9700 stormtroopers, 20 AT-ATs and 30 AT-STs) with dropships for rapid deployment to planetary surfaces, plus a prefabricated base if a permanent planetary garrison is required.\nThough the Imperial Navy also has smaller capital ships like Nebulon-B Escort Frigates and CR90 Corvettes (the films show these vessels being used exclusively by the Rebel Alliance), \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyers are usually the default choice for frontline deployments. At the Battle of Endor the Rebel Alliance captured two \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyers and added them to the New Republic fleet; they serve alongside Mon Calamari Cruisers in General Han Solo's task force as told in the and Dark Empire comics. Although the New Republic eventually upgrades its starfleet with newer ship types, the \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyer remains in service well into the \"New Jedi Order\" era and fights during the Yuuzhan Vong War.\nDescribed in \"A Guide to the Star Wars Universe\" (1984) as being long, \"Executor\"-class Super Star Destroyers were later described as being long. In addition to Vader's command ship \"Executor\", \"Star Wars\" novels introduce the prison ship \"Lusankya\" and stealth-armored \" Knight Hammer\" as other in the class. Kevin J. Anderson's novel \"Darksaber\" describes a Super Star Destroyer as being \"worth twenty Imperial Star Destroyers\".\nThe expansion pack to the game \"\" introduced the \"Aggressor\"-class Star Destroyer. Its plans were kept aboard the first Death Star, where they were studied along with other ship designs, including the \"Vengeance\"-class frigate. Following the Battle of Yavin, the Zann Consortium stole the designs stored in a data pod amidst the wreckage of the battle station, as well as a prototype that Tyber Zann took as his flagship; it was heavily modified over three years and was christened the \"Merciless\". The \"Aggressor\"-class featured two fire-linked cannons fixed on its forward hull that fired an ion blast that disabled shields, followed by a plasma blast for maximum damage.\nThe description \"Star Destroyer\" and \"Super Star Destroyer\" are applied to several another massive dagger/triangle-shaped warships in \"Star Wars\", such as the \"Pellaeon\"-class Star Destroyer in the \"\" comic series (2006\u20132010), and the reborn Emperor Palpatine's flagships \"Eclipse\" and \"Eclipse II\" Super Star Destroyers in the Dark Empire series (1991\u20131995). The \"Eclipse\"-class was perhaps the ultimate Super Star Destroyer or Star Dreadnought in the Expanded Universe, incorporating a Death Star-type superlaser but miniaturized and more advanced, and gravity well projectors to prevent enemies from jumping to hyperspace, and having strong enough shields/armor to be able to ram enemy vessels. Curtis Saxton, in the unofficial \"Star Wars Technical Commentaries\" (he has since been the author of the official \"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Incredible Cross-Sections\" and \"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections\"), has advocated using the term \"Imperator\"-class in lieu of \"Imperial\"-class. Saxton argues that \"Imperial Star Destroyer\" is a somewhat generic term, as the vast majority of Star Destroyer types are operated by the Galactic Empire's Imperial Navy which technically means they are all \"Imperial Star Destroyers\", although the \"Imperator\"/\"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyers are by far the most common type. Similarly, the \"Super Star Destroyer\" moniker has been used for numerous unrelated vessels of varying sizes and classes, so fans have suggested labeling the class instead of by the lead ship such as \"Executor\"-class and \"Eclipse\"-class, with some referring to them instead as a \"Star Dreadnought\" (sometimes spelled \"Star Dreadnaught\") to emphasize their massive size relative to Star Destroyers. Author Jason Fry introduced the \"Anaxes War College System\" which specifically divide warships into different types depending on their size and power, which explain all the differently sized \"Super Star Destroyers\" appearing in the Expanded Universe (now \"Star Wars\" Legends), supplementing the contradictory classification systems used in Star Wars lore previously, becoming reference material in the s by West End Games.\nThe \"Victory\"-class Star Destroyer first described in the early \"Star Wars\" novella, was initially designed as a direct predecessor to the \"Imperial\"-class during the development of \"A New Hope\", which would make it a follow-up to the \"Venator\"-class seen in \"Revenge of the Sith\". The \"Victory\" appears very similar in appearance to the \"Imperial\"-class which succeeded it; albeit the \"Victory\" being considerably smaller in scale (900 meters in length versus 1600 meters), adds atmospheric maneuvering \"wings\" on the port and starboard sides (according to \"\" sourcebooks, the \"Victory I\"-class can enter a planetary atmosphere which is a unique attribute not found in the \"Victory II\" and \"Imperial\"-class Star Destroyers), and a shorter conning tower with different elements on the command bridge. The \"Victory\"-class was developed from a prototype Star Destroyer model created by Colin Cantwell for \"A New Hope\", with the final design being used for the basis of the \"Imperial\"-class.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

TIE fighters are depicted as fast, agile, yet fragile starfighters produced by Sienar Fleet Systems for the Galactic Empire and by Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems for the First Order and the Sith Eternal. TIE fighters and other TIE craft appear in \"Star Wars\" films, television shows, and throughout the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe. Several TIE fighter replicas and toys, as well as a TIE flight simulator, have been produced and sold by many companies.\nOrigin and design.\nColin Cantwell created the concept model that established the TIE fighter's ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for \"Star Wars\" (1977). \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas liked the basic design consisting of two panels connected by a stick with a ball-shaped cockpit, but Cantwell's concept had few details. Joe Johnston created additional details, such as the cockpit window and the attachment points between the solar panels and the hull.\nInitially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter models for the first film were grey to film better against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) and \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983) shifted back to being a muted blue. Sound designer Ben Burtt created the distinctive sound of the TIE fighter in flight by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. \"The Sounds of Star Wars\" likens the TIE's engine roar to German Junker Ju 87 \"Stuka\" bombers, which used sirens to frighten civilians during air raids. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the \"Millennium Falcon\" and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in \"Star Wars\" were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light &amp; Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE Advanced x1 in \"Star Wars\" was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE Interceptors featured in \"Return of the Jedi\" were designed to look fast, deadly, sleek, and frightening.\nThe Jedi starfighter, created for ' (2005)\",\" was designed to bridge the appearance of the Jedi starfighter in ' (2002) and the TIE fighter design from the original trilogy. The V-wing starfighter, seen at the end of \"Revenge of the Sith,\" also makes the distinctive TIE fighter sound. Dark Horse Comics' Sean Cooke designed the TIE predator for \"\" (2006), set 130 years after the events of \"Star Wars\", to appear both reminiscent of and more advanced than the original TIE fighter.\nDesigners for \"\" (2015) had numerous discussions about how much to \"update\" the TIE fighter for the first sequel film set 30 years after \"Return of the Jedi\". They retained the starfighter's design but altered its aesthetic to suggest improvements to the vessel's manufacturing process and materials.\nDepiction.\n\"Star Wars\" literature states that Grand Moff Tarkin commissioned Sienar Fleet Systems to design and manufacture the Twin Ion Engine line edition (TIE/ln) space superiority starfighter and most TIE variants. Tarkin specified that the TIE had to be fast, maneuverable, energy-efficient, and inexpensive; simply put they are meant to be easily mass-produced and engage in swarm tactics, with the expectation of being expendable assets that would be lost in combat. To meet these requirements, Sienar incorporated aspects of the V-wing and Jedi interceptor into the new starfighter.\nTIE fighters have two hexagonal wings fitted with solar panels which power a twin ion engine (TIE) system. This engine system accelerates ionized gases at a substantial fraction of lightspeed along almost any vector, affording the ships tremendous speed and maneuverability albeit with limited fuel reserves. The wings are also structurally sound enough to double as landing gear and feature repulsorlifts for take-off and landing, though TIE fighters are designed to be launched and recovered by cycling storage racks used by Imperial starships and garrisons. The TIE fighter's primary weapons are a pair of L-s1 laser cannons, which were prone to overheating and decreasing the fighter's speed and maneuverability due to power being drawn from the twin ion engines. Prior to the Battle of Endor, these were replaced with the L-s7.2 models, which were tied to a secondary generator instead, improving their rate of fire and granting them a lower recycle time. The laser cannons were mated with an advanced targeting computer which assists the pilot in hitting other fast-moving starfighters. The fighter does not possess deflector shields, and while its light armoring is proof against small arms and glancing micrometeoroids a direct hit from a laser cannon will destroy it, encouraging pilots to shoot first and make their shots count. The TIE fighter also lacks a hyperdrive, not only to save on weight and cost but to discourage defection. Although the TIE fighter's cockpit is pressurized and equipped with oxygen scrubbers to prevent corrosion, it lacks life-support systems, requiring pilots to wear special flight suits. TIE fighters are equipped with ejection seats, though in older Legends sources there was disagreement on this issue.\n\"Star Wars\" literature also holds that TIE fighter pilots are considered an elite group within the Imperial Navy, relying on their quick reflexes and fearlessness to survive multiple tours of duty. Training involves hundreds of flight hours learning to coordinate as a team and intense psychological conditioning to put the accomplishment of their mission above other considerations. As such most TIE fighter pilots have a life expectancy of less than a year. TIE fighter pilots wear self-contained flight suits with life-support systems connected to reinforced vacuum-sealed flight helmets. These helmets feature ship-linked communications and displays.\nTIE variants.\nIn addition to the standard TIE/ln fighter (also available as the TIE Light Duty training craft, as seen in the \"Jump to Lightspeed\" expansion pack to \"Star Wars Galaxies\"), a variety of other TIE craft appear throughout the films. \nSith Eternal variants.\nA number of different TIE designs made their appearance in what is now considered \"Star Wars\" Legends, a separate continuity that was split off after Disney acquired the \"Star Wars\" franchise. The TIE/sa was the inspiration for the triple-hulled TIE lander, featured in \"Star Wars\" No. 60 and in \"Star Wars: Complete Locations\". Red-modified TIE interceptors are also used by the Emperor's Royal Guards, as featured in \"Rage of the Wookiees\", another expansion of \"Star Wars Galaxies\".\nAdditionally, LucasArts \"Star Wars\" video games introduce several TIE variants, such as the TIE/hu Hunter starfighter in ' and the TIE ap-1 Mauler surface vehicle in '. The TIE/ad fighter (nicknamed \"TIE Advanced\" or \"Avenger\" in-game and derived from Vader's TIE Advanced x1 fighter) and TIE/D Defender \u2014 heavily upgraded derivatives of previous craft seen in the \"Star Wars\" universe \u2014 first appear in \"TIE Fighter\" as player-pilotable craft. The plot of ' revolves around destroying the Empire's ability to manufacture the cloaking TIE Phantom starfighter, and a campaign in ' centers on destroying experimental remote-controlled TIE fighters.\n\"Star Wars\" literature also introduces TIE varieties. TIE raptors attack Rogue Squadron in \"Solo Command\". TYE wings \u2013 TIE fighter and Y-wing hybrids \u2013 appear both in \"I, Jedi\" and \"\". Dark Horse's \"Dark Empire\" introduces both the droid-piloted TIE/D and the TIE crawler \"century tank\". West End Games' roleplaying sourcebooks introduce varieties that include the TIE/fc fire-control support ship, the TIE/gt ground-attack fighter, the TIE/rc reconnaissance vessel, and the TIE scout.\nAnalysis.\nIn 2018, a number of \"Star Wars\" starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. Of those studied, the TIE Fighter scored the worst with a drag coefficient of .98, which is only slightly better than a brick. Of the other TIE variants tested, the TIE interceptor was slightly better with a coefficient of .78, while the TIE Striker had the best at .48, though this did not compare favorably to the .02 drag coefficient of an F-4E Phantom. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that \"Star Wars\" fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.\nKenneth Wong of the online magazine \"Digital Engineering\" enlisted several computational fluid dynamics experts to model the aerodynamics of the TIE Fighter and offer suggestions to redesign it. While their models found the design could fly in an Earth-like atmosphere, excessive drag and lack of lift would require lots of thrust to keep it airborne and to maneuver. Their models also found the exposed mechanical features on the fuselage and solar panels created turbulent flows, which ideally should be covered with a smooth skin. Among their other suggestions to improve it were replacing the cockpit's spherical shape with a teardrop design, making the solar panels' leading edges smoother and more streamline, and incorporating vortex generators to keep the airflow attached to the surface.\nShortly after the release of the teaser trailer for \"The Force Awakens\", Rhett Allain, an associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, analyzed the scene where two First Order TIE Fighters engage the \"Millennium Falcon\". Using the known dimensions of the ships involved and the principal of angular size, he estimated that the TIE Fighters were flying at approximately . He also estimated their blaster shots had a velocity of approximately . In an earlier analysis of the trailer for \"The Force Awakens\", he measured a group of First Order TIE Fighters flying in formation at , but explained that the reason they appeared to pass each other despite flying at the same speed was due to parallax.\nCultural impact.\nA TIE fighter model used in filming the climax of \"Star Wars\" sold at auction for $350,000, and another TIE fighter from the film sold at auction for $402,500. Fans built a 16-foot-by-20-foot, 1,000-pound TIE fighter float to commemorate \"Star Wars\"' thirtieth anniversary as part of the 2007 Gala Parade in Crystal Lake, Illinois. A \"Wired\" editor's creation of a TIE fighter model out of Starbucks cups and stirrers prompted the magazine to create a contest for its readers to submit their own art out of similar Starbucks material. io9 mocked the variety of TIE fighters in the franchise, listing four TIE models on its list of the eleven \"silliest\" \"Star Wars\" ships.\nKenner released TIE fighter and TIE interceptor toys during the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy's theatrical release, and Kenner's die-cast TIE bomber is a rare collector's item. Hasbro also released TIE fighter, TIE bomber, and TIE interceptor toys. Both Kenner and Hasbro also manufactured TIE fighter pilot action figures. Lego manufactured TIE fighter, TIE bomber, TIE interceptor, TIE defender, and TIE advanced models. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published various TIE starfighter and TIE-related cards for the \"Star Wars Customizable Card Game\" and \"Star Wars Trading Card Game\", respectively. In 2012, Fantasy Flight Games released ', a miniatures game with pre-painted and to scale miniature X-wings and TIE fighters. In 1994, LucasArts released the ' flight simulator, which casts the player as an Imperial pilot flying a variety of TIE starfighters. TIE starfighters and their variants are also playable in third- or first-person perspectives in several \"Star Wars\" titles.\nIn Sasuke (also known as \"Ninja Warrior\"), TIE Fighter (Japanese: \u30bf\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc) was a obstacle that introduced in the 32nd competition as the second obstacle in the First Stage. Competitors must prop their hands and feet against a set of glass panels that much resemble to the two hexagonal solar energy-collecting wings of TIE Fighter, position themselves and slide down a track to reach the safety platform at the other side. Due to the expiration of the license before the 36th competition, the TIE Fighter was renamed the Wing Slider (Japanese: \u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc), and was redesigned to reflect this.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. It may result in an increased risk of accidents as well as problems focusing and learning. Insomnia can be short-term, lasting for days or weeks, or long-term, lasting more than a month. The concept of the word \"insomnia\" has two distinct possibilities: insomnia disorder or insomnia symptoms.\nInsomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, restless leg syndrome, menopause, certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Risk factors include working night shifts and sleep apnea. Diagnosis is based on sleep habits and an examination to look for underlying causes. A sleep study may be done to look for underlying sleep disorders. Screening may be done with questions like \"Do you experience difficulty sleeping?\" or \"Do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep?\"\nCognitive behavioral therapy is considered the first-line treatment. Sleep hygiene and lifestyle changes are also recommended for insomnia, though their efficacy is not definitely established. Sleep hygiene includes a consistent bedtime, a quiet and dark room, exposure to sunlight during the day and regular exercise. Sleeping pills can improve sleep, though some are associated with falls, cognitive impairment, and dependence. These medications are not recommended for more than four or five weeks but can be used longer in certain instances. Among these, lemborexant and eszopiclone have the most favorable efficacy and safety profiles. The efficacy and safety of alternative medicine treatments are unclear.\nBetween 10% and 30% of adults have insomnia at any given point in time, and up to half of people have insomnia in a given year. About 6% of people have insomnia that is not due to another problem and lasts for more than a month. People over the age of 65 are affected more often than younger people. Women are more often affected than men. Descriptions of insomnia occur at least as far back as ancient Greece. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nSymptoms of insomnia:\nSleep onset insomnia is difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night, often a symptom of anxiety disorders. Delayed sleep phase disorder can be misdiagnosed as insomnia, as sleep onset is delayed much later than normal, while awakening spills over into daylight hours.\nIt is common for patients who have difficulty falling asleep to also have nocturnal awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep. Two-thirds of these patients wake up in the middle of the night, with more than half having trouble falling back to sleep after a middle-of-the-night awakening.\nEarly morning awakening occurs earlier (more than 30 minutes) than desired, with an inability to go back to sleep and before total sleep time reaches 6.5 hours. Early morning awakening is often a characteristic of depression. Anxiety symptoms may well lead to insomnia. Some of these symptoms include psychological stress, compulsive worrying about the future, feeling overstimulated, and overanalyzing past events.\nPoor sleep quality.\nPoor sleep quality can occur as a result of, for example, restless legs, sleep apnea, or major depression. Poor sleep quality is defined as the individual not reaching stage 3 or delta sleep, which has restorative properties.\nMajor depression leads to alterations in the function of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis, causing excessive release of cortisol, which can lead to poor sleep quality.\nNocturnal polyuria, excessive night-time urination, can also result in a poor quality of sleep.\nSubjectivity.\nSome types of insomnia are not classified as insomnia in the usual sense since patients with sleep state misperception frequently sleep for a typical period of time. The problem is that, despite sleeping for multiple hours each night and typically not experiencing significant daytime sleepiness or other symptoms of sleep loss, they do not feel like they have slept very much, if at all. Because their perception of their sleep is incomplete, they incorrectly believe it takes them an abnormally long time to fall asleep, and they underestimate how long they stay asleep.\nCauses.\nWhile insomnia can be caused by many conditions, it can also occur without any identifiable cause. This is known as Primary Insomnia. Primary Insomnia may also have an initial identifiable cause but continues after the cause is no longer present. For example, a bout of insomnia may be triggered by a stressful work or life event. However, the condition may continue after the stressful event has been resolved. In such cases, the insomnia is usually perpetuated by the anxiety or fear caused by the sleeplessness itself, rather than any external factors.\nSymptoms of insomnia can be caused by or associated with:\nSleep studies using polysomnography have suggested that people who have sleep disruption have elevated night-time levels of circulating cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. They also have an elevated metabolic rate, which does not occur in people who do not have insomnia but whose sleep is intentionally disrupted during a sleep study. Studies of brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate that people with insomnia have higher metabolic rates by night and by day. The question remains whether these changes are the causes or consequences of long-term insomnia.\nGenetics.\nHeritability estimates of insomnia vary between 38% in males to 59% in females. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 3 genomic loci and 7 genes that influence the risk of insomnia and showed that insomnia is highly polygenic. In particular, a strong positive association was observed for the MEIS1 gene in both males and females. This study showed that the genetic architecture of insomnia strongly overlaps with psychiatric disorders and metabolic traits.\nIt has been hypothesized that epigenetics might also influence insomnia through a controlling process of both sleep regulation and brain-stress response, having an impact as well on brain plasticity.\nSubstance-induced.\nAlcohol-induced.\nAlcohol is often used as a form of self-treatment for insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries to make up for lost time by producing more glutamine than it needs.\nThe increase in glutamine levels stimulates the brain while the drinker is trying to sleep, keeping them from reaching the deepest levels of sleep. Stopping chronic alcohol use can also lead to severe insomnia with vivid dreams. During withdrawal, REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a rebound effect.\nCaffeine.\nSome people experience sleep disruption or anxiety if they consume caffeine. Doses as low as 100\u00a0mg/day, such as a cup of coffee or two to three servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.\nBenzodiazepine-induced.\nLike alcohol, benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam, are commonly used to treat insomnia in the short-term (both prescribed and self-medicated), but worsen sleep in the long-term. While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep (i.e., inhibit NREM stage 1 and 2 sleep), while asleep, the drugs disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep slow-wave sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).\nOpioid-induced.\nOpioid medications such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, and morphine are used for insomnia that is associated with pain due to their analgesic properties and hypnotic effects. Opioids can fragment sleep and decrease REM and stage 2 sleep. By producing analgesia and sedation, opioids may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with pain-associated insomnia. However, dependence on opioids can lead to long-term sleep disturbances.\nRisk factors.\nInsomnia affects people of all age groups, but people in the following groups have a higher chance of acquiring insomnia:\nMechanism.\nTwo main models exist regarding the mechanism of insomnia: cognitive and physiological. The cognitive model suggests that rumination and hyperarousal contribute to preventing a person from falling asleep and might lead to an episode of insomnia.\nThe physiological model is based upon three major findings in people with insomnia; firstly, increased urinary cortisol and catecholamines have been found suggesting increased activity of the HPA axis and arousal; second, increased global cerebral glucose utilization during wakefulness and NREM sleep in people with insomnia; and lastly, increased full body metabolism and heart rate in those with insomnia. All these findings taken together suggest a deregulation of the arousal system, cognitive system, and HPA axis, all contributing to insomnia. However, it is unknown if the hyperarousal is a result of, or cause of insomnia. Altered levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA have been found, but the results have been inconsistent, and the implications of altered levels of such a ubiquitous neurotransmitter are unknown. Studies on whether insomnia is driven by circadian control over sleep or a wake-dependent process have shown inconsistent results, but some literature suggests a deregulation of the circadian rhythm based on core temperature. Increased beta activity and decreased delta wave activity has been observed on electroencephalograms; however, the implication of this is unknown.\nAround half of post-menopausal women experience sleep disturbances, and generally, sleep disturbance is about twice as common in women as men; this appears to be due in part, but not completely, to changes in hormone levels, especially in post-menopause.\nChanges in sex hormones in both men and women as they age may account in part for an increased prevalence of sleep disorders in older people.\nDiagnosis.\nIn medicine, insomnia is measured using the Athens insomnia scale (AIS). It measures eight parameters related to sleep, represented as an overall scale which assesses an individual's sleep quality. It has excellent internal consistency and re-test reliability. The Athens Insomnia Scale for Non-Clinical Populations (AIS-NCA) has been developed and validated in English, Chinese, and German to identify subclinical manifestations of insomnia in a language simpler than the Athens Insomnia Scale and more suitable for self-report. It uses four items to assess sleep problems and three items to assess impaired daytime functioning.\nA medical history and a physical examination can identify other conditions that could be the cause of insomnia. A comprehensive sleep history should include sleep habits and sleep environment, medications (prescription and non-prescription, including supplements), alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine intake, and co-morbid illnesses. A sleep diary can be used to track time to bed, total sleep time, time to sleep onset, number of awakenings, use of medications, time of awakening, and subjective feelings in the morning. The sleep diary can be replaced or validated by the use of out-patient actigraphy for a week or more, using a non-invasive device that measures movement.\nNot everyone who suffers from insomnia should routinely have a polysomnography study to screen for sleep disorders, but it may be indicated for those with risk factors for sleep apnea, including obesity, a thick neck diameter, or fullness of the flesh in the oropharynx. For most people, the test is not needed to make a diagnosis, and insomnia can often be treated by changing their schedule to make time for sufficient sleep and by improving sleep hygiene.\nSome patients may need an overnight sleep study in a sleep lab. Such a study will commonly involve assessment tools including a polysomnogram and the multiple sleep latency test. Specialists in sleep medicine are qualified to diagnose disorders according to the ICSD, 81 major sleep disorder diagnostic categories. Patients with some disorders, including delayed sleep phase disorder, are often misdiagnosed with primary insomnia; when a person has trouble getting to sleep and awakening at desired times, but has a normal sleep pattern once asleep, a circadian rhythm disorder is a likely cause.\nIn many cases, insomnia is co-morbid with another disease, side effects from medications, or a psychological problem. Approximately half of all diagnosed insomnia is related to psychiatric disorders. For those who have depression, \"insomnia should be regarded as a co-morbid condition, rather than as a secondary one;\" insomnia typically predates psychiatric symptoms. \"In fact, it is possible that insomnia represents a significant risk for the development of a subsequent psychiatric disorder.\" Insomnia occurs in between 60% and 80% of people with depression and can be a side effect of medications that treat depression.\nThe determination of causation is not necessary for a diagnosis.\nDSM-5 criteria.\nThe DSM-5 criteria for insomnia include the following:\n\"Predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, associated with one (or more) of the following symptoms\":\nIn addition:\nThe DSM-IV TR includes insomnia but does not fully elaborate on the symptoms compared to the DSM-5. Instead of early-morning waking as a symptom, the DSM-IV-TR listed \"nonrestorative sleep\" as a primary symptom. The duration of the experience was also vague in the DSM-IV-TR. The DSM-IV-TR stated that symptoms had to be present for a month, whereas the DSM-5 states that symptoms must be present for three months and occur at least three nights a week (Gillette).\nTypes.\nInsomnia can be classified as transient, acute, or chronic.\nPrevention.\nPrevention and treatment of insomnia may require a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, medications, and lifestyle changes.\nAmong lifestyle practices, going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day can create a steady pattern which may help to prevent insomnia. Avoidance of vigorous exercise and caffeinated drinks a few hours before going to sleep is recommended, while exercise earlier in the day may be beneficial. Other practices to improve sleep hygiene may include:\nManagement.\nIt is recommended to rule out medical and psychological causes before deciding on the treatment for insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. The beneficial effects, in contrast to those produced by medications, may last well beyond the stopping of therapy.\nMedications have been used mainly to reduce symptoms in insomnia of short duration; their role in the management of chronic insomnia remains unclear. Several different types of medications may be used. Many doctors do not recommend relying on prescription sleeping pills for long-term use. These medications are not recommended for more than four or five weeks, although they can be used longer in certain instances. It is also important to identify and treat other medical conditions that may be contributing to insomnia, such as depression, breathing problems, and chronic pain. As of 2022, many people with insomnia were reported as not receiving overall sufficient sleep or treatment for insomnia.\nNon-medication based.\nNon-medication-based strategies have comparable efficacy to hypnotic medication for insomnia, and they may have longer-lasting effects. Hypnotic medication is only recommended for short-term use because dependence with rebound withdrawal effects upon discontinuation or tolerance can develop.\nNon-medication-based strategies provide long-lasting improvements to insomnia and are recommended as a first-line and long-term strategy of management. Behavioral sleep medicine offers non-medication strategies to address chronic insomnia including sleep hygiene, stimulus control, behavioral interventions, sleep-restriction therapy, paradoxical intention, patient education, and relaxation therapy. Some examples are keeping a journal, restricting the time spent awake in bed, practicing relaxation techniques, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule and a wake-up time. Behavioral therapy can assist a patient in developing new sleep behaviors to improve sleep quality and consolidation. Behavioral therapy may include learning healthy sleep habits to promote sleep relaxation, undergoing light therapy to regulate the circadian rhythm, and regulating the circadian clock.\nMusic may improve insomnia in adults (see music and sleep). EEG biofeedback has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of insomnia with improvements in duration as well as the quality of sleep. Self-help therapy (defined as a psychological therapy that can be worked through on one's own) may improve sleep quality for adults with insomnia to a small or moderate degree.\nStimulus control therapy is a treatment for patients who have conditioned themselves to associate the bed or sleep in general with a negative response. As stimulus control therapy involves taking steps to control the sleep environment, it is sometimes referred to interchangeably with the concept of sleep hygiene. Examples of such environmental modifications include using the bed for sleep and sex only, not for activities such as reading or watching television; waking up at the same time every morning, including on weekends; going to bed only when sleepy and when there is a high likelihood that sleep will occur; leaving the bed and beginning an activity in another location if sleep does not occur in a reasonably brief period after getting into bed (commonly ~20 min); reducing the subjective effort and energy expended trying to fall asleep; avoiding exposure to bright light during night-time hours, and eliminating daytime naps.\nA component of stimulus control therapy is sleep restriction, a technique that aims to match the time spent in bed with the actual time spent asleep. This technique involves maintaining a strict sleep-wake schedule, sleeping only at certain times of the day and for specific amounts of time to induce mild sleep deprivation. Complete treatment usually lasts up to 3 weeks and involves making oneself sleep for only a minimum amount of time that they are actually capable of on average, and then, if capable (i.e. when sleep efficiency improves), slowly increasing this amount (~15 min) by going to bed earlier as the body attempts to reset its internal sleep clock. Bright light therapy may be effective for insomnia.\nParadoxical intention is a cognitive reframing technique where the insomniac, instead of attempting to fall asleep at night, makes every effort to stay awake (i.e., essentially stops trying to fall asleep). One theory that may explain the effectiveness of this method is that by not voluntarily making oneself go to sleep, it relieves the performance anxiety that arises from the need or requirement to fall asleep, which is meant to be a passive act. This technique has been shown to reduce sleep effort and performance anxiety and also lower subjective assessment of sleep-onset latency and overestimation of the sleep deficit (a quality found in many insomniacs).\nSleep Hygiene.\nSleep hygiene is a common term for all of the behaviors that relate to the promotion of good sleep. They include habits that provide a good foundation for sleep and help to prevent insomnia. However, sleep hygiene alone may not be adequate to address chronic insomnia. Sleep hygiene recommendations are typically included as one component of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Recommendations include reducing caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also help reduce the symptoms of insomnia.\nOn the other hand, a systematic review by the AASM concluded that clinicians should not prescribe sleep hygiene for insomnia due to the evidence of absence of its efficacy and potential delaying of adequate treatment, recommending instead that effective therapies such as CBT-i should be preferred.\nCognitive behavioral therapy.\nThere is some evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is superior not only in the long-term, but also in the short-term (2 months) to benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepines in the treatment and management of insomnia. In this therapy, patients are taught improved sleep habits and relieved of counter-productive assumptions about sleep. Common misconceptions and expectations that can be modified include:\nNumerous studies have reported positive outcomes of combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia treatment with treatments such as stimulus control and relaxation therapies. Hypnotic medications are equally effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia, but their effects wear off over time due to tolerance. The effects of CBT-I have sustained and lasting effects on treating insomnia long after therapy has been discontinued. The addition of hypnotic medications with CBT-I adds no benefit in insomnia. The long-lasting benefits of a course of CBT-I shows superiority over pharmacological hypnotic drugs. Even in the short term, when compared to short-term hypnotic medication such as zolpidem, CBT-I still shows significant superiority. Thus, CBT-I is recommended as a first-line treatment for insomnia.\nCommon forms of CBT-I treatments include stimulus control therapy, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, improved sleeping environments, relaxation training, paradoxical intention, and biofeedback. Sleep restriction (also called \"time-in-bed restriction\"), stimulus control and cognitive restructuring are key components.\nCBT is a well-accepted form of therapy for insomnia since it has no known adverse effects, whereas taking medications to alleviate insomnia symptoms has been shown to have adverse side effects. Nevertheless, the downside of CBT is that it may take a lot of time and motivation.\nAcceptance and commitment therapy.\nTreatments based on the principles of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and metacognition have emerged as alternative approaches to treating insomnia. ACT rejects the idea that behavioral changes can help insomniacs achieve better sleep since they require \"sleep efforts\" - actions which create more \"struggle\" and arouse the nervous system, leading to hyperarousal. The ACT approach posits that acceptance of the negative feelings associated with insomnia can, in time, create the right conditions for sleep. Mindfulness practice is a key feature of this approach, although mindfulness is not practiced to induce sleep (this in itself is a \"sleep effort\" to be avoided) but rather as a longer-term activity to help calm the nervous system and create the internal conditions from which sleep can emerge.\nA key distinction between CBT-I and ACT lies in the divergent approaches to time spent awake in bed. Proponents of CBT-i advocate minimizing time spent awake in bed, on the basis that this creates a cognitive association between being in bed and wakefulness. The ACT approach proposes that avoiding time in bed may increase the pressure to sleep and arouse the nervous system further.\nResearch has shown that \"ACT has a significant effect on primary and comorbid insomnia and sleep quality, and ... can be used as an appropriate treatment method to control and improve insomnia\".\nInternet Interventions.\nDespite the therapeutic effectiveness and proven success of CBT, treatment availability is significantly limited by a lack of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, and expense. One way to potentially overcome these barriers is to use the Internet to deliver treatment, making this effective intervention more accessible and less costly. The Internet has already become a critical source of health care and medical information. Although the vast majority of health websites provide general information, there is growing research literature on the development and evaluation of Internet interventions.\nThese online programs are typically behaviorally based treatments that have been operationalized and transformed for delivery via the Internet. They are usually highly structured, automated, or human-supported, based on effective face-to-face treatment; personalized to the user; interactive; enhanced by graphics, animations, audio, and possibly video; and tailored to provide follow-up and feedback.\nThere is good evidence for the use of computer-based CBT for insomnia.\nMedications.\nMany people with insomnia use sleeping tablets and other sedatives. In some places, medications are prescribed in over 95% of cases. They, however, are a second line treatment. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration stated it is going to require warnings for eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem, due to concerns about serious injuries resulting from abnormal sleep behaviors, including sleepwalking or driving a vehicle while asleep.\nThe percentage of adults using a prescription sleep aid increases with age. During 2005\u20132010, about 4% of U.S. adults aged 20 and over reported that they took prescription sleep aids in the past 30 days. Rates of use were lowest among the youngest age group (those aged 20\u201339) at about 2%, increased to 6% among those aged 50\u201359, and reached 7% among those aged 80 and over. More adult women (5%) reported using prescription sleep aids than adult men (3%). Non-Hispanic white adults reported higher use of sleep aids (5%) than non-Hispanic black (3%) and Mexican-American (2%) adults. No difference was shown between non-Hispanic black adults and Mexican-American adults in use of prescription sleep aids.\nAntihistamines.\nAs an alternative to taking prescription drugs, some evidence shows that an average person seeking short-term help may find relief by taking over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or doxylamine. Diphenhydramine and doxylamine are widely used in nonprescription sleep aids. They are the most effective over-the-counter sedatives currently available, at least in much of Europe, Canada, Australia, and the United States, and are more sedating than some prescription hypnotics. Antihistamine effectiveness for sleep may decrease over time, and anticholinergic side-effects (such as dry mouth) may also be a drawback with these particular drugs. While addiction does not seem to be an issue with this class of drugs, they can induce dependence and rebound effects upon abrupt cessation of use. However, people whose insomnia is caused by restless legs syndrome may have worsened symptoms with antihistamines.\nAntidepressants.\nWhile insomnia is a common symptom of depression, antidepressants are effective for treating sleep problems whether or not they are associated with depression. While all antidepressants help regulate sleep, some antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, doxepin, mirtazapine, trazodone, and trimipramine, can have an immediate sedative effect and are prescribed to treat insomnia. Trazodone was at the beginning of the 2020s the most prescribed drug for sleep in the United States despite not being indicated for sleep.\nAmitriptyline, doxepin, and trimipramine all have antihistaminergic, anticholinergic, antiadrenergic, and antiserotonergic properties, which contribute to both their therapeutic effects and side effect profiles, while mirtazapine's actions are primarily antihistaminergic and antiserotonergic and trazodone's effects are primarily antiadrenergic and antiserotonergic. Mirtazapine is known to decrease sleep latency (i.e., the time it takes to fall asleep), promoting sleep efficiency and increasing the total amount of sleeping time in people with both depression and insomnia.\nAgomelatine, a melatonergic antidepressant with claimed sleep-improving qualities that does not cause daytime drowsiness, is approved for the treatment of depression though not sleep conditions in the European Union and Australia. After trials in the United States, its development for use there was discontinued in October 2011 by Novartis, who had bought the rights to market it there from the European pharmaceutical company Servier.\nA 2018 Cochrane review found the safety of taking antidepressants for insomnia to be uncertain with no evidence supporting long term use.\nMelatonin agonists.\nMelatonin receptor agonists such as melatonin and ramelteon are used in the treatment of insomnia. Prolonged-release melatonin improves insomnia mainly in adults \u226555, and ramelteon improves sleep generally, with both effective versus placebo but less effective than most licensed insomnia drugs and showing limited long-term benefits.\nThe usage of melatonin as a treatment for insomnia in adults has increased from 0.4% between 1999 and 2000 to nearly 2.1% between 2017 and 2018.\nWhile the use of melatonin in the short term has been proven to be generally safe and is shown not to be a dependent medication, side effects can still occur.\nMost common side effects of melatonin include:\nStudies have also shown that children who have an autism spectrum disorder or a learning disability, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or related neurological diseases, can benefit from the use of melatonin. This is because they often have trouble sleeping due to their disorders. For example, children with ADHD tend to have trouble falling asleep because of their hyperactivity and, as a result, tend to be tired during most of the day. Another cause of insomnia in children with ADHD is the use of stimulants to treat their disorder. Children who have ADHD, as well as the other disorders mentioned, may be given melatonin before bedtime to help them sleep.\nBenzodiazepines.\nThe most commonly used class of hypnotics for insomnia are the benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are not significantly better for insomnia than antidepressants. Chronic users of hypnotic medications for insomnia do not have better sleep than chronic insomniacs not taking medications. In fact, chronic users of hypnotic medications have more regular night-time awakenings than insomniacs not taking hypnotic medications. Many have concluded that these drugs cause an unjustifiable risk to the individual and to public health and lack evidence of long-term effectiveness. It is preferred that hypnotics be prescribed for only a few days at the lowest effective dose and avoided altogether wherever possible, especially in the elderly. Between 1993 and 2010, the prescribing of benzodiazepines to individuals with sleep disorders has decreased from 24% to 11% in the US, coinciding with the first release of nonbenzodiazepines.\nThe benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medications also have several side effects, such as daytime fatigue, motor vehicle crashes and other accidents, cognitive impairments, and falls and fractures. Elderly people are more sensitive to these side effects. Some benzodiazepines have demonstrated effectiveness in sleep maintenance in the short term but in the longer term benzodiazepines can lead to tolerance, physical dependence, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome upon discontinuation, and long-term worsening of sleep, especially after consistent usage over long periods. Benzodiazepines, while inducing unconsciousness, actually worsen sleep as \u2013 like alcohol \u2013 they promote light sleep while decreasing time spent in deep sleep. A further problem is, with regular use of short-acting sleep aids for insomnia, daytime rebound anxiety can emerge. Although there is little evidence for benefit of benzodiazepines in insomnia compared to other treatments and evidence of major harm, prescriptions have continued to increase. This is likely due to their addictive nature, both due to misuse and because \u2013 through their rapid action, tolerance and withdrawal they can \"trick\" insomniacs into thinking they are helping with sleep. There is a general awareness that long-term use of benzodiazepines for insomnia in most people is inappropriate and that a gradual withdrawal is usually beneficial due to the adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines and is recommended whenever possible.\nBenzodiazepines all bind unselectively to the GABAA receptor. Some theorize that certain benzodiazepines (hypnotic benzodiazepines) have significantly higher activity at the \u03b11 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to other benzodiazepines (for example, triazolam and temazepam have significantly higher activity at the \u03b11 subunit compared to alprazolam and diazepam, making them superior sedative-hypnotics\u00a0\u2013 alprazolam and diazepam, in turn, have higher activity at the \u03b12 subunit compared to triazolam and temazepam, making them superior anxiolytic agents). Modulation of the \u03b11 subunit is associated with sedation, motor impairment, respiratory depression, amnesia, ataxia, and reinforcing behavior (drug-seeking behavior). Modulation of the \u03b12 subunit is associated with anxiolytic activity and disinhibition. For this reason, certain benzodiazepines may be better suited to treat insomnia than others.\nZ-Drugs.\nNonbenzodiazepine or Z-drug sedative\u2013hypnotic drugs, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, and eszopiclone, are a class of hypnotic medications that are similar to benzodiazepines in their mechanism of action, and indicated for mild to moderate insomnia. Their effectiveness at improving time to sleeping is slight, and they have similar\u2014though potentially less severe\u2014side effect profiles compared to benzodiazepines. Prescribing of nonbenzodiazepines has seen a general increase since their initial release on the US market in 1992, from 2.3% in 1993 among individuals with sleep disorders to 13.7% in 2010.\nOrexin antagonists.\nOrexin receptor antagonists are a more recently introduced class of sleep medications and include suvorexant, lemborexant, and daridorexant, all of which are FDA-approved for treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. They are oriented towards blocking signals in the brain that stimulate wakefulness, therefore claiming to address insomnia without creating dependence. There are three dual orexin receptor (DORA) drugs on the market: Belsomra (Merck), Dayvigo (Eisai) and Quviviq (Idorsia).\nAntipsychotics.\nCertain atypical antipsychotics, particularly quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone, are used in the treatment of insomnia. However, while common, the use of antipsychotics for this indication is not recommended as the evidence does not demonstrate a benefit, and the risk of adverse effects is significant. A major 2022 systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for insomnia in adults found that quetiapine did not demonstrate any short-term benefits for insomnia. Some of the more serious adverse effects may also occur at the low doses used, such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia. Such concerns of risks at low doses are supported by Danish observational studies that showed an association of use of low-dose quetiapine (excluding prescriptions filled for tablet strengths &gt;50\u00a0mg) with an increased risk of major cardiovascular events as compared to use of Z-drugs, with most of the risk being driven by cardiovascular death. Laboratory data from an unpublished analysis of the same cohort also support the lack of dose-dependency of metabolic side effects, as new use of low-dose quetiapine was associated with a risk of increased fasting triglycerides at one-year follow-up. Concerns regarding side effects are greater in the elderly.\nOther sedatives.\nGabapentinoids like gabapentin and pregabalin have sleep-promoting effects, but are not commonly used for the treatment of insomnia. Gabapentin is not effective in helping alcohol related insomnia.\nBarbiturates, while once used, are no longer recommended for insomnia due to the risk of addiction and other side effects.\nComparative effectiveness.\nMedications for the treatment of insomnia have a wide range of effect sizes. When comparing drugs such as benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, sedative antidepressants and antihistamines, quetiapine, orexin receptor antagonists, and melatonin receptor agonists, the orexin antagonist lemborexant and the Z-drug eszopiclone had the best profiles overall in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability.\nAlternative medicine.\nHerbal products, such as valerian, kava, chamomile, and lavender, have been used to treat insomnia. However, there is no quality evidence that they are effective and safe. The same is true for cannabis and cannabinoids. It is likewise unclear whether acupuncture is useful in the treatment of insomnia.\nPrognosis.\nA survey of 1.1 million residents in the United States found that those who reported sleeping about 7 hours per night had the lowest rates of mortality, whereas those who slept for fewer than 6 hours or more than 8 hours had higher mortality rates. Severe insomnia\u2014sleeping less than 3.5 hours in women and 4.5 hours in men\u2014is associated with a 15% increase in mortality, while getting 8.5 or more hours of sleep per night was associated with a 15% higher mortality rate.\nWith this technique, it is difficult to distinguish the lack of sleep caused by a disorder, which is also a cause of premature death, versus a disorder that causes a lack of sleep, and the lack of sleep, causing premature death. Most of the increase in mortality from severe insomnia was discounted after controlling for associated disorders. After controlling for sleep duration and insomnia, the use of sleeping pills was also found to be associated with an increased mortality rate.\nThe lowest mortality was seen in individuals who slept between six and a half and seven and a half hours nightly. Even sleeping only 4.5 hours per night is associated with a very small increase in mortality. Thus, mild to moderate insomnia for most people is associated with increased longevity, and severe insomnia is associated only with a very small effect on mortality. It is unclear why sleeping longer than 7.5 hours is associated with excess mortality.\nEpidemiology.\nBetween 10% and 30% of adults have insomnia at any given point in time and up to half of people have insomnia in a given year, making it the most common sleep disorder. About 6% of people have insomnia that is not due to another problem and lasts for more than a month. People over the age of 65 are affected more often than younger people. Females are more often affected than males. Insomnia is 40% more common in women than in men.\nThere are higher rates of insomnia reported among university students compared to the general population.\nSociety and culture.\nThe word insomnia is from + \"without sleep\" and \"-ia\" as a nominalizing suffix.\nThe popular press have published stories about people who supposedly never sleep, such as that of Th\u00e1i Ng\u1ecdc and Al Herpin. Horne writes \"everybody sleeps and needs to do so\", and generally this appears true. However, he also relates from contemporary accounts the case of Paul Kern, who was shot in 1915 fighting in World War I and then \"never slept again\" until he died in 1955. Kern appears to be a completely isolated, unique case.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are depicted as fighter-bombers of the Galactic Republic, Rebel Alliance, New Republic and the Resistance. Within the \"Star Wars\" setting, Y-wings are known for being ideally suited for anti-shipping, close air support, air interdiction, escort, force protection and ground attack missions. Y-wings made their first theatrical appearance in \"\" and have featured in movies, television shows, and the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe's books, comics, and games.\nOrigin and design.\nColin Cantwell, who also designed the saga's TIE fighters, initially designed the Y-wing with a large bubble turret for a gunner. However, the dome did not appear properly when filmed against bluescreen and subsequent designs omitted the turret.\nDepiction.\nBased on \"Star Wars\" supplemental reference material, the Galactic Republic commissioned Koensayr Manufacturing to produce the BTL-B Y-wing during the early part of the Clone Wars. This original model of the Y-wing, as depicted in the \"\" 2008 television series, features a forward module seating a pilot in the cockpit and a gunner in a bubble turret. An astromech droid (which served as the fighter's navigation system) fits into a dedicated socket behind them. The module contains the starfighter's armaments: two forward-firing laser cannons, twin ion cannons in the turret, and a pair of torpedo launchers with six-round magazines capable of launching bombs, cluster missiles and other ordnance. The module connects to two powerful ion engines via reinforced central spar and cross wing, all encased in heavy armor plating. Modified and retrofitted versions of the original Y-wing (BTL-B) include the BTL-S3, which replaces the bubble turret with a remote-controlled turret and seats the gunner behind the pilot in the cockpit, and the BTL-A4, which removes the gunner altogether and gives the pilot control of the ion cannons.\nReference material states that the Y-wings were prized for their durability and long-range striking capability during the Clone Wars. However, when the war concluded and the Galactic Empire came to power, Y-wings were decommissioned and relegated to military surplus sellers or scrapyards. The nascent Rebel Alliance sought to buy or commandeer as many Y-wings as possible. In the \"Star Wars Rebels\" 2014 animated series, the crew of the \"Ghost\" are shown stealing decommissioned Old Republic Y-wings, in the process of being dismantled by the Galactic Empire, for use by the Rebellion. Once acquired, Rebel technicians modified the fighter-bombers to make them more suitable to the Rebellion's hit-and-run tactics. Armor plating was removed to save on weight and make it easier to perform maintenance, compensated for by increasing deflector shield power. Various other components were removed or rearranged - such as replacing the six-round torpedo magazines with four-round versions - to lighten weight and increase performance while maintaining overall integrity. The resulting modification made these Rebel Y-wings faster and more lethal than their original version, and they soon became the most readily available starfighters to the Rebellion during the Galactic Civil War.\nY-wings make a theatrical appearance in \"Rogue One\" (2016), an anthology film set immediately prior to the events of the original \"Star Wars\" film. Here the Y-wings of Gold Squadron are shown playing a pivotal role during the Battle of Scarif in disabling an Imperial Star Destroyer with ion torpedoes. The same Gold Squadron features in the original \"Star Wars\" movie (1977) as they take part in the attack on the Death Star. Led by squadron leader Jon Vander (Angus MacInnes), Y-wings made the first unsuccessful \"trench run\" on the Death Star's exhaust port, and only one Y-wing would survive the battle itself. (The pilot of the surviving Y-Wing was identified in \"Star Wars Legends\" sources as Keyan Farlander but was later revised to be Evaan Verlaine following the acquisition by Disney). Luke Skywalker pilots a Y-wing in the animated segment of the 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special. Y-wings made a brief appearance at the end of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) when the heroes are reunited with the Rebel fleet, and feature alongside other Rebel starfighters during the climatic space battle of \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983).\nBackground material further describes that, after the defeat of the Empire, Koensayr introduced a new version of the Y-wing to capitalize on the fighter's popularity. This BTA-NR2 model emulates the look of the Rebel-modified Y-wings both because the public was more familiar with this version and because it allowed for greater customization. While outwardly mimicking the \"classic\" Y-wing design, the BTA-NR2 features various upgrades including stronger shields and more sophisticated sensors. These versions of the Y-wing would appear during the climax of \"\" (2019) as the Resistance attempts to defeat the reborn Emperor Palpatine.\nAnalysis.\nIn 2018, various \"Star Wars\" starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. Of those tested, the Y-wing had a drag coefficient of .68, which, while worse than the real-life example of the F-4E Phantom with a rating of .02, was better than that of most TIE Fighters tested. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel and that \"Star Wars\" fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.\nCultural impact.\nKen Napzok in \"Why We Love Star Wars: The Great Moments That Built a Galaxy Far, Far Away\" argues that the Y-wing is the true workhorse of the Rebellion but that it gets unfairly overshadowed by the classic X-wing and other starfighters. Admitting that it is a slower and bulkier design, he nevertheless points out the critical role it played in the \"Rogue One\" movie proved its worth as a vital Rebel asset for softening Imperial defenses. He also highlights a larger point that such fun and often silly debates about little details in the \"Star Wars\" saga are what attract many fans to the series.\nWriting for the \"Smithsonian\", Cory Graff contrasts the Y-wing and X-wing working together with another complimentary pair: the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane during the Battle of Britain. He states that the X-wing's popularity \"is not unlike the preference wartime magazine photographers showed toward the stunning Spitfire fighter, while the workhorse Hurricane was all but ignored. Lucas\u2019 war-wagon Y-wing received similar treatment.\" The in-universe explanation for how the Y-wing was stripped down to make it faster mirrors how many fighters of the time were similarly converted for reconnaissance duties. He also draws parallels between the design of the Y-wing and another fighter, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, with both featuring centrally-located cockpits and twin booms.\nIn July 2024, a miniature of the Y-wing, used in the filming of the original \"Star Wars\" movie and identified as the model flown by Gold Leader, was sold at auction for $1.55 million USD. It was one of only two \"hero\" miniatures that were created for filming close-up shots. The auction was held by Heritage Auctions, which began the bidding at $300,000.\nLego has released multiple Y-wing sets starting with their first one in 1999, which was part of a combo pack along with a TIE Fighter. Two of these were part of the Ultimate Collector Series (UCS), one in 2004 and again in 2018, which have high piece counts and meticulous detailing. The second UCS Y-wing set consisted of 1,967 pieces and when fully constructed measured 2 inches high by 24 inches long and 11 inches wide. It also came with a display stand and sold at retail for $199.99 USD.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50801", "revid": "32807689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50801", "title": "X-wing fighter", "text": "Fictional fighter craft\nThe X-wing starfighter is a name applied to a family of fictional spacecraft manufactured by the Incom Corporation and later the Incom-FreiTek Corporation from the \"Star Wars\" franchise. Named for the distinctive shape made when its s-foils (wings) are in attack position, the X-wing was a class of starfighter used by the Rebel Alliance in their conflict with the Galactic Empire. It made its theatrical debut, as the T-65B model, in \"Star Wars\" (1977) as the spacecraft piloted by Luke Skywalker and the Red Squadron when Luke destroyed the Death Star. The starfighter featured extensively in the \"Star Wars\" original trilogy and in the Expanded Universe that followed, and has been merchandised as a variety of toys and models.\nStarting with \"The Force Awakens\" (2015), a new model of X-wing was introduced, which has gone on to play a prominent role in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The T-70 X-wing, flown by the Resistance in their fight against the First Order, is depicted as the successor to the T-65. Although described as being an improvement over the original, in the expanded literature this new X-wing is itself considered outdated, having been replaced by the T-85 X-wing in the New Republic's defense fleet. The T-85 X-wing made its first appearance in the TV series \"Star Wars Resistance\" (2018).\nOrigin and design.\nColin Cantwell sketched and built models that eventually became the final X-wing fighter in \"Star Wars\". The X-wings were designed to appear more \"traditional\" than the Empire's TIE fighters. ILM built miniatures in various scales, with wing markings indicating which prop represented which pilot. When ILM fell behind on generating X-wing footage, \"Star Wars\" creator/director George Lucas and his editors temporarily used World War II dogfight footage for initial editing cuts. Each X-wing model was built around a hollow core made from surgical tubing, which allowed lighting, cooling, and electrical connectors for the wing motors to be installed and maintained. The cockpit windows were made from faceted glass so that accurate reflections could be filmed. Although the movie's initial script and novelization describe the X-wings as belonging to \"Blue squadron\", limitations in bluescreen photography led to the markings on the filming models, as well as the fictional squadron affiliation being changed to red.\nIn addition to miniatures, special effects expert John Stears and his crew made a single, full-size X-wing for scenes in the Rebels' Yavin 4 base hangar; combined with cardboard cutouts and careful editing, the Rebels appear to have dozens of fighters. The production crew also made a full-size X-wing cockpit that was used for all actors; the astromech droid visible behind each actor was changed for each starfighter. Background noise pitch and tone also varied between X-wings to further differentiate the characters piloting them.\nThe \"lake\" in which Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) crashes his X-wing in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was only deep, requiring the creation of a rig resembling the starfighter sitting in the lake at an angle. The rig was built in hinged sections so it could be manipulated by frogmen to sink or rise, a key feature for the scene when Luke fails to levitate his ship from the water.\nIn 1993, ILM visual effects specialist John Knoll created a proof of concept test of dogfighting X-wings and TIE fighters to demonstrate the feasibility of using commercially available desktop computer software for simple animation work. This resulted in numerous parts of space battle scenes being \"re-shot\" as digital animations for the original trilogy's Special Edition releases. The ARC-170 starfighter seen in \"\" is the ancestor of the X-wing and is deliberately reminiscent of the X-wing's design.\nDepiction.\nThe T-65B X-wing was produced by the Incom Corporation, which had previously supplied the ARC-170 and Z-95 Headhunter starfighters to the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. When the Galactic Empire ordered them to produce a new starfighter for the Imperial Navy, Incom engineers took inspiration from their previous work to create the X-wing. Production was already underway however when politicking resulted in the Empire choosing instead to go with Sienar Fleet Systems' TIE fighter. Faced with an overproduction of expensive starfighters, a new market was found when agents of the Rebel Alliance contacted Incom about acquiring their stock of X-wings, to which Incom eagerly agreed. The X-wing quickly became a symbol of the Rebellion thanks to its use in several spectacular victories and the role it played in ultimately defeating the Empire. After the defeat of the Empire, the X-wing starfighters became a staple of the New Republic fleet and later the Resistance, with Incom-FreiTek supplying upgraded T-70 and T-85 models.\nCompared to the TIE fighter, the X-wing is said to be slower and less maneuverable in space, but boasts superior firepower, defenses, atmospheric maneuverability, and a supraluminal hyperdrive. Its four laser canons can be fired singly, in pairs or all at once, and each launcher can carry up to three proton torpedoes. In addition to deflector shields, the X-wing possesses a titanium alloy armored hull, electronic countermeasures, and armored cockpit. An inertial dampener protects the pilot from high-g maneuvers, while an anti-gravity \"repulsorlift\" provides for flight in planetary atmospheres.\nThe T-65B X-wing's distinctive strike foils or \"S-foils\" are opened and closed by powerful servo motors in the spacecraft. When in the open or 'attack' position, they provided a greater range of fire to the laser cannons mounted on the end of each wing. They also serve to distribute energy to enlarge the deflector shield, shed waste heat, and function as stabilizer surfaces during air travel.\nInstead of a dedicated navigational system, the X-wing makes use of an astromech droid (such as R2-D2) which fits in a socket behind the cockpit. The droid can hold up to 10 hyperspace coordinates, make minor repairs to the craft, and assume full control of the X-wing if needed. As with the pilot's ejection seat, an explosive charge can eject the droid from the X-wing in an emergency.\nIn \"Legends\".\nAccording to roleplaying and other literature prior to Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, the origin of the X-wing is somewhat different compared to later material. Incom Corporation had already begun designing the X-wing when the Empire's Imperial Security Bureau began to suspect the company of Rebel sympathies. Before the empire could seize control of the company, the designers defected to the Rebel Alliance and handed over the X-wing's schematics.\nThe Rebel Alliance adopted the military strategy of \"Doctrine of Space Denial\", wherein the Rebellion would raid Imperial boneyards and shipping frigates, both to disrupt Imperial logistics and operations, and also to requisition desperately needed materials. X-wing hyperdrive capabilities allowed for this kind of harassment and escape before the Empire could react. The presence of a hyperdrive and deflector shields differentiate the X-wing from the Empire's TIE fighters, emphasizing the importance the Rebels place on pilots surviving their missions.\nNovels and roleplaying material set after \"Return of the Jedi\" showed the X-wing continued to be refined and upgraded in service to the New Republic; the \"XJ\"-series X-wings, depicted in the war against the Yuuzhan Vong, have a third proton torpedo launcher, stronger lasers and improved engines.\nMerchandise and licensing.\nKenner Toys produced an X-wing toy as a complement to its action figure line in 1978; this model was made from formed plastic and had a battery-operated light and buzzer in the forward fuselage. The \"s-foils\" were activated by depressing the molded astromech droid. In 1982, a \"battle-damaged\" version was released using the same mold but with damage stickers, a grey fuselage, blackened engine inlets, and a darker canopy. In countries outside the U.S., the electronics were removed and the R2-D2 \u201cbutton\u201d was chrome (apart from the U.S., the electronic X-wing was only available in Brazil, Canada, and France). Kenner also produced a die-cast 1:72 miniature X-wing in 1978 and a smaller scaled version with \"battle damage crash feature\" for the short lived Micro Collection line in 1982.\nThe X-wing appeared in four Micro Machines three-packs, including the first \"Star Wars\" pack released, a bronzed version, and a pack of three \"battle damaged\" X-wings with different colored markings. The Micro Machines X-wing has also been released in two single-packs, as a promotional souvenir with German video releases, in a nine-pack of \"Original Trilogy\" vehicles, and once in clear plastic. The X-wing appears eight times in the Micro Machines Action Fleet toy line: Luke's starfighter on its own, with \"targeter\" stand, with Dagobah swamp damage, and in a double pack with a TIE Fighter, Wedge's starfighter on its own, and as a component of the Yavin Rebel Base playset, a toy based on the prototype packaged with Biggs Darklighter's starfighter, and Jek Porkins' starfighter.\nLego also released numerous X-wing models, including a 76-piece miniature X-wing/TIE advanced kit, a 263-piece X-wing (1999/2002), a 563-piece X-wing kit with Yoda's Hut (2004), a 437-piece X-Wing (2006), a 560-piece X-wing (2012), a 730-piece X-wing (2018), and a 474-piece Luke Skywalker's X-wing Fighter (2021). A 1,304-piece \"Ultimate Collector's\" model was released in 2000. A new \"Ultimate Collector's\" model with 1,559 pieces was released in 2013. In 2019, the Lego Group's annual Christmas gift to employees was a 1,038-piece Christmas X-wing, which also included Yoda's igloo and a sleigh. In addition to the original T-65 X-wing, Lego has released several models of the newer T-70 X-wing. These include the black/orange Poe's X-wing Fighter (2015), the gray/blue Resistance X-wing Fighter (2016) and orange/white Poe Dameron's X-wing Fighter (2020), as well as several small mini-scale versions.\nX-wings also appear in numerous \"Star Wars\" games and Expanded Universe stories. The player pilots an X-wing in the Atari \"Star Wars\" game. It is also a playable ship in numerous LucasArts games, and is the eponymous vessel in the first of several . Both the ' and ' rail shooters include X-wing levels, and X-wing squadrons are controllable units in the ' and ' strategy games. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published X-wing and X-wing-related cards for the \"Star Wars Customizable Card Game\" and \"Star Wars Trading Card Game\", respectively. Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston wrote the ' novel series that focuses on the X-wing pilots of Rogue Squadron and Wraith Squadron, the former expanding the story of pilots like Wedge Antilles who appear in the films. Dark Horse Comics has also published an \"X-Wing Rogue Squadron\" series. In 2012, Fantasy Flight Games released the ' featuring several pilots and variations of the ship. The X-wing also included in its \"Star Wars: Armada\" miniatures game and \"\" board game.\nCultural influence.\nA model of Luke Skywalker's X-wing was among 250 \"Star Wars\"-related items on display at the National Air and Space Museum celebrating the franchise's twentieth anniversary. An original X-wing filming prop sold at auction for $160,000 in July 2016. In 2007, the San Diego Tripoli Rocket Association built and launched a X-wing model propelled by four rockets, which disintegrated seconds after liftoff. A life-size X-wing is suspended from the ceiling at the Star Trader gift shop in Disneyland in California, as well as one displayed outdoors by the Star Tours attraction at Disneyland Paris. A life-size X-wing made from Lego blocks appeared in Times Square, and a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444-size replica is on display at the Wings Over the Rockies Air &amp; Space Museum in Denver.\nIn 2018, a number of \"Star Wars\" starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. When tested, the classic T-65 X-wing design had a drag coefficient of 0.45, which is only slightly better than the coefficient of a sphere. The newer T-70 X-wing flown by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) was more aerodynamically sound with a rating of 0.24, but still fell short of the F-4E Phantom with its 0.02 drag coefficient. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that Star Wars fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.\nIn 2016, Hot Wheels once again created a \"Star Wars\"-themed full-sized car, this time was a depiction of the X-wing (dubbed as the 'carship', a combination of 'starships' and 'cars') to coincide the release of the Star Wars Carships line. The car's design was said to be inspired by most of the open- wheeled race cars. It was showcased at San Diego Comic-Con that year and currently as part of the Garage of Legends car collection.\nIn 2023, Heritage Auctions sold an original 20-inch model of an X-wing starfighter used in the climatic space battle in 1977\u2019s \"Star Wars\" for a record-setting $3.135 million.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Designed and manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering, they are the fastest ship in the Rebel Fleet (not including hyperspace travel). The A-Wing was conceived for high-speed surgical strikes, deep reconnaissance, and escort fighter duty.\nA-wings first appear in \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983) and later in numerous \"Star Wars\" materials and productions. It gained popularity through its depiction in several video games, and since 1985 the A-wing has been merchandised by several companies. They are the fastest vessels in the \"Star Wars\" canon, with the advantage of being the smallest hyperspace drive-equipped craft without relying on a carrier, allowing the vessel to extricate itself from a losing battle or to escape hostile territory after performing an attack.\nAppearances.\nRZ-1 A-wings from Green Squadron participate in the climactic Battle of Endor depicted in \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983). At Endor, an A-wing piloted by Arvel Crynyd (Hilton McRae) crashes into the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer \"Executor\", resulting in the \"Executor\" crashing out of control into the second Death Star. In addition to McRae, two women recorded A-wing cockpit footage; one of the actors was cut, and the other was dubbed over by a male actor.\nA-wings later appear in various \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe television shows, books, and games. Some Expanded Universe material says Jan Dodonna created the A-wing based on his analysis of the role of speed in the Battle of Yavin, the climactic battle in \"Star Wars\" (1977). Later material, such as the \"Star Wars Rebels\" television series, depicts the starfighters in use before the events of \"Star Wars\".\nThe A-wings of Phoenix Squadron play an important role in \"Rebels\"' second season (2015\u20132016). \"Rebels\" producers used the A-wing in part because the ship was not used much in \"Return of the Jedi\" The fighter's presence in the cartoon was meant to show that different groups used different craft to fight the Empire. The series's episodes \"The Holocrons of Fate\" and \"Twin Suns\" also feature the two-seater RZ-1T trainer, a training spacecraft used by the rebels to train recruits. The RZ-1T also appears in the novel \"Battlefront II: Inferno Squad\".\nThe RZ-1 A-Wing is based on the R-22 A-Wing, also made by Kuat Systems Engineering.\nA later variant, the RZ-2 A-wing, features in \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" and in \"\". It is a bigger spacecraft used by the Resistance against the First Order.\nConcept and design.\nThe A-wing was one of two new Rebel Alliance starfighters created for \"Return of the Jedi\". It was dubbed the \"A fighter\" because it was the first of the two designs created. Ralph McQuarrie's production paintings of A-wing starfighters were completed after filming and displayed alternative blue markings.\nJoe Johnston designed the ship, Wesley Seeds and Lorne Peterson of Industrial Light &amp; Magic built the model, and its pilot figure is based on a World War I German airman. A battle-damaged engine \"wing\" was snapped into place to represent Arvel Crynyd's damaged fighter as it crashed into the \"Executor\".\nMcQuarrie's alternative blue-and-white coloring was used for the craft's appearance in \"Rebels.\" Photographs from the filming of \"\" show an A-wing on the film set. \"Screen Rant\" suggests the A-wing seen in the photographs evokes some of McQuarrie's interpretation of the design, such as the blaster cannon shape and the presence of additional ports in the cockpit.\nDepiction.\nAccording to \"Star Wars\" canon, the A-wing was first produced by Kuat Systems Engineering, which had built the Delta-7 starfighter for the Jedi Order. With the Jedi eradicated (as depicted in \"\") and the Delta-7 nearly impossible for non-Jedi to pilot, Kuat designed a new starfighter, the R-22 A-wing, in hopes the Galactic Empire would purchase it. While impressed with prototypes of the R-22, the Empire instead went with the TIE fighter, and forbade Kuat from mass-producing the A-wing. The prototypes were sold to the kingdom of Tammuz-an, which over a decade later were eventually sold to the Rebel Alliance.\nRebel engineers made many alterations to the original R-22 design to produce the RZ-1 model as seen in \"Return of the Jedi\". The original engines were swapped out for more powerful ones, while other major components were replaced with lightweight versions so a supraluminal hyperdrive could be added. The resulting fighter is faster than even the Empire's TIE interceptor and perfect for hit-and-run attacks, long-range patrols, and reconnaissance missions. Its two Borstel RG-9 laser cannons, mounted on special swivel mounts, can elevate or depress 60\u00b0 vertically; some were modified for full 360\u00b0 rotation but these had a greater chance to jam. However, engineers could not fit the A-wing with an astromech droid, which limited how many hyperspace coordinates it could carry. The lack of droid assistance also makes it challenging even for a being with Jedi-like reflexes to control a fighter so fast and maneuverable. Consequently, only the best Rebel pilots are allowed to fly the A-wing.\nAfter the Empire was defeated, background material explains how Kuat Systems Engineering made a number of improvements to the design to create the RZ-2 A-wing for the New Republic Defense Fleet. Even faster than the original, the RZ-2 requires less maintenance than the RZ-1, and the swivel mounts that allow its laser cannons to rotate 360\u00b0 were no longer at risk of jamming. Thanks to the New Republic's disarmament campaign, RZ-2s found their way into the Resistance, which like the Rebellion before allows only the best pilots to fly the A-wing.\nImpact.\n\"CinemaBlend\" said the A-wing received little attention after \"Return of the Jedi\" because no prominent characters pilot the craft. Kenner in 1985 released an A-wing pilot figure as part of its \"Power of the Force\" line, and it released a \"magnificent\" A-wing toy as part of the \"\" line. Since then, the A-wing has been recreated as various other toys, models, and collectibles by companies that include Galoob, Hasbro, Model Products Corporation, Estes Industries, Lego, and Fantasy Flight Games.\n\"Screen Rant\" said the A-wing gained popularity as a playable craft in the \"\" space combat simulator (1993), which \"The Escapist\" said depicted the ship as \"an excellent dogfighter\". Subsequent video games that allowed players to pilot the A-wing also contributed to the ship's popularity. \"Blastr\" ranked the A-wing 16th on its list of the best \"Star Wars\" vehicles.\nPrince Harry was photographed sitting in an A-wing cockpit during his and the Duke of Cambridge's April 2016 visit to the \"Star Wars: Episode VIII\" set. Responding to the photographs, various publications called the A-wing \"iconic\", an \"unsung hero\", \"woefully underappreciated\", and \"a classic\".\nIn 2018 a number of \"Star Wars\" starfighters - including the A-wing - had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program. Of those starfighters tested the A-wing was among the most aerodynamic designs of all with a drag coefficient of .17, though it was still worse than the real-life example of the F-4E Phantom with a .02 rating. These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that \"Star Wars\" fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50803", "revid": "6326132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50803", "title": "Victimless crime", "text": "Concept in criminology\nA victimless crime is an illegal act that typically either directly involves only the perpetrator or occurs between consenting adults. Because it is consensual in nature, whether there involves a victim is a matter of debate. Definitions of victimless crimes vary in different parts of the world and different law systems, but usually include possession of any illegal contraband, recreational drug use, prostitution and prohibited sexual behavior between consenting adults, assisted suicide, and smuggling among other similar infractions.\nIn politics, a lobbyist or an activist might use the term \"victimless crime\" with the implication that the law in question should be abolished.\nVictimless crimes are, in the harm principle of John Stuart Mill, \"victimless\" from a position that considers the individual as the sole sovereign, to the exclusion of more abstract bodies such as a community or a state against which criminal offenses may be directed. They may be considered offenses against the state rather than society.\nDefinition.\nAccording to the University of Chicago's vice scholar, Jim Leitzel, three characteristics can be used to identify whether a crime is a victimless crime: if the act is excessive, is indicative of a distinct pattern of behavior, and its adverse effects impact only the person who has engaged in it.\nIn theory, each polity determines its own laws so as to maximize the happiness of its citizens. But as knowledge, behavior, and values change, laws in most countries often lag significantly behind these social shifts. Once the majority believes that a law is unnecessary, it continues to prohibit a victimless crime until it is repealed.\nExamples.\nMany victimless crimes begin because of a desire to obtain illegal products or services that are in high demand. Criminal penalties thus tend to limit the supply more than the demand, driving up the black-market price and creating monopoly profits for those criminals who remain in business. This \"crime tariff\" encourages the growth of sophisticated and well-organized criminal groups. Organized crime in turn tends to diversify into other areas of crime. Large profits provide ample funds for bribery of public officials, as well as capital for diversification.\nThe war on drugs is a commonly cited example of prosecution of victimless crime. The reasoning behind this is that drug use does not directly harm other people. One argument is that the criminalization of drugs leads to highly inflated prices for drugs. For example, Bedau and Schur found in 1974 that \"In England the pharmacy cost of heroin [was] 0.06 cents per grain. In the United States street price [was] $30\u201390 per grain.\" This inflation in price is believed to drive addicts to commit crimes such as theft and robbery, which are thought to be inherently damaging to society, in order to be able to purchase the drugs on which they are dependent.\nIn addition to the creation of a black market for drugs, the war on drugs is argued by proponents of legalization to reduce the workforce by damaging the ability of those convicted to find work. It is reasoned that this reduction of the workforce is ultimately harmful to an economy reliant on labor. The number of drug arrests increases every year. In a poll taken by the Bureau of Justice Statistics between 1980 and 2009, \"[over a] 30-year period...[arrest] rates for drug possession or use doubled for whites and tripled for blacks.\"\nAccording to economist Walter Block, illegal immigration and emigration is a victimless crime from a libertarian perspective.\nVera Bergelson states that victimless crime comes in four main varieties:\nLegalization of victimless acts.\nMany activities that were once considered crimes are no longer illegal in some countries, at least in part because of their status as victimless crimes.\nOne example is the British sturdy beggar laws that applied the death penalty to unemployment.\nTwo large categories of victimless crimes are sexual pleasure and recreational drug use (drug pleasure). On the first,\nMarijuana use is forbidden by law in Australia but is the most \"widely used illicit drug\" in the country, just as it is in countries such as the United States and New Zealand. Prohibition of alcohol in the United States, repealed in 1933, is considered a failed \"social experiment\" because many citizens ignored what it stipulated, turning to home-made spirits in lieu of licensed alcoholic drinks and resultantly making problems worse. In the United States today, tension over marijuana legalization is in response to the current marijuana prohibition in most states, but there are efforts to legalize cannabis in many countries such as the United States and Australia, as its legalization has the potential to greatly increase revenue.\nProstitution is legal in many countries, though usually restricted. The Netherlands legalized prostitution in 1999, and was one of the first countries to do so. As of 2012, however, it has been considering policy changes to severely restrict it.\nAdultery (sexual acts between a married person and a person other than the spouse) and fornication (sexual acts between unmarried people) have not been prosecuted in the United States for over 50 years, although the laws against them, like those against sodomy, are still on the books in several states. However, because sodomy laws were struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Lawrence v. Texas\", the laws against fornication would also be unconstitutional as was recognized by the Supreme Court of Virginia in \"Martin v. Ziherl\".\nControversy.\nA major concern among opponents of legalizing victimless crimes is the degradation of societal moral standards, but punishing citizens for their choice to engage in victimless acts declared by the law to be immoral is difficult. While the United States's typical response to crimes is retroactive, the illegality of victimless crimes is a more preventative approach to justice and is highly controversial.\nControversies over victimless crime deal mostly with the question of whether a crime can ever actually be victimless. With relation to drugs and their pathway to consumption, the impact of the drug trade and liability laws on drug dealers, their families, and other unforeseen actors may end in victimization. Another act often considered a victimless crime is the possession of pornography, especially fictional child pornography. However, those who hold this position typically acknowledge the victimization that can occur to performers during production of non-fictional pornography.\nIn contrast, there is the argument for restraining legal powers to allow citizens the freedom to make victimless personal choices that may or may not be perceived as morally wrong. Preventative law, such as sex offender registries and anti-social behavior orders, blurs the distinction between criminal and civil law because victimless crime is typically difficult to categorize and criminalize. This is problematic because it causes a distortion of traditional procedures of the criminal and civil of aspects of law by enabling confusion and procedural interchangeability.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Legislative bodies and interest groups sometimes rationalize the criminalization of consensual activity because they feel it offends cultural norms, or because one of the parties to the activity is considered a \"victim\" despite their informed consent.\nConsensual crimes can be described as crimes in which the victim is the state, the judicial system, or society at large and so affect the general (sometimes ideological or cultural) interests of the system, such as common sexual morality. Victimless crimes, while similar, typically involve acts that do not involve multiple persons. Drug use is typically considered a victimless crime whereas the sale of drugs between two or more persons would be a consensual crime. The fact that no persons come forward to claim injury has essentially made the two terms interchangeable in common use.\nGiving consent.\nWhen discussing consensual crime, one issue is whether all the participants are capable of giving genuine legal consent. This may not be the case if one or more of the participants are:\nExamples.\nThe generally accepted definition of a consensual crime is a criminal act committed by two or more people, who consent to involvement, and does not involve any nonconsenting individuals.

{"id": "50806", "revid": "17859592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50806", "title": "White Australia policy", "text": "Historical racial policies in Australia\nThe White Australia policy was a set of racial policies that aimed to forbid people of non-European ethnic origins\u00a0\u2013 Asians (primarily Chinese) and Pacific Islanders\u00a0\u2013 from immigrating to Australia, in order to create a \"white/British\" ideal focused on Anglo-Celtic peoples, but not exclusively. Pre-Federation, the Australian colonies passed many anti-Chinese immigration laws mainly using Poll Taxes. With Federation in 1901 came discrimination based on the Dictation Test, which effectively gave power to immigration officials to racially discriminate without mentioning race. The policy also affected immigrants from Germany, Italy, and other European countries, especially in wartime. Governments progressively dismantled such policies between 1949 and 1973, when the Whitlam government removed the last racial elements of Australia's immigration laws.\nCompetition in the gold fields between European and Chinese miners, and labour union opposition to the importation of Pacific Islanders (primarily South Sea Islanders) into the sugar plantations of Queensland, reinforced demands to eliminate or minimize low-wage immigration from Asia and the Pacific Islands. From the 1850s colonial governments imposed restrictions on Chinese arrivals, including poll taxes and tonnage restrictions. The colonial authorities levied a special tax on Chinese immigrants which other immigrants did not have to pay. Towards the end of the 19th century, labour unions pushed to stop Chinese immigrants from working in the furniture and market garden industries. Some laws were passed regarding the labelling of Chinese made furniture in Victoria and Western Australia but not in New South Wales. Chinese people dominated market gardening until their numbers declined as departures were not replaced.\nSoon after Australia became a federation in January 1901, the federal government of Edmund Barton passed the \"Immigration Restriction Act of 1901\"; this was drafted by Alfred Deakin, who eventually became Australia's second prime minister. The passage of this bill marked the commencement of the White Australia Policy as Australian federal government policy. The key feature of this legislation was the dictation test, which was used to bar non-white immigrants from entry. Subsequent acts further strengthened the policy. These policies effectively gave British migrants preference over all others through the first half of the 20th century. During World War II, Prime Minister John Curtin reinforced the policy, saying \"This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.\"\nSuccessive governments dismantled the policy in stages after the conclusion of World War II, with the Chifley and Menzies governments encouraging non-British Europeans to immigrate to Australia. The \"Migration Act 1958\" abolished the dictation test, while the Holt government removed discrimination against non-white applicants for citizenship in 1966. The Whitlam government passed laws to ensure that race would be totally disregarded as a component for immigration to Australia in 1973. In 1975, the Whitlam government passed the \"Racial Discrimination Act\", which made racially-based selection criteria unlawful. In the decades since, Australia has maintained large-scale multi-ethnic immigration. As of 2018[ [update]], Australia's migration program allows people from any country to apply to immigrate to Australia, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, culture, religion, or language, provided that they meet the criteria set out in law. Prior to 2011, the United Kingdom was the largest source country for immigration to Australia but, since then, China and India have provided the highest number of permanent migrants. These results exclude the many settlers from New Zealand unless they choose to apply through the permanent resident program. The National Museum of Australia describes the White Australia Policy as openly racist, stating that it \"existed because many white Australians feared that non-white immigrants would threaten Australian society\".\nImmigration policies before federation.\nGold rush era.\nThe discovery of gold in Australia in 1851 led to an influx of immigrants from all around the world. The colony of Victoria had a population of only 77,000 in 1851 and New South Wales just 200,000, but the huge influx of settlers spurred by the Australian gold rushes transformed the Australian colonies economically, politically and demographically. Over the next 20 years, 40,000 Chinese men but very few women, nearly all from the province of Guangdong (then known as Canton) but divided by language and dialect nevertheless, immigrated to the goldfields seeking prosperity.\nGold brought great wealth but also new social tensions. Multi-ethnic migrants came to Victoria and New South Wales in large numbers for the first time. Competition on the goldfields, particularly resentment among white miners towards the successes of Chinese miners, led to tensions between groups and eventually a series of significant racist protests and riots, including the Buckland riot in 1857 and the Lambing Flat riots between 1860 and 1861. Governor Hotham, on 16 November 1854, appointed a Royal Commission on Victorian goldfields problems and grievances. This led to restrictions being placed on Chinese immigration and residency taxes levied from Chinese residents in Victoria from 1855. New South Wales following suit with poll taxes and tonnage restrictions only in 1861. These restrictions remained in force only until 1867.\nSupport from the Australian Labour Movement.\nMelbourne Trades Hall was opened in 1859 with trades and labour councils and trades halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s, trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe.\nAustralia gained a reputation as \"the working man's paradise\". Some employers hired Chinese labourers, who were cheaper and more hard working. This produced a reaction which led eventually to all the colonies restricting Chinese immigration by 1888 and subsequently other Asian immigration. This was the genesis of the White Australia Policy. The \"Australian compact\", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century.\nThe growth of the sugar industry in Queensland in the 1870s led to searching for labourers prepared to work in a tropical environment. During this time, thousands of \"Kanakas\" (Pacific Islanders) were brought into Australia as indentured workers. This and related practices of bringing in non-white labour to be cheaply employed was commonly termed \"blackbirding\" and refers to the recruitment of people, often through trickery and kidnappings, to work on plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations of Queensland (Australia) and Fiji. In the 1870s and 1880s, the trade union movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for \"substandard\" wages, lowered working conditions, were harder workers and refused unionisation.\nObjections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas. It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned. Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration. Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and southern compatriots, although they faced significant discrimination.\nAgreements were made to further increase these restrictions in 1895 following an inter-colonial premiers' conference where all colonies agreed to extend entry restrictions to all non-white races. However, in attempting to enact this legislation, the governors of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania reserved the bills, due to a treaty with Japan, and they did not become law. Instead, the Natal Act of 1897 was introduced, restricting \"undesirable persons\" who could not fill in a set form rather than by naming any specific race.\nThe British government in London was not pleased with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed. Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain explained in 1897:We quite sympathize with the determination...of these colonies...that there should not be an influx of people alien in civilisation, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labouring population.\nFrom the Federation to World War II.\nIn writing about the preoccupations of the Australian population in early Federation Australia before World War I in \"ANZAC to Amiens\", the official historian of the war, Charles Bean, considered the White Australia Policy and defined it as follows:\"White Australia Policy\" \u2013 a vehement effort to maintain a high Western standard of economy, society and culture (necessitating at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples).\nFederation Convention and Australia's first government.\nImmigration was a prominent topic of discussion in the lead up to the establishment of the Australian Federation. At the third session of the Australasian Federation Convention of 1898, Western Australian premier and future federal cabinet member John Forrest summarised the feeling of the Anglo-Saxon people in Australia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is of no use to shut our eyes to the fact that there is a great feeling all over Australia against the introduction of coloured persons. It goes without saying that we do not like to talk about it, but it is so.\nThe Barton government which came to power following the first elections of the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers Union and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded. The Australian historian James Jupp wrote that it was not true that the White Australia policy was exclusively a right-wing cause as the strongest support for the White Australia policy was on the left-side of Australian politics with both the trade unions and the Labour Party being the most militant opponents of Asian immigration well into the 1960s. Many Australians in the early 20th century tended to define being white as being the same as Australian with a majority of Australian states passing laws banning marriage and/or sex between whites and Aboriginals as part of an effort to maintain Australia's white character.\nThe first Parliament of Australia quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia's \"British character\", and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose for its first Christmas recess. The colonial secretary in Britain had, however, made it clear that a race-based immigration policy would run \"contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire\". The Barton government therefore conceived of the \"Education test\", later called the \"Dictation Test\", which would allow the government, at the discretion of Customs Officers, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in \"any European language\". At the time, Anglo-Japanese relations were improving, and in 1902 Britain and Japan were to sign a defensive alliance directed implicitly against Russia. The White Australia policy led to vigorous protests from the Japanese government, and led to complaints from London that Australia was gratuitously straining relations with Japan, which Britain viewed as a prospective ally against Russia.\nFor the Labor Party this was a compromise of principles, so the main question for the debate on the Immigration Restriction Act just how openly racist to be, with the Labor Party preferring to openly bar \"aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof\". However in the end the preferred option of the British, the Education Test was passed. There was also opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude \"Kanaka\" labourers, however Barton argued that the practice was \"veiled slavery\" that could lead to a \"negro problem\" similar to that in the United States, and the bill was passed.\nImmigration Restriction Act 1901.\nThe new Federal Parliament, as one of its first pieces of legislation, passed the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (1 Edward VII 17 1901) to \"place certain restrictions on immigration and... for the removal... of prohibited immigrants\". The act drew on similar legislation in the South African colony of Natal. Edmund Barton, the prime minister, argued in support of the bill with the following statement: \"The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman.\"\nThe attorney general tasked with drafting the legislation was Alfred Deakin. Deakin supported Barton's position over that of the Labor Party in drafting the bill (the ALP wanted more direct methods of exclusion than the dictation test) and redacted the more vicious racism proposed for the text in his second reading of the Bill. In seeking to justify the policy, Deakin said he believed that the Japanese and Chinese might be a threat to the newly formed federation and it was this belief that led to legislation to ensure they would be kept out:It is not the bad qualities, but the good qualities of these alien races that make them so dangerous to us. It is their inexhaustible energy, their power of applying themselves to new tasks, their endurance and low standard of living that make them such competitors.Early drafts of the act explicitly banned non-Europeans from migrating to Australia but objections from the British government, which feared that such a measure would offend British subjects in India and Britain's allies in Japan, caused the Barton government to remove this wording. Instead, a \"dictation test\" was introduced as a device for excluding unwanted immigrants. Immigration officials were given the power to exclude any person who failed to pass a 50-word dictation test. At first this was to be in any European language, but was later changed to include \"any\" language. The tests were given in such a way as to make them impossible to pass. If a person seemed likely to pass in English then a test in another language could be given. Attlee Hunt, the first administrator of the \"Immigration Restriction Act\" expressed it clearly in a 1903 memo to all Customs Officers: \"It is not desirable that persons should be allowed to past the test, and before putting it to anyone the Officer should be satisfied that he will fail. If he is considered likely to pass the test if put in English, it should be applied in some other language of which he is ignorant.\"\nMigrants who had been domiciled in any of the Australian colonies, or the federation, before the introduction of the act, and wanted to leave the country for a temporary period, could apply for a Certificate of Exemption to the Dictation Test (CEDT).\nThe legislation found strong support in the new Australian Parliament, with arguments ranging from economic protection to outright racism. The Labor Party wanted to protect \"white\" jobs and pushed for more explicit restrictions. A few politicians spoke of the need to avoid hysterical treatment of the question. Member of Parliament Bruce Smith said he had \"no desire to see low-class Indians, Chinamen or Japanese...swarming into this country... But there is obligation...not (to) unnecessarily offend the educated classes of those nations\" Norman Cameron, a Free Trade Party member from Tasmania, expressed a rare note of dissension:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[N]o race on... this earth has been treated in a more shameful manner than have the Chinese... They were forced at the point of a bayonet to admit Englishmen... into China. Now if we compel them to admit our people... why in the name of justice should we refuse to admit them here?\nOutside parliament, Australia's first Catholic cardinal, Patrick Francis Moran was politically active and denounced anti-Chinese legislation as \"un-Christian\". The popular press mocked the Cardinal's position and the small European population of Australia generally supported the legislation and remained fearful of being overwhelmed by an influx of non-British migrants from the vastly different cultures of the highly populated nations to Australia's north.\nThe Immigration Restriction Act 1901 imposed a dictation test, in any European language, for any non-European migrant to Australia. The immigration officer (Customs until 1949) could choose any language, which effectively meant that the officer had the power to restrict the immigration of any individual. Further discriminatory legislation was the Postal and Telegraph Services Act 1901 (1 Edward VII 12 1901), which required any ship carrying mail to and from Australia to only have a white crew.\nPacific Island Labourers Act 1901.\nIn 1901, there were approximately 9,800 Pacific Islander labourers in Queensland. In 1901, the Australian parliament passed the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 (1 Edward VII 16 1901). The result of these statutes was that 7,500 Pacific Islanders (called \"Kanakas\") working mostly on plantations in Queensland were deported, and entry into Australia by Pacific Islanders was prohibited after 1904. Those exempted from repatriation, along with a number of others who escaped deportation, remained in Australia to form the basis of what is today Australia's largest non-indigenous black ethnic group. Today, the descendants of those who remained are officially referred to as South Sea Islanders.\nExemption for M\u0101ori.\nM\u0101ori generally benefited from the same immigration and voting rights as European New Zealanders in Australia, making them a notable exception to the White Australia Policy. In 1902, with the \"Commonwealth Franchise Act\", M\u0101ori residents in Australia were granted the right to vote, a right denied to Indigenous Australians. During that same period, their right to settle in Australia was facilitated by their shared status as British subjects. The Australian government granted equal rights to M\u0101ori only reluctantly. In 1905, the New Zealand government made a formal complaint about the exclusion of two M\u0101ori shearers, after which the Australian government changed its customs regulations to allow M\u0101ori to freely enter the country. Other Pacific Islanders were still subject to the White Australia Policy.\nParis Peace Conference.\nAt the 1919 Paris Peace Conference following the First World War, Japan sought to include a racial equality clause in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Japanese policy reflected their desire to remove or to ease the immigration restrictions against Japanese (especially in the United States and Canada), which Japan regarded as a humiliation and affront to its prestige.\nAustralian Prime Minister Billy Hughes was already concerned by the prospect of Japanese expansion in the Pacific. Australia, Japan and New Zealand had seized the Germany's Pacific territories in the early stages of the war and Hughes was concerned to retain German New Guinea as vital to the defence of Australia. The treaty ultimately granted Australia a League of Nations Mandate over German New Guinea and Japan to the South Seas Mandate immediately to its north \u2013 thus bringing Australian and Japanese territory to a shared border \u2013 a situation altered only by Japan's Second World War invasion of New Guinea.\nHughes vehemently opposed Japan's racial equality proposition. Hughes recognised that such a clause would be a threat to White Australia and made it clear to British prime minister David Lloyd George that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted. Hughes wrote in 1919: \"No Govt. could live for a day in Australia if it tempered with a White Australia\". Hughes wrote a note to Colonel Edward M. House of the American delegation: \"It may be all right. But sooner than agree to it I would walk into the Seine-or the Folies Bergeres-with my clothes off\". Hughes did offer the compromise that he would support the Racial Equality Clause provided that it did not affect immigration, an offer the Japanese rejected. When the proposal failed, Hughes reported in the Australian parliament:The White Australia is yours. You may do with it what you please, but at any rate, the soldiers have achieved the victory and my colleagues and I have brought that great principle back to you from the conference, as safe as it was on the day when it was first adopted.\nAbolition of the policy.\nWorld War II.\nAustralian anxiety at the prospect of Japanese expansionism and war in the Pacific continued through the 1930s. Hughes, by then a minister in the United Australia Party's Lyons government, made a notable contribution to Australia's attitude towards immigration in a 1935 speech in which he argued that \"Australia must... populate or perish.\"\nBetween the Great Depression starting in 1929 and the end of World War II in 1945, global conditions kept immigration to very low levels. At the start of the war, Prime Minister John Curtin (ALP) reinforced the message of the White Australia Policy by saying: \"This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.\"\nFollowing the 1942 Fall of Singapore, Australians feared invasion by Imperial Japan. Australian cities were bombed by the Japanese airforce and Navy and Axis naval forces menaced Australian shipping, while the Royal Navy remained pre-occupied with the battles of the Atlantic and Mediterranean in the face of Nazi aggression in Europe. A Japanese invasion fleet headed for the Australian Territory of New Guinea was only halted by the intervention of the United States Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Australia received thousands of refugees from territories falling to advancing Japanese forces \u2013 notably thousands of Chinese men and women as well as many Chinese seamen. There were also Dutch who fled the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Aboriginal Australians, Torres Strait Islanders, Papua New Guineans and Timorese served in the frontline of the defence of Australia, bringing Australia's racially discriminatory immigration and political rights policies into focus and wartime service gave many Indigenous Australians confidence in demanding their rights upon return to civilian life.\nDuring the war, talk arose about the possibility of abolishing the policy. Hostility to this idea was one reason Australia never signed a treaty with China as it was feared the Chinese government would request the abolition of the White Australian policy as an ally. A spokesman for the Labor Party demanded that it be continued, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The policy of White Australia is now, perhaps, the most outstanding political characteristic of this country, and it has been accepted not only by those closely associated with it, but also by those who watched and studied \"this interesting experiment\" from afar. Only those who favor the exploitation of a servile coloured race for greed of gain, and a few professional economists and benighted theologians, are now heard in serious criticism of a White Australia; but... they are encouraged by the ill-timed and inappropriate pronouncements of what are, after all, irresponsible officials.\nPost-war immigration.\nFollowing the trauma of the Second World War, Australia's vulnerability during the Pacific War and its relatively small population compared to other nations led to policies summarised by the slogan, \"populate or perish.\" According to author Lachlan Strahan, this was an ethnocentric slogan that in effect was an admonition to fill Australia with Europeans or else risk having it overrun by Asians. Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell stated in 1947 to critics of the government's mass immigration programme: \"We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us.\"\nDuring the war, many non-white refugees, Chinese, Malays, Indonesians and Filipinos, arrived in Australia, but Calwell controversially sought to have them all deported. Between 1945 and 1952, an Australian brigade served as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Until 1952, Australia did not permit Japanese women who had married Australian soldiers to enter Australia.\nThe Chifley government introduced the \"Aliens Deportation Act 1948\", which had its weaknesses exposed by the High Court case \"O'Keefe v Calwell\", and then passed the \"War-time Refugees Removal Act 1949\" which gave the immigration minister sweeping powers of deportation. In 1948, Iranian Bah\u00e1'\u00eds seeking to immigrate to Australia were classified as \"Asiatic\" by the policy and were denied entry. In 1949, Calwell's successor, Harold Holt, allowed the remaining 800 non-white refugees to apply for residency, and also allowed Japanese \"war brides\" to settle in Australia. In the meantime, Holt continued Calwell's policy of encouraging mass immigration from Europe, and Australia admitted large numbers of immigrants from mostly Italy, Poland, Greece and Yugoslavia, as well as its traditional source of immigration, the British Isles. The Australian Government promoted the assimilation of migrants to Australia from continental Europe, who were expected to become mainstream Australians. In 1947, Australian immigration law, which had until had been based on encouraging British immigration, was amended to take in more European immigration. The way that Australia took in a large number of European immigrants from countries that were previously considered undesirable weakened the case for Australia as a primarily \"British\" country and led to demands for the end of the White Australia policy. Given that the purpose of the White Australia policy was to preserve Australia as a British country, it is notable that some of the strongest critics of the White Australia policy in the 1950s were liberal British professors serving at Australian universities. In 1959, the Immigration Reform Group was founded at Melbourne University to champion for the abolition of the policy.\nRelaxation of restrictions.\nAustralian policy began to shift towards significantly increasing immigration. Legislative changes over the next few decades continuously opened up immigration in Australia.\nLabor Party Chifley government:\nLiberal-Country Party Menzies government (1949\u20131966):\nThis was despite comments Menzies made in a discussion with radio 2UE's Stewart Lamb in 1955, where he appeared to be a defender of the White Australia Policy. Menzies: \"I don't want to see reproduced in Australia the kind of problem they have in South Africa or in America or increasingly in Great Britain. I think it's been a very good policy and it's been of great value to us and most of the criticism of it that I've ever heard doesn't come from these oriental countries it comes from wandering Australians.\"\nLamb: \"For these years of course in the past Sir Robert you have been described as a racist.\"\nMenzies: \"Have I?\"\nLamb: \"I have read this, yes.\"\nMenzies: \"Well if I were not described as a racist I'd be the only public man who hasn't been.\"\nThe Democratic Labor Party (DLP) then the third largest party, started opposing the White Australia policy as early as 1957. \nIn 1963, a paper, \"Immigration: Control or Colour Bar?\", was published by a group of students and academics at Melbourne University. It proposed eliminating the White Australia policy and was influential towards this end.\nEnd of the White Australia Policy.\nIn July 1966, Prime Minister Harold Holt stated that Australia no longer had a White Australia policy, but instead had a \"restricted immigration policy\". Earlier in the year he and immigration minister Hubert Opperman had announced a significant liberalisation of immigration laws for non-whites. These included reducing the waiting time for non-whites to obtain citizenship from fifteen years to five years and allowed for family reunification. Non-white immigrants would be admitted on the basis that they were \"well-qualified\", rather than \"highly qualified and distinguished\" as had been the case since 1956. According to \"The Canberra Times\" the changes would allow around 5,000 non-whites to obtain citizenship.\nIn January 1971, Prime Minister John Gorton stated that his government aimed to establish a multi-racial society in Australia and committed to abolishing racial discrimination. However he stated that there was still a need to restrict non-white immigration. He had earlier stated that the White Australia policy was not morally justifiable, but that \"the unlimited influx of colored people would lead to stresses in Australia\".\nLabor Party members Don Dunstan and Gough Whitlam set about removing the White Australia Policy from the Labor platform. Attempts in 1959 and 1961 failed, with Labor leader Arthur Calwell stating, \"It would ruin the Party if we altered the immigration policy ... it was only cranks, long hairs, academics and do-gooders who wanted the change.\" However, Dunstan persisted in his efforts, and in 1965, the White Australia Policy was removed from the Labor platform at their national conference; Dunstan personally took credit for the change.\nIn 1966, the Holt Liberal government modified the White Australia policy in an effort to reduce the strong perception of Australia's anti-Asian racism. After a review of immigration policy in March 1966, Immigration Minister Hubert Opperman announced applications for migration would be accepted from well-qualified people \"on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily and their possession of qualifications positively useful to Australia\". At the same time, Holt's government decided to allow foreign non-whites to become permanent residents and citizens after five years (the same as for Europeans), and also removed discriminatory provisions in family reunification policies.\nAfter the removal of official discrimination, preference was still given to Asian migrants of European or racially mixed appearance. A report on the Filipino community of Sydney in 1966 observed that its members \u2013 numbering approximately 100 \u2013 were all \"white\" looking, or in Filipino terms, \"mestizos\" of presumably Spanish descent. \"The Filipino Consul General stated that he was the only 'colored Filipino' in Sydney.\"\nNevertheless, the annual non-European settler arrivals rose from 746 in 1966 to 2,696 in 1971, while annual part-European settler arrivals rose from 1,498 to 6,054.\nLeader of the Labor Party from 1960 to 1967 Arthur Calwell supported the White Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, \"Be Just and Fear Not\", in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatise the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.\nThe Australian Workers' Union (AWU) abandoned its support for the White Australia policy in 1972.\nThe Whitlam Labor government brought about the comprehensive legal end of the White Australia policy in 1973 as prime minister. The Whitlam Labor government implemented a series of amendments preventing the enforcement of racial aspects of the immigration law. These amendments:\nThe \"Racial Discrimination Act 1975\" made the use of racial criteria for any official purpose illegal.\nIt was not until the Fraser Liberal government's review of immigration law in 1978 that all selection of prospective migrants based on country of origin was entirely removed from official policy.\nIn 1981, the minister for immigration announced a special humanitarian assistance programme (SHP) for Iranians to seek refuge in Australia and by 1988 some 2,500 Bah\u00e1'\u00eds and many more others had arrived in Australia through either SHP or refugee programmes. The last selective immigration policy, offering relocation assistance to British nationals, was finally removed in 1982.\nAftermath.\nAustralia's contemporary immigration programme has two components: a programme for skilled and family migrants and a humanitarian programme for refugees and asylum seekers. By 2010, the post-war immigration programme had received more than 6.5\u00a0million migrants. The population tripled in the six decades to around 21\u00a0million in 2010, comprising people originating from 200 countries.\nContemporary demographics.\nIn 2019, Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 34% of the population, a higher proportion than in any other nation with a population of over 10\u00a0million. 162,417 permanent immigrants were admitted to Australia in 2017\u201318. Most immigrants are skilled, but the immigration quota includes categories for family members and refugees. In 2018 the five largest immigrant groups were those born in England (4%), Mainland China (2.6%), India (2.4%), New Zealand (2.3%) and the Philippines (1.1%).\nIn the 2016 Australian census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: \nPolitical and social legacy.\nThe story of Australia since the Second World War \u2013 and particularly since the final relegation of the White Australia Policy \u2013 has been one of ever-increasing ethnic and cultural diversity. Successive governments have sustained a large program of multi-ethnic immigration from all continents.\nDiscrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity was legally permitted until 1975. Australia's new official policy on racial diversity is: \"to build on our success as a culturally diverse, accepting and open society, united through a shared future\". The White Australia policy continues to be mentioned in modern contexts, although it is generally only mentioned by politicians when denouncing their opposition. As Leader of the Opposition, John Howard argued for restricting Asian immigration in 1988 as part of his One Australia policy; in August 1988, he said: I do believe that if it is \u2013 in the eyes of some in the community \u2013 that it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it [Asian immigration] were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater.Howard later retracted and apologised for the remarks, and was returned to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1995. The Howard government (1996\u20132007) in turn ran a large programme of non-discriminatory immigration and, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Asian countries became an increasingly important source of immigration over the decade from 1996 to 2006, with the proportion of migrants from Southern and Central Asian countries doubling from 7% to 14%. The proportion of immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also increased. By 2005\u201306, China and India were the third and fourth largest sources of all migration (after New Zealand and the United Kingdom). In 2005\u201306, there were 180,000 permanent additions of migrants to Australia (72% more than the number in 1996\u201397). This figure included around 17,000 through the humanitarian programme, of whom Iraqis and Sudanese accounted for the largest portions. China became Australia's biggest source of migrants for the first time in 2009, surpassing New Zealand and Britain.\nThe Australian historian John Fitzgerald wrote that the White Australia policy, with its definition that to be Australian was to be white, had a powerful impact on forging the identity of the Chinese-Australian community as a marginalised community. Fitzgerald noted that even in the early 21st century, many Chinese-Australians who had been born and grew up in Australia automatically referred to white Australians as \"the Australians\" and to themselves as \"the Chinese\".\nHistorian Geoffrey Blainey achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a \"cluster of tribes\". In his 1984 book \"All for Australia\", Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to \"emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians\" and also for tending to be \"anti-British\", even though \"people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants.\"\nAccording to Blainey, such a policy, with its \"emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority,\" was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that \"the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high\" and warned that \"we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.\"\nIn one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.\nBlainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham\". The British historian Andrew Roberts, in his 2006 book \"A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900\" praised the White Australia policy as being necessary to \"protect Australia as an English-speaking nation\". Roberts wrote the White Australia policy was the \"right\" immigration policy to pursue as he accused Asian immigrants of spreading infectious diseases and stated \"Australia had the right (and duty) to protect herself\" from Asian immigration. Views such as those expressed by Roberts have been in the minority. In 2009, the Australian historian Erin Ihde described the White Australia policy as \"discredited\" both within the historians' community and with the general public. Ihde wrote that the White Australia policy remains a difficult subject within the Australian popular memory of the past as it was the fear of the so-called \"Yellow Peril\" in the form of Asian immigration and the possibility of Asian nations such as China and Japan posing a military threat to Australia that played a major role in the formation of the Australian federation in 1901. Ihde argued the White Australia policy was not an aberration in Australian history, nor was it marginal, making it problematic to integrate into a positive view of Australian history.\nDespite the overall success and generally bipartisan support for Australia's multi-ethnic immigration programme, there remain voices of opposition to immigration within the Australian electorate. At its peak, Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party received 9% of the national vote at the 1998 Federal Election.\nHanson was widely accused of trying to take Australia back to the days of the White Australia policy, particularly through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia. Hanson returned to politics in 2014 and ran in the Queensland election. She won a Queensland senate seat in the 2016 election, and retained it again in 2022. In 2018, Hanson said she opposes the White Australia policy.\nTopics related to racism and immigration in Australia are still regularly connected by the media to the White Australia policy. Some examples of issues and events where this connection has been made include:\nreconciliation with Indigenous Australians; mandatory detention and the \"Pacific Solution\"; the 2005 Cronulla riots, and the 2009 attacks on Indians in Australia. Former opposition Labor party leader Mark Latham, in his book \"The Latham Diaries\", described the ANZUS alliance as a legacy of the White Australia policy.\nIn 2007, the Howard government proposed an Australian Citizenship Test intended \"to get that balance between diversity and integration correct in future, particularly as we now draw people from so many different countries and so many different cultures\". The draft proposal contained a pamphlet introducing Australian history, Culture and Democracy. Migrants were to be required to correctly answer at least 12 out of 20 questions on such topics in a citizenship quiz. Migrants would also be required to demonstrate an adequate level of understanding of the English language. The Rudd government reviewed and then implemented the proposal in 2009.\nOn 14 August 2018, Senator Fraser Anning delivered his maiden speech to the Senate. In it, he called for a plebiscite to reintroduce the White Australia Policy, especially with regard to excluding Muslims (even though Muslims come from different races). He was criticised by politicians from the left and the right, in particular for his choice of words (\"final solution\"). He was again criticised by politicians across the board after blaming Muslim immigration to New Zealand for the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks.\nSurveys from 2018 and 2023 have found that over 15% polled have shown support for discrimination when it comes to immigration intake. Support for discrimination was higher on basis of religion then race or ethnicity.\nReferences.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also the river with the most voluminous flow of water by far in all of England and Wales, with an average flow rate of at Apperley, Gloucestershire. It rises in the Cambrian Mountains in mid Wales, at an altitude of , on the Plynlimon massif, which lies close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes. The river then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. The county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester lie on its course.\nThe Severn's major tributaries are the Vyrnwy, the Tern, the Teme, the Warwickshire Avon, and the Worcestershire Stour.\nBy convention, the River Severn is usually considered to end, and the Severn Estuary to begin, after the Prince of Wales Bridge, between Severn Beach in South Gloucestershire and Sudbrook, Monmouthshire. The total area of the estuary's drainage basin is . That figure excludes the area of the River Wye and the Bristol Avon, both of which flow into the Severn Estuary. The estuary discharges into the Bristol Channel, which opens into the Celtic Sea and from there into the Atlantic Ocean.\nEtymology and mythology.\nCeltic Root.\nAn etymology has been proposed, which signifies that 'Severn' is an anglicised version of an ancient Celtic phrase signifying 'a gap (in the coastline)', referring to the estuary.\nRomano-British name.\nThe name Severn is thought to derive from a British word \"sabrin\u0101\", possibly from an older form *\"samarosina\", meaning \"land of summertime fallow\".\nDuring the Roman occupation the \"Severn\" was known by the Romano-British Latin name \"Sabrina\".\nName legacy.\nMilton's 1634 masque \"Comus\" makes \"Sabrina\" a nymph who had drowned in the river.\nIn Shrewsbury, there is now a statue of Sabrina in the Dingle Gardens at the Quarry, as well as a metal sculpture erected in 2013.\nThere is a different deity associated with the Severn Estuary: Nodens, represented as mounted on a seahorse, riding on the crest of the Severn bore.\nWelsh name.\nThe Welsh form of the name is ' () first recorded in the 12th-century \"Historia Regum Britanniae\". The Old Welsh form of the name ' was recorded c.800.\nDocumented history of the Welsh name:\nThe toponym for \"Habren\" might be:\nEnglish name.\nThe English form of the name (\"Severn\") is derived from Old English \"S\u00e6fern\". However the name is also influenced by English dialect \"seave\" (\"sedge, rush\") hence the origin of the name \"Seaverne\" recorded in the 16th\u201317th century.\nCommon club-rush (\"Schoenoplectus lacustris\") prefers to grow in shallow water such as that found in ponds, streams and river margins. The Hwicce people used the club-rush growing along the banks of the River Severn to make wicker baskets.\nName history.\nThe name history shows evidence of Scandinavian influence:\nViking age.\nIn the Summer of 893 a coalition of all of the Danish armies in England made a determined attempt to annex western Mercia to Danish Mercia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (ASC) recorded an account of the Battle of Buttington, and included this description of the route taken by the Danes:\n\"... Foron \u00fea up be Temese o\u00fe\u00fe\u00e6t hie gedydon \u00e6t \"S\u00e6ferne\", \u00fea up be \"S\u00e6ferne\".\nSeafarer.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The Seafarer (poem)&lt;br&gt;\n...\"\u00fe\u00e6t he a his s\u00e6fore sorge n\u00e6bbe,&lt;br&gt;\nto hwon hine Dryhten gedon wille.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n...\"that he never in his seafaring has a worry,&lt;br&gt;\nas to what his Lord will do to him.\"\n \u2014 A passage in Old English poem\nThe name \"S\u00e6fern\" might be related to:\nThe Old Norse name \"S\u00e6fari\" (\"Seafarer\") lives on as the name of the Dalv\u00edk \u2013 Gr\u00edmsey ferry in Iceland.\nGeography and geology.\nThe River Severn's current form is the result of a multi-million year history and complex underlying geology but is in part the result of glaciation during the last ice age in the Pleistocene epoch of the Quaternary period. Within Wales, the river runs through a landscape formed in Ordovician and Silurian rocks. As it enters the Shropshire Plain, these lower Palaeozoic rocks are replaced by Permian and Triassic age strata though largely unseen beneath a thick cover of Quaternary deposits. Certain stretches also run across Carboniferous strata as at Shrewsbury and for much of the distance between Ironbridge and Bewdley. Permo-Triassic bedrock then continues until the Severn moves intermittently onto the Jurassic outcrop from Tewkesbury southwards. Only in the SSW-NNE aligned valley either side of Welshpool is there any obvious relationship to geological structure where the valley follows the lines of the Severn Valley Fault Belt. For much of the rest of its course it runs directly across geological structures.\nIt was first proposed in the 1900s that the former northerly course of the upper Severn was disrupted during the course of the ice age by the blocking of its access to the Irish Sea through Cheshire causing a large lake to develop across much of Shropshire. It was supposed that this lake, named as Lake Lapworth, overtopped its southern margin and rapidly cut down to form the Ironbridge Gorge providing the Severn with a southerly exit to the sea as remains the case today. An alternative theory which has gained favour in recent years does away with Lake Lapworth, suggesting that the upper Severn flowed beneath the icesheet in a bedrock hollow known as the Severn Trench eastwards from Melverley to the Ironbridge Gorge. It is possible that the trench and gorge were cut over successive ice ages.\nTributary rivers.\nOver its length, there are a large number of tributaries, but the three largest feeding the non-tidal river are the Vyrnwy, the Teme and the Warwickshire Avon. The Wye, the Bristol Avon and the Usk all flow into the estuarine section of the Severn. The main tributaries are described in sequence below.\nThe first tributary of significance is the Afon Dulas, joining from the south immediately upstream of Llanidloes, with the Afon Clywedog joining in the town. The Afon Cerist, bolstered by the Afon Trannon, and the Afon Carno join as left bank tributaries immediately upstream of Caersws. Mochdre Brook enters on the western edge of Newtown, followed by the Bechan Brook just northeast of the town. The Mule enters at Abermule, and the River Rhiw east of Berriew, followed shortly by the Camlad which rises above Churchstoke and by the Luggy Brook. The left bank Sylfaen Brook enters at Welshpool, and the Bele Brook via the New Cut east of Arddlin.\nThe River Vyrnwy, which begins at Lake Vyrnwy, flows eastwards through Powys, gathering the waters of the Banwy, Cain and Tanat, before forming part of the border between England and Wales, and joining the Severn near Melverley, Shropshire. The River Perry joins on the left bank above Shrewsbury, while both the Rad Brook and the Rea Brook, which flows northeast from its source at Marton Pool near the Welsh border, join the Severn within the town. The left bank tributary, the River Tern, after flowing south from Market Drayton and being joined by the River Meese and the River Roden, meets the Severn at Attingham Park.\nThe River Worfe joins the Severn's left bank just above Bridgnorth, before the Mor, Borle and Dowles brooks join on the opposite bank over the next few miles, the last-named draining Wyre Forest. The River Stour rises in the north of Worcestershire in the Clent Hills, near St Kenelm's Church at Romsley. It flows north into the adjacent West Midlands at Halesowen. It then flows westwards through Cradley Heath and Stourbridge, where it leaves the Black Country. It is joined by the Smestow Brook at Prestwood before it winds around southwards to Kinver, and then flows back into Worcestershire. It then passes through Wolverley, Kidderminster and Wilden to its confluence with the Severn at Stourport-on-Severn. The Dick Brook, Shrawley Brook and Grimley Brook enter on the right bank before the River Salwarpe, which runs through Droitwich enters on the opposite (east) bank.\nThe River Teme flows eastwards from its source in Mid Wales, straddling the border between Shropshire and Herefordshire; it is joined by the River Onny, River Corve and River Rea before it finally joins the Severn on the southern edge of Worcester. Bushley Brook joins just upstream of the confluence of the Warwickshire Avon with the Severn at Tewkesbury. One of several Avons, this one flows west through Rugby, Warwick and Stratford-upon-Avon. It is then joined by its tributary the River Arrow, before joining the Severn. The rivers Swilgate and Chelt also join the Severn's left bank, as do the Hatherley and Horsbere brooks, before it reaches Gloucester. The River Leadon enters the tidal West Channel of the Severn at Over, immediately west of Gloucester. The River Frome is the second significant tributary to enter the tidal stretch of the Severn, doing so at Framilode. Bideford Brook drains the easternmost part of the Forest of Dean, entering the Severn estuary east of Blakeney. On the opposite (southeast) bank the flow of the River Cam is usurped by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal before reaching the estuary. The Lyd enters the west bank of the estuary at Lydney Harbour, opposite the place where Berkeley Pill carries the waters of the Little Avon River into it. The final tributary before the Severn Bridge is the collection of streams which enter via Oldbury Pill.\nThe River Wye, from its source in Plynlimon in Wales ( from the source of the Severn), flows generally south east through the Welsh towns of Rhayader and Builth Wells. It enters Herefordshire, flows through Hereford, and is shortly afterwards joined by the River Lugg, before flowing through Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth, and then southwards where it forms part of the border between England (Forest of Dean) and Wales. The Wye flows into the Severn estuary south of the town of Chepstow.\nThe Mounton Brook and Nedern Brooks enter on the Monmouthshire side between the two motorway crossings. The Port of Bristol is on the Severn Estuary, where another River Avon flows into it through the Avon Gorge. The River Usk and the Ebbw River flow into the Severn Estuary at Uskmouth just south of Newport.\nSettlements.\nThe river's course within Wales lies wholly within the county of Powys. The first town it encounters downstream of its source is Llanidloes where it is joined by the Dulas and the Clywedog. It flows past the villages of Llandinam and Caersws before reaching Newtown. It then runs by Abermule and Cilcewydd before flowing beside Welshpool, the last town on its course in Wales.\nEntering Shropshire and England, a few villages such as Shrawardine sit back from the river as it meanders eastwards towards the county town of Shrewsbury. More villages, notably Atcham, Wroxeter and Cressage sit beside the river as it turns southeast and heads for the gorge at Ironbridge before turning south for Bridgnorth. The Shropshire villages of Quatford and Hampton Loade and the Worcestershire village of Upper Arley follow, before the Severn runs through Bewdley and Stourport-on-Severn in quick succession. The river then passes the villages of Astley Burf and Holt Fleet before entry into the city of Worcester. Several villages sit back from the river before it runs by Upton-upon-Severn and then enters Gloucestershire as it joins with the Warwickshire Avon outside of Tewkesbury. A few more villages intervene, notable amongst which is Maisemore before the river enters the city of Gloucester from which point it is tidal.\nSeveral more villages sit beside the tidal stretch. Amongst these are Elmore, Epney and Framilode on the east bank and Minsterworth, Broadoak and Newnham on Severn on the west bank.\nTransport.\nBridges.\nThe Severn is bridged at many places, and many of these bridges are notable in their own right. The Iron Bridge at Ironbridge was the world's first iron arch bridge. Several other bridges crossing the river were designed and built by the engineer Thomas Telford.\nThe two major road bridges of the Severn crossing link south eastern Wales with the southern counties of England.\nPrior to the construction of the first bridge in 1966, the channel was crossed by the Aust Ferry.\nOther notable bridges include:\nRail.\nThe Severn Tunnel, completed in 1886 by John Hawkshaw on behalf of the Great Western Railway, lies near the Second Severn Crossing road bridge, and carries the South Wales Main Line section of the Great Western Main Line under the channel. The original line built before the Severn Tunnel was the South Wales Railway from Gloucester, that followed the estuary alongside present day stations of Lydney, Chepstow, Caldicot and Severn Tunnel Junction to Newport.\nCars could also be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between Severn Tunnel Junction and Pilning. The vehicles were loaded onto open flat bed carriages and pulled by a small pannier tank locomotive, although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle with a sheet, as sparks often flew when the steam locomotive tackled the slope leading to the tunnel exit. A railway coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings (\u00a31.50) in the early 1950s.\nDisasters.\nThere have been many disasters on the Severn, which have claimed perhaps 300 lives, depending on sources, especially during the 20th century. The Severn Railway Bridge was badly damaged by the collision of two river barges in 1960, which led to its demolition in 1970. Five crew members of both the \"Arkendale H\" and \"Wastdale H\" died in the accident. There have been frequent floods in Shrewsbury, Bewdley and elsewhere. More recently the river flooded during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2019\u201320 United Kingdom floods.\nNavigation.\nThere is a public right of navigation between Pool Quay, near Welshpool, and Stourport. However this stretch of the river has little traffic, other than small boats, canoes and some tour boats in Shrewsbury. Below Stourport, where the river is more navigable for larger craft, users must obtain permits from the Canal &amp; River Trust, who are the navigation authority. During spring freshet the river can be closed to navigation.\nAt Upper Parting above Gloucester, the river divides into two, and flows either side of Alney Island to Lower Parting. The West Channel is no longer navigable. The East Channel is navigable as far as Gloucester Docks, from where the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal provides a navigable channel south. Between the docks and Lower Parting Llanthony Weir marks the Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the East Channel of the river.\nIn the tidal section of the river below Gloucester, the Gloucester Harbour Trustees are the competent harbour authority. The trustees maintain navigation lights at various points along the river (including on Chapel Rock and Lyde Rock, and leading lights at Slime Road, Sheperdine and Berkeley Pill).\nLocks.\nThere are locks on the lower Severn to enable seagoing boats to reach as far as Stourport. The most northerly lock is at Lincomb, about downstream from Stourport.\nAssociated canals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, (both narrow beam) and the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal join the Severn at Stourport, Worcester and Gloucester respectively. The Droitwich Barge Canal, a broad beam canal, joins the Severn at Hawford, near to the River Salwarpe, and connects to the Droitwich Canal (narrow beam) in the name town, which then forms a link to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. The two Droitwich canals re-opened in 2010 after major restoration.\nThe Gloucester and Sharpness Canal connects the Severn at Gloucester to the Severn at Sharpness, avoiding a stretch of the tidal river which is dangerous to navigate. The Stroudwater Navigation used to join the tidal Severn at Framilode, but since the 1920s has connected to the Severn only via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.\nThe Lydney Canal is a short canal which connects Lydney to the river.\nThe section of the river between Tewkesbury and Worcester forms part of the Avon Ring, a circular cruising route which includes 129 locks and covers parts of three other waterways.\nPassenger transport.\nThe tidal river.\nPaddle steamers were operated in the Severn Estuary from the mid 19th century to the late 1970s by P &amp; A Campbell of Bristol. The vessels, \"Cardiff Queen\", \"Bristol Queen\", \"Glen Usk\", \"Glen Gower\" and \"Britannia\" all operated on this route in the 1950s and 1960s. Since 1986 Waverley Excursions has operated occasional sailings to Sharpness and Lydney by the \"MV Balmoral\".\nA number of ferries were also operated on the tidal river, for example at New Passage, Purton and Arlingham. The last ferry was the Aust Ferry, which closed in 1966 when the Severn Bridge opened. One of the Aust ferries, \"Severn Princess\", is still in Chepstow although largely derelict.\nThe upper river.\nCurrently the only passenger boat operating between Shrewsbury &amp; Gloucester is the 'River King' vessel that operates in Stourport. Worcester River Cruises used to run boat trips up and down the river between Tewkesbury and Stourport, operating the boats \"The Pride of the Midlands\" and \"The Earl Grosvenor\".\nThe Cathedral Ferry, a foot passenger ferry, also operates on summer weekends from the steps of Worcester Cathedral.\nIn Shropshire the Hampton Loade Ferry used to operate across the river but has been closed since 2016.\nIn Shrewsbury, boat trips around the loop of the town centre are at present provided by the \"Sabrina\" and depart from Victoria Quay near the Welsh Bridge during the summer.\nSevern Estuary.\nThe river becomes tidal close to Maisemore, on the West Channel just north of Gloucester, and at Llanthony Weir on the East Channel. However, particularly high tides may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of or so.\nThe tidal river downstream from Gloucester is sometimes referred to as the Severn Estuary, but the river is usually considered to become the Severn Estuary after the Prince of Wales Bridge near Severn Beach, South Gloucestershire (the point to which the jurisdiction of the Gloucester Harbour Trustees extends), or at Aust, the site of the Severn Bridge.\nThe Severn Estuary extends to a line from Lavernock Point (south of Cardiff) to Sand Point near Weston-super-Mare. West of this line is the Bristol Channel. In the Severn Estuary (or the Bristol Channel in the last two cases, depending where the boundary is drawn) are the rocky islands called Denny Island, Steep Holm and Flat Holm.\nThe estuary is about wide at Aust, and about wide between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare.\nSevern Sea.\nUntil Tudor times the Bristol Channel was known as the Severn Sea, and it is still known as this in both Welsh and Cornish (M\u00f4r Hafren and Mor Havren respectively, with \"m\u00f4r\" meaning \"sea\").\nSevern bore.\nA phenomenon associated with the lower reaches of the Severn is the tidal bore, which forms upstream of the port of Sharpness.\nIt is frequently asserted that the river's estuary, which empties into the Bristol Channel, has the second largest tidal range in the world\u2014, exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy. However a tidal range greater than that of the Severn is recorded from the lesser known Ungava Bay in Canada. During the highest tides, the rising water is funnelled up the Severn estuary into a wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current. The largest bores occur in spring, but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. The bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed.\nIndustry.\nA stretch of the River Severn in Shropshire, is known as Ironbridge Gorge. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986. Its historic importance is due to its role as the centre of the iron industry in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution. The gorge and the village of Ironbridge get their name from the Iron Bridge across the Severn, built in 1779, which was the first cast-iron arch bridge ever constructed.\nTwo nuclear power stations are situated on the river, in the area of South Gloucestershire. Oldbury Nuclear Power Station and Berkeley Nuclear Power Station both made use of the River Severn as part of the power generation and nuclear cooling processes. Both are now decommissioned.\nWildlife.\nThe sides of the estuary are also important feeding grounds for waders, notably at the Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve and the Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust. River shingle habitat can also be found on the lower estuary, notable for its population of the endangered 5-spot Ladybird.\nBefore the installation of the weirs, sturgeon and grey seals would regularly reach as far upstream as Worcester. In the winter of 2011/2012 a female grey seal spent several weeks on the river in Bewdley. The same individual was seen at and around Worcester from October to December 2013.\nThe river forms part of the Severn-Trent flyway, a route used by migratory birds to cross Great Britain.\nLiterary and musical allusions.\nThe River Severn is named several times in A. E. Housman's \"A Shropshire Lad\" (1896): \"It dawns in Asia, tombstones show/And Shropshire names are read;/And the Nile spills his overflow/Beside the Severn's dead\" (\"1887\"); \"Severn stream\" (\"The Welsh Marches\"); and \"Severn shore\" (\"Westward from the high-hilled plain...\").\nIn Shakespeare's \"Henry IV, Part 1\", Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy recalls the valour of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March in a long battle against Welshman Owain Glynd\u0175r upon the banks of the Severn, claiming the flooding Severn \"affrighted with [the warriors'] bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank, bloodstained with these valiant combatants.\"\nThe Severn was the inspiration for a number of works by Gloucestershire composer Ivor Gurney, including the songs \"Western Sailors\" (1925) and \"Severn Meadows\" (1917).\nGloucestershire writer and poet Brian Waters published \"Severn Tide\" with J. M. Dent in 1947 and followed it with \"Severn Stream\" in 1949. With anecdotal stories about his travels, both books tell of the lives of the people who lived and worked on and along the river, describing the landscape with a poet's eye. Waters links Nodens with the Severn Bore and the association of the Celtic deity with the river is explored at length by Rogers.\nSeveral 20th-century English composers wrote works inspired by the river. Gerald Finzi (1901\u20131956) wrote \"A Severn Rhapsody,\" his Opus 3, in 1923; taking the Severn River and its surrounding countryside as his inspiration. Edward Elgar (1857\u20131934) wrote \"The Severn Suite,\" Opus 87, in 1930. Elgar lived much of both his early life and his later life near Worcester, through which the Severn runs. Herbert Howells (1892\u20131983), born close to the Severn in Lydney, wrote the complex \"Missa Sabrinensis\" (Mass of the Severn) in 1954, and an earlier hymn tune simply entitled \"Severn\".\nThe Severn is often mentioned in Ellis Peters' \"The Cadfael Chronicles\", set in or around Shrewsbury Abbey, beside the river.\nIn Julian Barnes' 2011 novel, \"The Sense of an Ending\", Tony, the main character, recalls \"a river rushing nonsensically upstream, its wave and wash lit by half a dozen chasing torchbeams,\" an allusion to a visit to the Severn Bore.\nIn the song \"The Last Bristolian Pirate\" by The Longest Johns, a disgruntled farmer decides to become a pirate on the Severn, attacking innocent travellers down the river.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its southern end is at Breueh Island just north of Sumatra, with the Strait of Malacca further southeast.\nTraditionally, the sea has been used for fishery and transportation of goods between the coastal countries and its coral reefs and islands, which are popular tourist destinations. The fishery and tourist infrastructure was severely damaged by the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe Andaman Sea, which extends over 92\u00b0E to 100\u00b0E and 4\u00b0N to 20\u00b0N, occupies a very significant position in the Indian Ocean, yet remained unexplored for a long period. To the south of Myanmar, west of Thailand, and north of Indonesia, this sea is separated from the Bay of Bengal by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and an associated chain of sea mounts along the Indo-Burmese plate boundary. The Strait of Malacca (between the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra) forms the southern exitway of the basin, which is wide and deep.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the \"Andaman or Burma Sea\" as follows:\n\"On the Southwest.\" A line running from \"Oedjong Raja\" [\"\"Ujung Raja\" or \"Point Raja\"\"] () in Sumatra to Poeloe Bras (Breu\u00ebh) and on through the Western Islands of the Nicobar Group to Sandy Point in Little Andaman Island, in such a way that all the narrow waters appertain to the Burma Sea.\n\"On the Northwest.\" The Eastern limit of the Bay of Bengal [A line running from Cape Negrais (16\u00b003'N) in Burma [Myanmar] through the larger islands of the Andaman group, in such a way that all the narrow waters between the islands lie to the Eastward of the line and are excluded from the Bay of Bengal, as far as a point in Little Andaman Island in latitude 10\u00b048'N, longitude 92\u00b024'E].\n\"On the Southeast.\" A line joining Lem Voalan (7\u00b047'N) in Siam [Thailand], and Pedropunt (5\u00b040'N) in Sumatra.\n\"Oedjong\" means \"cape\" and \"Lem\" means \"point in the Dutch language on maps of the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia). Lem Voalan [Phromthep Cape] is the southern extremity of Goh Puket (Phuket Island).\nExclusive economic zone.\nExclusive economic zones in Andaman Sea:\nChannels.\nSee Channels in Bay of Bengal, Laccadive Sea, and Arabian Sea.\nGeology.\nThe northern and eastern side of the basin is shallow, as the continental shelf off the coast of Myanmar and Thailand extends over (marked by isobath). About 45 percent of the basin area is shallower (less than depth), which is the direct consequence of the presence of the wider shelf. The continental slope which follows the eastern shelf is quite steep between 9\u00b0N and 14\u00b0N. Here, the perspective view of the submarine topography sectioned along 95\u00b0E exposes the abrupt rise in depth of sea by about within a short horizontal distance of a degree. Isobaths corresponding to are also shown in the figure to emphasize the steepness of the slope. Further, it may be noted that the deep ocean is also not free from sea mounts; hence only around 15 percent of the total area is deeper than .\nThe northern and eastern parts are shallower than due to the silt deposited by the Irrawaddy River. This major river flows into the sea from the north through Myanmar. The western and central areas are deep. Less than 5% of the sea is deeper than , and in a system of submarine valleys east of the Andaman-Nicobar Ridge, the depth exceeds . The sea floor is covered with pebbles, gravel, and sand.\nThe western boundary of the Andaman Sea is marked by islands and sea mounts, with straits or passages of variable depths that control the entry and exit of water to the Bay of Bengal. There is a drastic change in water depth over a short distance of , as one moves from the Bay of Bengal (around deep) to the vicinity of islands (up to depth) and further into the Andaman Sea. Water is exchanged between the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal through the straits between the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Out of these, the most important straits (in terms of width and depth) are Preparis Channel (PC), Ten Degree Channel (TDC), and Great Channel (GC). PC is the widest but shallowest () of the three and separates south Myanmar from north Andaman. TDC is deep and lies between Little Andaman and Car Nicobar. GC is deep and separates Great Nicobar from Banda Aceh.\nOcean floor tectonics.\nRunning in a rough north\u2013south line on the seabed of the Andaman Sea is the boundary between two tectonic plates, the Burma Plate and the Sunda Plate. These plates (or microplates) are believed to have formerly been part of the larger Eurasian Plate, but were formed when transform fault activity intensified as the Indian Plate began its substantive collision with the Eurasian continent. As a result, a back-arc basin center was created, which began to form the marginal basin which would become the Andaman Sea, the current stages of which commenced approximately 3\u20134\u00a0million years ago (Ma).\nThe boundary between two major tectonic plates results in high seismic activity in the region (see List of earthquakes in Indonesia). Numerous earthquakes have been recorded, and at least six, in 1797, 1833, 1861, 2004, 2005, and 2007, had a magnitude of 8.4 or higher. On 26 December 2004, a large portion of the boundary between the Burma plate and the Indo-Australian plate slipped, causing the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. This megathrust earthquake had a magnitude of 9.3. Between of the boundary underwent thrust faulting and shifted by about , with the sea floor being uplifted several meters. This rise in the sea floor generated a massive tsunami with an estimated height of that killed approximately 280,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean. The initial quake was followed by a series of aftershocks along the arc of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The entire event severely damaged the fishing infrastructure.\nVolcanic activity.\nWithin the sea, to the east of the main Great Andaman island group, lies Barren Island, the only currently active volcano associated with the Indian subcontinent. This island volcano is in diameter and rises above sea level. Its recent activity resumed in 1991 after a quiet period of almost 200 years. It is caused by the ongoing subduction of the India plate beneath the Andaman island arc, which forces magma to rise in this location of the Burma plate. The last eruption started on 13 May 2008 and continues. The volcanic island of Narcondam, which lies further north, was also formed by this process. No records exist of its activity.\nSediments to the Sea.\nCollectively, the modern Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) and Thanlwin (Salween) rivers deliver &gt;600 Mt/yr of sediment to the sea. Most recent studies show: 1) There is little modern sediment accumulating on the shelf immediately off the Ayeyarwady River mouths. In contrast, a major mud wedge with a distal depocenter, up to in thickness, has been deposited seaward in the Gulf of Martaban, extending to approximately water depth into the Martaban Depression. Further, 2) There is no evidence showing that modern sediment has accumulated or is transported into the Martaban Canyon; 3) a mud drape/blanket is wrapping around the narrow western Myanmar Shelf in the eastern Bay of Bengal. The thickness of the mud deposit is up to nearshore and gradually thins to the slope at water depth, and likely escapes into the deep Andaman Trench; 4) The estimated total amount of Holocene sediments deposited offshore is approximately . If we assume this has mainly accumulated since the middle Holocene highstand (~6000 yr BP) like other major deltas, the historical annual mean depositional flux on the shelf would be per year, which is equivalent to ~35% of the modern Ayeyarwady-Thanlwin rivers derived sediments; 5) Unlike other large river systems in Asia, such as the Yangtze and Mekong, this study indicates a bi-directional transport and depositional pattern controlled by the local currents that are influenced by tides, and seasonally varying monsoons winds and waves.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Andaman Sea is determined by the monsoons of southeast Asia, as the prevailing winds reverse with the start of either season. The region experiences north-easterlies with an average windspeed of from November to February. During these months, the western part of the domain experiences maximum wind intensity. It weakens by March\u2013April and reverses to strong south-westerlies from May to September, with mean wind speeds touching in June, July, and August, distributed near-uniformly over the entire basin. Wind speeds plummet by October and switch back to north-easterlies from November.\nAir temperature is stable over the year at in February and in August. Precipitation is as high as /year and mostly occurs in summer. Sea currents are south-easterly and easterly in winter and south-westerly and westerly in summer. The average surface water temperature is in February and in May. The water temperature is constant at at the depths of and below. Salinity is 31.5\u201332.5\u2030 (parts per thousand) in summer and 30.0\u201333.0\u2030 in winter in the southern part. In the northern part, it decreases to 20\u201325\u2030 due to the inflow of freshwater from the Irrawaddy River. Tides are semidiurnal with an amplitude of up to .\nThe effect of wind stress on the ocean surface can be explained by wind stress curl. The net divergence of water in the ocean mixed layer results in Ekman pumping. The contrast between the two seasons elicits a very strong negative pumping velocity of more than per day along the north coast of Indonesia from May to September (shown here, June). This may signify coastal downwelling in the summer. It is also observed that the region develops a weak but positive pumping velocity of less than per day at the mouth of GC in winter (here, December).\nCurrent and wave fluid dynamics.\nGenerally, currents are found to be stronger in the south than any other part of the basin. An intense surface outflux through GC, of the order of , occurs during summers and winters. While this flow is directed westwards in winter, it is southwards along the west coast of Indonesia in summer. On the other hand, the TDC has strong surface influx in summer, which weakens by October. This is followed by a sturdy outflux in winter, which wanes by the month of April. Although the surface flow through PC is generally inward during summer monsoon, the preceding and succeeding months experience outflow (strong outflow in October, but weak outflow in April). During April and October, when the effects of local winds are minimal, Andaman Sea experiences the intensification of meridional surface currents in the poleward direction along the continental slope on the eastern side of the basin. This is characteristic of the propagation of Kelvin Waves.\nIt is observed that the water level rises in the basin between April and November with the maximum rate of piling up of water during April and October (marked by the steep slope of the curve). The rise in sea surface height (SSH) is attributed to rainfall, fresh water influx from rivers, and inflow of water through the three major straits. The first two of these are quantifiable and are hence expressed in volumes of water for comparison. From this, the expected influx through the straits (= SSH anomaly \u2013 Rainfall \u2013 River Influx) could be deduced. A possible fourth factor, evaporative losses, is negligible in comparison. (Previous studies show that the annual mean freshwater gain (precipitation minus evaporation) of the Andaman Sea is per year.) It is found that the SSH of the basin is primarily determined by the transport of water through the straits. The contributions from rainfall and rivers become substantial only during summer. Hence, a net inward flow occurs through the straits between April and November, followed by a net outward transport until March.\nThe basin has a very high rate of transport of water through the straits in April and October. This is a period of equatorial Wyrtki jets, which hit the coast of Sumatra and reflect back as Rossby waves and coastal Kelvin waves. These Kelvin waves are guided along the eastern boundary of Indian Ocean, and a part of this signal propagates into the Andaman Sea. The northern coast of Sumatra is the first to be affected. The isotherm which deepens during the same period is suggestive of the downwelling nature of Kelvin waves. The waves further propagate along the eastern boundary of the Andaman Sea, which is confirmed by the differential deepening of the 20-degree isotherm along longitudes 94\u00b0E and 97\u00b0E (averaged over latitudes 8\u00b0N and 13\u00b0N). These longitudes are chosen so that one represents the western part of the basin (94\u00b0E) and the other along the steep continental slope on the eastern side of the basin (97\u00b0E). It is observed that both these longitudes experience deepening of the isotherms in April and October, but the effect is more pronounced at 97\u00b0E (isotherms deepen by in April and in October). This is a concrete signature of downwelling in the basin and is definitely not forced locally as the winds are weaker during this period. This confirms unequivocally that the sudden burst of water into the basin through the straits, the intensification of eastern boundary currents and the coincidental deepening of isotherms in April and October are the direct consequence of the propagation of downwelling Kelvin waves in the Andaman Sea, remotely forced by equatorial Wyrtki jets. The evolution of vorticity in the basin is suggestive of strong shear in the flow during different times of the year, and further indicates the presence of low frequency geophysical waves (such as westward propagating Rossby waves) and other transient eddies.\nEcology.\nFlora.\nThe coastal areas of the Andaman Sea are characterized by mangrove forests and seagrass meadows. Mangroves cover between more than of the Thai shores of Malay Peninsula whereas seagrass meadows occupy an area of . Mangroves are largely responsible for the high productivity of the coastal waters \u2013 their roots trap soil and sediment and provide shelter from predators and nursery for fish and small aquatic organisms. Their body protects the shore from the wind and waves, and their detritus are a part of the aquatic food chain. A significant part of the Thai mangrove forests in the Andaman Sea was removed during the extensive brackish water shrimp farming in 1980s. Mangroves were also significantly damaged by the 2004 tsunami. They were partly replanted after that, but their area is still gradually decreasing due to human activities.\nOther important sources of nutrients in the Andaman Sea are seagrass and the mud bottoms of lagoons and coastal areas. They also create a habitat or temporal shelter for many burrowing and benthic organisms. Many aquatic species migrate from and to seagrass either daily or at certain stages of their life cycle. The human activities which damage seagrass beds include waste water discharge from coastal industry, shrimp farms and other forms of coastal development, as well as trawling and the use of push nets and dragnets. The 2004 tsunami affected 3.5% of seagrass areas along the Andaman Sea via siltation and sand sedimentation and 1.5% suffered total habitat loss.\nFauna.\nThe sea waters along the Malay Peninsula favor molluscan growth, and there are about 280 edible fish species belonging to 75 families. Of those, 232 species (69 families) are found in mangroves and 149 species (51 families) reside in seagrass; so 101 species are common to both habitats. The sea also hosts many vulnerable fauna species, including dugong (\"Dugong dugon\"), several dolphin species, such as Irrawaddy dolphin (\"Orcaella brevirostris\") and four species of sea turtles: critically endangered leatherback turtle (\"Dermochelys coriacea\") and hawksbill turtle (Eletmochelys imbricata) and threatened green turtle (\"Chelonia mydas\") and olive ridley turtle (\"Lepidochelys olivacea\"). There are only about 150 dugongs in the Andaman Sea, scattered between Ranong and Satun Provinces. These species are sensitive to the degradation of seagrass meadows.\nCoral reefs are estimated to occupy 73,364 rai (117\u00a0km2) in the Andaman Sea with only 6.4 percent in ideal condition.\nHuman activities.\nThe sea has long been used for fishing and transportation of goods between the coastal countries.\nFishing.\nThailand alone harvested about of fish in 2005 and about in 2000. Of those , are accounted for by trawling (1,017 vessels), by purse seine (415 vessels), and about by gillnets. Of Thailand's total marine catch, 41% is caught in the Gulf of Thailand and 19% in the Andaman Sea. 40% is caught in waters outside Thailand's EEZ.\nProduction numbers are significantly smaller for Malaysia and are comparable, or higher, for Myanmar. Competition for fish resulted in numerous conflicts between Myanmar and Thailand. In 1998 and 1999, they resulted in fatalities on both sides and nearly escalated into a military conflict. In both cases, the Thai navy intervened when Burmese vessels tried to intercept Thai fishing boats in the contested sea areas, and Thai fighter aircraft were thought to be deployed by the National Security Council. Thai fishing boats were also frequently confronted by the Malaysian navy to the extent that the Thai government had to caution its own fishers against fishing without license in foreign waters.\nThe 2004 marine production in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are released to the sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (\"Stolephorus\" spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (\"Rastrelliger brachysoma\", 18 percent), sardinellas (\"Sardinellars\" spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (\"Thunnus tonggol\", 9 percent), eastern little tuna (\"Euthynnus affinis\", 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (\"Rastrelliger kanagurta\", 4 percent), king mackerel (\"Scomberomorus cavalla\", 3 percent), torpedo scad (\"Megalaspis cordyla \", 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (\"Priacanthus tayenus\"), threadfin bream (\"Nemipterus hexodon\"), brushtooth lizardfish (\"Saurida undosquamis\"), slender lizardfish (\"Saurida elongata\") and Jinga shrimp (\"Metapenaeus affinis\"). Most species are overfished since the 1970s\u20131990s, except for Spanish mackerel (\"Scomberomorus commersoni\"), carangidae and torpedo scad (\"Meggalaspis\" spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (\"Anadara granosa\") and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 percent of the total marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (\"Thenus orientalis\"), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was for squid and cuttlefish and for crustaceans.\nMineral resources.\nThe sea's mineral resources include tin deposits off the coasts of Malaysia and Thailand. Major ports are Port Blair in India; Dawei, Mawlamyine and Yangon in Myanmar; Ranong port in Thailand; George Town and Penang in Malaysia; and Belawan in Indonesia.\nTourism.\nThe Andaman Sea, particularly the western coast of the Malay Peninsula, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India and Myanmar are rich in coral reefs and offshore islands with spectacular topography. Despite having been damaged by the 2004 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami, they remain popular tourist destinations. The nearby coast also has numerous marine national parks \u2013 16 only in Thailand, and four of them are candidates for inclusion into UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The country has north, east and complex east-to-north coasts including the curved Gulf of Gab\u00e8s, which forms the western part of Africa's Gulf of Sidra. Most of this greater gulf forms the main coast of Libya including the city of Sirte which shares its root name. The country's geographic coordinates are . Tunisia occupies an area of 163,610 square kilometres, of which 8,250 are water. The principal and reliable rivers rise in the north of the country with a few notable exceptions from north-east Algeria and flow through the northern plain where sufficient rainfall supports diverse plant cover and irrigated agriculture.\nPhysical geography.\nTunisia is on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Nile Delta. It is bordered by Algeria on the west and Libya on the south east. It lies between latitudes 30\u00b0 and 38\u00b0N, and longitudes 7\u00b0 and 12\u00b0E. An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west\u2013east in the north, and north\u2013south in the east\nTunisia is about the size of the American state of Wisconsin. Despite its relatively small size, Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its north\u2013south extent. Its east\u2013west extent is limited. Differences in Tunisia, like the rest of the Maghreb, are largely north\u2013south environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point.\nThe Dorsal, the eastern extension of the Saharan Atlas Mountains, runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east. North of the Dorsal is the Tell, a region characterized by low, rolling hills and plains, again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria. In the Khroumerie, the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell, elevations reach and snow occurs in winter. The Sahel, a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, is among the world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the Sahel, between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa, are the steppes. Much of the southern region is desert.\nTunisia has a coastline long. In maritime terms, the country claims a contiguous zone of , and a territorial sea of .\nRivers.\nThe Medjerda River rises in Algeria and flows east through the third of the country with reliable rivers, the north. It empties into the Gulf of Tunis and Lake of Tunis. At it is the longest river. It is also known as the \"w\u0101di\" (or ) \"Majardah\" and \"Wadi Mejerha\" and it was known as \"Bagrada\" in ancient times. It rises in a further section of the Tell Atlas in Algeria, staying to the south of the Tell escarpment while within the country. It has been dammed at the Sidi Salem Dam. The Oued Zouara rises in the country's own section of the Tell. It has been dammed by the Sidi el Barrak Dam which forms a large lake widely used across the north and centre of the country in an advanced water management project.\nClimate.\nTunisia's climate is hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Csa\") in the north, where winters are mild with moderate rainfall and summers are hot and dry. Temperatures in July and August can exceed when the tropical continental air mass of the desert reaches the whole Tunisia. Winters are mild with temperatures rarely exceeding (exception is the south-west of the country). The south of the country is desert. The terrain in the north is mountainous, which, moving south, gives way to a hot, dry central plain. As we go to the south, the climate naturally becomes hotter, drier and sunnier. The southern part has therefore a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"BWh\") with extremely hot summers, warm winters and very low annual rainfall amount. Daytime temperatures consistently turn around during summers. However, the warmth of winters is only during daytime because nights can be cold in the desert. A series of salt lakes, known as \"chottzz\" or \"shatts\", lie in an east\u2013west line at the northern edge of the Sahara Desert, extending from the Gulf of Gabes into Algeria. The lowest point is Chott el Djerid, at , and the highest is Jebel ech Chambi, at . Annual average rainfall amount is lower than nearly everywhere in Tunisia. Tunisia is therefore a dry, semi-arid country. Areas with a pre-Saharan climate receive below and areas with a typical Saharan climate receive below of annual average precipitation. The southernmost part receives rainfall as low as in areas around El Borma, along the Algerian border.\nNatural resources.\nTunisia possesses petroleum, phosphates, iron ore, lead, zinc, salt, gold and arable land. 3,850\u00a0km2 of land is irrigated in Tunisia. The use of land in the country is demonstrated in the following table.\nEnvironment.\nCurrent environmental issues for Tunisia include:\nTunisia is a party to the following international agreements: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78) and Wetlands. Tunisia has signed, but not ratified the Marine Life Conservation agreement.\nTunisia, like other North African countries, has lost much of its prehistoric biodiversity due to the ongoing expanding human population; for example, until historic times there was a population of the endangered primate Barbary macaque (\"Macaca sylvanus\"). The monk seal is now extirpated (locally extinct).\nExtreme points.\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Tunisia, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50811", "revid": "36336112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50811", "title": "History of Tunisia", "text": "The present day Republic of Tunisia, \"al-Jumhuriyyah at-Tunisiyyah\", is situated in Northern Africa. Geographically situated between Libya to the east, Algeria to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Tunis is the capital and the largest city (population over 800,000); it is near the ancient site of the city of Carthage.\nThroughout its recorded history, the physical features and environment of the land of Tunisia have remained fairly constant, although during ancient times more abundant forests grew in the north, and earlier in prehistory the Sahara to the south was not an arid desert.\nThe weather is temperate in the north, which enjoys a Mediterranean climate with mild rainy winters and hot dry summers, the terrain being wooded and fertile. The Medjerda river valley (Wadi Majardah, northeast of Tunis) is currently valuable farmland. Along the eastern coast the central plains enjoy a moderate climate with less rainfall but significant precipitation in the form of heavy dews; these coastlands are currently used for orchards and grazing. Near the mountainous Algerian border rises \"Jebel ech Chambi\", the highest point in the country at 1544 meters. In the near south, a belt of salt lakes running east\u2013west cuts across the country. Further south lies the Sahara desert, including the sand dunes of the \"Grand Erg Oriental\".\nEarly history.\nFirst peoples.\nStone age tools dating from the Middle Stone Age (around 200,000 years ago) found near Kelibia are the earliest evidence of human activity in the region. Finds have been made of stone blades, tools, and small figurines of the Capsian culture (named after Gafsa in Tunisia), which lasted from around 10,000 to 6,000 BC (the Mesolithic period). Seasonal migration routes evidence their ancient journeys. Saharan rock art, consisting of inscriptions and paintings that show design patterns as well as figures of animals and of humans, are attributed to the Berbers and also to Native Africans from the south. Dating these outdoor art works has proven difficult and unsatisfactory.291 Egyptian influence is thought very unlikely. Among the animals depicted, alone or in staged scenes, are large-horned buffalo (the extinct \"bubalus antiquus\"), elephants, donkeys, colts, rams, herds of cattle, a lion and lioness with three cubs, leopards or cheetahs, hogs, jackals, rhinoceroses, giraffes, hippopotamus, a hunting dog, and various antelope. Human hunters may wear animal masks and carry their weapons. Herders are shown with elaborate head ornamentation; a few other human figures are shown dancing, while others are driving chariots or riding camels.\nBy five thousand years ago, a Neolithic culture was evolving among the sedentary proto-Berbers of the Maghrib in northwest Africa, characterized by the practice of agriculture and animal domestication, as well as the making of pottery and finely chipped stone arrowheads. They planted wheat, barley, beans and chick peas in their fields, and used ceramic bowls and basins, goblets, plates, and large cooking dishes daily. These were stored by hanging on the walls of their domiciles. Archaeological evidence shows these proto-Berbers were already \"farmers with a strong pastoral element in their economy and fairly elaborate cemeteries,\" well over a thousand years before the Phoenicians arrived to found Carthage. Individual wealth was measured among the nomadic herders of the south by the number of sheep, goats, and cattle a man possessed. Finds of scraps of cloth woven in stripes of different colors indicate that these groups wove fabrics.\nThe religion of the ancient Berbers is undocumented and only funerary rites can be reconstructed from archaeological evidence. Burial sites provide an early indication of religious beliefs; almost sixty thousand tombs are located in the Fezzan alone, according to the Italian scholar Giacomo Caputo. A more recent tomb, the \"Medracen\" in eastern Algeria, still stands. Built for a Berber king and traditionally assigned to Masinissa (r. 202\u2013149 BC), it may have belonged instead to his father Gala (or Gaia). The architecture of the elegant tower tomb of his contemporary Syphax shows Greek or Punic influence. Most other information about Berber religious beliefs comes from later, classical times. The Libyans believed that divine power showed itself in the natural world, and could, for example, inhabit bodies of water or reside in stones, which were objects of worship. Procreative power was symbolized by the bull, the lion, and the ram. Among the proto-Berbers in the area that is now Tunisia, images of fish, often found in mosaics excavated there, were phallic symbols that fended off the evil eye, while sea shells signified the female sex.243 Herodotus mentions that Libyans of the Nasamone tribe slept on the graves of their ancestors in order to induce dreams for divination.377 Libyans sacrificed to the sun and to the moon (Ayyur).391 Eventually supernatural entities became personalized as gods, perhaps influenced by Egyptian or Punic practice; yet the Berbers seemed to be \"drawn more to the sacred than to the gods.\"245 Often only a little more than the names of the Berber deities are known, e.g., \"Bonchar\", a leading god. Eventually, Berbero-Libyans came to adopt elements from ancient Egyptian religion. Herodotus writes of the divine oracle sourced in the Egyptian god Ammon located among the Libyans, at the oasis of Siwa. Later, Berber beliefs influenced the Punic religion of Carthage, the city-state founded by the Phoenicians.\nEgyptian hieroglyphs from the early dynasties also testify to Libyans, the Berbers of the \"western desert\". First mentioned as the Tehenou during the pre-dynastic reigns of Scorpion II (c. 3050) and of Narmer (on an ivory cylinder), their appearance is later disclosed in a bas relief of the Fifth Dynasty temple of Sahure. Ramses II (r. 1279\u20131213) placed Libyan contingents in his army. Tombs of the 13th century BC show paintings of \"Libu\" leaders wearing fine robes, with ostrich feathers in their \"dreadlocks\", short pointed beards, and tattoos on their shoulders and arms. Evidently, Osorkon the Elder (Akheperre setepenamun), a Berber of the Meshwesh tribe, became the first Libyan pharaoh. Several decades later, his nephew Shoshenq I (r. 945\u2013924) became Pharaoh of Egypt, and the founder of its Twenty-second Dynasty (945\u2013715).xv In 926 Shoshenq I (thought to be Shishak of the Bible) successfully campaigned to Jerusalem then ruled by Solomon's heir. For several centuries Egypt was governed by a decentralized system based on the Libyan tribal organization of the Meshwesh. Becoming acculturated, Libyans also served as high priests at Egyptian religious centers.129,131 Hence during the classical era of the Mediterranean, all of the Berber peoples of Northwest Africa were often known collectively as Libyans.\nFarther west, foreigners knew some Berbers as Gaetulians (who lived in remote areas), and those Berbers more familiar as the Numidians, and as the Mauri or Maurisi (later the Moors). These Berber peoples interacted with Phoenicia and Carthage (who also used the name \"Libyphoenicians\"), and later with Rome. Yet prior to this era of history, sedentary rural Berbers apparently lived in semi-independent farming villages, composed of small tribal units under a local leader. Yet seasonally they might leave to find pasture for their herds and flocks. Modern conjecture is that robust feuding between neighborhood clans kept Berber political organization from rising above the village level, yet the military threat from the city-state of Carthage would inspire Berber villages to join in order to marshall large-scale armed forces under a strong leader. Social techniques from the nearby polity of Carthage were adopted and modified for Berber use.\nA bilingual (Punic and Berber) urban inscription of the 2nd century BC from Berber Numidia, specifically from the city of Thugga (modern Dougga, Tunisia), indicates a complex city administration, with the Berber title GLD (corresponding to modern Berber \"Aguellid\", or paramount tribal chief) being the ruling municipal office of the city government; this office apparently rotated among the members of leading Berber families. Circa 220 BC, in the early light given us by historical accounts, three large kingdoms had arisen among the Berbers of Northwest Africa (west to east): (1) the \"Mauri\" (in modern Morocco) under king Baga; (2) the \"Masaesyli\" (in northern Algeria) under Syphax who ruled from two capitals, Siga (near modern Oran) and to the east Cirta (modern Constantine); and (3) the \"Massyli\" (south of Cirta, west and south of Carthage) ruled by Gala, father of Masinissa. Later Masinissa would receive full honors befitting an important leader from both Roman and Hellenic states. Berber ethnic identities were maintained during the long periods of dominance by Carthage and Rome.\nDuring the first centuries of the Islamic era, it was said that the Berber tribes were divided into two blocs, the Butr (Zanata and allies) and the Baranis (Sanhaja, Masmuda, and others). The etymology of these names is unclear, perhaps deriving from tribal customs for clothing (\"abtar\" and \"burnous\"), or perhaps distinguishing the nomad (Butr) from the farmer (Baranis). The Arabs drew most of their early recruits from the Butr. Later, legends arose of an obscure, ancient invasion of Northwest Africa by the Himyarite Arabs of Yemen, from which a prehistoric ancestry was evidently fabricated: Berber descent from two brothers, Burnus and Abtar, who were sons of Barr, the grandson of Canaan (Canaan being the grandson of Noah through his son Ham). Both Ibn Khaldun (1332\u20131406) and Ibn Hazm (994\u20131064) as well as Berber genealogists held that the Himyarite Arab ancestry was totally unacceptable. This legendary ancestry, however, played a role in the long Arabization process that. continued for centuries among the Berber peoples.\nIn their medieval Islamic history the Berbers may be divided into three major tribal groups: the Zanata, the Sanhaja, and the Masmuda. The Zanata early on allied more closely with the Arabs and consequently became more Arabized, although Znatiya Berber is still spoken in small islands across Algeria and in northern Morocco (the Rif and north Middle Atlas). The Sanhaja are also widely dispersed throughout the Maghrib, among which are: the sedentary Kabyle on the coast west of modern Algiers, the nomadic Zanaga of southern Morocco (the south Anti-Atlas) and the western Sahara to Senegal, and the Tuareg (al-Tawarik), the well-known camel breeding nomads of the central Sahara. The descendants of the Masmuda are sedentary Berbers of Morocco, in the High Atlas, and from Rabat inland to Azru and Khanifra, the most populous of the modern Berber regions.\nMedieval events in Ifriqiya and al-Maghrib often have tribal associations. Linked to the Kabyle \"Sanhaja\" were the Kutama tribes, whose support helped to establish the Fatimid Caliphate (909\u20131171, only until 1049 in Ifriqiya); their vassals and later successors in Ifriqiya the Zirids (973\u20131160) were also \"Sanhaja\". The Almoravids (1056\u20131147) first began far south of Morocco, among the Lamtuna \"Sanhaja\". From the \"Masmuda\" came Ibn Tumart and the Almohad movement (1130\u20131269), later supported by the \"Sanhaja\". Accordingly, it was from among the \"Masmuda\" that the Hafsid dynasty (1227\u20131574) of Tunis originated.\nMigrating peoples.\nThe historical era opens with the advent of traders coming by sea from the eastern Mediterranean. Eventually they were followed by a stream of colonists, landing and settling along the coasts of Africa and Iberia, and on the islands of the western seas.\nThe Neolithic Revolution brought technological innovations and economic development in the eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, and along the Nile, increased the demand for various metals not found locally in sufficient quantity. Phoenician traders recognized the relative abundance and low cost of the needed metals among the goods offered for trade by local merchants in Hispania, which spurred trade. In the Phoenician city-state of Tyre, much of this Mediterranean commerce, as well as the corresponding trading settlements located at coastal stops along the way to the west, were directed by the kings, e.g., Hiram of Tyre (969\u2013936).\nBy three thousand years ago the Levant and Hellas had enjoyed remarkable prosperity, resulting in population growth in excess of their economic base. On the other hand, political instability from time to time caused disruption of normal business and resulted in short-term economic distress. City-states started organizing their youth to migrate in groups to locations where the land was less densely settled. Importantly, the number of colonists coming from Greece was much larger than those coming from Phoenicia.\nTo these migrants, lands in the western Mediterranean presented an opportunity and could be reached relatively easily by ship, without marching through foreign territory. Colonists sailed westward following in the wake of their commercial traders. The Greeks arrived later, coming to (what is now) southern France, southern Italy including Sicily, and eastern Libya. Earlier the Phoenicians had settled in (what is now) Sardinia, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Sicily, and Tunisia. In Tunisia the city of Carthage was founded, which would come to rule all the other Phoenician settlements.\nThroughout Tunisia's history many peoples have arrived among the Berbers to settle: most recently the French along with many Italians, before them came the Ottoman Turks with their multi-ethnic rule, yet earlier the Arabs who brought their language and the religion of Islam, and its calendar; before them arrived the Byzantines, and the Vandals. Over two thousand years ago came the Romans, whose Empire long governed the region. The Phoenicians founded Carthage close to three thousand years ago. Also came migrations from the Sahel region of Africa. Perhaps eight millennia ago, already there were peoples established among whom the proto-Berbers (coming from the east) mingled, and from whom the Berbers would spring, during an era of their ethno-genesis.\nCarthage.\nFoundation.\nThe city of Carthage (site of its ruins near present-day Tunis) was founded by Phoenicians coming from the eastern Mediterranean coast. Its name, pronounced \"Qart Hadesht\" in the Punic language that meant \"new city\" (It's cognate with Arabic, \"Qarya \u0126ad\u012btha\", lit: \"Modern Village/City). The Punic idiom is a Canaanite language, in the group of Northwest Semitic languages.\nTimaeus of Taormina, a third century BC Greek historian from Sicily, gives the date of the founding of Carthage as thirty-eight years before the first Olympiad (776 BC), which in today's calendar would be the year 814 BC. Timaeus in Sicily was proximous to Cathaginians and their version of the city's foundation; his date is generally accepted as approximate. Ancient authors, such as Sallust and Pliny the Elder, give founding dates several hundred years earlier for other Phoenician cities in the western Mediterranean, such as Utica and Gades, but recent archeology has been unable to verify these earlier dates.\nIt was Tyre, a major maritime city-state of Phoenicia, which first settled Carthage, probably in order to enjoy a permanent station there for its ongoing trade. Legends alive in the African city for centuries assigned its foundation to a queen of Tyre, Elissa, also called Dido. The Roman historian Pompeius Trogus, a near contemporary of Virgil, describes a sinister web of court intrigue which caused Queen Elissa (Dido) to flee the city of Tyre westward with a fleet of ships. The Roman poet Virgil (70\u201319 BC) portrays Dido as the tragic, admirable heroine of his epic the \"Aeneid\", which contains many inventions loosely based on legendary history, and includes the story about how the Phoenician queen acquired the Byrsa.\nSovereignty.\nBy the middle of the sixth century BC, Carthage had grown into a fully independent thalassocracy. Under Mago (r., c.550\u2013530) and later his Magonid family, Carthage became preeminent among the Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean, which included nearby Utica.\nTrading partnerships were established among the Numidian Berbers to the west along the African coast as well as to the east in Libya; other stations were located in southern Sardinia and western Sicily, Ibiza in the Balearics, Lixus south of the straits, and Gades north of the straits, with additional trading stations in the south and east of Iberia. Also, Carthage enjoyed an able ally in the Etruscans, who then ruled a powerful state to the north of the infant city of Rome.\nA merchant sailor of Carthage, Himilco, explored in the Atlantic to the north of the straits, along the coast of the Lusitanians and perhaps as far as Oestrymnis (modern Brittany), circa 500 BC. Carthage would soon supplant the Iberian city of Tartessus in carrying the tin trade from Oestrymnis. Another, Hanno the Navigator explored the Atlantic to the south, along the African coast well past the River Gambia. The traders of Carthage were known to be secretive about business and particularly about trade routes; it was their practice to keep the straits to the Atlantic closed to the Greeks.\nIn the 530s there had been a three sided naval struggle between the Phoenicians, the Greeks, and the Etrusco-Punic allies; the Greeks lost Corsica to the Etruscans and Sardinia to Carthage. Then the Etruscans attacked Greek colonies in the Campania south of Rome, but unsuccessfully. As an eventual result, Rome threw off their Etruscan kings of the Tarquin dynasty. The Roman Republic and Carthage in 509 entered into a treaty which set out to define their commercial zones.\nGreek rivalry.\nThe energetic presence of Greek traders and their emporia in the Mediterranean region led to disputes over commercial spheres of influence, especially in Sicily. This Greek threat, plus the foreign conquest of Phoenicia in the Levant, had caused many Phoenician colonies to come under the leadership of Carthage. In 480 BC (concurrent with Persia's invasion of Greece), Mago's grandson Hamilcar landed a large army in Sicily in order to confront Syracuse (a colony of Corinth) on the island's eastern coast, but the Greeks prevailed at the Battle of Himera. A long struggle ensued with intermittent warfare between Syracuse led by e.g., the tyrant Dionysius I (r.405\u2013367), and Carthage led by e.g., Hanno I the Great. Later, near Syracuse Punic armies defeated the Greek leader Agathocles (r.317\u2013289) in battle, who then attempted a bold strategic departure by leaving Sicily and landing his forces at Cape Bon near Carthage, frightening the city. Yet Carthage again defeated Agathocles (310\u2013307). Greece, preoccupied with its conquest of the Persian Empire in the east, eventually became supplanted in the western Mediterranean by Rome, the new rival of Carthage.\nAll this while Carthage enlarged its commercial sphere, venturing south to develop the Saharan trade, augmenting its markets along the African coast, in southern Iberia, and among the Mediterranean islands, and exploring in the far Atlantic. Carthage also established its authority directly among the Numidian Berber peoples in the lands immediately surrounding the city, which grew ever more prosperous.\nReligion of Carthage.\nThe Phoenicians of Tyre brought their lifestyle and inherited customs with them to Northwest Africa. Their religious practices and beliefs were generally similar to those of their neighbors in Canaan, which in turn shared characteristics common throughout the ancient Semitic world. Several aspects of Canaanite religion have been widely criticized, particularly temple prostitution and child sacrifice. Canaanite religious sense and mythology do not appear as elaborated or developed as those of Mesopotamia. In Canaan the supreme god was called \"El\", which means \"god\" in common Semitic. The important storm god was called \"Baal\", which means \"master\". Other gods were called after royalty, e.g., \"Melqart\" means \"king of the city\".\nThe gods of the Semitic pantheon that were worshipped would depend on the identity of the particular city-state or tribe. After being transplanted to Africa far from its regional origins, and after co-existing with the surrounding Berber tribes, the original Phoenician pantheon and ways of worship evolved distinctly over time at the city-state of Carthage.\nConstitution of Carthage.\nThe government of Carthage was undoubtedly patterned after the Phoenician, especially the mother city of Tyre, but Phoenician cities had kings and Carthage apparently did not. An important office was called in Punic the \"Suffets\" (a Semitic word agnate with the Old Hebrew \"Shophet\" usually translated as Judges as in the Book of Judges). Yet the Suffet at Carthage was more the executive leader, but as well served in a judicial role. Birth and wealth were the initial qualifications. It appears that the Suffet was elected by the citizens, and held office for a one-year term; probably there were two of them at a time; hence quite comparable to the Roman Consulship. A crucial difference was that the Suffet had no military power. Carthaginian generals marshalled mercenary armies and were separately elected. From about 550 to 450 the Magonid family monopolized the top military position; later the Barcid family acted similarly. Eventually it came to be that, after a war, the commanding general had to testify justifying his actions before a court of 104 judges.\nAristotle (384\u2013322, Greek) discusses Carthage in his \"Politica\" describing the city as a \"mixed constitution\", a political arrangement with cohabiting elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. Later Polybus of Megalopolis (c.204\u2013122, Greek) in his \"Histories\" would describe the Roman Republic as a mixed constitution in which the Consuls were the monarchy, the Senate the aristocracy, and the Assemblies the democracy.\nEvidently Carthage also had an institution of elders who advised the Suffets, similar to the Roman Senate. We do not have a name for this body. At times members would travel with an army general on campaign. Members also formed permanent committees. The institution had several hundred members from the wealthiest class who held office for life. Vacancies were probably filled by co-option. From among its members were selected the 104 Judges mentioned above. Later the 104 would come to judge not only army generals but other office holders as well. Aristotle regarded the 104 as most important; he compared it to the ephorate of Sparta with regard to control over security. In Hannibal's time, such a Judge held office for life. At some stage there also came to be independent self-perpetuating boards of five who filled vacancies and supervised (non-military) government administration.\nPopular assemblies also existed at Carthage. When deadlocked the Suffets and the quasi-senatorial institution might request the assembly to vote, or in very crucial matters in order to achieve political coherence. The assembly members had no \"legal\" wealth or birth qualification. How its members were selected is unknown, e.g., whether by festival group or urban ward or another method.\nThe Greeks were favorably impressed by the constitution of Carthage; Aristotle had a study of it made which unfortunately is lost. In the brief approving review of it found in his \"Politica\" Aristotle saw one fault: that focus on pursuit of wealth led to oligarchy. So it was in Carthage. The people were politically passive; popular rights came late. Being a commercial republic fielding a mercenary army, the people were not conscripted for military service, an experience which can foster the feel for popular political action. On the other hand, Carthage was very stable; there were few openings for tyrants. \"The superiority of their constitution is proved by the fact that the common people remain loyal,\" noted Aristotle. Only after defeat by Rome devastated Carthage's imperial ambitions did the people express interest in reform\nIn 196, following the Second Punic War, Hannibal, still greatly admired as a Barcid military leader, was elected Suffet. When his reforms were blocked by a financial official about to become a Judge for life, Hannibal rallied the populace against the 104 Judges. He proposed a one-year term for the 104, as part of a major civic overhaul. His political opponents cravenly went to Rome and charged Hannibal with conspiracy, with plotting war against Rome in league with Antiochus the Hellenic ruler of Syria. Although Scipio Africanus resisted such maneuver, eventually Roman intervention forced Hannibal to leave Carthage. Thus corrupt officials of Carthage efficiently blocked Hannibal's efforts at reform.\nThe above description of the constitution basically follows Warmington. Largely it is taken from descriptions by Greek foreigners who likely would see in Carthage reflections of their own institutions. How strong was the Hellenizing influence within Carthage? The basic difficulty is the lack of adequate writings due to the secretive nature of the Punic state as well as to the utter destruction of the capital city and its records. Another view of the constitution of Carthage is given by Charles-Picard as follows.\nMago (6th century) was \"King\" of Carthage, Punic \"MLK\" or \"malik\" (Greek \"basileus\"), not merely a \"SFT\" or \"Suffet\", which then was only a minor official. Mago as \"MLK\" was head of state and war leader; being \"MLK\" was also a religious office. His family was considered to possess a sacred quality. Mago's office was somewhat similar to that of Pharaoh, but although kept in a family it was not hereditary, it was limited by legal consent; however, the council of elders and the popular assembly are late institutions. Carthage was founded by the \"King\" of Tyre who had a royal monopoly on this trading venture. Accordingly, royal authority was the traditional source of power the \"MLK\" of Carthage possessed. Later, as other Phoenician ship companies entered the trading region, and so associated with the city-state, the \"MLK\" of Carthage had to keep order among a rich variety of powerful merchants in their negotiations over risky commerce across the seas. The office of \"MLK\" began to be transformed, yet it was not until the aristocrats of Carthage became landowners that a council of elders was institutionalized.\nPunic Wars with Rome.\nThe emergence of the Roman Republic and its developing foreign interests led to sustained rivalry with Carthage for dominion of the western Mediterranean. As early as 509 BC Carthage and Rome had entered into treaty status, but eventually their opposing positions led to disagreement, alienation, and conflict.\nThe First Punic War (264\u2013241 BC) started in Sicily. It developed into a naval war in which the Romans learned how to fight at sea and prevailed. Carthage lost Sardinia and its western portion of Sicily. Following their defeat, the Mercenary revolt threatened the social order of Carthage, which they survived under their opposing leaders Hanno II the Great, and Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal.\nThe Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC) started over a dispute concerning Saguntum (near modern Valencia) in Hispania, from whence Hannibal set out, leading his armies over the Alps into Italy. At first Hannibal (\"grace of Baal\") won great military victories against Rome, at Trasimeno (217 BC) and at Cannae (216 BC), which came close to destroying Rome's ability to wage war. Yet the majority of Rome's Italian allies remained loyal; Rome drew on all her resources and managed to rebuild her military strength. For many years Hannibal remained on campaign in southern Italy. An attempt in 207 BC by his brother Hasdrubal to reinforce him failed. Meanwhile, Roman armies were contesting Carthage for the control of Hispania, in 211 BC the domain of armies under Hannibal's three brothers (Hasdrubal and Mago), and Hasdrubal Gisco; by 206 BC the Roman general Cornelius Scipio (later Africanus) had defeated Punic power there. In 204 BC Rome landed armies at Utica near Carthage, which forced Hannibal's return. One Numidian king, Syphax, supported Carthage. Another, Masinissa, Rome. At the Battle of Zama in 202 BC the same Roman general Scipio Africanus defeated Hannibal, ending the long war. Carthage lost its trading cities in Hispania and elsewhere in the Western Mediterranean, and much of its influence over the Numidian Kingdoms in Northwest Africa. Carthage became reduced to its immediate surroundings. Also, it was required to pay a large indemnity to Rome. Carthage revived, causing great alarm in Rome.\nThe Third Punic War (149\u2013146 BC) began following the refusal by Carthage to alter the terms of its agreement with Rome. Roman armies again came to Africa and lay siege to the ancient and magnificent city of Carthage, which rejected negotiations. Eventually, the end came; Carthage was destroyed and its citizens enslaved.\nAfterward The region (modern Tunisia) was annexed by the Roman Republic as the province of Africa. Carthage itself was eventually rebuilt by the Romans. Long after the fall of Rome, the city of Carthage would be again destroyed.\nRoman Province of Africa.\nRepublic and early Empire.\nThe Province (basically what is now Tunisia and coastal regions to the east) became the scene of military campaigns directed by well known Romans during the last decades of the Republic. Gaius Marius celebrated his \"triumph\" as a result of successfully finishing Rome's war against Jugurtha, the Numidian king. A wealthy \"novus homo\" and populares, Marius was the first Roman general to enlist in his army \"proletari\" (landless citizens); he was chosen Consul an unprecedented seven times (107, 104\u2013100, 86). The optimate Lucius Cornelius Sulla, later Consul (88, 80), and Dictator (82\u201379), had served as quaestor under the military command of Marius in Numidia. There in 106 Sulla persuaded Bocchus to hand over Jurgurtha, which ended the war.\nIn 47 BC Julius Caesar landed in Africa in pursuit of Pompey's remnant army, which was headquartered at Utica where they enjoyed the support of the Numidian King Juba I. Also present was Cato the Younger, a political leader of Caesar's republican opponents. Caesar's victory nearby at the Battle of Thapsus almost put an end to that phase of the civil war. Cato committed suicide by his sword. Caesar then annexed Numidia (the eastern region of modern Algeria).\nAugustus (ruled 31 BC to 14 AD) controlled the Roman state following the civil war that would mark the end of the Roman Republic. He established a quasi-constitutional regime known as the \"Principate\", later to be called the Roman Empire.\nAugustus circa 27 BC restored Juba II to the throne as King of Mauretania (to the east of the province of Africa). Educated at Rome and obviously a client king, Juba also wrote books about the culture and history of Africa, and a best seller about Arabia, writings unfortunately lost. He married Cleopatra Selene, the daughter of Anthony and Cleopatra. After his reign, his kingdom and other lands of the Maghrib were annexed as the Roman Provinces of Mauritania Caesaria and Mauritania Tingitana (approximately the western coast of modern Algeria and northern Morocco).\nRenaissance of Carthage.\nRebuilding of the city of Carthage began under Augustus and, notwithstanding reported ill omens, Carthage flourished during the 1st and 2nd centuries. The capital of the Province of Africa, where a Roman \"praetor\" or \"proconsul\" resided, was soon moved from nearby Utica back to Carthage. Its rich agriculture made the province wealthy; olives and grapes were important products, but by its large exports of wheat it became famous. Marble, wood, and mules were also important exports. New towns were founded, especially in the Majarda valley near Carthage; many prior Punic and Berber settlements prospered.\nExpeditions ventured south into the Sahara. Cornelius Balbus, Roman governor at Utica, in 19 BC occupied Gerama, desert capital of the Garamantes in the Fezzan. These Berber Garamantes had long-time, unpredictable, off-and-on contacts with the Mediterranean. Extensive trade across the Sahara directly with the lands to the south had not yet developed.\nPeople from all over the Empire began to migrate into Africa Province, e.g., veterans in early retirement settled in Africa on farming plots promised for their military service. A sizable Latin speaking population that was multinational developed, which shared the region with those speaking the Punic and Berber languages. The local population began eventually to provide the Roman security forces. That the Romans \"did not display any racial exclusiveness and were remarkably tolerant of Berber religious cults\" facilitated local acceptance of their rule. Here the Romans evidently governed well enough that the province of Africa became integrated into the economy and culture of the Empire, with Carthage as one of its major cities.\nApuleius (c.125\u2013c.185) managed to thrive in the professional and literary communities of Latin-speaking Carthage. A full Berber (Numidian and Gaetulian) of Madaura whose father was a provincial magistrate, he studied at Carthage, and later at Athens (philosophy) and at Rome (oratory), where he evidently served as a legal advocate. He also traveled to Asia Minor and Egypt. Returning to Carthage he married an older, wealthy widow; he then was prosecuted for using magic to gain her affections. His speech in defense makes up his \"Apology\"; apparently he was acquitted. His celebrated work \"Metamorphosus, or the Golden Ass\" is an urbane, extravagant, inventive novel of the ancient world. At Carthage he wrote philosophy, rhetoric, and poetry; several statues were erected in his honor. St. Augustine discusses Apuleius in his \"The City of God\". Apuleius used a Latin style that registered as \"New Speech\" recognized by his literary contemporaries. It expressed the everyday language used by the educated, along with embedded archaisms, which transformed the more formal, classical grammar favored by Cicero (106\u201343), and pointed toward the development of modern Romance idioms. Apuleius was drawn to the mystery religions, particularly the cult of Isis.\nMany native Berbers adopted to the Mediterranean-wide influences operating in the province, eventually intermarrying, or entering into the local aristocracy. Yet the majority did not. There remained a social hierarchy of the Romanized, the partly assimilated, and the unassimilated, many of whom were Berbers. These imperial distinctions overlay the preexisting stratification of economic classes, e.g., there continued the practice of slavery, and there remained a co-opted remnant of the wealthy Punic aristocracy. The stepped-up pace and economic demands of a cosmopolitan urban life could have a very negative impact on the welfare of the rural poor. Large estates (\"latifundia\") at produced crops for export, often were managed for absentee owners and used slave labor; these occupied lands previously tilled by small local farmers. On another interface, tensions increased between pastoral nomads, who had their herds to graze, and sedentary farmers, with the best land being appropriated for planting, usually by the better-connected. These social divisions would manifest in various ways, e.g., the collateral revolt in 238, and the radical edge to the Donatist schism.\nEmperors from Africa.\nSeptimius Severus (145\u2013211, r. 193\u2013211) was born of mixed Punic ancestry in Lepcis Magna, Tripolitania (now Libya), where he spent his youth. Although he was said to speak with a Northwest African accent, he and his family were long members of the Roman cosmopolitan elite. His eighteen-year reign was noted for frontier military campaigns. His wife Julia Domna of Emesa, Syria, was from a prominent family of priestly rulers there; as empress in Rome she cultivated a salon which may have included Ulpian of Tyre, the jurist of Roman Law. After Severus (whose reign was well regarded), his son Caracalla (r. 211\u2013217) became emperor; Caracalla's edict of 212 granted citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire. Later, two grand nephews of Severus through his wife Julia Domna became emperors: Elagabalus (r. 218\u2013222) who brought the black stone of Emesa to Rome; and Severus Alexander (r.222\u2013235) born in Caesarea sub Libano (Lebanon). Though unrelated, the emperor Macrinus (r. 217\u2013218) came from Iol Caesarea in Mauretania (modern Sharshal, Algeria).\nThere were also Roman emperors from the Province of Africa. In 238 local proprietors rose in revolt, arming their clients and agricultural tenants who entered Thysdrus (modern El Djem) where they killed their target, a rapacious official and his bodyguards. In open revolt, they then proclaimed as co-emperors the aged Governor of the province of Africa, Gordian I (c.159\u2013238), and his son, Gordian II (192\u2013238). Gordian I had served at Rome in the Senate and as consul, and had been the governor of various provinces. The very unpopular current Emperor Maximinus Thrax (who had succeeded the dynasty of Severus) was campaigning on the middle Danube. In Rome the Senate sided with the insurgents of Thysdrus. When the African revolt collapsed under an assault by local forces still loyal to the emperor, the Senate elected two of their number, Balbinus and Pupienus, as co-emperors. Then Maximus Thrax was killed by his disaffected soldiers. Eventually the grandson of Gordian I, Gordian III (225\u2013244), of the province of Africa, became the emperor of the Romans, 238\u2013244. He died on the Persian frontier. His successor was Philip the Arab.\nChristianity, its Donatist schism.\nTwo significant theologians arose in the province of Africa. Tertullian (160\u2013230) was born, lived, and died at Carthage; a convert and a priest, his Latin books were at one time widely known, although he later came to espouse an unforgiving puritanism, after Montanus.\nSt. Augustine (354\u2013430), Bishop of Hippo (modern Annaba), was born at Tagaste in Numidia (modern Souk Ahras), his mother being St. Monica (who evidently was of Berber heritage). At Carthage, Augustine received his higher education. While professor of Rhetoric at Milano (then the Roman imperial capital) he followed Manichaean teachings. Following his conversion from Manichaeism to Christianity he returned to Africa, where he became a church leader and the author of many works. Augustine remains one of the most prominent and most admired of all Christian theologians. His moral philosophy remains influential, e.g., his contribution to the further evolved doctrine of the Just War, used to test whether or not a military action may be considered just and ethical. His books (e.g., \"The City of God\", and \"Confessions\") are still today widely read and discussed.\nThe Donatist schism was a major disruption; it followed a severe Roman persecution of Christians ordered by the Emperor Diocletian (r.284\u2013305). An earlier persecution had caused divisions over whether or how to accept back into the church contrite Christians who had apostatized under state threats, abuse, or torture. Donatists believed that to receive them back would be immoral.\nThen, in 313, the new Emperor Constantine by the Edict of Milan had granted tolerance to Christianity, himself becoming a Christian. This turnabout led to confusion in the Church, which in Northwest Africa accentuated the divide between wealthy urban members aligned with the Empire, and the local rural poor whose beliefs included social and political dissidence.\nChristian Berbers tended to be Donatists, although some more assimilated Berbers were Catholic. The Donatists became centered in southern Numidia, the Catholics in Carthage. One issue was whether a priest could perform his spiritual office if not personally worthy. The Donatist schismatics set up parallel churches in order to practice a ritual purity not required by the Catholic Church. Augustine came to condemn the Donatists throngs for rioting; at one point, there were imperial persecutions. Long negotiations lasted until finally the Catholics declared Donatism a heresy in 405, though general tolerance persisted until the ban became enforced late in the 6th century.\nFall of the Roman Empire in the West.\nVandal Kingdom.\nIn the fifth century the western Roman Empire was in a steep decline. Carthage and the Roman province of Africa were captured in 439 by the Vandals under Gaiseric (r. 428\u2013477), becoming the center of their Germanic kingdom. The western imperial capital at Ravenna recognized his rule in 442. In 455 the Vandals sailed with an army to the city of Rome, which was occupied without resistance and looted. Yet in governing their kingdom the Vandals did not fully maintain their martial culture, having made alliances with Berber forces upon entering the region.\nIn religious policy, the Vandals tried to convert the urban Catholic Christians of Africa to their Arian heresy (named after the Christian priest Arius, who taught that the Father is greater than the Son and the Spirit), e.g., by sending the clergy into exile and by expropriating churches; in the 520s their efforts turned to persecution, including martyrdom, all without success. The Berbers remained aloof. In all, Vandal rule would last 94 years.\nThe Vandals did provide functional security and governed with a light hand, so that the former Roman province prospered at first. Roman officials and Roman law continued, and Latin was used for government business. Agriculture provided more than enough to feed the region and trade flourished in the towns. Yet because of their desire to maintain a superiority in status, the Vandals refused to intermarry or agreeably assimilate to the advanced culture of the Romans. Consequently, finer points were overlooked; they failed to sustain a functional and effective social order. The Berber confederacies beyond the frontier grew increasingly powerful and troublesome.\nByzantine Empire.\nThe Eastern Romans or Byzantine Empire eventually recaptured Northwest Africa in 534, under their celebrated general Belisarius. The Byzantines rebuilt fortifications and border defenses (the \"limes\"), and entered into treaties with the Berbers. Nevertheless, for many decades security and prosperity were precarious and never fully returned. Direct Byzantine rule did not extend far beyond the coastal cities; the interior remained under the control of various Berber tribal confederacies. Further west (in modern Algeria) was the Romano-Moor Kingdom of Garmul.\nEarly in the seventh century, several Berber groups (the Jarid and Zanata of the Auruba) converted to Catholicism, although other Berbers remained attached to their gods. In the 540s the restored Catholic Church in Africa was disrupted by the Emperor Justinian's position in favor of the Monophysite doctrine.\nIn the early 600s AD, the Byzantine Empire entered a period of serious crises that would alter the future of Tunisia. For centuries Rome/Byzantium's greatest enemy had been the Sassanid Persians, and the two powers were chronically atwar with each other. The warfare was often intense but usually resulted in small border changes. By the 7th century however, the situation changed dramatically. Persistent religious discord within the Empire, followed by the overthrow of Emperor Maurice by the tyrant Phocas, severely weakened the Byzantines. The Persians invaded the Byzantine Empire, in alliance with the Eurasian Avars and Slavs from the north. Much of the Empire was overrun and it seemed the end was near.\nIt was a son of Carthage, so-to-speak, who managed to play a crucial role in restoring the imperial destiny. The son of the Exarch of Carthage, Flavius Heraclius Augustus, sailed east with an African fleet to the Byzantine capital city of Constantinople and overthrew the usurper Phocas; Heraclius became the Byzantine Emperor in 610. He began reorganizing the government and erecting defenses to counter the threats to the capital. Yet the Persians continued their invasion, meeting little resistance, taking Antioch in 611, Jerusalem in 614, and Alexandria in 619, in astonishing victories. His forces soon stood before Constantinople. In response, Heraclius took a great risk and moved an army by ship over the Black Sea, landing near his Armenian allies, and in the fighting managed to out-flank the Persians. By 627 Heraclius was marching on their capital Ctesiphon, a complete reversal of fortune. Then in 628 Chosroes II was killed in a revolt by his generals.\nAs a result of these dramatic and tumultuous events, Sassanid Persia was in disarray and confusion, and Byzantines soon retook their provinces of Egypt and Syria, but the religious discord between the local Monophysite and Eastern Orthodox Christians returned. Eastern Orthodox Emperor Heraclius (575\u2013641), the former Exarch of Africa (Carthage), attempted to work out a theological compromise, Monothelitism, but without any success.\nYet events did not rest. To the south, Arab Islamic armies began to stir, unified and energized by the teachings of the Prophet, Muhammad (570\u2013632). In 636 at the Battle of Yarmuk to the east of the Sea of Galilee, the Arabs decisively defeated the Byzantine forces.\nFollowing the Arab invasion of Egypt in 640, Christian refugees came west into the Exarchate of Africa (Carthage). There serious disputes arose within the Catholic churches pp.\u00a0Carthage over Monophysite doctrines and Monothelitism, with St. Maximus the Confessor leading the orthodox Catholics.\nUmayyad Caliphate in Ifriqiya.\nBy 661 the Umayyads had taken firm control of the new Muslim state, which it ruled from Damascus. The Caliph Mu'awiya could see the foreign lands west of Egypt in terms of the Muslim contest with the Byzantine Empire.\nIslamic conquest.\nIn 670 an Arab Muslim army under Uqba ibn Nafi, who had commanded an earlier incursion in 666, entered the region of Ifriqiya (Arabic for the province of Africa). Arriving by land the Arabs passed by Byzantine fortified positions along the Mediterranean coast. In the more arid south, the city of Kairouan [\"stronghold\" in Arabic] was established as their base, and the building of its famous Mosque begun. From 675 to 682 Dinar ibn Abu al-Muhadjir took command of the Arab Muslim army. In the late 670s, this army defeated the Berber forces (apparently composed of sedentary Christians mainly from the Awreba tribe and perhaps the Sanhadja confederation) led by Kusaila, who was taken prisoner.\nIn 682, Uqba ibn Nafi reassumed command. He defeated an alliance of Berber forces near Tahirt (Algeria), then proceeded westward in military triumph, eventually reaching the Atlantic coast, where he lamented at before him there was no more land to conquer for Islam. Episodes from his campaigns became legend throughout the Maghrib. Yet the Berber leader held prisoner, Kusaila, escaped. Later Kusaila led a fresh Berber uprising, which interrupted the conquest and claimed the Arab leader's life. Kusaila then formed an enlarged Berber kingdom. Yet Zuhair b. Qais, the deputy of the fallen Arab leader, enlisted Zanata tribes from Cyrenaica to fight for the cause of Islam, and in 686 managed to overturn Kusaila's newly formed kingdom.\nUnder the Caliph 'Abd al-Malik (685\u2013705), the Umayyad conquest of North Africa was to advance close to completion. In Egypt a new army of forty thousand was assembled, to be commanded by Hassan ibn al-Nu'man (known to Arabs as \"the honest old man\"). Meanwhile, the Byzantines had been reinforced. The Arab Muslim army crossed the Cyrene and Tripoli without opposition, then quickly attacked and captured Carthage.\nThe Berbers, however, continued to offer stiff resistance, then being led by a woman of the Jarawa tribe, whom the Arabs called \"the prophetess\" [\"al-Kahina\" in Arabic]; her actual name was approximately \"Damiya\". On the river Nini, an alliance of Berbers under \"Damiya\" defeated the Muslim armies under al-Nu'man, who escaped returning to Cyrenaica. Thereupon, the Byzantines took advantage of the Berber victory by reoccupying Carthage. Unlike the Berber Kusaila ten years earlier, \"Damiya\" did not establish a larger state, evidently being content to rule merely her own tribe. Some commentators speculate as to \"Damiya\" the Arabs appeared interested in booty primarily, because she then commenced to ravage and disrupt the region, making it unattractive to raiders looking for spoils of war; of course, it also made her unpopular to the residents. Yet she did not attack the Muslim base at Kairouan. From Egypt the Caliph 'Abdul-Malik had reinforced al-Nu'man in 698, who then reentered Ifriqiya. Although she told her two sons to go over to the Arabs, she herself again gave battle. She lost;al-Nu'man won. It is said at \"Bir al-Kahina\" [well of the prophetess] in the Auras, \"Damiya\" was killed.\nIn 705 Hassan b.al-Nu'man stormed Carthage, overcame and sacked it, leaving it destroyed. A similar fate befell the city of Utica. Near the ruins of Carthage he founded Tunis as a naval base. Muslim ships began to dominate the Mediterranean coast; hence the Byzantines made their final withdrawal from al-Maghrib. Then al-Nu'man was replaced as Muslim military leader by Musa ibn Nusair, who substantially completed the conquest of al-Maghrib. He soon took the city of Tangier and appointed as its governor the Berber Tariq ibn Ziyad.\nBerber role.\nThe Berber people, also known as the \"Amazigh\", \"converted en masse as tribes and assimilated juridically to the Arabs,\" writes Prof. Hodgson; he then comments that the Berbers were to play a r\u00f4le in the west parallel to at played by the Arabs elsewhere in Islam. For centuries the Berbers lived as semi-pastoralists in or near arid lands at the fringes of civilization, sustaining their isolated identity somewhat. like the Arabs. \"The Maghrib, islanded between Mediterranean and Sahara, was to the Berbers what Arabia... was to the Arabs.\" Hodgson explains: although the Berbers enjoyed more rainfall than the Arabs, their higher mountains made their settlements likewise difficult to access; and though the Imperial cities were more proximous, those cities never incorporated the countryside with a network of market towns, but instead remained aloof from the indigenous rural Berbers.\nA counter argument would be that the Berbers merely imitated the success of the Arab Muslims; the better historical choice would be more uniquely ethnic and authentic, i.e., to articulate their own inner character and fate. Prof. Abdallah Laroui interprets the Northwest African panorama as indicating that the Berbers did in fact carve out for themselves an independent r\u00f4le. \"From the first century B.C. to the eighth century A.D. the will of the Berbers to be themselves is revealed by the continuity of their efforts to reconstitute the kingdoms of the Carthaginian period, and in this sense the movement was crowned with success.\" By choosing to ally \"not\" with nearby Europe, familiar in memory by the Roman past, but rather with the newcomers from distant Arabia, the Berbers knowingly decided their future and historical path. \"Their hearts opened to the call of Islam because in it they saw a means of national liberation and territorial independence.\"\nEnvironmental and geographic parallels between Berber and Arab are notable, as Hodgeson adumbrates. In addition, the languages spoken by the semitic Arabs and by the Berbers are both members of the same world language family, the Afro-Asiatic, although from two of its different branches. Perhaps this linguistic kinship shares a further resonance, e.g., in mythic explanations, popular symbols, and religious preference.\nEvidently, long before and after the Islamic conquest, there was some popular sense of a strong and long-standing cultural connection between the Berbers and the Semites of the Levant, naturally with regard to Carthage and in addition with regard to links yet more ancient and genetic. These claims of a remote ancestral relationship perhaps facilitated the Berber demand for equal footing with the Arab invaders within the religion of Islam following the conquest.\nFrom Cyrenaica to al-Andalus, the somewhat Arabized Berbers continuously remained in communication with each other throughout the following centuries. As a group their distinguishing features are easy to discern within Islam; e.g., while the ulama in the rest of Islam adopted for the most part either the Hanafi or the Shafi'i school of law, the Berbers in the west chose the Maliki madhhab, developing it in the course of time after their own fashion.\nAlso inducing the Berbers to convert was the early lack of rigor in religious obligations, as well as the prospect of inclusion as warriors in the armies of conquest, with a corresponding share in booty and tribute. A few years later, in 711, the Berber Tariq ibn Ziyad would lead the Muslim invasion of the Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania. Additionally, many of the Arabs who came to settle in al-Maghrib were religious and political dissidents, often Kharijites who opposed the Umayyad rulers in Damascus and embraced egalitarian doctrines, both popular positions among the Berbers of Northwest Africa. Also, to locate its historical and religious context, the Arab conquest and Berber conversion to Islam followed a long period of polarization of society in the old province of Africa, in which the Donatist schism within Christianity proved instrumental, with the rural Berbers prominent in their dissent from the urban orthodoxy of the Roman church. The Berbers were initially attracted to the Arabs because of their \"proclivity for the desert and the steppes\".\nAfter the conquest and following the popular conversion, Ifriqiya constituted a natural and proximous center for an Arab-Islamic regime in Northwest Africa, the focus of culture and society. It was then the region with the most developed urban, commercial and agricultural infrastructure, essential for such a comprehensive project as Islam.\nAghlabid Dynasty under the Abbasids.\nDuring the years immediately preceding the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus (661\u2013750), revolts arose among the Kharijite Berbers in Morocco which eventually disrupted the stability of the entire Maghrib. Although the Kharijites failed to establish lasting institutions, the results of their revolt persisted. Direct rule by the Caliphs over Ifriqiya became untenable, even following the rapid establishment of the new Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad in 750. Also, after several generations a local Arabic-speaking aristocracy emerged, which became resentful of the distant caliphate's interference in local matters.\nPolitical culture.\nThe Muhallabids (771\u2013793) negotiated with the 'Abbasids a wide discretion in the exercise of their governorship of Ifriqiya. One such governor was al-Aghlab ibn Salim (r. 765\u2013767), a forefather of the Aghlabids. Eventually Muhallabid rule weakened: a minor rebellion in Tunis took on a more ominous turn when it spread to Kairouan. The Caliph's governor was unable to restore order.\nIbrahim I ibn al-Aghlab, a provincial leader (and son of al-Aghlab ibn Salim), was in command of a disciplined army; he managed to reestablish stability in 797. Later he proposed to the 'Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, that he be granted Ifriqiya (as the Arabs called the former province of Africa) as a hereditary fief, with the title of \"amir\"; the caliph acquiesced in 800. Thereafter, the 'Abbasids received an annual tribute and their suzerainty was named in the \"khutba\" at Friday prayers, but their control was largely symbolic, e.g., in 864 the Caliph al-Mu'tasim \"required\" at a new wing be added to the Zaytuna Mosque in Tunis.\nFrom 800 to 909, Ibrahim ibn-al-Aghlab (800\u2013812) and his descendants, known as the Aghlabids, ruled in Ifriqiya, as well as in Algeria (to the west) and in Tripolitania (to the east), yet in theory their rule was on behalf of the 'Abbasid Caliphate. The Aghlabids were predominantly of an Arab tribe the Bani Tamim. Their military forces were drawn from: (a) Arab immigrant warriors (those recently sent against the Kharajite revolts, and descendants of earlier Arab invasions), (b) Islamized and bilingual natives (\"Afariq\"), and (c) black slave soldiers. It was on their black soldiery that the rulers often relied.\nDespite the political peace and stability, followed by an economic expansion and prosperity, and despite a developing culture and grand construction projects, many in the Arabic-speaking elite developed an increasingly critical attitude toward the Aghlabid regime.\nFirst, the Arab military officer class was dissatisfied with the legitimacy of the regime and often fell to internal quarreling which could spill over into violent struggles. Their latent hostility surfaced when they began making extortionist demands on the population, as well as by their general insubordination. A dangerous revolt from within the Arab army (the \"jund\") broke out near Tunis and lasted from 824 until 826. The Aghlabids retreated to the south and were saved only by enlisting the aid of Berbers of the Kharajite Jarid. (Another revolt of 893, provoked by the cruelty of the ninth Aghlabid amir, Ibrahim II Ibn Ahmad (r. 875\u2013902), was put down by the black soldiery.)\nSecond, the Muslim ulema looked with reproach on the ruling Aghlabids. Aggravation in religious circles arose primarily from the un-Islamic lifestyle of the rulers. Disregarding the strong religious sentiments held by the many in the community, often the Aghlabids led lives of pleasure and, e.g., were seen drinking wine (against Islamic law). Another issue was Aghlabid taxation not sanctioned by the Maliki school of Islamic law. Other opponents criticized their contemptuous treatment of mawali Berbers who had embraced Islam. The Islamic doctrine of equality regardless of race was a cornerstone of the Sunni movement in the Maghrib, and also of the Maliki school of law as developed in Kairouan; these principles formed the core of the hostility of Ifriqiya toward rule from the east by the Caliph.\nAs recompense, the Aghlabid rulers saw at mosques were constructed or augmented, e.g., at Tunis (the Olive Tree [\"Zaituna\"] Mosque, as well as its famous university, Ez-Zitouna); at. Kairouan (Mosque of the Three Doors), and at Sfax. Also a well known ribat or fortified monastery was built at Monastir, and at Susa (in 821 by Ziyadat Allah I); here Islamic warriors trained.\nIn 831 the son of Ibrahim, Ziyadat Allah I (r. 817\u2013838), launched an invasion of Sicily. Placed in command was Asad ibn-al-Furat, the qadi or religious judge; the military adventure was termed a \"jihad\". This expedition proved successful; Palermo was made the capitol of the region captured. Later raids were made against the Italian peninsula; in 846 Rome was attacked and the Basilica of St. Peter sacked. In orchestrating the invasion of Sicily, the Aghlabid rulers had managed to unite two rebellious factions (the army and the clergy) in a common effort against outsiders. Later Islamic rulers in Sicily severed connections with Ifriqiyah, and their own Sicilian Kalbid dynasty (948\u20131053) governed the Emirate. The invasion of Sicily had worked to stabilize the political order in Ifriqiya, which progressed in relative tranquility during its middle period. In its final decline, however, the dynasty self-destructed, when its eleventh and last amir, Ziyadat Allah III (r. 902\u2013909) (d. 916), due to insecurity stemming from his father's assassination, ordered his rival brothers and uncles executed. This occurred during the assaults made by the Fatimids against the Aghlabid domains.\nInstitutions and Society.\nIn the Aghlabid government generally, the high positions were filled by \"princes of the blood, whose loyalty could be relied on.\" The judicial post of Qadi of Kairouan was said to be given \"only to outstanding personalities notable for their conscientiousness even more than their knowledge.\" On the other hand, the administrative staffs were composed of dependent clients (mostly recent Arab and Persian immigrants), and the local bilingual \"Afariq\" (mostly Berber, and which included many Christians). The Islamic state in Ifriqiya paralleled in many respects the government structure formed in Abbasid Baghdad, There was the \"vizier\" [prime minister], the \"hajib\" [chamberlain], the \"sahib al-barid\" [master of posts and intelligence], and numerous \"kuttab\" [secretaries] (e.g., of taxation, of the mint, of the army, of correspondence). Leading Jews formed a small elite group. As in an earlier periods (e.g., under Byzantine rule), the majority of the population consisted of rural Berbers, distrusted now because of Kharajite or similar tendencies.\nKairouan (or Qayrawan) had become the cultural center of not only of Ifriqiya but of the entire Maghrib. A type of volume then current, the \"tabaqat\" (concerning the handling of documents), indirectly illuminates elite life in Aghlabid Ifriqiya. One such work was the \"Tabaqat 'ulama' Ifriqiya\" [\"Classes of Scholars of Ifriqiya\"] written by Abu al-'Arab. Among the Sunni Muslim ulema, two learned professions then came to the fore: (a) the \"faqih\" (plural \"fuqaha\") or the jurist; and (b) the \"'\u0101bid\" or the ascetics.\nThe \"fuqaha\" congregated at Kairouan, then the legal center of al-Maghrib. The more liberal Hanafi school of law at first predominated in Ifriqiyah, but soon a strict form of the Maliki school came to prevail, becoming in fact the only widespread madhhab, not only in Tunisia but throughout Northwest Africa, a situation which continues (despite several interruptions) to be the norm today. The Maliki school was introduced to Ifriqiya by the jurist Asad ibn al-Furat, (759\u2013829), who nonetheless wavered between these two schools of law. The \"Mudawanna\", written by his disciple Sahnun ('Abd al-Salam b. Sa'id) (776\u2013854), provided a \"vulgate of North-African Malikism\" during the period in which this madhhab won the field against its rival, the Hanafi. Abu Hanifa (700\u2013767) drew out fiqh at was perhaps better suited to its origin in Baghdad, the sophisticated imperial capital; Malik ibn Anas (716\u2013795) initiated the school bearing his name in Medina. By choosing the Maliki school, Ifriqiya obtained more discretion in defining its legal culture. The Maliki jurists were often at odds with the Aghlabids, e.g., over their personal immorality, and over issues of taxation regarding agriculture (i.e., of a fixed cash levy instead of a tithe in kind). Also the Maliki fuqaha was understood to act in the interests of the Berbers for a local autonomy, by filtering out potential intrusions into Ifriqiya by Arab power and influence from the east.\nForemost of the \"'\u0101bid\" scholars or ascetics was Buhlul b. Rashid (d. 799), who reputedly despised money and refused the post of grand judge; his fame spread throughout the Islamic world. By virtue of their piety and independence, the \"abid\" won social prestige and a voice in politics, speaking especially for the cities, criticizing the regime's finance and trade decisions. Although substantially different, the status of the '\u0101bid relates somewhat to the much later figure of the Maghribi saint, the \"wali\", who as keeper of \"baraka\" (spiritual charisma) became the object of veneration by religious believers, and whose tomb would be the destination of pilgrimage.\nIfriqiya flourished under Aghlabid rule. Extensive improvements were made to the pre-existing water works in order to promote olive groves and other agriculture (oils and cereals were exported), to irrigate the royal gardens, and for livestock. Roman aqueducts to supply the towns with water were rebuilt under Abu Ibrahim Ahmad, the sixth amir. In the Kairouan region hundreds of basins were constructed to store water for the raising of horses.\nCommercial trade resumed under the new Islamic regime, e.g., by sea, particularly to the east with the Egyptian port of Alexandria. Also, improved trade routes linked Ifriqiya with the continental interior, the Sahara and the Sudan, regions regularly incorporated into the Mediterranean commerce for the first time during this period. Evidently camels on a large scale had not been common to the region until the fourth century, and it was not until several centuries later at their use in the Saharan trade became generally recognized. The trade began in earnest. The desert city of Sijilmasa near the Atlas mountains in the far west [maghrib al-aqsa] served as one of the primary trading junctions and entrep\u00f4ts, e.g., for salt and gold. Yet Wargla was the primary desert link to Gafsa and Kairouan. Also Ghadames, Ghat, and Tuat served the Saharan trade to Ifriqiya.\nA prosperous economy permitted a refined and luxurious court life and the construction of the new palace cities of al-'Abbasiya (809), and Raqada (877) for the residences of the ruling amir. The architecture was later imitated in Fez, Tlemcen, and Bougie. The location of these Aghlabid government centers was outside of Kairouan, a city dominated by Muslim clerical institutions.\nIfriqiyah during the era under the Aghlabid Dynasty (799\u2013909) for the most part continued its leading r\u00f4le in the Maghrib, due generally to its peace and stability, recognized cultural achievements, and material prosperity.\nFatimids: Shi'a Caliphate, and the Zirids.\nAs the Fatimids grew in strength and numbers nearby to the west, they began to launch frequent attacks on the Aghlabid regime in Ifriqiya, which of course contributed to its political instability and general unrest. The Fatimids eventually managed to capture Kairouan in 909, forcing the last of the Aghlabid line, Ziyadat Allah III, to evacuate the palace at Raqadda. On the east coast of Ifriqiaya facing Egypt, the Fatimids built a new capital on top of ancient ruins, calling the seaport Mahdiya after their \"mahdi\".\nMaghribi Origin of the Fatimids.\nThe Fatimid movement had originated locally in al-Maghrib, among the Kotama Berbers in Kabylia (Setif, south of Bougie, eastern Algeria). However, both founders of the movement were recent immigrants from the Islamic east, religious dissidents: Abu 'Abdulla ash-Shi'i, originally from San'a in al-Yemen; and, coming from Salamiyah in Syria, 'Ubaidalla Sa'id (who claimed descent from Fatima the daughter of the prophet Muhammad, and who was to proclaim himself the Fatimid Mahdi). Their religious affiliation was the Ismaili branch of the Shia.\nBy agreement, the first founder to arrive (circa 893) was Abu 'Abdulla, the Ismaili \"Da'i\" or propagandist, who found welcome in the hostility against the Caliphate in Baghdad freely expressed by the Kotama Berbers. After his success in recruitment and in building the organization, Abu 'Abdulla was ready in 902 to send for 'Ubaidalla Sa'ed, who (after adventures and imprisonment) arrived in 910, proclaimed himself Mahdi, and took control of the movement. Abu 'Abdulla was killed in a dispute over leadership.\nFrom the start the Mahdi was focused on expansion eastward, and he soon attacked Egypt with a Fatimid army of Kotama Berbers led by his son, once in 914, and again in 919, both times quickly taking Alexandria but then losing to the Abbasids. Probing for weakness, the Mahdi then sent an invasion \"westward\", but his forces met with mixed results. Many Sunnis, including the Umayyad Caliph of al-Andalus and the Zenata Berber kingdom in Morocco, effectively opposed him because of his Ismaili Shi'a affiliation. The Mahdi did not follow Maliki law, but taxed harshly, incurring further resentment. His capital Mahdiya was more a fort than a princely city. The Maghrib was disrupted, being contested between the Zenata and the Sanhaja favoring the Fatimids.\nAfter the death of the Mahdi, there came the Kharijite revolt of 935, which under Abu Yazid (nicknamed \"the man on a donkey\") was said by 943 to be spreading chaos far and wide. The Mahdi's son, the Fatimid caliph al-Qa'im, became besieged in Mahdiya. Eventually Abu Yazid was defeated by the next Fatimid caliph, Ishmail, who then moved his residence to Kairouan. Fatimid rule continued to be under attack from Sunni Islamic states to the west, e.g., the Umayyad Caliphate in Al Andalus.\nIn 969 the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz sent his best general Jawhar al-Rumi leading a Kotama Berber army against Egypt. He managed the conquest without great difficulty. The Shi'a Fatimids founded al-Qahira (Cairo) [\"the victorious\" or the \"city of Mars\"]. In 970 the Fatimids also founded the world-famous al-Azhar mosque, which later became the leading Sunni theological center. Three years later al-Mu'izz the caliph left Ifriqiyah for Egypt, taking everything, \"his treasures, his administrative staff, and the coffins of his predecessors.\" Once centered in Egypt the Fatimids expanded their possessions further, northeast to Syria and southeast to Mecca, while retaining control of Northwest Africa. From Cairo they were to enjoy relative success; they never returned to Ifriqiyah.\nZirid succession.\nAfter removing their capital to Cairo, the Fatimids withdrew from direct governance of al-Maghrib, which they delegated to a local vassal, namely Buluggin ibn Ziri a Sanhaja Berber of the central Maghrib. As a result of civil war following his death, the Fatimid vassalage split in two: for Ifriqiya the Zirid (972\u20131148); and for the western lands [present day Algeria]: the Hammadid (1015\u20131152). Civic security was chronically poor, due to political quarrels between the Zirids and the Hammadids, and attacks from Sunni states to the west.\nAlthough the Maghrib remained submerged in political confusion, at first the Fatimid province of Ifriqiya continued relatively prosperous under the Zirids. Soon however the Saharan trade began to decline, caused by changing consumer demand, as well as by encroachments by rival traders from the Fatimids to the east and from the rising power of the al-Murabit movement to the west. This decline in the Saharan trade caused a rapid deterioration to the city of Kairouan, the political and cultural center of the Zirid state. To compensate, the Zirids encouraged the commerce of their coastal cities, which did begin to quicken; however, they faced tough challenges from Mediterranean traders of the rising city-states of Genoa and Pisa.\nIn 1048, for economic and popular reasons, the Zirids dramatically broke with the Shi'a Fatimid suzerainty from Cairo; instead the Zirids chose to become Sunni (always favored by most Maghribi Muslims) and declaring their allegiance to the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. Many shia were killed in disturbances throughout Ifriqiya. The Zirid state seized Fatimid coinage. Sunni Maliki jurists were reestablished as the prevailing school of law. In retaliation, the Fatimids sent against the Zirids an invasion of nomadic Arabians who had already migrated into Egypt; these bedouins were induced by the Fatimids to continue westward into Ifriqiya.\nThe arriving Bedouins of the Banu Hilal defeated in battle Zirid and Hammadid armies and sacked Kairouan in 1057. It has been said at much of the Maghrib's misfortunes to follow could be traced to the chaos and regression occasioned by their arrival, although opinion is not unanimous. In Arab lore Abu Zayd al-Hilali the leader of the Banu Hilal is a hero, as in the folk epic Taghribat Bani Hilal. The Banu Hilal originated from the tribal confederacy of the Banu 'Amir, located generally in southwest Arabia. As the Banu Halali tribes took control of the plains, the local sedentary people were forced to take refuge in the mountains; in prosperous central and northern Ifriqiya farming gave way to pastoralism. Even after the fall of the Zirids the Banu Hilal were a source of disorder, as in the 1184 insurrection of the Banu Ghaniya. These rough Arab newcomers did constitute a second large Arab immigration into Ifriqiya, and accelerated the process of Arabization, with the Berber languages decreasing in use in rural areas as a result of this Bedouin ascendancy.\nSubstantially weakened, the Zirids lingered on, while the regional economy declined, with civil society adrift.\nPerspectives and trends.\nThe Fatimids were Shi'a (specifically, of the more controversial Isma'ilis branch), whose leadership came from the then unpopular east. Today, of course, the majority of Tunisians now identify as members of the opposing Sunni. The Fatimids did initially inspire the allegiance of Berber elements. Yet once installed Fatimid rule greatly disrupted social harmony in Ifriqiya; they imposed high, unorthodox taxes, leading to the Kharijite revolt. Later, the Fatimids relocated to Cairo. Although originally a client of the Fatimid Shi'a Caliphate in Egypt, eventually the Zirids expelled the Fatimids from Ifriqiya. In return, the Fatimids managed to send the destructive Banu Hilal to Ifriqiya, which led to chaotic, ragged social conditions, during a period of economic decline. The Zirid dynasty has been viewed historically as a Berber kingdom, essentially founded by a Sanhaja Berber leader. Also, from the far west of al-Maghrib, the Sunni Umayyad Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba long opposed and battled against the Shi'a Fatimids, whether based in Ifriqiya or in Egypt. Accordingly, Tunisians may evidence faint pride in the great extent and relative endurance, the peace and prosperity at Fatimid rule brought to Egypt, and in the Fatimid Caliphate in Islamic history.\nDuring the interval of Shi'a rule, the Berber people appear to have moved ideologically, from a popular antagonism to the Sunni east, toward an acquiescence to its orthodoxy, though of course mediated by their own Maliki law (viewed as one of the four orthodox madhhab by the Sunni). In addition to the above grievances against the Fatimids, during the Fatimid era the prestige of exercising cultural leadership within al-Maghrib shifted decisively away from Ifriqiya and instead came to be the prize of al-Andalus.\nNorman Africa.\nAnarchy in Ifriqiya (Modern day Tunisia) made it a target for the Norman kingdom in Sicily, which between 1134 and 1148 seized Mahdia, Gabes, Sfax, and the island of Jerba.\nThe Kingdom of Africa was an extension of the frontier zone of the Siculo-Norman state in the former Roman province of Africa (\"Ifr\u012bqiya\" in Tunisian Arabic), corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today. The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim); the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. According to Hubert Houben, since \"Africa\" was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily, \"one ought not to speak of a 'Norman kingdom of Africa'.\" Rather, \"[Norman Africa] really amounted to a constellation of Norman-held towns along coastal Ifr\u012bqiya.\"\nThe Sicilian conquest of Africa began under Roger II in 1146\u201348. Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns, exactions on the local Muslim population, protection of Christians and the minting of coin. The local aristocracy was largely left in place, and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight. Economic connections between Sicily and Africa, which were strong before the conquest, were strengthened, while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded. Early in the reign of William I, the \"kingdom\" of Africa fell to the Almohads (1158\u201360). Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo-Almohad peace finalised in 1180.\nConquest of Tripoli and Mahdia.\nIn 1142/3, Roger II attacked Tripoli, further south down the coast from Mahdia. In 1146 he besieged it and took it. The city had already been depleted by a series of famines and was practically in a state of civil war when Roger's troops assaulted it. It was still an important port on the sea route from the Maghreb to Egypt. Several of the minor emirs in the vicinity of Tripoli sought Sicilian overlordship after this. Y\u016bsuf, the ruler of Gab\u00e8s, wrote to Roger requesting \"the robes and letter of appointment making me \"w\u0101li\" of Gab\u00e8s, and I shall be your deputy there, as are the Ban\u016b Matr\u016bh who hold Tripoli from you.\" Roger complied and Y\u016bsuf, in his new robes, read out the letter of appointment to an assemblage of notables. Gab\u00e8s had long been an irritant to Mahdia, and al-Hasan of Mahdia attacked it and brought back Y\u016bsuf to Mahdia, and stoned him to death. It is possible that Roger's attack on Mahdia in 1148 was a response to this insubordination on the part of its emir, but Ibn al-Ath\u012br suggested that Roger was merely taking advantage of a famine in Africa, despite the fact that he had a treaty with al-Hasan until 1150.\nIn June 1148 Roger sent his admiral George of Antioch, a former Mahdian officer, against al-Hasan. Off the island of Pantelleria the Sicilian fleet encountered a Mahdia ship bearing some carrier pigeons. George had the birds sent home with false messages that the fleet was headed for Byzantium. When the Sicilians reached Mahdia on 22 June, the emir and his court fled the unprepared city leaving their treasure behind. This was seized as booty, but the Sicilians were given only two hours to plunder the city while its Muslim inhabitants took refuge in Christian homes and churches. Roger quickly issued a royal protection, or \"am\u0101n\", to all the city's inhabitants. According to Ibn ab\u012b-D\u012bn\u0101r, George \"restored both cities of Zaw\u012bla and Mahdiyya; lent money to the merchants; gave alms to the poor; placed the administration of justice in the hands of \"qadi\" acceptable to the population; and arranged well the government of these two cities.\" Food was released to encourage refugees to return.\nOn 1 July the city of Sousse (Susa), ruled by al-Hasan's son 'Ali, surrendered without a fight, and 'Ali fled to his father in Almohad Morocco. On 12 July Sfax fell after a short resistance. The Africans \"were treated humanely\" and an \"am\u0101n\" full of \"fine promises\" was granted for the entire province, according to Ibn al-Ath\u012br. Ibn Khaldun, in his \"Kitab al-Ibar\", records the abuse the Christians of Sfax heaped on their Muslim neighbours. The Ban\u016b Matr\u016bh were left in power in Tripoli, and in Sfax Roger appointed Umar ibn al-Husayn al-Furr\u012b\u0101n\u012b, whose father was brought to Sicily as a hostage for his son's good behaviour. The Arabic sources are unanimous in presenting Umar's father as encouraging his son to rebel nonetheless. The town of Barasht (Bresk) and the isles of Kerkennah fell to Roger, as did the unruly desert tribes. After the brief period of conquest and acquisition, \"the dominion of the Franks [Normans] extended from Tripoli to the borders of Tunis, and from the western Maghrib to Qayrawan\".\nSubmission of Tunis and internal unrest.\nRoger became involved in a war with Byzantium after 1148, and so was unable to follow up his conquests with an attack on Tunis. In fear, the Tunisians sent grain to Sicily in hopes of averting an attack, according to Ibn Idhari. This should probably be seen as tribute and submission, since Ibn Idhar writes that Roger was still in power in the city when the Almohads attacked it in 1159, although he was in fact dead. The Venetian chronicler Andrea Dandolo is probably correct in asserting: \"and the kings of Tunis paid him [Roger] tribute\" (\"regemque Tunixii sibi tributarium fecit\"). Roger died in 1154, and was succeeded by his son William I, who continued to rule Africa. His accession was taken for an opportunity by the native officials, who clamoured for more powers to tax. The Arabic historians Ibn al-Ath\u012br and Ibn Khaldun, both hoped that Roger would defend his African lands against Almohad extremism and intolerance. After his death, some Muslim officials demanded that sermons be preached against the Almohads in the mosques.\nAlmohads (al-Muwahiddin).\nThe only strong Muslim power then in the Maghreb was at the newly emerging Almohads, led by their caliph a Berber Abd al-Mu'min. He responded in several military campaigns which by 1160 compelled the Normans to retreat back to Sicily. The Almohads were also successful in driving off incursions by the Ayyubids in the 1180s, although they managed to occupy southern coastal areas intermittently during this period.\nMovement and Empire.\nThe Almohad movement [Arabic \"al-Muwahhidun\", \"the Unitarians\"] ruled variously in the Maghrib starting about 1130 until 1248 (locally until 1275). This movement had been founded by Ibn Tumart (1077\u20131130), a Masmuda Berber from the Atlas mountains of Morocco, who became the mahdi. After a pilgrimage to Mecca followed by study, he had returned to the Maghrib about 1218 inspired by the teachings of al-Ash'ari and al-Ghazali. A charismatic leader, he preached an interior awareness of the Unity of God. A puritan and a hard-edged reformer, he gathered a strict following among the Berbers in the Atlas, founded a radical community, and eventually began an armed challenge to the current rulers, the Almoravids (1056\u20131147). These Almoravids [Arabic \"al-Murabitun\", from \"Ribat\", e.g., \"defenders\"] had also been a Berber Islamic movement of the Maghrib, which had run its course and since become decadent and weak. Although the Almoravids had once ruled from Mauritania (south of Morocco) to al-Andalus (southern Spain), Almoravid rule had never reached to Ifriqiya.\nFollowing Ibn Tumart's death, Abd al-Mu'min al-Kumi (c.1090\u20131163) became the Almohad caliph, circa 1130. Abd al-Mu'min had been one of the original \"Ten\" followers of Ibn Tumart. He immediately had attacked the ruling Almoravids and had wrestled Morocco away from them by 1147, suppressing subsequent revolts there. Then he crossed the straits, occupying al-Andalus (in Spain). In 1152 he successfully invaded the Hammadids of Bougie (in Algeria). His armies intervened in Zirid Ifriqiya, removing the Christian Sicilians by 1160. Yet Italian merchants from Genoa and Pisa had already arrived, continuing the foreign presence.\n\"Abd al-Mu'min briefly presided over a unified Northwest African empire\u2013\u2013the first and last in its history under indigenous rule\". It would be the high point of Maghribi political unity. Yet twenty years later, by 1184, the revolt by the Banu Ghaniya had spread from the Balearic Islands to Ifriqiya (Tunisia), causing problems for the Almohad regime for the next fifty years.\nRule of the Maghrib.\nIbn Tumart, the Almohad founder, left writings in which his theological ideas mix with the political. Therein he claimed that the leader, the mahdi, is infallible. Ibn Tumart created a hierarchy from among his followers which persisted long after the Almohad era (i.e., in Tunisia under the Hafsids), based not only on a specie of ethnic loyalty, such as the \"Council of Fifty\" [\"ahl al-Khamsin\"], and the assembly of \"Seventy\" [\"ahl al-Saqa\"], but more significantly based on a formal structure for an inner circle of governance at would transcend tribal loyalties, namely, (a) his \"ahl al-dar\" or \"people of the house\", a sort of privy council, (b) his \"ahl al-'Ashra\" or the \"Ten\", originally composed of his first ten followers, and (c) a variety of offices. Ibn Tumart trained his own \"talaba\" or ideologists, as well as his \"huffaz\", who function was both religious and military. There is lack of certainty about some details, but general agreement at Ibn Tumart sought to reduce the \"influence of the traditional tribal framework.\" Later historical developments \"were greatly facilitated by his original reorganization because it made possible collaboration among tribes\" not likely to otherwise coalesce. These organizing and group solidarity preparations made by Ibn Tumart were \"most methodical and efficient\" and a \"conscious replica\" of the Medina period of the prophet Muhammad.\nThe mahdi Ibn Tumart also had championed the idea of strict Islamic law and morals displacing unorthodox aspects of Berber custom. At his early base at Tinmal, Ibn Tumart functioned as \"the custodian of the faith, the arbiter of moral questions, and the chief judge.\" Yet because of the narrow legalism then common among Maliki jurists and because of their influence in the Almoravid regime, Ibn Tumart did not favor the Maliki school of law; nor did he favor any of the four recognized madhhabs. In practice, however, the Maliki school of law survived and by default eventually functioned in an official fashion (except during the reign of Abu Yusuf Ya'qubal-Mansur (1184\u20131199) who was loyal to Ibn Tumart's teachings). After of century of oscillation, the caliph Abu al-'Ala Idris al-Ma'mun broke with the narrow ideology of prior Almohad regimes (first articulated by the mahdi Ibn Tumart) at had continued to function on and off, and for the most part, at the end, poorly; circa 1230, he affirmed the reinstitution of the then-reviving Malikite rite, perennially popular in al-Maghrib.\nThe Muslim philosophers Ibn Tufayl (Abubacer to the Latins) of Granada (d.1185), and Ibn Rushd (Averro\u00ebs) of C\u00f3rdoba (1126\u20131198), who was also appointed a Maliki judge, were dignitaries known to the Almohad court, whose capital became fixed at Marrakesh. The sufi master theologian Ibn 'Arabi was born in Murcia in 1165. Under the Almohads architecture flourished, the Giralda being built in Seville and the pointed arch being introduced.\n\"There is no better indication of the importance of the Almohad empire than the fascination it has exerted on all subsequent rulers in the Maghrib.\" It was an empire Berber in its inspiration, and whose imperial fortunes were under the direction of Berber leaders. The unitarian Almohads had gradually modified the original ambition of strictly implementing their founder's designs; in this way the Almohads were similar to the preceding Almoravids (also Berber). Yet their movement probably worked to deepen the religious awareness of the Muslim people across the Maghrib. Nonetheless, it could not suppress other traditions and teachings, and alternative expressions of Islam, including the popular cult of saints, the sufis, as well as the Maliki jurists, survived.\nThe Almohad empire (like its predecessor the Almoravid) eventually weakened and dissolved. Except for the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, Spain was lost. In Morocco, the Almohads were to be followed by the Merinids; in Ifriqiya (Tunisia), by the Hafsids (who claimed to be the heirs of the unitarian Almohads).\nHafsid dynasty of Tunis.\nThe Hafsid dynasty (1230\u20131574) succeeded Almohad rule in Ifriqiya, with the Hafsids claiming to represent the true spiritual heritage of its founder, the Mahdi Ibn Tumart (c.1077\u20131130). Under the Hafsids, Tunisia would eventually regain for a time cultural primacy in the Maghrib.\nPolitical chronology.\nAbu Hafs 'Umar Inti (or:al-Hintati) was one of the \"Ten\", the crucial early adherents of the \"Almohad\" movement [\"al-Muwahhidun\"], circa 1121. These \"Ten\" were companions of Ibn Tumart the Mahdi, and formed an inner circle consulted on all important matters. Abu Hafs 'Umar Inti, wounded in battle near Marrakesh in 1130, was for a long time a powerful figure within the Almohad movement. His son 'Umar al-Hintati was appointed by the Almohad caliph Muhammad an-Nasir as governor of Ifriqiya in 1207 and served until his death in 1221. His son, the grandson of Abu Hafs, was Abu Zakariya.\nAbu Zakariya (1203\u20131249) served the Almohads in Ifriqiya as governor of Gab\u00e8s, then in 1226 as governor of Tunis. In 1229 during disturbances within the Almohad movement, Abu Zakariya declared his independence: hence, the start of the Hafsid dynasty. In the next few years he secured his hold on the cities of Ifriqiya, then captured Tripolitania (1234) to the east, and Algiers (1235) to the west and later added Tlemcen (1242). He solidified his rule among the Berber confederacies. Government structure of the Hafsid state followed the Almohad model, a rather strict centralization. Abu Zakariya's succession to the Almohads was briefly acknowledged in Friday prayer by several states in al-Andalus and in Morocco. Diplomatic relations were opened with Venice, Genoa, Sicily, and Aragon. Abu Zakariya became the foremost ruler in the Maghrib. \nFor an historic moment, the son of Abu Zakariya and self-declared caliph of the Hafsids, al-Mustansir (r.1249\u20131277), was recognised as caliph by Mecca and the Islamic world (1259\u20131261), following termination of the Abbasid caliphate by the Mongols (in 1258). Yet the moment passed; the Hafsids remained a local sovereignty.\nIn 1270 King Louis IX of France, whose brother was the king of Sicily, landed an army near Tunis; disease devastated their camp. Later, Hafsid influence was reduced by the rise of the Moroccan Marinids of Fez, who captured and lost Tunis twice (1347, and 1357). Yet Hafsid fortunes would recover; two notable rulers being Abu Faris (1394\u20131434) and his grandson Abu 'Amr 'Uthman (r. 1435\u20131488).\nToward the end, internal disarray within the Hafsid dynasty created vulnerabilities, while a great power struggle arose between Spaniard and Turk over control of the Mediterranean. The Hafsid dynasts became pawns, subject to the rival strategies of the combatants. By 1574 Ifriqiya had been incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.\nCommerce and Trade.\nThe entire Maghrib, as well as Tunisia under the early Hafsids, enjoyed an era of prosperity due to the rise of Saharan-Sudanese as well as the Mediterranean trade, the latter including trade with Europe. Across the region, repeated buy and sell dealings with Christians led to the development of practices and structured arrangements at were crafted to ensure security, customs revenue, and commercial profit. The principal customs ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gab\u00e9s (in modern Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Bejaia), and B\u00f4ne (Annaba) (in modern Algeria); and Tripoli (in modern Libya). Generally at such ports, the imports were off loaded and transferred to a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed warehouse, or \"funduq\", until the duties and fees were paid. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often a member of the ruling nobility or \"musharif\", called \"al-Caid\", who not only managed the staff collecting duties but also might negotiate commercial agreements, conclude treaties, and would act as judge in legal disputes involving foreigners. The amount of the duties varied, usually five or ten percent. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods and pick up the return cargo in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city\u2013of\u2013origin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.\nIslamic law during this era had developed a specific institution to regulate community morals, or \"hisba\", which included the order and security of public markets, the supervision of market transactions, and related matters. The urban marketplace [Arabic \"souk\", pl. \"iswak\"] was generally a street of shops selling the same or similar commodities (vegetables, cloth, metalware, lumber, etc.). The city official charged with these responsibilities was called the \"muhtasib\". In effecting public order in the urban markets, the \"muhtasib\" enforced fair commercial dealing (merchants truthfully quoting the local price to rural people, honest weights and measures, but not quality of goods nor price \"per se\"), keeping roadways open, regulating the safety of building construction, ensuring the metal value of existing coinage and minting new coin. The authority of the \"muhtasib\", with his group of assistants, was somewhere between a \"qadi\" (judge) and the police, or on other occasions perhaps between a public prosecutor or trade commissioner and the mayor or a high city official. Often a leading judge or \"mufti\" held the position. The \"muhtasib\" did not hear contested litigation, but nonetheless could order the pain and humiliation of up to 40 lashes, remand to debtor's prison, order a shop closed, and expel from the city. The authority of the \"muhtasib\" did not extend into the countryside.\nDuring this period from al-Andalus came Muslim and Jewish immigrants with appreciated talents, e.g., trade connections, crafts, and agricultural techniques. Regarding general prosperity, however, there was a sharp economic decline starting in the fourteenth century due to a variety of factors.\nSociety and culture.\nBedouin Arabs continued to arrive into the 13th century; with their tribal ability to raid and war still intact, they remained influential. The Arab language came to be predominant, except for a few Berber-speaking areas, e.g., Kharijite Djerba, and the desert south. Also, Arab Muslim and Jewish migration continued to come into Ifriqiya from al-Andalus, especially after the fall of Granada in 1492, the last Muslim state ruling on the Iberian peninsula. These newly arriving immigrants brought infusions of the developed arts of al-Andalus. The Andalusian tradition of music and poetry was discussed by Ahmad al-Tifashi (1184\u20131253) of Tunis, in his \"Muta'at al-Asma' fi 'ilm al-sama' \" [Pleasure to the Ears, on the Art of Music], in volume 41 of his enciclopedia.\nAfter a hiatus under the Almohads, the Maliki school of law resumed its full traditional jurisdiction over the Maghrib. During the 13th century, the Maliki school had undergone substantial liberalizing changes due in part to Iraqi influence. Under Hafsid jurisprudents the concept of \"maslahah\" or \"public interest\" developed in the operation of their madhhab. This opened up Maliki fiqh to considerations of necessity and circumstance with regard to the general welfare of the community. By this means, local \"custom\" was admitted in the Sharia of Malik, to become an integral part of the legal discipline. Later, the Maliki theologian Muhammad ibn 'Arafa (1316\u20131401) of Tunis studied at the Zaituna library, said to contain 60,000 volumes.\nEducation was improved by the institution of a system of madrasah. Sufism, e.g., Sidi Bin 'Arus (d. 1463 Tunis) founder of the \"Arusiyya\" tariqah, became increasingly established, linking city and countryside. Poetry blossomed, as did architecture. For the moment, Tunisia had regained cultural leadership of the Maghrib.\nIbn Khaldun.\nA major social philosopher, Ibn Khaldun (1332\u20131406) is recognized as a pioneer in sociology, historiography, and related disciplines. Although having Yemeni ancestry, his family enjoyed centuries-long residency in al-Andalus before leaving in the 13th century for Ifriqiyah. As a native of Tunis, he spent much of his life under the Hafsids, whose regime he served on occasion.\nIbn Khaldun entered into a political career early on, working under a succession of different rulers of small states, whose designs unfolded amid shifting rivalries and alliances. at one point he rose to vizier; however, he also spent a year in prison. His career required several relocations, e.g., Fez, Granada, eventually Cairo where he died. In order to write he retired for a while from active political life. Later, after his pilgrimage to Mecca, he served as Grand Qadi of the Maliki rite in Egypt (he was appointed and dismissed several times). While he was visiting Damascus, Tamerlane took the city; the conqueror interviewed the elderly jurist and social philosopher, yet Ibn Khaldun managed to escape back to his life in Egypt.\nThe history and historiography written by Ibn Khaldun was informed in theory by his learning as a \"faylasuf\" [philosopher]. Yet it was his participation in the small unstable governments of the region at inspired many of his key insights. His history seeks to account for the apparent cyclical progression of historical states of the Maghrib, whereby: (a) a new ruling association comes to power with strong loyalties, (b) which over the course of several generations fall apart, (c) leading to the collapse of the ruling strata. The \"social cohesion\" necessary for the group's initial rise to power, and for the group's ability to maintain it and exercise it, Ibn Khaldun called \"Asabiyyah\".\nHis seven-volume \"Kitab al-'Ibar\" [Book of Examples] (shortened title) is a telescoped \"universal\" history, which concentrates on the Persian, Arab, and Berber civilizations. Its lengthy prologue, called the \"Muqaddimah\" [Introduction], presents the development of long-term political trends and events as a field for the study, characterizing them as human phenomena, in quasi-sociological terms. It is widely considered to be a gem of sustained cultural analysis. Due to his downplaying (or denying) the role of the ethnic Arab people in the development of Islamic science, philosophy and politics, Ibn Khaldun did not attract sufficient interest among Arabs, his studies being neglected in Ifriqiyah\u2014a trend that has lasted to the present day as his works are considered politically incorrect vis a vis Arab nationalism. However and naturally, in the Persian and Turkish worlds he acquired a sustained following.\nIn the later books of the \"Kitab al-'Ibar\", he focuses especially on the history of the Berbers of the Maghrib. The perceptive Ibn Khaldun in his narration eventually arrives at historical events he himself witnessed or encountered. As an official of the Hafsids, Ibn Khaldun experienced first hand the effects on the social structure of troubled regimes and the long-term decline in the region's fortunes.\nOttoman Caliphate, and the Beys.\nA long-term contest for the Mediterranean began in the sixteenth century, between Spaniards (who in 1492 completed the \"reconquista\") and Turks (who had captured Constantinople in 1453). Spain then occupied a series of ports in Northwest Africa, e.g., Oran (1505), Tripoli (1510), Tunis (1534). Some Muslim rulers encouraged Turkish forces to enter the area in order to counter the Spanish presence. The Hafsids of Tunis, however, saw in the Muslim Turks a greater threat and arranged a Spanish alliance.\nThe Ottoman Empire accepted many corsairs as their agents, who made Algiers their base, including Khair al-Din [Arabic name] and his brother Aruj (both known for red beards and called Barbarossa), and Uluj Ali. In 1551 the corsair Dragut was installed in Tripoli; he entered Kairouan in 1558. Then in 1569 Uluj Ali, advancing from Algiers, seized Tunis. After the Christian naval victory at Lepanto in 1571, Don Juan of Austria retook Tunis for Spain in 1573. Uluj Ali returned in 1574 with a large fleet and army to capture Tunis with finality, and then sent the last Hafsid to Constantinople.\nJanissary Deys.\nFollowing imposition in 1574 of permanent Ottoman imperial rule, government in Tunisia was put on a more stable footing after a long period of flux and chaos. The Porte in Constantinople appointed a Pasha as the civil and military authority in Tunisia, which was made a province of the empire. Turkish became the language of the state. The capital city of Tunis was originally garrisoned with 4,000 Janissaries, recruited primarily from Anatolia, commanded by an Agha. The Porte did not maintain the ranks of \"Janissaries\", rather the Pasha in Tunisia himself began to recruit such soldiery from many different regions. From 1574 to 1591 a council (the Diwan), composed of senior military (\"buluk-bashis\") and local notables, advised the provincial government.\nThe new energy of Turkish rule was welcome in Tunis, and by the ulama. Although the Ottomans preferred the Hanifi school of law, some Tunisian Maliki jurists were admitted into the administration. Yet the rule remained one of a foreign elite. In the countryside, efficient Turkish troops managed to control the tribes without compromising alliances, but their rule was unpopular. The rural economy was never brought under effective regulation by the central authority. For revenues the government continued to rely primarily on corsair raiding in the Mediterranean.\nIn 1591 Janissary junior officers (\"deys\") who were not of Turkish origin forced the Pasha to acknowledge the authority of one of their own men, called the Dey (elected by his fellow deys). Relatively independent of the Ottomans, the Dey exercised control in the cities.\n'Uthman Dey (1598\u20131610) and Yusuf Dey (1610\u20131637) managed well enough to establish peace and order in place of chronic social turbulence.\nIn the tribal rural areas, control and collection of taxes were assigned to a chieftain, called the Bey [Turkish]. Twice a year, armed expeditions (\"mahallas\") patrolled the countryside, showing the arm of the central authority. As an auxiliary force, the Beys organized rural cavalry (\"sipahis\"), mostly Arab, recruited from what came to be called the \"government\" (\"makhzan\") tribes.\nMuradid Beys.\nThe Corsican Murad Curso (d. 1631) had since his youth been sponsored by Ramdan Bey (d. 1613). Murad then followed his benefactor into the office of the Bey, which he exercised effectively; later he was also named Pasha, although his position remained inferior to the Dey. His son Hamuda (1631\u20131666) inherited both titles, with the support of the local notables of Tunis. By virtue of his title as Pasha, the Bey came to enjoy the prestige of connection with the Sultan-Caliph in Constantinople. In 1640, upon the death of the Dey, Hamuda Bey maneuvered to establish his control over appointments to at office.\nUnder Murad II Bey (1666\u20131675), son of Hamuda, the \"Diwan\" again functioned as a council of notables. Yet in 1673 the janissary deys, seeing their power ebbing, rose in revolt. During the consequent fighting, the urban forces of the janissary deys fought against the Muradid Beys with their largely rural forces under the tribal shaykhs, and with popular support from city notables. As the Beys secured victory, so did the rural Bedouins and the Tunisian notables, who also emerged triumphant. The Arabic language returned to local official use, although the Muradids continued to use Turkish in the central government, accentuating their elite status and Ottoman connection.\nAt Murad II Bey's death, internal discord with the Muradid family led to armed struggle. The Turkish rulers of Algeria later intervened on behalf of one side in a subsequent domestic conflict; the Algerian forces did not withdraw and proved unpopular. This unfortunate condition of civil discord and Algerian interference persisted. The last Muradid Bey was assassinated in 1702 by Ibrahim Sharif, who then ruled for several years with Algerian backing.\nA gradual economic shift occurred during the Muradid era, as corsair raiding decreased due to pressure from Europe, and commercial trading based on agricultural products (chiefly grains) increased due to an integration of the rural population into regional networks. Mediterranean trade, however, continued to be carried by European shipping concerns. The Beys, in order to derive the maximum advantage from the export trade, in addition to taxation instituted government monopolies which mediated between the local producers and foreign merchants. As a result, the rulers and their business partners (drawn from foreign-dominated elites connected to the Ottomans) took a disproportionate share of Tunisia's trading profits. This precluded the development of local interests, whether rural landowners or a wealthy merchant strata. A social divide persisted, with the important families in Tunisia identified as a \"Turkish\" ruling caste.\nHusaynid Beys.\nThe Husaynid Beys ruled from 1705 to 1881, and reigned until 1957. In theory, Tunisia continued as a vassal of the Ottoman empire (the Friday prayer was pronounced in the name of the Ottoman Sultan, money was coined in his honor, and an annual ambassador brought gifts to Istanbul) but the Ottomans never were able to depend on, or exact, obedience.\nHusayn ibn Ali (1669\u20131740), a cavalry officer of Greek Cretan origin, came into power in 1705, remaining in control until 1735. He had won backing from the Tunisian ulama and notables, as well as from the tribes, for his opposition to Algerian influence which was removed. Yet in a succession dispute, his nephew Ali and his son Muhammad fought a divisive civil war, which ended in 1740 with Ali's uncertain victory. This result was reversed in 1756 after ten more years of fighting, but not without meddling by Algeria.\nEarly Husaynid policy required a careful balance among several divergent parties: the Ottomans, the Turkish speaking elite in Tunisia, and local Tunisians, both urban and rural, notables and clerics, landowners and the more remote tribes. Entanglement with the Ottoman Empire was avoided due to its potential ability to take over the Bey's prerogatives; however, religious ties to the Caliph were fostered, adding prestige to the Beys and winning approval of the local ulama and deference from the notables. Janissaries were still recruited, but increasing reliance was placed on tribal forces. Turkish was spoken at the apex, but use of Arabic increased in government use. \"Kouloughlis\" (children of mixed Turkish and Tunisian parentage) and native Tunisians notables were given increased admittance into higher positions and deliberations. Yet the Husaynid Beys did not themselves intermarry with Tunisians; instead they often turned to the institution of mamluks. The dynasty never ceased to identify as Ottoman, and therefore privileged. Nonetheless, the local ulama were courted, with funding for religious education and the clerics. Maliki jurist entered government service. Rural marabouts were mollified. Tribal shaykhs were recognized and invited to conferences. Especially favored were a handful of prominent families, Turkish speaking, who were given business and land opportunities, as well as important posts in the government, depending on their loyalty.\nThe French Revolution and reactions to it caused disruptions in European economic activity which provided opportunities for Tunisia to profit handsomely. Hammouda Pasha (1781\u20131813) was Bey during this period of prosperity; he also turned back an Algerian invasion in 1807, and quelled a janissary revolt in 1811.\nAfter the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Britain and France secured the Bey's agreement to cease sponsoring or permitting corsair raids, which had resumed during the Napoleonic conflict. Then in the 1820s economic activity in Tunisia took a steep downturn. The Tunisian government was particularly affected due to its monopoly positions regarding many exports. Credit was obtained to weather the deficits, but eventually the debt would grow to unmanageable levels. Foreign business interests increasingly exercised control over domestic commerce. Foreign trade proved to be a Trojan Horse.\nUnder the French Protectorate (1881\u20131956) the Husaynid Beys continued in a largely ceremonial r\u00f4le. Following independence, a republic was declared in 1957; the Beylical office was terminated and the Husaynid dynasty came to an end.\nEra of Reform.\nIn the 19th century under the Husaynid Beyds, commerce with the Europeans increased, with permanent residences established by many foreign merchants. In 1819 the Bey agreed to quit corsair raids. In 1830 the Bey also agreed to enforce in Tunisia the capitulation treaties between the Ottomans and various European powers, under which European consuls would act as judges in legal cases involving their nationals. During 1830 the French royal army occupied neighboring Algeria.\nAhmad Bey (1837\u20131855) assumed the throne during this complex situation. Following the examples of the Ottoman Empire under sultan Mahmud II, and of Egypt under Muhammad Ali, he moved to intensify a program to update and upgrade the Tunisian armed forces. In pursuit of this policy, he instituted a military school and started industries in order to supply its more modern army and navy. In a major step, he initiated the recruitment and conscription of native Tunisians to serve in the army and navy, a step which would reduce the long division between the state and its citizens. Yet the resulting tax increases were not popular.\nAlthough desiring Ottoman support, repeatedly Ahmad Bey refused to apply in Tunisia the Ottoman legal reforms regarding citizen rights, i.e., the Tanzimat of 1839. Instead, he instituted progressive laws of his own, showing native Tunisian authority in the modernizing project and hence the redundancy of importing any Ottoman reforms. The Slave trade was abolished in 1841, slavery in 1846. Yet these legal reforms had limited application to many Tunisians. Ahmad Bey continued the general Beylical policy, i.e., to decline or reject political attachment to the Ottoman state, but welcome religious ties to the Ottoman Caliphate.\nAs part of his maneuvering to maintain Tunisia's sovereignty, Ahmad Bey sent 4,000 Tunisian troops against the Russian Empire during the Crimean War (1854\u20131856). In doing so he allied Tunisia with the Ottoman Empire, France, and Great Britain.\nModernity and the French Protectorate.\nAs the 19th century commenced, the country remained quasi-autonomous, although officially still an Ottoman province. Trade with Europe increased dramatically with western merchants arriving to establish businesses in the country. In 1861, Tunisia enacted the first constitution in the Arab world, but a move toward a modernizing republic was hampered by the poor economy and by political unrest. Loans made by foreigners to the government were becoming difficult to manage. In 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt; an international financial commission, with representatives from France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, took control over the economy.\nInitially, Italy was the country that demonstrated the most desire to have Tunisia as a colony having investment, citizens and geographic proximity as motivation. However, this was rebuffed when Britain and France co-operated to prevent this during the years 1871 \u2013 1878 ending in Britain supporting French influence in Tunisia in exchange for dominion over Cyprus. France still had the issue of Italian influence (related to the huge colony of Tunisian Italians emigrated to Tunisia) and thus decided to find an excuse for a pre-emptive strike. In the spring of 1881, the French army occupied Tunisia, claiming that Tunisian troops had crossed the border to Algeria, France's primary colony in Northern Africa. Italy, also interested in Tunisia, protested, but did not risk a war with France. On May 12 of that year, Tunisia was officially made a French protectorate with the signature of the treaty of Bardo (Al Qasr as Sa'id)by Muhammad III as-Sadiq. This gave France control of Tunisian governance and making it a de facto French protectorate.\nThe French progressively assumed more of the important administrative positions, and by 1884 they supervised all Tunisian government bureaus dealing with finance, post, education, telegraph, public works and agriculture. They decided to guarantee the Tunisian debt, and then abolished the international finance commission. French settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of French colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945, occupying approximately one-fifth of the cultivated land. Roads, ports, railroads, and mines were developed. In rural areas the French administration strengthened the local officials (\"qa'ids\") and weakened the independent tribes. An additional judicial system was established for Europeans but available generally, set up without interfering with the existing Sharia courts, available as always for the legal matters of Tunisians.\nMany welcomed the progressive changes, but preferred to manage their own affairs. Kayr al-Din in the 1860s and 1870s had introduced modernizing reforms before the French occupation. Some of his companions later founded the weekly magazine \"al-Hadira\" in 1888. A more radical one \"al-Zahra\" ran from 1890 until suppressed in 1896; as was the \"Sabil al-Rashad\" of 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Tha'alibi, who was inspired by Muhammad 'Abduh of Cairo, among others. Bashir Sfar initiated the discussion group \"Khalduniya\" in 1896. 'Ali Bash Hamba founded the French-language journal \"Tunisien\" to inform the French public of the Tunisian complaints, but only increased unrest. Tha'alibi founded the Arabic language \"Tunisien\" in 1909, to challenge Hamba from a Tunisian view point. In 1911 there were civil disturbances started within the universities. Hamba and Tha'alibi came together. A political party was begun, \"al-Ittihad al-Islami\" [Islamic Unity], which had pro-Ottoman leanings. Issues concerning a Muslim cemetery, the Jallaz, sparked large demonstrations which ended with martial law and the killing of many Tunisians in late 1911. Further demonstrations in 1912 led to the closing of the nationalist newspapers and the exiling of nationalist leadership.\nOrganized nationalist sentiment among Tunisians, driven underground in 1912, resurfaced after the great War. Encouragement came from many directions, e.g., the formation of the League of Nations in 1919. Nationalists established the Destour [Constitution] Party in 1920. Habib Bourguiba established and led its successor, the Neo-Destour Party, in 1934. French authorities later banned this new party, while the fascist organizations of the Tunisian Italians supported it (Mussolini obtained the liberation of Bourghiba from a Vichy jail in 1942).\nDuring World War II, the French authorities in Tunisia supported the Vichy government which ruled France after its capitulation to Germany in 1940. After initial victories to the east the German General Erwin Rommel, lacking supplies and reinforcements, in 1942 lost the decisive battle of al-Alamein (near Alexandria in Egypt) to the British General Bernard Montgomery. After learning of Allied landings in the west (Operation Torch), the Axis army retreated westward to Tunisia and set up defensive positions. The British following on his heels eventually broke these lines, although Rommel did have some early success against the \"green\" American troops advancing from the west, until the arrival of General George Patton who stopped Rommel in battle. The fighting ended in May 1943. The German Afrika Corps surrendered on May 11. Two days later, on May 13, after the collapse of the 5th German Tank Army, the fall of Tunis and the surrounding of the 1st Italian Army, still holding the line at Enfidaville, the Italian general Messe formally surrendered to the Allies.\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower (who earned trust by talking straight if not always clearly) stated at \"far from governing a conquered country, we were attempting only to force a gradual widening of the base of government, with the final objective of turning all internal affairs over to popular control.\" Tunisia became a staging area for operations in the invasion of Sicily later at year.\nAfter World War II, the struggle for national independence continued and intensified. The Neo-Destour Party reemerged under Habib Bourguiba. Yet with a lack of progress, violent resistance to French rule began in the mountains during 1954. The Tunisians coordinated with independence movements in Algeria and Morocco, although it was Tunisia that first became independent. Ultimately, the Neo-Destour Party managed to gain sovereignty for its people by maneuver and finesse.\nTunisian Republic.\nIndependence from France was achieved on March 20, 1956. The State was established as a constitutional monarchy with the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad VIII al-Amin Bey, as the king of Tunisia.\nThe Era of Habib Bourguiba.\nIn 1957, the Prime Minister Habib Bourguiba (Habib Abu Ruqaiba) abolished the monarchy and firmly established his Neo Destour (New Constitution) party. The regime sought to run a strictly structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not democratic-style politics. Also terminated was the \"bey\", a quasi-monarchist institution dating back to Ottoman rule. Then Bourguiba commenced to dominate the country for the next 31 years, governing with thoughtful programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing Islamic fundamentalism, and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. The vision at Bourguiba offered was of a Tunisian republic. The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued with a kind of French rationalist vision of the state at was buoyant, touched with \u00e9lan, \"Napoleonic\" in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity.\n\"Bourguibism\" was also resolutely nonmilitarist, arguing that Tunisia could never be a credible military power and that the building of a large military establishment would only consume scarce investment resources and perhaps thrust Tunisia into the cycles of military intervention in politics at had plagued the rest of the Middle East. In the name of economic development, Bourguiba nationalized various religious land holdings and dismantled several religious institutions.\nBourguiba's great asset was at \"Tunisia possessed a mature nationalist organization, the Neo Destour Party, which on independence day held the nation's confidence in hand.\" It had made its case to the city workers in the modern economy and to country folk in the traditional economy; it had excellent leaders who commanded respect and who generally developed reasonable government programs.\nIn July 1961, when Tunisia imposed a blockade on the French naval base at Bizerte, hoping to force its evacuation, the crisis culminated in a three-day battle between French and Tunisian forces that left some 630 Tunisians and 24 French dead and eventually led to France ceding the city and naval base to Tunisia in 1963.\nOne serious rival to Habib Bourguiba was Salah Ben Yusuf. Exiled in Cairo during the early 1950s he had absorbed the pan-Arab nationalism associated with the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser. Yet as a result of his strong opposition to the Neo Destour leadership during their negotiations with France for autonomy prior to independence, Ben Youssef was removed from his position as secretary-general and expelled from the party. Nonetheless, he rallied disaffected union members, students, and others, enough to put 20,000 \"yusufists\" into the street during the next congress of the Neo Destour party. Eventually he left Tunisia for Cairo.\nSocialism was not initially a major part of the Neo Destour project, but the government had always held and implemented redistributive policies. A large public works program was launched in 1961. Nonetheless, in 1964, Tunisia entered a short lived socialist era. The Neo Destour party became the Socialist Destour (\"Parti Socialiste Dusturien\" or PSD), and the new minister of planning, Ahmed Ben Salah, formulated a state-led plan for agricultural cooperatives and public-sector industrialization. The socialist experiment raised considerable opposition within Bourguiba's old coalition. Ahmed Ben Salah was eventually dismissed in 1970, and many socialized operations (e.g., the farm cooperatives) were returned to private ownership in the early 1970s. In 1978, a general strike was repressed by the government with its forces killing dozens; union leaders were jailed.\nAfter independence, Tunisian economic policy had been primarily to promote light industry and tourism, and develop its phosphate deposits. The major sector remained agriculture with small farms prevailing, but these did not produce well. In the early 1960s the economy slowed down, but the socialist program did not prove to be the cure.\nIn the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very healthy rate. Oil was discovered, and tourism continued. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe.\nThe Era of Ben Ali.\nIn the 1980s the economy performed poorly. In 1983 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forced the government to raise the price of bread and semolina, causing severe hardship and protest riots. In this situation, the Islamic Tendency Movement (MTI) under Rached Ghannouchi provided popular leadership. Civil disturbances, including those by the Islamists, were repressed by government security forces under General Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The government persisted in following its program; Ben Ali was named prime minister.\nThe 84-year-old president Bourguiba was overthrown and replaced by Ben Ali, his prime minister, on November 7, 1987. The new president changed very little in the Bourguibist political support system, except to rename the party the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD by its French acronym).\nIn 1988, Ben Ali tried a new tack with reference to the government and Islam, by attempting to reaffirm the country's Islamic identity; several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to an-Nahda (the Renaissance Party). But Ben Ali's innovative tack did not work out. Subsequently, An-Nahda claimed to have run strongly in the 1989 elections, which gave the appearance of being unfair; reports often described pro-government votes at over 90%. Ben Ali subsequently banned Islamist political parties and jailed as many as 8,000 activists.\nIn 2004, Ben Ali was re-elected President for a five-year term, with a reported 94.5% of the vote. Also elected were 189 members of the \"Majlis al-Nuwaab\" or Chamber of Deputies, with a five-year term. In addition, there was a Chamber of Advisors composed of 126 members with six-year terms, of whom 85 were elected by government subdivisions (e.g., municipalities), by professional associations, and by trade unions (14 union members boycotted the process); the remaining 41 members were appointed by the President. The court system remained a combination of French Civil Law and Islamic Sharia Law.\nA widely supported human rights movement emerged, which included not only Islamists but also trade unionists, lawyers and journalists. Tunisia's political institutions, however, remained fixed in the authoritarian past. As of 2001, the government's response to calls for reform Included house arrests and prison. The government continued its refusal to recognize Muslim opposition parties, and governed the country in a political climate considered rigid, from time to time using objectionable military and police measures to repress dissent.\nIn foreign affairs, Tunisia continued to enjoy close ties to the West while broadly following a moderate, non-aligned stance. The Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1991.\n2000s in Tunisia.\nTunis, the capital, has a population of about 700,000, and the second city of Sfax approximately 250,000. The population growth rate measured as births per female has fallen from 7 (1960s) to 2 (2007). Life expectancy is female 75, male 72. The religion is Muslim (98%), with 1% Christian, and 1% Jewish and other. Required education is eight years. The official language is Arabic, with French also spoken particularly in commercial dealings, and with less than 2% Berber. Literacy by definition includes all over 15 years, and is overall 74%, male 83% and female 65%. In 2006, 7.3 million mobile phones were in use and 1.3 million were on the internet; there were 26 television stations and 29 radio stations. Over half the population is considered urban, with agricultural workers being about 30% of the total. Unemployment in 2000 was about 15.6%, and in 2006 about 13.9%. Over 300,000 Tunisians were reported to be residing in France during 1994. Left out of the recent prosperity were many rural and urban poor, including small businesses facing the world market.\nThe monetary unit is the \"dinar\", at about 1.33 per dollar U.S.A. (recently a fairly constant rate), with inflation estimated pp.\u00a04.5% for 2006. Tunisia's per capita annual income was approximately 8,900 dollars (U.S.A.) in 2006. Between 1988 and 1998 the economy more than doubled. The economy grew at 5% per year during the 1990s (the best in Northwest Africa), but hit a 15-year low of 1.9% in 2002 (due to drought and a decline in tourism), but it regained a 5% rate for 2003\u20132005; it was said to be 4%\u20135% for 2006. Tunisia's economy is diverse. Its products are primarily from light industry (food processing, textiles, footwear, agribusiness, mining commodities, construction materials) and from agriculture (olives, olive oil, grains (wheat and barley), tomatoes, citrus, sugar beets, dates, almonds, figs, vegetables, grapes, beef dairy), as well as livestock (sheep, goats) and fishing. Other production comes from petroleum and mining (phosphates, iron, oil, lead, zinc, salt). Tunisia is self-sufficient in oil, but not in natural gas. A very significant portion of the economy derives from the tourist industry. Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) was composed of approximately 12.5% agriculture, 33.1% industry, and 54.4% services. Exports went to France 29%, Italy 20%, Germany 9%, Spain 6%, Libya 5%, U.S.A. 4%. Imports came from France 25%, Italy 22%, Germany 10%, Spain 5%. An association agreement with the European Union will move Tunisia toward full free trade with the EU by 2008.\nThe face of the countryside changes markedly as one moves from north to south. In the north and central coast, orchards and fields predominate; while in the central plains, pasturage. Overall, arable land is 17%\u201319%, with forest and woodland 4%, permanent crops 13%, irrigated lands at 2.4%; about 20% is used for pasture. There are limited fresh water resources. In the south the environment grows increasingly arid, until the borderlands eventually reach into the Sahara desert. Roads total about 20,000\u00a0km., two-thirds being paved, with most of the unpaved roads lying in the desert south.\nThe \"Dignity Revolution\".\nThe Ben Ali regime came to an end following nationwide demonstrations precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. The protests were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010 and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 28 days later on 14 January 2011, when he officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia, ending 23 years in power. In the Western media, these events were commonly named the \"Jasmine Revolution\", but the name was not generally adopted in Tunisia itself. where the name generally used is the \"Dignity Revolution\" () (\"\").\nFollowing the overthrow of Ben Ali, Tunisians elected a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution, and an interim government known as the Troika because it was a coalition of three parties; the Islamist Ennahda Movement in the lead, with the centre-left Congress for the Republic and the left-leaning Ettakatol as minority partners. Widespread discontent remained however, leading to the 2013\u201314 Tunisian political crisis. As a result of the efforts made by the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, the Constituent Assembly completed its work, the interim government resigned, and new elections were held in 2014, completing the transition to a democratic state. The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for \"its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution of 2011\".\nPresidency of Kais Saied.\nTunisia's first democratically elected president, Beji Caid Essebsi, died in July 2019. After him, Kais Saied became Tunisia's president after a landslide victory in the 2019 Tunisian presidential election in October 2019. On 23 October 2019, Kais Saied was sworn in as Tunisian president.\nOn 25 July 2021 in light of violent demonstrations against the government demanding the improvement of basic services and amid a growing COVID-19 outbreak, Saied suspended parliament for thirty days and relieved the prime minister Hichem Mechichi from his duties, waiving the immunity of the parliament members and ordering the military to close the parliament house. Saied's actions, which included relieving the prime minister of his duties, assuming the executive authority, suspending the Parliament and closing the offices of some foreign news agencies, appeared to have been clear signs of a coup, as they disregard Article 80 of the Tunisian constitution which states that before raising an emergency state, the president must consult his prime minister and the head of the Parliament, and even then the Parliament cannot be suspended.\nIn September 2021, President Ka\u00efs Sa\u00efed announced an upcoming reform of the 2014 Constitution and the formation of a new government led by Najla Bouden Romdhane, first woman prime minister of Tunisia and the Arab world. A constitutional referendum was scheduled for 25 July 2022. After the referendum results indicated that 90% of voters supported Saied, he emerged as victorious and promised that Tunisia will enter the new phase after he got the unlimited power. Critics said the new constitution has a risk of the return of authoritarian rule to the country.\nOn 6 October 2024, President Kais Saied won a second term with more than 90% of the vote in Tunisian presidential election. Five political parties had urged people to boycott the elections.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Between 1956 and 2011, Tunisia operated as a \"de facto\" one-party state, with politics dominated by the secular Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD) under former presidents Habib Bourguiba and then Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. However, in 2011 a national uprising led to the ousting of Ben Ali and the dismantling of the RCD, paving the way for a multi-party democracy. October 2014 saw the first democratic parliamentary elections since the 2011 revolution, resulting in a win by the secularist Nidaa Tounes party with 85 seats in the 217-member assembly.\nTunisia is a member of the Arab League, the African Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It maintains close relations with the United States, France and the European Union, with which it entered an Association Agreement in 1995. Tunisia's favorable relations with the United States and the European Union were earned following years of successful economic cooperation in the private sector and infrastructure modernization.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated Tunisia a \"hybrid regime\" in .\nTunisia's first democratically elected president, Beji Caid Essebsi, died in July 2019. After him, Kais Saied, a constitutional law professor, became Tunisia's president after a landslide victory in the 2019 Tunisian presidential elections in October 2019. He built his campaign around being anti-corruption, anti-establishment and socially conservative. He was nicknamed \"Robotcop\" because of his stiff manners.\nHowever, on 25 July 2021 he suspended Parliament, fired the prime minister and consolidated power in what opponents called a \"coup.\" On 6 October 2024, President Kais Saied won a second term with more than 90% of the vote in Tunisian presidential election. Five political parties had urged people to boycott the elections.\nGovernment.\nTunisia was a representative democracy with an executive president, a legislature and judiciary, starting with elections in 2014 until the president suspended parliament and began ruling by decree on 25 July 2021. Since then, all the trappings of an authoritarian state have returned. The military is neutral and does not play any role in national politics.\nExecutive branch.\nIn Tunisia, the president was directly elected for a five-year term. The president nominates the candidate of the party that gained the most votes in legislative elections to form a government within a month. The nominee must submit his program to the Assembly of the Representatives of the People and get the trust of the majority of its members before being appointed prime minister. Regional governors and local administrators are appointed by the central government. Mayors and municipal councils are directly elected.\nLegislative branch.\nTunisia's legislative branch consists of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People, with 161 seats. The first elections for the Assembly of the Representative of the People occurred on 26 October 2014.\nBefore the 2011 revolution the parliament was bicameral. The lower house was the Chamber of Deputies of Tunisia (\"Majlis al-Nuwaab\"), which had 214 seats. Members were elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms. At least 25% of the seats in the House of Deputies were reserved for the opposition. More than 27% of the members of the Chamber of Deputies were women. The lower house played a growing role as an arena for debate on national policy, especially as it hosted representatives from six opposition parties. Opposition members often voted against bills or abstained. However, because the governing party enjoyed a comfortable majority, bills usually passed with only minor changes.\nThe upper house was the Chamber of Advisors, which had 112 members, including representatives of governorates (provinces), professional organizations and national figures. Of these, 41 were appointed by the head of state while 71 were elected by their peers. About 15% of the members of the Chamber of Advisors were women.\nJudicial branch.\nThe Tunisian legal system is based on French civil law system. Some judicial review of legislative acts takes place in the Supreme Court in joint session. The judiciary is independent, although the Supreme Judicial Council is chaired by the president of the republic.\nThe Tunisian Order of Lawyers is a non-profit bar association. All Tunisian lawyers are members of the Order, which does not have any political affiliations.\nThe Constitution of 2014 provides for a newly constituted Constitutional Court. It consists of 12 members, each of whom must have 20 years' experience in order to serve for a single term of nine years. Two thirds are specialized in law. The president of the republic, the president of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People and the Supreme Judicial Council each propose four candidates; the Assembly of the Representatives of the People approves nominations with a three-fifths majority. The Constitutional Court appoints its own president and vice president, both specialized in law.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nSince 1987 Tunisia has reformed its political system several times, abolishing life-term presidencies and opening up the parliament to opposition parties. The number of new political parties and associations has increased since the beginning of Ben Ali's presidency in 1987. Shortly before the revolution of 2011 there were eight recognized national parties, six of which held national legislative seats. President Ben Ali's party, known as the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), commanded majorities in local, regional, and national elections. Although the party was renamed (in President Bourguiba's days it was the Socialist Destourian Party), its policies were still considered to be largely secular and conservative. However, the Tunisian Revolution in 2011 saw its removal from power.\n2009 national elections.\nThe Tunisian national elections of 2009, overseen by the Interior Ministry and held on October 25, 2009, elected candidates for president and legislative offices. During the campaign, speeches by candidates were aired on Tunisian radio and television stations. Participation was 89% of resident citizens and 90% of citizens living abroad. In the presidential vote, Ben Ali soundly defeated his challengers, Mohamed Bouchiha (PUP), Ahmed Inoubli (UDU) and Ahmed Ibrahim (Ettajdid Movement) for a fifth term in office. His 89% of the vote was slightly lower than in the 2004 election. In the parliamentary elections, the RCD received 84% of the vote for 161 constituency seats. The MDS won 16 seats under the proportional representation system, followed by the PUP with 12 seats. Fifty-nine women were elected to legislative seats.\nThe election was criticized by opposition parties and some international observers for limitations placed on non-incumbents. In one instance, the Ettajdid party's weekly publication, \"Ettarik al-Jadid\", was seized by authorities for violating campaign communications laws. Meanwhile, a delegation from the African Union Commission praised the election for taking place with \"calm and serenity\". Prior to the 2009 election, Tunisia amended its constitution to allow more candidates to run for president, allowing the top official from each political party to compete for the presidency regardless of whether they held seats in parliament.\n2011 Constituent Assembly election.\nFollowing the 2010\u20132011 protests and the vacation of the presidency by President Ben Ali, elections for a Constituent Assembly were held on 23 October 2011. Results were announced on 25 October 2011 with the center-right and moderately Islamist Ennahda winning a plurality with 37% of the vote.\n2014 parliamentary elections.\nParliamentary elections were held in Tunisia on 26 October 2014. Results were announced on 27 October 2014 with secularist Nidaa Tounes winning a plurality with 38% of the vote.\n2019 parliamentary and presidential elections.\nIn the parliamentary election, the Ennahda became the biggest party with 52 seats, while the Heart of Tunisia became the second with 38 seats. In the presidential election, independent candidate Kais Saied got a landslide victory with 72.5% of the vote in the second round.\n2022 constitutional referendum.\nIn July 2022, Tunisians approved a new constitution in a referendum. The reform gave more powers to Tunisia's president, meaning the role of President Kais Saied strengthened significantly.\n2024 presidential elections.\nIn October 2024, Tunisia held presidential elections, which some political parties boycotted, while others had many of their leaders jailed since 2021. The ISIE ( Independent High Authority for Elections) rejected 14 candidacies files, only accepting three candidates : Saied and former deputies Zouhair Maghzaoui, a supporter of Saied and his coup, and Ayachi Zammel. Candidacies of Mondher Zenaidi, Abdellatif Mekki and Imed Da\u00efmi [fr], were rejected but later on reinstated by the Administrative Court.\nLate August 2024, the Administrative Court ruled that these last three candidates must be allowed back in the race. The ISIE, whose members are mostly appointed by Saied, disregarded this ruling, arguing it hasn't it received it on time, which was denied by the Court.\nPolitics and society.\nWomen's equality.\nThe now-defunct Chamber of Deputies had 23% women members in 2009, outpacing the percentage of women serving at the time in the U.S. Congress, which stood at 17% in the 111th Congress. More than one-fifth of the seats in both chambers of parliament were held by women, an exceptionally high level in the Arab world.\nTunisia is the only country in the Arab world where polygamy is forbidden by law. This is part of a provision in the country's Code of Personal Status which was introduced by President Bourguiba in 1956.\nRevolution.\nBen Ali regime.\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was criticized for the low levels of democracy and freedom of expression in the country by Amnesty International and various other organizations. which documented restrictions of basic human rights and obstruction of human rights organizations. \"The Economist\"'s 2008 Democracy Index ranked Tunisia 141 out of 167 countries studied and 143 out of 173 regarding freedom of the press. Later in his rule repression became more brutal, corruption more visible and the economy more stagnant.\n2010\u20132011 revolution.\nThe Tunisian Revolution overthrew President Ben Ali in 2011\u2014marking the beginning of the Arab Spring.\nOn 14 January 2011, president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia, ending 23 years in power, following the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades. Street protests and civil disobedience against high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions, were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010.\nA Constituent Assembly was elected on 23 October 2011, and a new constitution was adopted on 26 January 2014. It was passed on 10 February 2014.\nMedia.\nUnder the Ben Ali regime, freedom of the press was officially guaranteed, but the press was highly restricted, as was a substantial amount of web content. Journalists were often obstructed from reporting on controversial events. Prior to the Jasmine Revolution, Tunisia practiced internet censorship against popular websites such as YouTube. In 2010 Reporters Without Borders included Tunisia in the country list of \u201cEnemies of the Internet\". Despite this, Tunisia hosted the second half of the United Nations-sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in 2005, which endorsed the freedom of the internet as a platform for political participation and human rights protection. By 2010, Tunisia had more than 3.5 million regular internet users and 1.6 million Facebook users and hundreds of internet cafes, known as 'publinet.'\nFive private radio stations have been established, including Mosaique FM, Express FM, Shems FM and private television stations such as Hannibal TV and Nessma TV.\nAdministrative divisions.\nTunisia is divided into 24 governorates:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInternational organization participation.\nTunisia is a participant in the following international organizations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prudent economic and fiscal planning has resulted in moderate but sustained growth for over a decade. Tunisia's economic growth historically has depended on oil, phosphates, agri-food products, car parts manufacturing, and tourism. In the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report for 2015\u20132016, Tunisia ranks in 92nd place.\nThe year 2015 was marked by terrorist attacks in Tunisia which are likely to affect economic growth, especially in tourism, one of the main sectors.\nHistorical trend.\nGDP per capita soared by more than 380% in the seventies (1970\u20131980: USD 280\u20131,369). But this proved unsustainable and it collapsed to a cumulative 10% growth in the turbulent eighties (1980\u20131990: USD 1,369\u20131,507), rising again to almost 50% cumulative growth in the nineties (1990\u20132000: USD 1,507\u20132,245), signifying the impact of successful diversification.\n Growing foreign debt and the foreign exchange crisis in the mid-1980s led the government to launch a structural adjustment program to liberalize prices, reduce tariffs, and reorient Tunisia toward a market economy in 1986. Tunisia's economic reform program was lauded as a model by international financial institutions. The government liberalized prices, reduced tariffs, lowered debt-service-to-exports and debt-to-GDP ratios, and extended the average maturity of its $10 billion foreign debt. Structural adjustment brought additional lending from the World Bank and other Western creditors. In 1990, Tunisia acceded to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nIn 1996 Tunisia entered into an \"Association Agreement\" with the European Union (EU) which removed tariffs and other trade barriers on most goods by 2008. In conjunction with the Association Agreement, the EU is assisting the Tunisian government's \"Mise A Niveau\" (upgrading) program to enhance the productivity of Tunisian businesses and prepare for competition in the global marketplace.\nThe government totally or partially privatized around 160 state-owned enterprises after the privatization program was launched in 1987. Although the program is supported by the GATT, the government had to move carefully to avoid mass firings. Unemployment continued to plague Tunisia's economy and was aggravated by a rapidly growing workforce. An estimated 55% of the population is under the age of 25. Officially, 15.2% of the Tunisian workforce is unemployed.\nIn 2011, after the Arab Spring, the economy slumped but then recovered with 2.81% GDP growth in 2014. However, unemployment is still one of the major issues with 15.2% of the labor force unemployed as of the first quarter of 2014. Tunisia's political transition gained new momentum in early 2014, with the resolution of a political deadlock, the adoption of a new Constitution and the appointment of a new government. The national dialogue platform, brokered by key civil society organizations, played a crucial role in gathering all major political parties. This consensus will allow for further reform in the economy and public sector.\nIn 2015, the Bardo National Museum attack led to the collapse of the third largest sector of Tunisia's economy; tourism. Tunisian tourist workers in Tunis have said that \"tourism is dead, it is completely dead\", expressing the severe drop in tourism after the attack.\nThe number of ragpickers in Tunisia is increasing due to the continuing high level of unemployment, the loss of purchasing power of the most disadvantaged families, and the explosion of plastic waste due to new consumption habits. Ragpickers do not benefit from social protection, granted to professions with a legal status and may be subject to the exploitation of the Recycling industry.\nIn January 2023, Marouane Abassi, governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia, warned that without an agreement with the IMF, his country would not be able to withstand the surge in prices and would not be able to maintain its growth rates.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017. Inflation under 5% is in green.\nExternal trade and investment.\nIn 1992, Tunisia re-entered the private international capital market for the first time in 6 years, securing a $10-million line of credit for balance-of-payments support. In January 2003 Standard &amp; Poor's affirmed its investment grade credit ratings for Tunisia. The World Economic Forum 2002-03 ranked Tunisia 34th in the Global Competitiveness Index Ratings (two places behind South Africa, the continent's leader). In April 2002, Tunisia's first US dollar-denominated sovereign bond issue since 1997 raised $458 million, with maturity in 2012.\nThe Bourse de Tunis is under the control of the state-run Financial Market Council and lists over 50 companies. The government offers substantial tax incentives to encourage companies to join the exchange, and expansion is occurring.\nThe Tunisian government adopted a unified investment code in 1993 to attract foreign capital. More than 1,600 export-oriented joint venture firms operate in Tunisia to take advantage of relatively low labor costs and preferential access to nearby European markets. Economic links are closest with European countries, which dominate Tunisia's trade. Tunisia's currency, the dinar, is not traded outside Tunisia. However, partial convertibility exists for bona fide commercial and investment transaction. Certain restrictions still limit operations carried out by Tunisian residents.\nThe stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Tunisia was valued at $5.3 Billion in 2007, 15% of 2007 GDP, by the World Bank.\nFor 2007, foreign direct investment totaled TN Dinar 2 billion in 2007, or 5.18% of the total volume of investment in the country. This figure is up 35.7% from 2006 and includes 271 new foreign enterprises and the expansion of 222 others already based in the country.\nThe economic growth rate seen for 2007, at 6.3% is the highest achieved in a decade.\nOn 29 and 30 November, Tunisia held an investment conference with country chiefs from all around the world with pledges that have reached $30 billion to finance new public projects.\nAs of 2022, Tunisia's government is in need of international help as the economy grapples with a crisis in public finances that has raised fears it may default on debt and has contributed to shortages of food and fuel, according to government critics. As a result, the government announced in December 2022 that they expect to reduce its fiscal deficit to 5.5% in 2023 from a forecast 7.7% this year, driven by austerity measures that could pave the way for a final deal with the International Monetary Fund on a rescue package. In 2025, Tunisia severed ties with the IMF.\nTunisia's exports to Libya, exceeding 18% growth between 2020 and 2024.\nLoan guarantee.\nSource:\nOn 20 April 2012, U.S. Treasury Secretary and Tunisian Finance Minister Houcine Dimassi signed a declaration of intent to move forward on a U.S. loan guarantee for Tunisia. The U.S. Government would provide this loan guarantee to enable the Tunisian government to access significant market financing at affordable rates and favorable maturities with the backing of a U.S. guarantee of principal and interest (up to 100 percent).\nThe support would consist of the U.S. guarantee of Tunisian government-issued debt (or of bank loans made to the Government of Tunisia). This guarantee will significantly reduce the Tunisian government's borrowing costs at a time when market access has become more expensive for many emerging market countries. In the weeks ahead, both governments intend to make progress on a loan guarantee agreement that would allow Tunisia to move forward with a debt issuance.\nThe ceremony took place at the World Bank immediately following the meeting of Finance Ministers of the Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in Transition.\nMicrofinance institutions, such as Enda Tamweel, exist to assist those who are unable to access the regular banking system. This comprises those living in rural or impoverished regions where the informal sector thrives, accounting for 34% of Tunisia's GDP.\nEnda Tamweel has made over 3 million microloans to over 900,000 people in the 30 years since its inception, infusing more than \u20ac1.6 billion into the local economy.\nEnergy.\nTunisia's natural resources are modest when compared to those of its neighbors: Algeria and Libya. This modesty in natural resources forced the country to import oil, which contributed to the rise in the cost of gasoline: on 26 April 2006, the liter crossed the bar of one dinar to sell for 1.50 Tunisian dinars. (a price equivalent to European prices from the point of view of purchasing power parity).\nEconomic structure.\nIn 2017, the breakdown by economic sector is as follows:\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture - products: olives, grain, tomatoes, citrus fruit, sugar beets, dates, almonds.\nIn 2018, Tunisia produced:\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like almond (66 thousand tons) and sugar beet (76 thousand tons).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tunis is the center of the transport system as the largest city having the largest port and a light transit system.\nRailways.\nTunisia inherited much of its rail transport system from the French. The Tunisian Government has developed infrastructure further. The railways are operated by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Chemins de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT), the Tunisian national railway. A modernisation program is currently underway. It has a total of 2,152\u00a0km consisting of 468\u00a0km of railways and 1,674 kilometres of . Tunis has a light rail system. In the south of Tunisia, there is a narrow gauge railway called the Sfax-Gafsa Railway which delivers phosphates and iron ore to the harbour at Sfax. Tunisia has rail links with the neighbouring country of Algeria via the Ghardimaou-Souk Ahras line, and another connection to T\u00e9bessa, however, the latter link is currently not used. There are no railways yet in neighbouring Libya though some are under construction in 2008; some gauge conversion would be required for efficient connections.\nHighways.\nAs of 2004, there were 18,997\u00a0km of highway including 12,310 of paved road and 6,387 of unpaved road.

Petrochemicals are Tunisia's third most important export despite the small size of its oil and gas fields as compared to Libya and Algeria. It also gets a royalty rate of 5 per cent on the Algerian gas that runs through Tunis to Sicily through the Trans-Mediterranean gas pipeline.

The first people known to history in what is now Tunisia were the Berbers, who currently make up 1% of the population, and were ultimately conquered by the Arabs in the 7th century. There was a continuing inflow of nomadic Arab tribes to the Maghreb from the Arabian Peninsula since the 7th century with a major wave in the 11th century.\nWhilst the Ottoman influence has been particularly significant in forming the Turco-Tunisian community, other peoples have also migrated to Tunisia during different periods of time, including Sub-Saharan Africans, Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians (Punics), Jews, and French settlers. The Tunisian, by 1870 the distinction between the Arabic-speaking mass and the Turkish elite had blurred. There is also a small Berber (1% at most) population located in the Dahar mountains and on the island of Djerba in the south-east and in the Khroumire mountainous region in the north-west.\nFrom the late 19th century to after World War II, Tunisia was home to large populations of French and Italians (255,000 Europeans in 1956), although nearly all of them, along with the Jewish population, left after Tunisia became independent. The history of the Jews in Tunisia goes back some 2,000 years. In 1948 the Jewish population was an estimated 105,000, but by 2013 only about 900 remained.\nAfter the Reconquista and expulsion of non-Christians and Moriscos from Spain, many Spanish Muslims and Jews also arrived. According to Matthew Carr, \"As many as eighty thousand Moriscos settled in Tunisia, most of them in and around the capital, Tunis, which still contains a quarter known as Zuqaq al-Andalus, or Andalusia Alley.\"\nGenetics.\nTunisians mainly carry haplogroup J1 (34.2%) and haplogroup E (55%).\n\"In fact, the Tunisian genetic distances to European samples are smaller than those to North African groups. (...) This could be explained by the history of the Tunisian population, reflecting the influence of the ancient Punic settlers of Carthage followed, among others, by Roman, Byzantine, Arab and French occupations, according to historical records. Notwithstanding, other explanations cannot be discarded, such as the relative heterogeneity within current Tunisian populations, and/or the limited sub-Saharan genetic influence in this region as compared with other North African areas, without excluding the possibility of the genetic drift, whose effect might be particularly amplified on the X chromosome.\",\nHowever, other research has suggested instead that Tunisians exhibit a mostly indigenous North African ancestral component similar to other Northwest African populations; characterized by a high amount of native Northwest African genes, but with higher Middle Eastern input than in Algeria or Morocco.\nY-Chromosome.\nListed here are the human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups in Tunisia.\nEmigration.\nAccording to statistics from the Tunisian Office for Foreign Nationals.

Paramilitary forces consisted of a 12,000-member national guard. Tunisia participates in United Nations peacekeeping efforts in the DROC (MONUSCO) and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Previous United Nations peacekeeping deployments for the Tunisian armed forces have included Cambodia (UNTAC), Namibia (UNTAG), Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia/Eritrea (UNMEE), and the 1960s mission in the Congo, ONUC.\nHistory.\nThe modern Tunisian army was formed in 1831 by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud. During the period of the French Protectorate (1881\u20131956) Tunisians were recruited in significant numbers into the French Army, serving as tirailleurs (infantry) and spahis (cavalry). These units saw active service in Europe during both World Wars, as well as in Indo-China prior to 1954. The only exclusively Tunisian military force permitted under French rule was the Beylical Guard.\nFollowing independence.\nOn June 30, 1956, the Tunisian army was officially founded by decree, in the form of a combined-arms regiment. The necessary equipment was made available to the young state from French stocks. The new army initially comprised 25 Tunisian officers, 250 NCOs and 1,250 men transferred from French Army service, plus 850 former members of the Beylical Guard. Approximately 4,000 Tunisian soldiers continued in French Army service until 1958, when the majority transferred to the Tunisian Army, which reached a strength of over 6,000 that year.\nIntakes of conscripts for military service, made mandatory in January 1957, plus the recall of reservists allowed the army to grow to twelve battalions numbering 20,000 men by 1961. Sixty per cent of those troops were deployed for border monitoring and defense duties.\nTunisian units first saw action in 1958 after French intrusions into the south in pursuit of National Liberation Army (Algeria) fighters. In 1960 Tunisian troops served with the United National Peacekeeping Force in the Congo. 1,020 troops from the Tunisian Armed Forces were amongst the first UN troops to arrive in the Congo, by 20 July 1960. In 1961 clashes occurred with French forces based at Bizerte. More than 600 men fell in battle against the French forces. The French evacuated the base after subsequent negotiations with the Tunisian Government.\nThe Tunisian Navy, founded in 1958, received its first ship in the fall of 1959. The Air Force acquired its first combat aircraft in 1960 . While the Tunisian armed forces obtain equipment from several sources, the United States remains the largest single supplier. Officer and specialist training for Tunisian personnel was formerly undertaken in French and American military academies. Tunisian trainees are now gradually being assigned to newly established military schools within the country.\nThe January 10, 1957, a law prohibits any military officer to be a member of a group or a political party. However, after 7 November 1987 when the former Prime Minister, General Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali took power senior officers such as Abdelhamid Escheikh and Mustapha Bouaziz took up ministerial appointments.\nOn 30 April 2002, at around 18.15, the direction of the Army - Brigadier General Abdelaziz Skik who led the Tunisian contingent to Cambodia, two colonels - majors, three colonels, four majors, two lieutenants and a sergeant-major - disappeared in a helicopter crash near the town of Medjez el-Bab.\nTunisia has contributed military forces to United Nations peacekeeping missions, including an army company to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) during the Rwandan genocide. In his book \"Shake Hands with the Devil\", Canadian force commander Rom\u00e9o Dallaire gave the Tunisian soldiers high credit for their skills and effort in the conflict and referred to them as his \"ace in the hole\".\nDuring the 2011 Libyan civil war, Tunisian forces, mostly border guards, saw some limited action when fighting between Libyan rebels and loyalist soldiers spilled over the border.\nThe military and politics.\nThe Library of Congress Country Study says:His exclusive power to promote military officers has been among the strongest components of Bourguiba's control over the armed forces. From independence, high-ranking officers\u2014general staff and senior commanders in particular\u2014have been carefully selected for their party loyalty more than for their professional experience and competence. This began in the late 1950s when the president dismissed those officers who had trained in the Middle East and who might therefore have been expected to sympathize with the militant Pan-Arab policies of Egypt's Nasser. The hand-picked senior officers, in turn, carefully screened all officers who were considered for positions of authority in line units to ensure that antiregime elements did not pose potential threats at any level of the military establishment.\nAs a result of these promotion policies, the Tunisian officer corps took on a very homogeneous character that only began to break down in the 1970s. Senior officers have been generally representative of Tunisia's economically and politically dominant families from the north, the coastal areas, and the major cities. Although military men have been kept from operating major business ventures or holding political office while in uniform, it has been common for family members to be prominent in business or in the Destourian political movement. Generally Western and Francophile in outlook, tied by kinship to the country's upper socioeconomic stratum, and personally familiar with leading figures in the PSD, high-ranking Tunisian officers must be classed as part of the national elite.In 2021, Tunisia boosted the role of military in their fight to curb the pandemic's spread. On Monday 5th, the Tunisian presidency announced that medical and paramedical university graduates of the last three years will be drafted by the army. The intent was to remedy to a shortage of medical staff in public and private hospitals because hundreds of unhappy health professionals have left the country in recent years. Among other decisions, a vaccination campaign will be waged by joint civilian-military teams around the country under the supervision of the army.\nGeneral Staff.\nThe supreme commander of the armed forces is the President of the Republic of Tunisia.\nIn December 2010, the staff is composed as follows: Chief of Staff of the Army corps is the Field Marshall Mohamed el ghoul, one of the Air Force is Brigadier General Taieb Lajimi and that the navy is Rear Admiral Mohamed Khamassi. In April 2011, Ammar became chief of staff inter-armed.\nThe Inspector General of the armed forces is Rear Admiral Tarek Faouzi Larbi, the Director of Military Engineering is Brigadier General Mohammed Hedi Abdelkafi and the director of military security Brigadier General Ahmed Chabir.\nTunisian Army.\nThe Tunisian Army is 80,000 strong and is composed essentially of:\nThe army was also enlisted to help in curbing the spread of Covid in the country in July 2021 when the Tunisian presidency announced that medical and paramedical university graduates of the last three years would be drafted by the army.\nAir Force.\nThe Tunisian Air Force is equipped with 10 Northrop F-5E Tiger II and two Northrop F-5F Tiger II. These form 15 Squadron at Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base. It also includes 12 Aero L-59T, as well as three Aermacchi MB-326K (combat capable) as well as 4 MB-326B, and 3 MB326L. Previously up to 8 Aermacchi MB-326B, 7-16 Aermacchi MB-326KT, and 4 Aermacchi MB-326LT were in service.\nThe IISS Military Balance 2013 lists six Lockheed C-130B Hercules, one Lockheed C-130H Hercules, five G-222s, three Let L-410UVP Turbolet (all assigned to one transport squadron) plus a liaison unit with two S-208A. Other reported transport aircraft include one Boeing 737-700/BBJ, two Dassault Falcon 20, and two Lockheed C-130J-30 Super Hercules.\nReported attack helicopters include four Hughes MD 500 Defenders, and 7-8 SNIAS SA-342 Gazelle.\nReported training/COIN and liaison aircraft include 12 SIAI Marchetti SF.260WC Warriors and 9 SIAI-Marchetti SF-260C, as well as 4 SIAI-Marchetti S.208A/M and one Reims F406.\nApart from Bizerte Sidi-Ahmed, there are military airfields reported at Bizerte (La-Kharouba), Gabes, Gafsa, and Sfax.\nNavy.\nEstablished in 1959, the Marine nationale tunisienne (Tunisian National Navy) initially received French assistance, including advisory personnel and several small patrol vessels. On 22 October 1973, the U.S. Edsall-class destroyer escort was decommissioned in ceremonies at the Quai d'Honneur, Bizerte. Moments later, the ship was commissioned by the Tunisian Navy as the \"President Bourgiba\". In the mid-1980s the force included \"President Bourguiba\", two United States-built coastal minesweepers, and a variety of fast-attack and patrol craft. The most important additions to the fleet in the 1980s were three La Combattante III type fast attack craft armed with Exocet anti-ship missiles. Apart from these vessels, however, most of the fleet's units were old and capable of little more than coastal patrol duties.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s the navy was primarily involved in combating the smuggling of contraband, the illegal entry of un-\ndesirable aliens, and unauthorized emigration as well as other coastal security activities. In these matters the overall effort was shared with agencies of the Ministry of Interior, especially the customs agents and immigration personnel of the Surete Nationale.\n\"President Bourgiba\" suffered a major fire on 16 April 1992 and later left operational service.\nToday the Tunisian Navy reportedly has bases at Bizerte, Kelibia, La Goulette, and Sfax. Formerly reported in service were six Kondor-II class minsweepers of 635 tons, equipped with 3 twin 25mm Guns. However, none were listed in service by the IISS Military Balance 2013. Also formerly in use were MBDA MM-40 Exocet and Nord SS-12M surface-to-surface missiles.\nLanding craft and auxiliary vessels.\nLanding craft and auxiliary vessels include one LCT-3 class LCT, one Robert Conard class 63.7m Survey vessel (NHO Salammbo), one Wilkes class (T-AGS-33) survey ship (NRF Khaireddine), two El Jem class training ships (ex A 5378 Aragosta and A 5381 Polipo delivered by Italian Navy on 17 July 2002), one Simeto class Tanker ( Ain Zaghouin - ex A 5375 delivered by Italian Navy on 10.7.2003) and one White Sumac 40.5m class, one diver training vessel Zarzis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Ministry of Communication Technologies, a cabinet-level governmental agency, is in charge of organizing the sector.\nRadio and television.\nFirst radio service began in 1935 in Tunisia. \nThe government of former President Ben Ali tightly controlled the press and broadcasting. But since the 2011 popular revolt, many journalists have enjoyed new-found freedoms. The number of radio and TV channels and print publications has increased, as has their freedom to report and debate political and social issues. State TV, which had toed the government line, has changed tack, giving airtime to the former opposition.\nPrior to the Tunisian revolution there were four private radio stations operating in Tunisia. In June 2011, following the Tunisian revolution, a recommendation to license twelve new private radio stations was forwarded to the interim Prime Minister. In August 2011 none of the recommendations had been acted upon. However, several stations began broadcasting under time-limited provisional licenses. The stations operate without specific operating rules because a new regulatory framework is not yet in place. In part due to the lack of a regulatory framework the government's National Office of Broadcasting (ONT) requires broadcasters to pay a licensing fee of 120,000 dinars (approximately $75,000), and while that license is not necessary to broadcast, it confers a certain amount of legitimacy that broadcasters need to draw advertisers. The large fee is difficult for new start-up stations and the new stations feel that the fees provide an unfair advantage for the older more established private groups organized under the previous regime.\nInformation and communications technology.\nThe Tunisian government considers information and communications technology (ICT) an important tool to boost the country's economy and to adapt the education system to the opportunities available from using Information Technology (IT) as a tool. E-commerce, e-learning, and e-medicine are all areas of strong interest where the Government is seeking international partnership and investments. During the last 15 years, several important efforts were made to invest in ICT and the Internet. Physical infrastructures were modernised. In July 2004 the World Bank approved a $13 million loan to the Tunisian government to support the government effort in accelerating its ICT reforms. Though, beyond the high priority the government is giving to ICT, development of telecommunications in Tunisia has been slower than expected compared to other developing countries in Middle East and North Africa.\n2005 World Summit on the Information Society.\nThe first World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was held in Geneva in 2003. Tunisia hosted the second World Summit in November 2005. The Tunisian government took the initiative to host the summit in 1998. It was organised by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) under the auspices of UNESCO. A declaration of Principles and Plan of Action were approved in order to bridge the digital gap between developing and developed countries within the World Information Society.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Beginning in the Bayan Har Mountains, the river flows generally eastwards before entering the long Ordos Loop, which runs northeast at Gansu through the Ordos Plateau and turns east in Inner Mongolia. The river then turns sharply southwards to form the border between Shanxi and Shaanxi, turns eastwards at its confluence with the Wei River, and flows across the North China Plain before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The river is named for the yellow color of its water, which comes from the large amount of sediment discharged into the water as the river flows through the Loess Plateau.\nThe Yellow River basin was the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization. According to traditional Chinese historiography, the Xia dynasty originated on its banks around 2100\u00a0BC; Sima Qian's \"Shiji\" (c.\u200991\u00a0BC) record that the Xia were founded after the tribes around the Yellow River united to combat the frequent floods in the area. The river has provided fertile soil for agriculture, but since then has flooded and changed course frequently, with one estimate counting 1,593 floods in the 2,540 years between 595\u00a0BC and 1946\u00a0AD. As such, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing and a curse throughout history, and has been nicknamed both \"China's Pride\" and \"China's Sorrow\".\nThe Yellow River's basin presently has a population of 120 million people, while over 420 million people live in the immediate provinces which rely on it as a water source. The basin comprises 13 percent of China's cultivated land area. The area receives very uneven rainfall, only 2 percent of China's water runoff\u2014water and sediment flow has decreased five-fold since the 1970s, and until recently, the river frequently did not reach the sea. Since 2003, China has been working on the South\u2013North Water Transfer Project to alleviate the strain on the river's water supply.\nEtymology.\nWhen the Yellow River was still somewhat clear, it was simply referred to as 'the river' (, Old Chinese: ). Observations made at the Yumenkou gorge, where the river leaves the modern Loess Plateau, indicated the river changed to muddy sometime between 367\u00a0BC and 165\u00a0AD, according to chronicles' records. The alternative names 'murky river' (, ) and '(muddy) yellow river' (, ) were attested in 145\u00a0BC and in 429\u00a0AD respectively. The name Yellow River fully replaces Murky River by the end of Tang dynasty, for unclear reasons.\nIn the Shaanxi loess plateau, it is referred to as 'river, my lord' (, ) in the Jin language. In Mongolian, it is called (\u0428\u0430\u0440 \u043c\u04e9\u0440\u04e9\u043d 'yellow river') or \"Khatan gol\" (\u0425\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e\u043b 'queen river'). The river is mentioned in the Kul Tigin stele as the 'green river' (Old Turkic: \"ya\u0161\u00efl \u00fcg\u00fcz\", \ud803\udc16\ud803\udc41\ud803\udc1e\ud803\udc3d\ud803\udc3a\ud803\udc0d). The Tibetan name is \"River of the Peacock\" (Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74 \n , Wylie: \"rma.chu\", THL: \"Ma chu\"; ).\nGeology.\nThe Yellow River first formed sometime during the Late Miocene, Pliocene or Pleistocene, as a result of the Tibetan Plateau being uplifted.\nHistory.\nDynamics.\nThe river has long been critical to the development of northern China, and is regarded by scholars as a cradle of civilization. Flooding of the river has also caused much destruction, including multiple floods that have resulted in the deaths of over one million people. Among the deadliest were the 1344 Yellow River Flood, during the Yuan dynasty, the 1887 flood during the Qing dynasty which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a Republic of China era 1931 flood (part of a massive number of floods that year) that killed 1\u20134 million people.\nThe cause of the floods is the large amount of fine-grained loess carried by the river from the Loess Plateau, which is continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel. The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams are unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water needs to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the path of least resistance. When this happens, it bursts out across the flat North China Plain, sometimes taking a new channel and inundating most farmland, cities or towns in its path.\nThe traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher levees along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood, as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as , sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of the Shandong Peninsula and sometimes to the south.\nAnother historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream ice dams in Inner Mongolia with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.\nBefore modern dams appeared in China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding. In the 2,540 years from 595 BC to 1946 AD, the Yellow River has been reckoned to have flooded 1,593 times, shifting its course 26 times noticeably and nine times severely. These floods include some of the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded. Before modern disaster management, when floods occurred, some of the population might initially die from drowning and many more would suffer later from the ensuing famine and spread of diseases.\nAncient times.\nIn Chinese mythology, the giant Kua Fu drained the Yellow River and the Wei River to quench his burning thirst as he pursued the Sun. Historical documents from the Spring and Autumn period and Qin dynasty indicate that the Yellow River at that time flowed considerably north of its present course. These accounts show that after the river passed Luoyang, it flowed along the border between Shanxi and Henan Provinces, then continued along the border between Hebei and Shandong before emptying into Bohai Bay near present-day Tianjin. Another outlet followed essentially the present course.\nThe river left these paths in 602 BC and shifted several hundred kilometers to the east. Sabotage of dikes, canals, and reservoirs and deliberate flooding of rival states became a standard military tactic during the Warring States period. As the Yellow River valley was the major entryway to the Guanzhong area and the state of Qin from the North China Plain, Qin heavily fortified the Hangu Pass; it saw numerous battles and was also an important chokepoint protecting the Han capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. Major flooding in AD 11 is credited with the downfall of the short-lived Xin dynasty, and another flood in AD 70 returned the river north of Shandong on essentially its present course.\nImperial times.\nFrom around the beginning of the 3rd century, the importance of the Hangu Pass was reduced, with the major fortifications and military bases moved upriver to Tongguan. In AD 923, the desperate Later Liang general Duan Ning again broke the dikes, flooding in a failed attempt to protect his realm's capital from the Later Tang. A similar proposal from the Song engineer Li Chun concerning flooding the lower reaches of the river to protect the central plains from the Khitai was overruled in 1020: the Chanyuan Treaty between the two states had explicitly forbidden the Song from establishing new moats or changing river courses.\nBreaches occurred regardless: one at Henglong in 1034 divided the course into three and repeatedly flooded the northern regions of Dezhou and Bozhou. The Song worked for five years futilely attempting to restore the previous course\u00a0\u2013 using over 35,000 employees, 100,000 conscripts, and 220,000 tons of wood and bamboo in a single year\u00a0\u2013 before abandoning the project in 1041. The more sluggish river then occasioned a breach at Shanghu that sent the main outlet north towards Tianjin in 1048.\nIn 1128, Song troops under the Kaifeng governor Du Chong (, \"D\u00f9 Ch\u014dng\", d.1141) breached the southern dikes of the Yellow River in an effort to stop the advancing Jin army. The resulting major river avulsion allowed the Yellow to capture the Si and other tributaries of the Huai River. For the first time in recorded history, the Yellow River shifted completely south of Shandong Peninsula and flowed into the Yellow Sea. By 1194, the mouth of the Huai had been blocked. The buildup of silt deposits was such that even after the Yellow River later shifted its course, the Huai could no longer flow along its historic course, but instead, its water pools into Hongze Lake and then runs southward toward the Yangtze River.\nA flood in 1344 returned the Yellow River south of Shandong. The Yuan dynasty was waning, and the emperor forced enormous teams to build new embankments for the river. The terrible conditions helped to fuel rebellions that led to the founding of the Ming dynasty. The course changed again in 1391 when the river flooded from Kaifeng to Fengyang in Anhui. It was finally stabilized by the eunuch Li Xing during the public works projects following the 1494 flood. The river flooded many times in the 16th century, including in 1526, 1534, 1558, and 1587. Each flood affected the river's lower course. The 1642 flood was man-made, caused by the attempt of the Ming governor of Kaifeng to use the river to destroy the peasant rebels under Li Zicheng who had been besieging the city for the past six months. He directed his men to break the dikes in an attempt to flood the rebels, but destroyed his own city instead: the flood and the ensuing famine and plague are estimated to have killed 300,000 of the city's previous population of 378,000. The once-prosperous city was nearly abandoned until its rebuilding under the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty.\nThe question of how aggressively flooding should be controlled, and whether it should be steered back to its original channels when it migrated, was a topic of controversy in the imperial court. Rival cliques made arguments based on budgetary, technical and strategic criteria. Geographer Charles Greer identifies two competing schools of thought on how to control the Yellow River. One, which he identifies as Confucian, advocated containing the river between higher levees, thus maximizing the amount of river basin land that could be cultivated. The other, which he associates with Taoism, favored lower levees separated by as much as 5\u201310 kilometers. In one particular long-running debate during the 11th century reigns of the Renzong and Shenzong emperors, when the river repeatedly broke its levees and migrated north and west, officials battled over whether expensive measures should be taken to return the river to its former channels. The Shenzong emperor ultimately decreed that the river be allowed to remain in its new course.\nTraditional flood control techniques made use of levees, revetments to absorb the energy of the water, overflow basins, drainage canals and polders. Treatises on traditional flood control techniques were written by officials such as Pan Jixun, who argued that joining branches of the river increased the water's power and this in turn increased its ability to flush sediment. The difficult situation around the confluence of the Yellow River, the Huai, and the Grand Canal, however, still led to a major flood of the regional center Sizhou and Pan's dismissal from court. Subsequently, the river's 1680 flood entirely submerged Sizhou and the nearby Mausoleum to Ming Ancestors beneath Hongze Lake for centuries until modern irrigation and flood control lowered the water level enough to permit their excavation and the tombs' restoration starting from the 1970s.\nRecent times.\nBetween 1851 and 1855, the Yellow River returned to the north amid the floods that provoked the Nien and Taiping Rebellions. The 1887 flood has been estimated to have killed between 900,000 and 2 million people, and is the second-worst natural disaster in history (excluding famines and epidemics). The Yellow River more or less adopted its present course during the 1897 flood.\nThe 1931 flood killed an estimated 1,000,000 to 4,000,000, and is the worst recorded flood in terms of number of fatalities.\nOn 9 June 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Nationalist troops under Chiang Kai-shek broke the levees holding back the river near the village of Huayuankou in Henan, causing what has been called by Canadian historian, Diana Lary, a \"war-induced natural disaster\". The goal of the operation was to stop the advancing Japanese troops by following a strategy of \"using water as a substitute for soldiers\". The 1938 flood of an area covering took some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. The flood prevented the Japanese Army from taking Zhengzhou, on the southern bank of the Yellow River, but did not stop them from reaching their goal of capturing Wuhan, which was the temporary seat of the Chinese government and straddles the Yangtze River.\nIn 1954, the People's Republic of China announced its General Plan to Fundamentally Control Yellow River Flood Disasters and Develop Yellow River Waterworks. It sought to address both flooding risks and to convert rainfall-fed fields of the North China Plain to irrigated agriculture.114 Construction began in earnest in 1957.114\nFrom the 1970s to the 1990s, the dry-up trends accelerated, with the Yellow River failing to reach its mouth for an average of approximately 180 days per year in the 1990s.168 In 1997, the Yellow River did not reach the sea for 226 consecutive days.168\nOn 12 August 2024, according to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee of the Ministry of Water Resources, since the implementation of unified water flow regulation for the entire river in 1999, the Yellow River has achieved continuous flow for 25 consecutive years as of August 12. Over the past 25 years, the main stream of the Yellow River has supplied a total of more than 543.6 billion cubic meters of water, with a total of 1.464 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment. The number of bird species in the estuarine wetlands and protected areas has increased to 373, and the wetland ecosystem has undergone a positive restoration.\nGeography.\nThe Yellow River basin has an east\u2013west extent of about and a north\u2013south extent of about . Its total drainage area is about .\nAccording to the China Exploration and Research Society, the source of the Yellow River is at in the Bayan Har Mountains near the eastern edge of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The source tributaries drain into Gyaring Lake and Ngoring Lake on the western edge of Golog Prefecture high in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with Gansu, the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"Ordos Loop\", and then flows generally eastward across the North China Plain to the Gulf of Bohai, draining a basin of which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.\nThe Yellow River passes through seven present-day provinces and two autonomous regions, namely (from west to east) Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Wuhai, Baotou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at Kenli County, Shandong.\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the mountainous Tibetan Plateau, the Ordos Loop and Loess Plateau, and the North China Plain. However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided. This article mainly adopts the division used by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.\nThe Yellow River derived sediments have been transported out of the Bohai Sea, all way to the North Yellow Sea and South Yellow Sea, and formed a Distal Depocenter around the Shandong Peninsula.\nUpper reaches.\nThe upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town (Togtoh County), Inner Mongolia just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of and total basin area of , 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops , with an average grade of 0.10%.\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the Bayan Har Mountains, and the Anemaqen (Amne Machin) Mountains in Qinghai. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7\u00a0billion and 10.8\u00a0billion m3 (166 and 381 billion ft3), respectively. At elevations over above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide. A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve, to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the Yangtze, and the Mekong.\nFlowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters Maqu County in Gansu. Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the Zoig\u00ea Wetlands and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and Zoig\u00ea County in Sichuan. Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at Xinghai.\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the Longyang, Jishi, Liujia, Bapan, and Qingtong gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for hydroelectric plants. The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge. Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of Lanzhou is built upon the Yellow River's banks. The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into Ningxia before the Qingtong Gorge.\nAfter emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast alluvial plains, the Yinchuan Plain and Hetao Plain. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly deserts and grasslands, with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of and width of . It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.\nMiddle reaches.\nThe Ordos Loop formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at Zhongning County in Ningxia and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the Wei at Tongguan in Shaanxi. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from Hekou in Togtoh County, Inner Mongolia, to Zhengzhou, Henan. The middle reaches are long, with a basin area of , 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of , an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\nThe middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the Loess Plateau, where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91\u00a0billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920\u00a0kg/m3 (57.4\u00a0lb/ft3). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the river bed and creating the famous \"river above ground\". From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous Hukou Waterfall is in the lower part of this valley on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi.\nLower reaches.\nIn the lower reaches, from Zhengzhou to its mouth, a distance of , the river is confined to a levee-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the North China Plain before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The basin area in this stage is only , a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the Huai River, whereas those to the north drain into the Hai River. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River. The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is , with an average grade of 0.012%.\nThe silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. That is why this part of the river is called the 'Earth Suspended River'. At Kaifeng, Henan, the Yellow River is above the ground level.\nTributaries.\nTributaries of the Yellow River listed from its source to its mouth include:\nThe lower reaches of the Yellow River have no tributaries.168\nCharacteristics.\nThe Yellow River is notable for the large amount of silt it carries\u20141.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the Loess Plateau. If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year. One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter, as opposed to 10 for the Colorado and 1 for the Nile.\nIts average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural irrigation, increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated of land. The Yellow River delta totals . However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.\nThe highest volume occurs during the rainy season from July to October, when 60% of the annual volume of the river flows. Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed South\u2013North Water Transfer Project involves several schemes to divert water from the Yangtze: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the Han River, and a third using the route of the old Grand Canal.\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a depositing stream\u00a0\u2013 that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between natural levees in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.\nHydroelectric power dams.\nBelow is an incomplete list of hydroelectric power stations built on the Yellow River, arranged according to the first year of operation (in brackets):\nAs reported in 2000, the 7 largest hydro power plants (Longyangxia, Lijiaxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, Bapanxia, Daxia and Qinglongxia) had the total installed capacity of 5,618 MW.\nCrossings.\nThe main bridges and ferries by the province names in the order of downstream to upstream are:\nShandong\nShandong\u2013Henan\nHenan\nShanxi\u2013Henan\nShaanxi\u2013Henan\nNingxia\nInner Mongolia\nGansu\nQinghai\nFauna.\nFish.\nThe Yellow River basin is rich in fish, being the home of more than 160 native species in 92 genera and 28 families, including 19 species found nowhere else in the world (endemic). However, due to habitat loss, pollution, introduced species and overfishing many of the natives have declined or disappeared entirely; several are recognized as threatened on China's Red List. Dams and their reservoirs have increased the habitat for species of slow-moving and static waters, while it excluded species of flowing waters and prevented the up- and down-stream breeding migration of others. In the 2000s, only 80 native fish in 63 genera and 18 families were recorded in the Yellow River basin. In contrast, introduced fish have risen in both abundance and number of species; only one introduced fish species was recorded in the 1960s when ichthyologist Li Sizhong published his original survey of fish fauna of the region, but by the 2000s there were 26.\nAs typical of Asian rivers, Cyprinidae is by far the most diverse family in the Yellow River basin. More than 85 cyprinids have been recorded in this basin, including species that still are present and species that no longer are present. Other highly diverse families are the stone loaches (more than 20 species), gobies (c. 15 species), true loaches (c. 10 species) and bagrid catfish (c. 10 species). Although there are species found throughout much of the river, several have a more restricted range. For example, the uppermost, highest parts on the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau has relatively few native species, notably snowtrout and allies (\"Gymnocypris\", \"Gymnodiptychus\", \"Platypharodon\" and \"Schizopygopsis\"), and \"Triplophysa\" loaches. Of the 18 endemics in the Yellow River basin, 12 are (or were) found in the upper part. These in particular have become threatened and the fish fauna in many headwaters are now dominated by introduced salmonids. In contrast, the lowermost part of the river and its delta are home to many brackish water or euryhaline species, like gobies (although there are also true freshwater gobies in the Yellow River), Asian seabasses, flatfish and \"Takifugu\" pufferfish.\nFishing remains an important activity, but catches have declined. In 2007, it was noted that 40% fewer fish were caught in the Yellow River compared to earlier catches. Large cyprinids (Asian carp, predatory carp, Wuchang bream and Mongolian redfin) and large catfish (Amur and Lanzhou catfish) are still present, but the largest species, the Chinese paddlefish, kaluga sturgeon and Yangtze sturgeon, have not been reported from the Yellow River basin in about 50 years. Other species that support important fisheries include white Amur bream, ayu, mandarin fish, \"Protosalanx\" icefish, northern snakehead, Asian swamp eel and others.\nAn annual fishing ban has been implemented since 2018, covering the entire Yellow River basin from 1 April to 30 June each year. A total ban of fishing of natural fishes is being implemented in the upper reaches of the Yellow River starting 1 April 2022, covering Qinghai, Sichuan and Gansu provinces, until the end of 2025. For the rest of the basin, the annual ban is extended to a period from 1 April to 31 July.\nAquaculture.\nThe Yellow River is generally less suitable for aquaculture than the rivers of central and southern China, such as the Yangtze or Pearl rivers, but aquaculture is also practiced in some areas along the Yellow River. An important aquaculture area is the riverside plain in Xingyang, upstream from Zhengzhou. Since the development of fish ponds started in Xingyang's riverside Wangcun Town in 1986, the pond systems in Wangcun have grown to the total size of 15,000 \"mu\" (10\u00a0km2), making the town the largest aquaculture center in north China.\nTwo turtle species are native to the Yellow River basin: the Chinese pond turtle and Chinese softshell turtle. Both species\u2014but especially the softshell\u2014are widely farmed for food. A variety of the Chinese softshell turtle popular in Chinese gourmets is called the Yellow River turtle (). Nowadays most of the Yellow River turtles eaten in China's restaurants comes from turtle farms, which may or may not be near the Yellow River.\nIn 2007, construction started in Wangcun, Henan on a large farm for raising this turtle variety. With the capacity for raising 5 million turtles a year, the facility was expected to become Henan's largest farm of this kind.\nThe huge, entirely aquatic Chinese giant salamander, a species that has declined drastically due primarily to persecution for food and traditional medicine, is native to the Yellow River and other Chinese rivers. It is farmed in large numbers in several parts of China and genetic studies have revealed that the captive stock mostly is of Yellow River origin. As these often are released back into the wild, the Yellow River type of the Chinese giant salamander has spread to other parts of China, which represents a problem to the other types.\nFlora.\nVegetation changes.\nIn abandoned parts of the river delta, woody plant encroachment leads to a decline in herbaceous plant diversity, altering soil characteristics, and potentially impacting the ecological balance and functioning of these wetland ecosystems.\nPollution.\nOn 25 November 2008, Tania Branigan of \"The Guardian\" filed a report \"China's Mother River: the Yellow River\", claiming that severe pollution has made one-third of China's Yellow River unusable even for agricultural or industrial use, due to factory discharges and sewage from fast-expanding cities. After reaching the first major city, Xining, the river is heavily polluted. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission had surveyed more than of the river in 2007 and said 33.8% of the river system registered worse than \"level five\" according to the criteria used by the UN Environment Program. Level five is unfit for drinking, aquaculture, industrial use, or even agriculture. The report said waste and sewage discharged into the system last year totaled 4.29b tons. Industry and manufacturing made up 70% of the discharge into the river with households accounting for 23% and just over 6% coming from other sources.\nIn culture.\nA traditional belief was that the Yellow River flowed from Heaven as a continuation of the Milky Way. In a Chinese legend, Zhang Qian is said to have been commissioned to find the source of the Yellow River. After sailing up-river for many days, he saw a girl spinning and a cow herd. Upon asking the girl where he was, she presented him with her shuttle with instructions to show it to the astrologer Yan Junping (\u56b4\u541b\u5e73). When he returned, the astrologer recognized it as the shuttle of the Weaving Girl (Vega), and, moreover, said that at the time Zhang received the shuttle, he had seen a wandering star interpose itself between the Weaving Girl and the cow herd (Altair).\nThe provinces of Hebei and Henan derive their names from the Yellow River. Their names mean, respectively, \"North of the River\" and \"South of the River\", although the border between them historically has never been stable, and currently the border between Hebei and Henan is not the Yellow River, but the Zhang River instead.\nTraditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated in the Yellow River basin. The Chinese refer to the river as \"the Mother River\" and \"the cradle of the Chinese civilization\".\nDuring the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both \"China's Pride\" and \"China's Sorrow\". In the twentieth-century, the river became a symbol of the rising Chinese nation in the face of Western and Japanese imperialism.\nDespite the Yellow River having a central role in the development of Chinese civilization on the North China Plain, flooding and constant rerouting of the river has also caused many great disasters to populations along the river, hence it is also known as a River of disaster (). The management of the Yellow River has been a great political trouble to various Chinese dynasties throughout history.\nSometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the \"Muddy Flow\" (). The Chinese idiom \"when the Yellow River flows clear\" is used to refer to an event that will never happen and is similar to the English expression \"when pigs fly\".\n\"The Yellow River running clear\" was reported as a good omen during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, along with the appearance of such auspicious legendary beasts as \"qilin\" (an African giraffe brought to China by a Bengal embassy aboard Zheng He's ships in 1414) and \"zouyu\" (not positively identified) and other strange natural phenomena.\nTourism.\nThe Yellow River has several major tourist attractions such as the http:// in Qinghai, the Bingling Grottoes at Liujiaxia Dam and the Yellow River Stone Forest in Gansu, and the Hukou Waterfall in Shanxi. \nThe river was first travelled in its entirety by https://. There have been successful https://, although there some sections of the upper reaches the river where the bank is inaccessible.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The northeastern extension of the Yellow Sea is called the Korea Bay, into which flow the Yalu River, the Chongchon River and the Taedong River.\nGeography.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Yellow Sea (\"Hwang Hai\") as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Yellow Sea is separated from the Sea of Japan by the boundary from the southern end of Haenam Peninsula in Jeollanamdo to Jeju Island and divided into the East China Sea by the boundary from the west end of Jeju Island to the Yangtze River estuary.\nPhysiography.\nThe Yellow Sea, excluding the Bohai, extends by about from north to south and about from east to west; it has an area of approximately and a volume of about . Its depth is only on average, with a maximum of . The sea is a flooded section of continental shelf that formed after the last glacial period (some 10,000 years ago) as sea levels rose to their current levels. The depth gradually increases from north to south. The sea bottom and shores are dominated by sand and silt brought by the rivers through the Bohai Sea (Liao River, Yellow River, Hai He) and the Korea Bay (Yalu River). These deposits, together with sand storms are responsible for the yellowish colour of the water referenced in the sea's name. The sea annually receives so much sand and silt from rivers such as the Yellow River, that it turns into a golden-yellow colour.\nThe seas surrounding Korea, which occupy a corner of Northeast Asia, border the \"island nation\" from the east, south, and west. Korea has named these the East Sea, South Sea, and West Sea (officially known as the Yellow Sea), respectively.\nMajor islands of the sea include Anmado, Baengnyeongdo, Daebudo, Deokjeokdo, Gageodo, Ganghwado, Hauido, Heuksando, Hongdo, Jejudo, Jindo, Muuido, Sido, Silmido, Sindo, Wando, Yeongjongdo and Yeonpyeongdo (all in South Korea).\nClimate and hydrology.\nThe area has cold, dry winters with strong northernly monsoons blowing from late November to March. Average January temperatures are in the north and in the south. Summers are wet and warm with frequent typhoons between June and October. Air temperatures range between . The average annual precipitation increases from about in the north to in the south. Fog is frequent along the coasts, especially in the upwelling cold-water areas.\nThe sea has a warm cyclone current, forming part of the Kuroshio Current, which diverges near the western part of Japan and flows northward into the Yellow Sea at a speed of less than . Southward currents prevail near the sea coast, especially in the winter monsoon period.\nThe water temperature is close to freezing in the northern part in winter, so drift ice patches and continuous ice fields form and hinder navigation between November and March. The water temperature and salinity are homogeneous across the depth. The southern waters are warmer at . In spring and summer, the upper layer is warmed up by the sun and diluted by the fresh water from rivers, while the deeper water remains cold and saline. This deep water stagnates and slowly moves south. Commercial bottom-dwelling fishes are found around this mass of water, especially at its southern part. Summer temperatures range between . The average salinity is relatively low, at 30\u2030 in the north to 33\u201334\u2030 in the south, dropping to 26\u2030 or lower near the river deltas. In the southwest monsoon season (June to August) the increased rainfall and runoff further reduce the salinity of the upper sea layer. Water transparency increases from about in the north up to in the south.\nTides are semidiurnal, i.e. rise twice a day. Their amplitude varies between about at the coast of China. Tides are higher at the Korean Peninsula, typically ranging between and reaching the maximum in spring. The tidal system rotates in a counterclockwise direction. The speed of the tidal current is generally less than in the middle of the sea, but may increase to more than near the coasts. The fastest tides reaching occur in the Myeongnyang Strait between Jindo Island and the Korean Peninsula.\nThe tide-related sea level variations result in a land pass long and wide opening for approximately an hour between Jindo and Modo islands. The event occurs about twice a year, at the beginning of May and in the middle of June. It had long been celebrated in a local festival called \"Jindo Sea Parting Festival\", but was largely unknown to the outside world until 1975, when the French ambassador Pierre Randi described the phenomenon in a French newspaper.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe sea is rich in seaweed (predominantly kelp, \"Laminaria japonica\"), cephalopods, crustaceans, shellfish, clams, and especially in blue-green algae which bloom in summer and contribute to the water color (see image above). For example, the seaweed production in the area was as high as 1.5 million tonnes in 1979 for China alone. The abundance of all these plant and animal species increases toward the south and indicates a high sea productivity, accounting for the diversity of fish species and high fish yield from the sea. Several species of goby new to science have been discovered recently in the Yellow Sea.\nThe southern part of the Yellow Sea, including the entire west coast of Korea, contains a belt of intertidal mudflats, which has the total area of and is maintained by . Those flats consist of highly productive sediments with a rich benthic fauna and are of great importance for migratory waders and shorebirds. Surveys show that the area is the single most important site for migratory birds on northward migration in the entire East Asian \u2013 Australasian Flyway, with more than 35 species occurring in internationally significant numbers. Two million birds, at minimum, pass through at the time, and about half that number use it on southward migration. About 300,000 migrating birds were transiting annually only through the Saemangeum tidal flat area. This estuary was however dammed by South Korea in 1991\u20132006 that resulted in drying off the land. Land reclamation also took 65% of the intertidal area (of China, North Korea and South Korea) between the 1950s and 2002, and as of 2005 there were plans to reclaim a further 45%.\nPopulations of oceanic megafauna, such as marine mammals, sea turtles, and larger fish, have decreased in modern times, not only due to pollution but also due to hunting. Japanese industrial whaling and illegal mass operations by the Soviet Union with support from Japan have been major drivers of population decline. Species that reside in the area today include spotted seals, and cetaceans such as minke whales, killer whales, false killer whales, and finless porpoises, but nonetheless all the remnants of species listed could be in very small numbers. Historically, large whales were abundant either for summering and wintering in the Yellow and Bohai Seas. For example, a unique population of resident fin whales and gray whales were historically presented, or possibly hosted some North Pacific right whales and Humpback whales (3 whales including a cow calf pair was observed at Changhai County in 2015) year-round other than migrating individuals, and many other migratory species such as Baird's beaked whales.\nEven blue whales, Japanese sea lions, dugongs (in southern regions only), and leatherback turtles used to breed or migrate into Yellow and Bohai seas.\nSpotted seals are the only resident species of seal in the Yellow Sea. A sanctuary for these seals is situated at Baengnyeongdo, which is also known for its finless porpoises. Great white sharks have also been known to prey on seals in the area.\nEconomy.\nThe coasts of the Yellow Sea are very densely populated, at approximately . The sea waters had been used for fishing by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese ships for centuries. The bottom layers are especially rich in fish with about 200 fish species exploited commercially, especially sea bream, croakers, lizard fishes, prawns, cutlassfish, horse mackerel, squid, eel, filefish, Pacific herring, chub mackerel, flounder and jellyfish. The intensity of fishing has been gradually increasing for China and Korea and decreasing for Japan. For example, the production volumes for China rose from 619,000 tonnes in 1985 to 1,984,400 tonnes in 1996. All species are overfished, however, and while the total catchments are rising, the fish population is continuously declining for most species.\nNavigation is another traditional activity in the Yellow Sea. The main Chinese ports are Dalian, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Tangshan and Qinhuangdao. The major South Korean ports on the Yellow Sea are Incheon, Gunsan and Mokpo, and that for North Korea is Nampho, the outport of Pyongyang. The Bohai Train Ferry provides a shortcut between the Liaodong Peninsula and Shandong. A major naval accident occurred on 24 November 1999 at Yantai, Shandong, China when the 9,000-ton Chinese ferry \"Dashun\" caught fire and capsized in rough seas. About 300 people were killed, making it the worst maritime incident in China.\nOil exploration has been successful in the Chinese and North Korean portions of the sea, with the proven and estimated reserves of about 9 and 20 billion tonnes, respectively. However, the study and exploration of the sea is somewhat hindered by insufficient sharing of information between the involved countries. China initiated collaborations with foreign oil companies in 1979, but this initiative declined later.\nA major oil spill occurred on 16 July 2010 when a pipeline exploded at the north-east port of Dalian, causing a wide-scale fire and spreading about 1,500 tonnes of oil over the sea area of . The port had been closed and fishing suspended until the end of August. Eight hundred fishing boats and 40 specialized vessels were mobilized to relieve the environmental damage.\nState of the environment.\nThe Yellow Sea is considered among the most degraded marine areas on earth. Loss of natural coastal habitats due to land reclamation has resulted in the destruction of more than 60% of tidal wetlands around the Yellow Sea coastline in approximately 50 years. Rapid coastal development for agriculture, aquaculture and industrial development are considered the primary drivers of coastal destruction in the region. This degree of loss of area, widespread pollution, algal blooms and declines of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna have resulted in the classification of this ecosystem as endangered.\nIn addition to land reclamation, the Yellow Sea ecosystem is facing several other serious environmental problems. Pollution is widespread and deterioration of pelagic and benthic habitat quality has occurred, and harmful algal blooms frequently occur. Invasion of introduced species are having a detrimental effect on the Yellow Sea environment. There are 25 intentionally introduced species and 9 unintentionally introduced species in the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem. Declines of biodiversity, fisheries and ecosystem services in the Yellow Sea are widespread.\nThe tidal flats of the Yellow Sea are considered endangered.\nLocation of Korean Peace Zones.\nOn 1 November 2018, officials from South Korea's Ministry of National Defense confirmed that \"peace zones\" had been established by the North and South Korean militaries in the Yellow Sea area that touches the North and South Korean demarcation line. A buffer zone was also created in the Yellow Sea's Northern Limit Line (NLL).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a direct-administered municipality on the shore of the Bohai Sea making it separate from the surrounding Hebei province. It is one of the nine national central cities, with a total population of 13,866,009 inhabitants at the time of the 2020 Chinese census. Its metropolitan area, which is made up of 12 central districts (other than Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 11,165,706 inhabitants in 2015 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.\nTianjin is governed as one of the four municipalities (alongside Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing) under the direct administration of the State Council of China. However, it is the only municipality with a population of less than 20 million. The city borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in Northern China and part of the Jing-Jin-Ji megapolis.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the seventh largest city in China. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion, the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time, European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, some of which are preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and the 1976 Tangshan earthquake; however, it has been recovering since the 1990s. Tianjin is classified as the largest type of port city, a Large-Port Megacity, due to its large urban population and port traffic volume.\nTianjin is currently a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the older part of the city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal, and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the older part of the city on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan and the city is considered to be one of the world's top 100 cities, including in the Global Financial Centres Index. As of 2024, Tianjin was ranked as a Beta+ (global second tier) city together with Barcelona and Rome by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. In 2025, Tianjin held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.\nTianjin is ranked as the 15th leading city in the world with the highest scientific research outputs and second in the North China region after Beijing. The municipality is also home to multiple institutes of higher education in Northern China, including Tianjin, Nankai, Tianjin Normal, Tianjin Medical, Tianjin Foreign Studies, Tiangong, Tianjin University of Science &amp; Technology, Tianjin University of Technology, and Hebei University of Technology.\nName.\n\"Tianjin\" is the pinyin spelling of the Chinese characters . The name literally means 'the ford of the emperor'. The origin of the name is disputed. One traditional theory says that it was an homage to the Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (). Another says that it honors the former name of the Girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name \"Tianjin\" in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third says that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common theory says that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew, the Jianwen Emperor.\nPrior to the introduction of pinyin, the city's name was historically romanized as in the Chinese postal romanization. The current English spelling of Tianjin was adopted in 1958, after pinyin was introduced by the PRC government. Several countries, international organizations and media outlets have adopted the pinyin name since 1979. The Government of the Republic of China (ROC) has continued to use the postal and Wade\u2013Giles spelling since the adoption of pinyin by the ROC government in 2009.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe land where Tianjin is now located was created in between 900 and 1300 CE by the sediments of rivers entering the sea at the Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in the area at one time. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin, as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin began to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gained importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty; it was a center of commerce by the 17th century.\nQing dynasty.\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Tianjin Prefecture, or \"Zhou\" (), was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later, it became an urban prefecture or \"Fu\" (), before becoming a relay station () under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\nOpening up as a treaty port.\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded \"The Arrow\", a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong that flew the British flag and which was suspected of piracy, smuggling, and involvement in the opium trade. The soldiers captured twelve men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin was signed, which opened Tianjin (Tientsin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, so Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and some countries without Chinese concessions, such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left architectural reminders of their rule, which include churches and thousands of villas.\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one violent incident was that of the Tianjin Church Massacre. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (translated as Church Our Lady's Victories) in Tianjin, which built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of kidnapping and brainwashing Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a conflict at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate, killing eighteen foreigners, including ten French nuns, the French consul, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885, Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy () for Chinese army officers with German advisors as a part of his military reforms. The academy's founding was supported by the Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve the Anhui Army and the Green Standard Army officers. The instructors were German officers. In 1887, the academy started a program to train teenagers to become army officers; the program continued for five years. Practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese literature, mathematics, and history were taught at the school and exams were administered to students. The lessons taught at the Tianjin Military Academy were copied for the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. A maritime defense fund supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was located in the same area as the Tianjin Naval Academy. In 1886, the Tianjin Military Academy adopted \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" as part of its curriculum. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui; its staff included Yinchang.\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of parts of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang; they were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tianjin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, which was composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russia, Britain, Japan, Germany, France, America, Austro-Hungary, and Italy). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902, when the city was returned to Qing control. Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained their forces using strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured as prisoners of war by Allied Forces; meanwhile, in 1918, the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, minus one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the development of industry, commerce and finance in the city, Tianjin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tianjin was the provincial capital of Hebei; afterwards, it was reestablished as an independent municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II, during which he was the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, served in Tianjin in the 1920s as the Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew the infantry unit in 1938, but the nation's presence was maintained by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\nSecond Sino-Japanese War.\nOn July 30, 1937, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Tianjin fell to Japan, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese generally respected foreign concessions until 1941, when American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, the Tientsin Incident damaged Anglo-Japanese relations. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded a British concession due to the refusal of British authorities to transfer six Chinese people, who had assassinated a Japanese collaborator and taken refuge in the British concession, to be under Japan's authority. For a time, the events of 1939 appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the Japanese Army mistreating British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in British newspapers. The situation ended when British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the situation in Europe, it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese people, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941, the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before it left, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession, following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded the concession to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\nAfter World War II.\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and the city's industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province, the capital of which was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, hindering Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to preparation and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated its provincial capital to Baoding, and the CCP Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so. In April 1970, since the central government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project using the name of the channel and by build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties, including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe, were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by shock waves and experienced a loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River; it is now used to supply water for Beijing; however; the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty with water usage in the city. As a result, during 1976, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water usage in Tianjin by attracting individuals to the city's academic centers.\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop. However, the overall speed of development in Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area, with the Tianjin Port as its core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CCP Central Committee convened; its meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening of the Binhai New Area into its Eleventh Five-Year Plan and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an ecological city.\" Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area were announced; they stated the following: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\"\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, which has a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, was opened. In August 2008, Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin; it is now held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event for the first time by hosting the East Asian Games. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy; Tianjin was positioned as the National Advanced Manufacturing R&amp;D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area. In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, so water availability in Tianjin increased. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was also formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors.\nOn August 12, 2015, a fire and explosion occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.The cost to businesses caused by the explosion was estimated to be $9 billion, making it the most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\nIn 2025, Tianjin held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit.\nGeography.\nTianjin is located on the west coast of the Bohai Gulf; the provinces of Shandong and Liaoning are located across those waters. The city is bordered by Beijing, which is to the northwest. Tianjin is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border, which is the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N and a longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area of the city is .\nThe city has of coastline and of land border. It is located at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers. The municipality is generally flat and is swampy near the coast; however, it has hills in the north, where the Yan Mountains enter Tianjin. Tidal flats occur on the coastal plain adjacent to the city. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak () in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei; the mountain has an altitude of .\nIn the Tianjin Municipality, the Hai River forms at the confluence of the Ziya River (), (), Yongding River, , and South Grand Canal; it enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality as well as in Tanggu District. Reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the south (in Dagang District) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the north in Ji County.\nClimate.\nTianjin has a semi-arid climate (using the K\u00f6ppen system, the city has a \"BSk\" climate bordering on \"Dwa\" and \"Cwa\"). As in other areas of East Asia, the city has a four-season, monsoon-influenced climate; it also has cold, windy, and dry winters due to the Siberian anticyclone and hot, humid summers due to the monsoon season. Spring in the city is dry and windy; the season sometimes consists of sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, which are capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, with an annual mean of . Extreme temperatures in the city at the main weather station in Xiqing District have ranged from to . With the monthly percentage of the possible amount of sunshine ranging from 45% in July to 61% in March and April, the city receives 2,460 hours of sunshine annually. Having an annual total precipitation of , with nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid climate zone, although parts of the municipality are humid continental (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\"/\"Dwa\", respectively).\nMeasures to improve air quality.\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several methods to restrict pollution on days when is severe, such as by halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n In the past, flights have also been grounded and highways have been closed.\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\nAdministrative divisions.\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\nThe Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but has rights similar to those of a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin was 15.57 million.http://\nAs of December 31, 2004, these districts and counties have been further subdivided into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\nThe \"Haibe Industrial Heritage Corridor\" is an urban regeneration project that integrates several decommissioned factory sites along the Haibe River. It transforms these historical structures into interconnected public spaces, art galleries, and design studios, creating a linear landscape that narrates Tianjin's industrial past.\nPolitics.\nLike all governing institutions in mainland China, Tianjin has a parallel party-government system, in which the CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee Secretary outranks the Mayor. The CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and has control over the Tianjin Municipal People's Government.\nEconomy.\nIndustries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking. EADS Airbus is one of the manufacturers in the city, and has opened an assembly plant for its Airbus A320 series airliners; the plant has been operational since 2009. As of 2010, the fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-1A, has been located at the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin. The city's GDP in 2009 was \u00a5750.1 billion, with a GDP per capita of RMB \u00a562,403.\nTianjin Economic-Technological Development Area.\nAs one of the first state-level economic and technological development zones, the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) was founded on December 6, 1984, with the approval of the State Council. It is given state preferential policies with the task of attracting domestic and foreign investment to develop new technology-oriented modern industries. As an affiliated organization of the Tianjin Municipal Government, the Administrative Commission of Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area exercises unified administration of TEDA on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal Government and has provincial-level administrative and economic management rights.\nTianjin Export Processing Zone.\nThe Tianjin Export Processing Zone is one of the first 15 export processing zones approved by the State Council, having been approved on April 27, 2000. This area is a special enclosed zone. where Customs officials conduct constant administration for commodities transported into and out of the zone. The central government granted the special economic zone preferential policies to attract enterprises in the business of processing and trade to invest in the zone. The Tianjin Export Processing Zone is located to the northeast of TEDA and has a planned area of . The area developed in the first phase is wide. A permanent wall is built to separate the export processing and non-export processing zones.\nTianjin Airport Economic Area.\nThe Tianjin Airport International Logistics Zone is jointly invested by the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone and Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It is located inside the airfreight area of Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It has domestic and foreign airfreight logistics enterprises engaged in sorting, warehousing, distribution, processing, and exhibition. It is in the process of constructing the largest airfreight base in northern China.\nTianjin Port Free Trade Zone.\nThe Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone is the only free trade zone in northern China. The zone was approved for establishment in 1991 by State Council. It is from Tianjin city proper, less than away from the wharf, and away from Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\nTianjin Tanggu National Marine High-Tech Development Area.\nThe Tianjin Tanggu Marine High-Tech Development Area was established in 1992 and was upgraded to the national-level high-tech development area by the State Council in 1995. It is the only national-level high-tech development area specializing in developing the marine technology industry. By the end of 2008, the zone had 2,068 corporations and 5 industries there, including those for new materials, oil manufacturing, modern machinery manufacturing, and electronic information.\nTianjin Nangang Industrial Zone.\nThe Tianjin Nangang Industrial Zone is a heavy and chemical industry base and harbor, a part of the\"dual-city, dual-harbor\" space development strategy of Tianjin, and a zone with a circular economy. The total planned area of Nangang Industrial Zone is , of which the terrestrial area is .\nAgriculture.\nFarmland takes up about 40% of Tianjin Municipality's total area. Wheat, rice, and maize are the most economically important crops.\nResources.\n Geothermal energy is another resource of Tianjin. Deposits of manganese and boron under Tianjin were the first to be found in China.\nUtilities and services.\nhttps:// constructs, delivers and maintains electrical power services.\nBinhai New Area.\nThe Tianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is located at the juncture of the Beijing-Tianjin City Belt and the Circum-Bohai City Belt. It is the gateway to North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Lying in the center of Northeast Asia, it is the nearest point of departure of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the end of 2009, the population of Tianjin Municipality was 12.28\u00a0million, of which 9.8\u00a0million owned and lived in Tianjin \"hukou\" (permanent residences). Among permanent residents of Tianjin, 5.99\u00a0million lived in urban areas, while 3.81\u00a0million lived in rural ones. Tianjin has recently shifted to population growth; its population had reached 14.72 million as of the end of 2013.\nThe encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010[ [update]], a population of 15.4 million.\nThe majority of Tianjin residents are Han Chinese. People from 51 out of the 55 minor Chinese ethnic groups live in Tianjin. Minorities with higher populations in the city include Hui, Korean, Manchu, and Mongol people.\nThe graph above excludes members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\nMedia.\nTianjin People's Broadcasting Station is a radio station in Tianjin. Broadcasting for nine channels, it serves most of North China, as well as a part of East and Northeast China, reaching an audience of over 100 million. Tianjin Television, the local television station, broadcasts on nine channels. It also has a paid digital channel, which features home improvement programs. Both the radio and television stations are now branches of the Tianjin Film, Radio and Television Group, which was established in October 2002.\nLocal newspapers include the Tianjin Daily and Jin Wan Bao (transl.\u2009Tonight Newspaper), which are the flagship papers of Tianjin Daily Newspaper Group and Jinwan Mass Media Group, respectively. There are also three English-language magazines: \"Jin\", \"Tianjin Plus\" and \"Business Tianjin\", which are mainly directed at expats resident in the city.\nPrevious newspapers.\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, \"Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina\" (also spelled as \"Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nord China\"), was published in Tianjin, which was known as \"Tientsin\" at the time.\nIn 1912, Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and five daily newspapers in other languages. None of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English; the other two were in French and German, respectively. Newspapers from Tianjin published in the city included \"China Critic\", \"Peking and Tientsin Times\", \"The China Times\",\"Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina\", \"L'\u00c9cho de Tientsin\", \"China Tribune\", \"Ta Kung Pao\" (L'Impartial), \"Min Hsing Pao\", and \"Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao\" (Tsientsin Daily News). Newspapers from Beijing published in Tianjin included \"Pei Ching Jih Pao\", \"Peking Daily News\", and \"Le Journal de Peking\".\nIn 1930, the newspaper \"Deutsch-Mandschurische Nachrichten\" moved from Harbin to Tianjin and changed its name to the \"Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten\".\nCensorship capital.\nChina's leading Internet information providers (which are usually located in Beijing), including social networks Sina Weibo and Douban, as well as the online video website Sohu, have been increasingly relocating their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than in Beijing, as censorship is a type of labor-intensive work. In fact, Tianjin is considered to have become the censorship capitol for Chinese Internet.\nTourism.\nThe city's streetscapes incorporate nineteenth and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China. Though areas of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. Using armed gunboats, they were victorious; the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, which were along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European communities; the French built ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners were noticeable in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, which occurred when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to watch its residents.\nThe old city was razed entirely during 2000 and 2001 to make way for new developments. Only several old buildings, such as the Tianjin Temple of Confucius, remain.\nThe network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station and south of the Hai River now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. The ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession now make up the downtown district just south of the river and mansions that the British built are east of the area. Farther east and south of the river, the architecture has a slight German construction.\nLandmarks and attractions.\nSights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality (including Binhai/TEDA), consist of the following:\nCulture.\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived. Despite its proximity to Beijing, the Tianjin dialect sounds different from the Beijing dialect, which provides the basis for Putonghua (Standard Chinese).\nTianjin is considered to be a \"home base\" of Beijing opera, which is a form of Chinese opera.\nTianjin is known for its stand-up comedy and comedians, including Guo Degang and Ma Sanli. Ma Sanli (1914\u20132003), an ethnic Hui person and longtime resident of Tianjin, was known for his \"xiangsheng\", a form of Chinese entertainment akin to stand-up comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his \"xiangsheng\" in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of \"xiangsheng\". Tianjin's general style of stand-up also includes the use of rhythmic bamboo clappers (\"kuaiban\").\nYangliuqing (transl.\u2009Green Willows), a town about west of Tianjin's urban area and the seat of Xiqing District, is known for its Chinese New Year-themed, traditional, and colorful wash paintings (). Tianjin is also known for the Zhang clay figurine, a type of colorful figurine depicting a variety of characters, and Tianjin's Wei's kites, which can be folded to a fraction of their full sizes and are noted for portability.\nOn September 28, 2015, the Juilliard School in Manhattan, New York City announced an expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan. At the time, the school had plans to offer a master's degree program. The visit was the institution's first full-scale foray outside the United States.\nCuisine.\nJianbing guozi () is a popular Tianjin street food consisting of a thin mung bean flour pancake wrapped around deep-fried dough sticks and flavored with sauces and green onions.In June 2017, the skill of making \"jianbing guozi\" was included in the municipal intangible cultural heritage list in Tianjin, and it is said to be \"one of China's most beloved street breakfasts\", especially in Tianjin and the neighboring province of Hebei. \nGuobacai, a traditional Tianjin snack, consists of shredded mung bean pancakes served in a flavorful gravy. It is characterized by its savory sauce, which is typically enriched with toppings like sesame paste and a distinctive fermented bean curd sauce.\nTianjin cuisine places a focus on seafood, due to Tianjin's proximity to the sea. It can be further classified into several varieties, including rough (), smooth (), and high () cuisine. Menu options include the Eight Great Bowls (), a combination of eight main meat dishes, and the Four Great Stews (), which actually refers to a large number of stews, which may include chicken, duck, seafood, beef, and mutton.\nThe four foods that are considered to be delicacies of Tianjin include Goubuli baozi, Guifaxiang Shibajie Mahua (), Erduoyan Zhagao () and Maobuwen Jiaozi (). Known foods include Caoji donkey meat, Bazhen sheep-leg mutton of Guanshengyuan, Luji Tangmian Zhagao, Baiji Shuijiao, Gaogan of Zhilanzhai, Guobacai of Dafulai, Subao of Shitoumenkan and Xiaobao chestnut. These snacks are available in Nanshi Food Street, which has food from Tianjin.\nTransport.\nThe transportation system in Tianjin is considered to be relatively effective, inclusive and sustainable. The city received the Sustainable Transport Award for 2024 due to its efforts to improve and expand non motorized and public transport, as well as to make it accessible. The policy of the city had an impact on policies at the regional and country level and received support from the World Bank (transportation in Tianjin is its biggest investment in this domain). According to a statement of the Institute for Transportation &amp; Development about policy that resulted in the award, \"Thus, the city's recent investments into sustainable mobility policy and infrastructure have the potential to serve as a model for the rest of China, as the nation works towards achieving carbon neutrality before 2060.\"\nAirport.\nTianjin Binhai International Airport is located in Dongli District and is roughly away from the city's downtown area. Tianjin is also served by the new Beijing Daxing International Airport in Beijing.\nPort of Tianjin.\nThe Port of Tianjin is China's largest artificial deep water harbor; its throughput capacity is the fifth largest in the world. Located in the Binhai Economic Zone, a national new economic zone of China, Tianjin Harbor is a port for international cruises visiting the wider area, including Beijing.\nTrams.\nTianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high-speed rubber-tired tram system; it is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, the system marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had a standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\nMetro.\nThe Tianjin Metro was formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged to form the Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. It is currently under expansion to create five to nine lines. A total of six lines are currently operating in the city and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was . The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001, for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to ; there is now a total of 22 stations. Construction work on Line 2 and Line 3 was completed in 2012; the two lines are now in operation. Several new metro lines have been planned.\nThe two rapid transit operators in Tianjin are responsible for the service as follows:\nRail.\nThere are several railway stations in the city, Tianjin railway station being one of them. It was built in 1888. The station was initially located at Wangdaozhuang (). The station was later moved to Laolongtou () on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892; as a result, the station was renamed as Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was completely rebuilt in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987, and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally known as the 'East Station', due to its geographic position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project, which involves Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9, as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-Speed Rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also railway stations in Tianjin. Tanggu railway station is located in the port area of Tanggu District; Binhai railway station and Binhai North railway station are located to the north of Tanggu in TEDA. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed railway began on July 4, 2005, and was completed during August 2008.\nThe following rail lines go through Tianjin:\nThe inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system using the letter C (C stands for InterCity) followed by four numbers. The train numbers range between C2001 and C2298. The number ranges are divided into three different groups, which provide information about where a train will go:\nThe new C trains take 30 minutes to travel between Beijing and Tianjin; the trains make the journey with half the time used by the previous D trains. The ticket price, as of Aug 15, 2008, is 69 RMB for first-class seating and 58 RMB for second-class seating.\nBus.\nThere were over 900 bus lines in the city as of 2005[ [update]].\nRoads and expressways.\nSome roads and bridges, such as Minquan Gate and Beiyang Road, have retained names given to them while the Republic of China (1912\u20131949) was in power. As in other cities in China, some roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Unlike Beijing, Tianjin has few roads that run parallel to the four cardinal directions.\nTianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is similar to a highway-level ring road. The road experiences traffic.\nTianjin's roads often finish in \"dao\" () and \"xian\" (). These suffixes are most often used for highways and through routes. The terms \"lu\" () and j\"ie\" () are not generally used. As Tianjin's roads are tend to not be in cardinal directions, \"jing\" () roads and \"wei\" () roads appear; these roads attempt to run more directly north\u2013south and east\u2013west, respectively.\nThe following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin:\nThe following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin:\nReligion.\nSome residents of Tianjin participate in indigenous religious practices, such as the worship of Mazu, a sea goddess. Tianjin also contains the Temple of Great Compassion (a Buddhist temple), St. Joseph's Cathedral (a Catholic cathedral also known as Laoxikai Church), and Our Lady of Victory Church (a Catholic church also known as Wanghailou Church). A Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin exists. According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 1.51% of the city's population. Tianjin has been described as a historically \"strong center\" of Islam in China. Northwestern Tianjin has traditionally been the location of the Muslim quarter of the city, where Muslims have lived for centuries; the area is near the city's Great Mosque, \"Qingzhen si\", which was founded in 1703. The city also contains the Dahuoxiang Mosque.\nSports.\nSports teams based in Tianjin include the following:\nThe 1995 World Table Tennis Championships, the 2013 East Asian Games, and the 2017 National Games of China were hosted by the city. Tianjin was scheduled to be one of the host cities for the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in 2021 before its cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also scheduled to be one of the host cities for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup before China's withdrawal as the host.\nSince 2014, a WTA international tennis tournament has taken place in Tianjin every year at the Tuanbo International Tennis Center.\nMartial arts.\nFor some centuries, Tianjin and Beijing had been considered centers for traditional Chinese martial arts. Formerly and currently practiced martial arts including \"bajiquan\", \"piguazhang\", \"xingyiquan\", and \"baguazhang\" have been practiced in the city. The martial arts that the city is known most for are Hong Qiao and Nankai. Martial artists practice in public green spaces such as Xigu Park and the Tianjin Water Park.\nEducation.\nTianjin is ranked as the 15th leading city in the world with the highest scientific research outputs and second in the North China region after Beijing.\nColleges and universities.\nThe following universities are under the jurisdiction of the national Ministry of Education:\nThe following are under the jurisdiction of the municipal government:\nThe following are under the jurisdiction of the national Civil Aviation Authority of China:\nThe following are under the Hebei Provincial People's Government:\nThe following are foreign institutions:\nThe following is a private institution:\nInstitutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed above.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the Jin and Yuan dynasties, it was renamed as Zh\u00edg\u01d4 River (\u76f4\u6cbd\u6cb3, lit. \u201cStraight Gu River\") and D\u00e0g\u01da River (\u5927\u6cbd\u6cb3, lit. \u201cGreat Gu River\") respectively. The name Hai River first appeared towards the end of the Ming dynasty.\nThe Hai River at Tianjin is formed by the confluence of five watercourses: the Southern Canal, Ziya River, Daqing River, Yongding River, and the Northern Canal. The southern and northern canals are parts of the Grand Canal. The Southern Canal is joined by the Wei River at Linqing. The Northern Canal joins with the Bai He (or Chaobai River) at Tongzhou. The Northern Canal (sharing a channel with Bai He) is also the only waterway from the sea to Beijing. Therefore, early Westerners also called the Hai He the Bai He.\nAt Tianjin, through the Grand Canal, the Hai connects with the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The construction of the Grand Canal greatly altered the rivers of the Hai He basin. Previously, the Wei, Ziya Yongding and Bai Rivers flowed separately to the sea. The Grand Canal cut through the lower reaches of these rivers and fused them into one outlet to the sea, in the form of the current Hai He.\nThe Hai River is long measured from the longest tributary. However, the Hai River is only around from Tianjin to its estuary. Its basin has an area of approximately .\nHistory.\nOn 20 May 1858, the Pei-ho, as it was then known, was the scene of an invasion by Anglo-French forces during the Second Opium War whereby the Taku Forts were captured. \nIn 1863 seagoing ships could reach the head of navigation at Tongzhou, but the crooked river was difficult for large vessels.\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion, Imperial Chinese forces deployed a weapon called \"electric mines\" on June 15, at the Baihe river before the Battle of Taku Forts (1900), to prevent the western Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack. This was reported by American military intelligence in the United States. War Dept. by the United States. Adjutant-General's Office. Military Information Division.\nLike the Yellow River, the Hai is exceedingly muddy because of the powdery soil through which it flows. The silt carried by the water deposits in the lower reaches, sometimes causing flooding. The waters from the five major tributaries only have one shallow outlet to the sea, which makes such floods stronger. Because China's capital (and second largest city), Beijing, and the third largest city, Tianjin, both lie in the Hai He Basin, Hai He floods cause a significant loss. To alleviate flooding, reservoirs have been built and artificial channels dug to divert excess water directly into the sea. For example, the Chaobai River is diverted to the Chaobai Xin River and no longer joins with the Northern Canal.\nDue to industrial and urban development in the Hai He Basin, the volume of water flow has greatly decreased. Many smaller tributaries and some of the major tributaries are dry for most of the year. With reduced water flow, water pollution worsens. The water shortage in the Hai He basin is expected to be alleviated by the South-North Water Transfer Project.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is noted for his contributions to late Restoration comedy, particularly for his plays \"The Constant Couple\" (1699), \"The Recruiting Officer\" (1706) and \"The Beaux' Stratagem\" (1707).\nEarly life.\nBorn in Derry, Farquhar was one of seven children born to William Farquhar, a clergyman of modest means. The author of \"Memoirs of Mr. George Farquhar\", a biographical sketch prefixed to certain 18th-century editions of his works, claims that Farquhar\nHe was educated at Foyle College and later entered Trinity College Dublin at age 17 as a sizar under the patronage of the Bishop of Dromore, who may have been related to Farquhar's mother. Farquhar may have initially intended to follow his father's profession and become a clergyman, but was \"unhappy and rebellious as a student\" and left college after two years to become an actor. According to an 18th-century biographer, Farquhar's \"gay and volatile Disposition could not long relish the Gravity and Retirement of a College-life,\" and Trinity College may have expelled him over a \"profane jest.\"\nActing career.\nFarquhar joined a company performing on the Dublin stage, probably through his acquaintance with the well-known actor Robert Wilks. However, Farquhar was reportedly not that impressive as an actor. We are told that \"his Voice was somewhat weak\" and that \"his movements [were] stiff and ungraceful.\" However, he was well received by audiences and thought to continue in this career \"till something better should offer.\" Some of the roles reportedly played by Farquhar were Lennox in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" Young Bellair in \"The Man of Mode\" by George Etherege, Lord Dion in \"Philaster\" by Beaumont and Fletcher, and Guyomar in \"The Indian Emperor\" by John Dryden.\nWhile he was performing in the Dryden play, an accident on stage put an end to Farquhar's acting career. As Guyomar, Farquhar was supposed to \"kill\" Vasquez, one of the Spanish generals in the drama. Forgetting to exchange his sword for a foil before enacting this scene, Farquhar severely wounded Price, the actor playing Vasquez. Although Price recovered, Farquhar resolved after this mishap to give up acting for good.\nWriting career.\nFarquhar then left for London, \"possibly with a draft of his first play in his portmanteau.\" Some writers tie his move to that of his friend Wilks, who had received an offer from the manager of Drury Lane to come to London and join that theatre, and Wilks is also credited with encouraging Farquhar's efforts at writing plays.\nFarquhar's first comedy, \"Love and a Bottle,\" was premiered in 1698; \"for its sprightly Dialogue and busy Scenes,\" it is said to have been \"well received by the Audience.\" Called a \"licentious piece\" by one scholar, and cited as proof that Farquhar had \"absorbed the stock topics, character-types, and situations of Restoration comedy\" by another, the play deals with Roebuck, \"An \"Irish\" Gentleman of a wild roving Temper\" who is \"newly come to \"London.\"\" The general character of the play can be evaluated by considering that in the opening scene, Roebuck tells his friend Lovewell that he has left Ireland due to getting a woman pregnant with twins (a boy and a girl) and to Roebuck's father trying to force Roebuck to marry the woman; however, Roebuck remarks, \"Heav'n was pleas'd to lessen my Affliction, by taking away the She-brat.\"\nAfter the favourable reception of \"Love and a Bottle,\" Farquhar decided to devote himself to playwriting. He also at this point received a commission in the regiment of the Earl of Orrery, so his time for the next few years was divided between the vocations of soldier and dramatist. It was also at about this time that Farquhar discovered Anne Oldfield, who was reading aloud a scene from \"The Scornful Lady\" at her aunt's tavern. Impressed, he brought her to the notice of Sir John Vanbrugh, and this led to her theatrical career, during which she was the first performer of major female roles in Farquhar's last comedies.\nIn 1700, Farquhar's \"The Constant Couple\" was acted at Drury Lane and proved a great success, helped considerably by his friend Wilks' portrayal of the character of Sir Henry Wildair (a performance that Farquhar himself praised generously in his \"Preface to the Reader\" when the play was published). The playwright followed up with a sequel, \"Sir Harry Wildair,\" the following year, and in 1702 wrote the comedies \"The Inconstant\" and \"The Twin Rivals.\" Also in 1702, Farquhar published \"Love and Business,\" a collection that included letters, verse, and \"A Discourse Upon Comedy.\"\nThe next year, he married Margaret Pemell, \"a widow with three children, ten years his senior,\" who reportedly tricked him into the marriage by pretending to have a great fortune. His 18th century biographer records that \"though\nhe found himself deceived, his Circumstances embarrassed, and his Family increasing, he never upbraided her for the Cheat, but behaved to her with all the Delicacy and Tenderness of an indulgent Husband.\" He was engaged in recruiting for the army, due to the War of the Spanish Succession, for the next three years, writing little except \"The Stage Coach\" in collaboration with Peter Motteux; this was an adaptation of a French play. He drew on his recruiting experience for his next comedy, \"The Recruiting Officer\" (1706). However, Farquhar had to sell his army commission to pay debts, reportedly after the Duke of Ormonde advised him to do so, promising him another but failing to keep his promise.\nEarly in 1707, Farquhar's friend Wilks visited him; Farquhar was ill and in distress, and Wilks is said to have \"cheered him with a substantial present, and urged him to write another comedy.\" This comedy, \"The Beaux' Stratagem,\" was given its premi\u00e8re on 8 March 1707; we know from Farquhar's own statement prefacing the published version of the play that he wrote it during his sickness:\nFarquhar died on 29 April 1707, not quite two months after the opening of this last play. He was buried in the Church of St. Martin in the Fields, London, on 3 May.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His work is noted for its intensity and its raw sexuality, and for the many self-portraits the artist produced, including nude self-portraits. The twisted body shapes and the expressive line that characterize Schiele's paintings and drawings mark the artist as an early exponent of Expressionism. Gustav Klimt, a figurative painter of the early 20th century, was a mentor to Schiele.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nEgon Leo Adolf Ludwig Schiele was born on 12 June 1890 in Tulln, Lower Austria. His father, Adolf Schiele, the station master of the Tulln station in the Austrian State Railways, was born in 1851 in Vienna to Karl Ludwig Schiele, a German from Ballenstedt and Aloisia Schimak; Egon's mother Marie, n\u00e9e Soukup, was born in 1861 in \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov (Krumau) to Franz Soukup, a Czech father from Mirkovice, and Aloisia Poferl, a German Bohemian mother from \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov. Schiele had three sisters, Elvira, Melanie and Gertrude. Elvira died as a child of congenital syphilis. Before the birth of Schiele his mother had suffered the still-births of three sons. \nAccording to family lore Adolf Schiele had contracted syphilis during his honeymoon in Trieste, when he had visited a brothel after his new wife, scared of the consummation of the marriage, fled their bedroom. When the couple had sex a few days later her husband then passed on the disease to his wife.\nAs a child, Schiele was fascinated by trains, and would spend many hours drawing them. Seeing Schiele's drawing as a detriment to his son's schoolwork, his father destroyed these sketchbooks.\nSchiele senior was known to have had an interest in collecting minerals and butterflies and also liked to draw. Schiele's family life was however deeply influenced by his father's illness and as the syphilis progressed it left him in a state of mental confusion and would oftentimes cast him into fits of rage. \nWhen he was 11 years old, Schiele moved to the nearby city of Krems (and later to Klosterneuburg) to attend secondary school. To those around him, Schiele was regarded as a strange child. Shy and reserved, he did poorly at school except in athletics and drawing, and was usually in classes made up of younger pupils. He also displayed a sexual interest in his younger sister Gertrude (who was known as \"Gerti\"), and his father once broke down the door of a locked room that Egon and Gerti were in to see what they were doing, only to discover them developing film. When he was sixteen he took the twelve-year-old Gerti by train to Trieste without permission and spent a night in a hotel room with her.\nAcademy of Fine Arts.\nWhen Schiele was 14\u00a0years old, his father died from syphilis, and the family that had been fairly wealthy were left impoverished. Before his death Schiele's father in a fit of insanity had burned the railway stocks he owned which would have helped out the family's economy. Schiele's elder sister Melanie became the sole breadwinner of the family when she was hired as a ticket clerk at the local railway station.\nSchiele and his younger sister Gerti became wards of his uncle (by marriage to Schiele's paternal aunt Maria), Leopold Czihaczek, also a railway official. Although he wanted Schiele to follow in his footsteps, and was distressed at his lack of interest in academia, he recognised Schiele's talent for drawing and allowed him a tutor, the artist Ludwig Karl Strauch. Eventually the uncle renounced his guardianship of Schiele and Schiele became dependent on financial support from his mother to continue his art studies. This support was cut off due to his sister Melanie objecting to the expense of it and it caused a rift in the family.\nIn 1906 Schiele applied to the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Arts and Crafts) in Vienna, where Gustav Klimt had once studied. Within his first year there, Schiele was sent, at the insistence of several faculty members, to the more traditional Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste in Vienna in 1906. His main teacher at the academy was Christian Griepenkerl, a painter whose strict doctrine and ultra-conservative style frustrated and dissatisfied Schiele so much that he left after three years.\nKlimt and first exhibitions.\nIn 1907, Schiele sought out Gustav Klimt, who generously mentored younger artists. Klimt took a particular interest in the young Schiele, buying his drawings, offering to exchange them for some of his own, arranging models for him and introducing him to potential patrons. He also introduced Schiele to the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, the arts and crafts workshop connected with the Secession. Schiele's earliest works between 1907 and 1909 contain strong similarities with those of Klimt, as well as influences from Art Nouveau. In 1908 Schiele had his first exhibition, in Klosterneuburg. Schiele left the academy in 1909, after completing his third year, and founded the \"Neukunstgruppe\" (\"New Art Group\") with other dissatisfied students. In his early years, Schiele was strongly influenced by Klimt and Kokoschka. Although imitations of their styles, particularly with the former, are noticeably visible in Schiele's first works, he soon evolved his own distinctive style.\nKlimt invited Schiele to exhibit some of his work at the 1909 Vienna \"Kunstschau\", where he encountered the work of Edvard Munch, Jan Toorop, and Vincent van Gogh among others. Once free of the academy's constraints, Schiele began to explore not only the human form, but also sexuality. Schiele's work was already daring, but it went a bold step further with the inclusion of Klimt's decorative eroticism and figurative distortions. He also painted tributes to Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" as well as landscapes and still lifes.\nIn 1910, Schiele began experimenting with nudes, and within a year a definitive style featuring emaciated, sickly-coloured figures, often with strong sexual overtones, began to emerge. Schiele also began painting and drawing children. \nSchiele began to participate in what would be numerous group exhibitions, including those of the Neukunstgruppe in Prague in 1910 and Budapest in 1912; the Sonderbund, Cologne, in 1912; and several Secessionist shows in Munich, beginning in 1911. In 1911, at the age of twenty-one, Schiele met the seventeen-year-old Walburga (Wally) Neuzil, who lived with him in Vienna and served as a model for some of his most striking paintings. She had previously modelled for Gustav Klimt and might have been one of his mistresses. Schiele and Wally wanted to escape what they perceived as the claustrophobic Viennese milieu, and went to the small town of \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov (Krumau) in southern Bohemia. Krumau was the birthplace of Schiele's mother; today it is the site of a museum dedicated to Schiele. Despite Schiele's family connections in Krumau, he and his lover were driven out of the town by the residents, who strongly disapproved of their bohemian lifestyle, including his alleged employment of the town's teenage girls as models. Progressively, Schiele's work grew more complex and thematic, and he eventually would begin dealing with themes such as death and rebirth.\nNeulengbach and imprisonment.\nTogether the couple moved to Neulengbach, west of Vienna, seeking inspirational surroundings and an inexpensive studio in which to work. As had been the case in the capital, young people and teenagers gathered in Schiele's new studio in Neulengbach. Schiele's way of life aroused much animosity among the town's inhabitants, and in April 1912 he was arrested under suspicion of kidnapping and seducing a girl of 13.\nWhen the police came to his studio to place Schiele under arrest, they seized more than a hundred drawings which they considered pornographic. Schiele was imprisoned while awaiting his trial. When his case was brought before a judge, the charges were dropped, but the artist was found guilty of exhibiting erotic drawings in a place accessible to children. In court, the judge burned one of the drawings (\"depicting a very young girl dressed only above the waist\") over a candle flame. The twenty-one days he had already spent in custody were taken into account, and he was sentenced to a further three days' imprisonment. While in prison, Schiele created a series of paintings depicting his jail cell.\nIn 1913, the Galerie Hans Goltz, Munich, mounted Schiele's first solo show. A solo exhibition of his work took place in Paris in 1914.\nWorld War I.\nIn 1914, Schiele glimpsed the sisters Edith and Ad\u00e9le Harms, who lived with their parents across the street from his studio in the Viennese district of Hietzing, 101 Hietzinger Hauptstra\u00dfe. They were a middle-class family and Protestant by faith; their father was a master locksmith. In 1915, Schiele chose to marry the more socially acceptable Edith, but had apparently expected to continue his relationship with Wally. When he explained the situation to Wally, she left him immediately and never saw him again. This abandonment led him to paint \"Death and the Maiden\", where Wally's portrait is based on a previous pairing, but Schiele's is newly struck. (In February 1915, Schiele wrote a note to his friend Arthur Roessler stating: \"I intend to get married, advantageously. Not to Wally.\") Despite some opposition from the Harms family, Schiele and Edith were married on 17 June 1915, the anniversary of the wedding of Schiele's parents.\nAlthough Schiele avoided conscription for almost a year, World War I now began to shape his life and work. Three days after his wedding, Schiele was ordered to report for active service in the army where he was initially stationed in Prague. Edith came with him and stayed in a hotel in the city, while Egon lived in an exhibition hall with his fellow conscripts. They were allowed by Schiele's commanding officer to see each other occasionally.\nDuring the war, Schiele's paintings became larger and more detailed. His military service gave him limited time, and much of his output consisted of linear drawings of scenery and military officers. Around this time, Schiele also began experimenting with the themes of motherhood and family. His wife Edith was the model for most of his female figures, but during the war (due to circumstance) many of his sitters were male. From 1915, Schiele's female nudes became fuller in figure, and many were deliberately illustrated with a lifeless doll-like appearance.\nDespite his military service, Schiele was still exhibiting in Berlin. He also had successful shows in Z\u00fcrich, Prague, and Dresden. His first duties consisted of guarding and escorting Russian prisoners. Because of his weak heart and his excellent handwriting, Schiele was eventually given a job as a clerk in a POW camp near the town of M\u00fchling. There, he was allowed to draw and paint imprisoned Russian officers; his commander, Karl Moser (who assumed that Schiele was a painter and decorator when he first met him), even gave him a disused store room to use as a studio. Since Schiele was in charge of the food stores in the camp, he and Edith could enjoy food beyond rations.\nSchiele did everything he could to get out of military service. In January 1917 he was transferred to a military supply depot in Vienna and given no particular responsibilities. He was again able to focus on his artistic career and his output was prolific. His work reflected the maturity of an artist in full command of his talents. Schiele was invited to participate in the 49th Vienna Secession exhibition held in 1918. Schiele had fifty works accepted for this exhibition, and they were displayed in the main hall. He also designed a poster for the exhibition. The composition was reminiscent of the Last Supper, with a portrait of himself in the place of Christ. The show was a triumphant success. As a result, prices for Schiele's drawings increased and he received many portrait commissions.\nDeath.\nIn the autumn of 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic reached Vienna. Edith, who was six months pregnant, died from the disease on 28 October. Schiele, very sick and weak, was transferred from the couple's home to his in-laws' house. Due to fear of contagion, visitors would communicate with Schiele from afar by way of a mirror which was set up on the threshold of his room and the parlour. Among Schiele's last visitors were his mother Marie and sister Melanie.\nSchiele died three days after his wife. He was 28\u00a0years old. During the three days between their deaths, Schiele drew a few sketches of Edith.\nStyle.\nJane Kallir has described Schiele's work as grotesque, erotic, pornographic, or disturbing, with a focus on sex, death, and discovery. He focused on portraits of others as well as himself. In his later years, while he still worked often with nudes, they were done in a more realist fashion. From a young age, Schiele drew with 'manic fluency'.\nArt critic Martin Gayford wrote in \"The Spectator\": 'He [Schiele] found his distinctive style very early. His entire oeuvre is that of a young man; most of the work in the first of the two rooms of this densely packed little exhibition dates from 1910 to 1911, when Schiele (1890\u20131918) was just 20. That helps to explain some tendencies: a half-disgusted preoccupation with sexuality and a similarly queasy fascination with examining his naked self. The male figures mainly seem to have been modelled by the artist, though it is hard to be certain since the head is often not included.'\nKallir and scholar Gerald Izenberg regard Schiele as fluid in sexuality and gender. Kallir says Schiele was \"struggling with his own sexual feelings and gender norms\" during a historical period of shifting gender expectations, the early women's movement, and criminalization of homosexuality. Some critics in the 21st century read his artwork as queer.\nA less known fact about Schiele's career is that, during his studies at the School of Arts and Crafts in Vienna, he explored sculpture and created a number of small-scale clay and plaster sculptures.\nLegacy.\nSchiele was the subject of the 1980 biographical film \"Excess and Punishment\" (aka \"Egon Schiele \u2013 Exzess und Bestrafung\"), originating in Germany with a European cast that explores Schiele's artistic demons leading up to his early death. The film was directed by Herbert Vesely and stars Mathieu Carri\u00e8re as Schiele, Jane Birkin as his early artistic muse Wally Neuzil, Christine Kaufman as his wife, Edith Harms, and Kristina Van Eyck as her sister, Adele Harms. Also in 1980, the Arts Council of Great Britain produced a documentary film, \"Schiele in Prison\", which looked at the circumstances of Schiele's imprisonment and the veracity of his diary. In 2016 another biographical film was released, \"\" (German: \"Egon Schiele: Tod und M\u00e4dchen\").\nJoanna Scott's 1990 novel \"Arrogance\" was based on Schiele's life and makes him the main figure. His life was also depicted in a theatrical dance production by Stephan Mazurek called \"Egon Schiele\", presented in May 1995, for which Rachel's, an American post-rock group, composed a score titled \"Music for Egon Schiele\". For The Featherstonehaughs contemporary dance company, Lea Anderson choreographed \"The Featherstonehaughs Draw On The Sketchbooks Of Egon Schiele\" in 1997. Glen Hansard, lead singer of Irish band The Frames, said (of writing the song \"Santa Maria) \"...With Santa Maria, I was trying to write a song about Egon Schiele, and about him and his girlfriend, while they were both dying from Spanish flu...\".\"\nThe novel \"The Flames\" (Doubleday, 2022) by the British author Sophie Haydock blends fact and fiction to tell a story of Schiele's four most significant muses. The book was named one of the best historical fiction novels of 2022 by \"The Times\". The Italian translation, \"Le Fiamme\" (Salani, 2023), won the Premio Letterario Edoardo Kihlgren award for a debut novel in 2024.\nSchiele's life and work have also been the subject of essays, including a discussion of his works by fashion photographer Richard Avedon in an essay on portraiture entitled \"Borrowed Dogs.\" Mario Vargas Llosa uses the work of Schiele as a conduit to seduce and morally exploit a main character in his 1997 novel \"The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto\".\nWes Anderson's film \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" features a painting by Rich Pellegrino that is modeled after Schiele's style which, as part of a theft, replaces a so-called Flemish/Renaissance masterpiece, but is then destroyed by the angry owner when he discovers the deception. The cover of David Bowie's 1979 \"Lodger\" album is inspired by Schiele's self-portraits and an image of Schiele appears on the cover of the 2013 single \"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\".\nJulia Jordan based her 1999 play \"Tatjana in Color\", which was produced off-Broadway at The Culture Project during the fall of 2003, on a fictionalization of the relationship between Schiele and the 12-year-old Tatjana von Mossig, the Neulengbach girl whose morals he was ultimately convicted of corrupting for allowing her to see his paintings. The opening chapters of Guy Mankowski's 2017 novel \"An Honest Deceit\" were cited to be heavily influenced by Schiele's paintings; in particular his portrayals of his sister, Gertrude.\nArt collections.\nThe Leopold Museum, Vienna houses perhaps Schiele's most important and complete collection of work, featuring over 200 exhibits. The museum sold one of these, \"Houses With Colorful Laundry (Suburb II)\", for $40.1\u00a0million at Sotheby's in 2011. Other notable collections of Schiele's art include the Egon Schiele-Museum, Tulln, the \u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere, and the Albertina Graphic Collection, both in Vienna. Viktor Fogarassy collected works by Schiele, including \"D\u00e4mmernde Stadt\".\nNazi-looted art.\nEgon Schiele had among his admirers many Jewish art collectors whose collections were looted under the Nazis: in Germany from 1933, in Austria from the Anschluss of 1938, and in France from the German occupation of 1940. As a result, numerous restitution cases in the 21st century involve artworks by Schiele. Egon Schiele's \"Dead City, \"Woman in Black Pinafore\"\" (1911) and \"Woman Hiding Her Face\" (1912) were owned by Jewish cabaret artist and film star Fritz Gr\u00fcnbaum before the Nazis deported him to the Dachau concentration camp. \"Krumau\" (1916) was owned by Daisy Hellmann until it was seized by Nazis in 1942. She first made a restitution claim in 1948 but her heirs were not able to recover the Schiele until 2002: Austria's Nazi looting organization, the Vugesta, had auctioned \"Krumau\" at the \"Dorotheum\" in Vienna on 24\u201327 February 1942, where the \"Sanct Lucas\" gallery bought it on behalf of Wolfgang Gurlitt. In 1953, the City of Linz acquired it for the Neue Galerie in Linz. The 1917 painting by Egon Schiele, \"Portrait of the Artist's Wife\" was owned by Karl Mayl\u00e4nder, a Jewish businessman in Vienna who was murdered in Auschwitz. Robin Lehman, the son of Robert Lehman, bought \"Portrait of the Artist's Wife\" (1917) in 1964 from Marlborough Gallery in London. \"Four Trees / Autumn All\u00e9e\" was owned by Josef Morgenstern who was arrested and deported to Auschwitz, where he was murdered.\nThe art gallery of the Jewish art dealer Lea Bondi Jaray, owner of the famous \"Portrait of Wally,\" was seized by the Nazis prior to his escaping to London. \"Wilted Sunflowers,\" which had been owned by Jewish art collector Karl Grunwald and seized by Nazis in Strasbourg, was discovered after a private collector took it to Christies for evaluation in 2005. \"Portrait of Wally\", a 1912 portrait, was purchased by Rudolf Leopold in 1954 and became part of the collection of the Leopold Museum when it was established by the Austrian government, purchasing more than 5,000 pieces that Leopold had owned. After a 1997\u20131998 exhibit of Schiele's work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the painting was seized by order of the New York County District Attorney and had been tied up in litigation by heirs of its former owner who claim that the painting was Nazi plunder and should be returned to them.\nThe dispute was settled on 20 July 2010 and the picture subsequently purchased by the Leopold Museum for US$19 million. In 2013, the museum sold three drawings by Schiele for \u00a314\u00a0million at Sotheby's London in order to settle the restitution claim over its 1914 Schiele painting \"Houses by the Sea\". The most expensive, \"Liebespaar (Selbstdarstellung mit Wally)\" (1914/15), or \"Two lovers (Self Portrait With Wally)\", raised the world auction record for a work on paper by the artist to \u00a37.88\u00a0million. On 21 June 2013 Auctionata in Berlin sold a watercolor from 1916, \"Reclining Woman\", at an online auction for \u20ac1.827\u00a0million (US$2.418\u00a0million). This is a world record for the most expensive work of art ever sold at an online auction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

Three species are known: \"M. birostris\", the largest at in width, \"M. yarae\", which reaches , and \"M. alfredi\", the smallest at . All three have triangular pectoral fins, horn-shaped cephalic fins and large, forward-facing mouths. They are classified among the Myliobatiformes (stingrays and relatives) and are placed in the family Myliobatidae (eagle rays). They have one of the highest brain-to-body ratio of all fish, and can pass the mirror test.\nMantas are found in warm temperate, subtropical and tropical waters. All three species are pelagic; \"M. birostris\" and \"M. yarae\" migrate across open oceans, singly or in groups, while \"M. alfredi\" tends to be resident and coastal. They are filter feeders and eat large quantities of zooplankton, which they gather with their open mouths as they swim. However, research suggests that the majority of their diet comes from mesopelagic sources. Gestation lasts over a year and mantas give birth to live pups. Mantas may visit cleaning stations for the removal of parasites. Like whales, they breach for unknown reasons.\n\"M. birostris\" and \"M. alfredi\" are both listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting of their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Manta rays are particularly valued for their gill plates, which are traded internationally. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"manta\" is Portuguese and Spanish for mantle (cloak or blanket), a type of blanket-shaped trap traditionally used to catch rays. Mantas are known as \"devilfish\" because of their horn-shaped cephalic fins, which are imagined to give them an \"evil\" appearance.\nTaxonomy.\nManta rays are members of the order Myliobatiformes which consists of stingrays and their relatives. The genus \"Manta\" is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the smaller \"Mobula\" devil rays. In 2018, an analysis of DNA, and to a lesser degree, morphology, found that \"Mobula\" was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays; that is, some members of genus \"Mobula\" are closer related to the members of the genus \"Manta\" than they are to fellow \"Mobula\", and the researchers recommended treating \"Manta\" as a junior synonym of \"Mobula\".\nMantas evolved from bottom-dwelling stingrays, eventually developing more wing-like pectoral fins. \"M. birostris\" still has a vestigial remnant of a sting barb in the form of a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas, they are right at the front. The edges of the jaws line up while in devil rays, the lower jaw shifts back when the mouth closes. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders. Manta rays have dorsal slit-like spiracles, traits which they share with the devil fish and Chilean devil ray.\nSpecies.\nThe scientific naming of mantas has had a convoluted history, during which several names were used for both the genus (\"Ceratoptera\", \"Brachioptilon\", \"Daemomanta\", and \"Diabolicthys\") and species (such as \"vampyrus\", \"americana\", \"johnii\", and \"hamiltoni\"). All were eventually treated as synonyms of the single species \"Manta birostris\". The genus name \"Manta\" was first published in 1829 by Dr Edward Nathaniel Bancroft of Jamaica. The specific name \" birostris\" is ascribed to Johann Julius Walbaum (1792) by some authorities and to Johann August Donndorff (1798) by others. The specific name \"alfredi\" was first used by Australian zoologist Gerard Krefft, who named the manta after Prince Alfred.\nA 2009 study analyzed the differences in morphology, including color, meristic variation, spine, dermal denticles (tooth-like scales), and teeth of different populations. Two distinct species emerged: the smaller \"M. alfredi\" found in the Indo-Pacific and tropical East Atlantic, and the larger \"M. birostris\" found throughout tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans. The former is more coastal, while the latter is more ocean-going and migratory. A 2010 study on mantas around Japan confirmed the morphological and genetic differences between \"M. birostris\" and \"M. alfredi\".\nA third possible species, preliminarily called \"Manta \"sp. cf. \"birostris\", reaches at least in width, and inhabits the tropical West Atlantic, including the Caribbean. In 2025, it was formally described as the Atlantic manta ray (\"Mobula yarae\"). \nFossil record.\nWhile some small teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of manta rays have been discovered. Their cartilaginous skeletons do not preserve well, as they lack the calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, one from the Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. \"M. hynei\" is a fossil species dating to Early Pliocene North America. Remains of an extinct species have been found in the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as \"Manta fragilis\", but were later reclassified as \"Paramobula fragilis\".\nCharacteristics.\nManta rays have broad heads, triangular pectoral fins, and horn-shaped cephalic fins located on both sides of their mouths. They have horizontally flattened bodies with eyes on the sides of their heads behind the cephalic fins, and gill slits on their ventral surfaces. Their tails lack skeletal support and are shorter than their disc-like bodies. The dorsal fins are small and at the base of the tail. Mantas can reach . In both species, the width is about 2.2 times the length of the body; \"M. birostris\" reaches at least in width, while \"M. alfredi\" reaches about . Their skin is covered in mucus. Mantas normally have a \"chevron\" coloration. They are typically black or dark on top with pale markings on their \"shoulders\". Underneath, they are usually white or pale with distinctive dark markings by which individual mantas can be recognized, as well as some shading. Individuals can also vary from mostly black (melanism) to mostly white (leucism). These color morphs appear to be products of neutral mutations and have no effects on fitness. A pink manta ray has been observed in Australia's Great Barrier Reef and scientists believe this could be due to a genetic mutation causing erythrism. The fish, spotted near Lady Elliot Island, is the world's only known pink manta ray.\nThe two species of manta differ in color patterns, dermal denticles, and dentition. \"M. birostris\" has more angular shoulder markings, ventral dark spots on the abdominal region, charcoal-coloured ventral outlines on the pectoral fins, and a dark colored mouth. The shoulder markings of \"M. alfredi\" are more rounded, while its ventral spots are located near the posterior end and between the gill slits, and the mouth is white or pale colored. The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in \"M. birostris\", while those of \"M. alfredi\" are evenly spaced and lack cusps. Both species have small, square-shaped teeth on the lower jaw, but \"M. birostris\" also has enlarged teeth on the upper jaw. Unlike \"M. alfredi\", \"M. birostris\" has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin.\nMantas move through the water by the wing-like movements of their pectoral fins. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial and concealed by small flaps of skin, and mantas must keep swimming with their mouths open to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiraled but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown gill rakers, which are made of spongy tissue that collects food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They have one of the highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. \"M. alfredi\" has been shown to dive to depths over , while the Chilean devil ray, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly .\nBehavior and ecology.\nSwimming behavior in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim at a constant rate in a straight line, while further inshore, they usually bask or swim idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups up to 50. They may associate with other fish species, as well as sea birds and marine mammals. Mantas sometimes breach or leap out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps in succession. Mantas may leap forward and re-enter head first, tail first or make somersaults. The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include communication, or the removal of parasites and remoras (suckerfish).\nMantas visit cleaning stations on coral reefs for the removal of external parasites. The ray adopts a near-stationary position close to the coral surface for several minutes while the cleaner fish feed. Such visits most frequently occur when the tide is high. Individual mantas may exhibit philopatry by revisiting the same cleaning station or feeding area repeatedly and appear to have cognitive maps of their environment. In addition, it has been confirmed that reef manta rays form a bond with a specific individual and act together.\nMantas may be preyed upon by large sharks, orcas and false killer whales. They may also harbor parasitic copepods. Mantas can remove internal parasites by sticking their intestines up to out of their cloaca and squeezing them out, often while defecating. Remoras adhere themselves onto mantas for transportation and use their mouths as shelter. Though they may clean them of parasites, remoras can also damage the manta's gills and skin, and increase its swimming load.\nIn 2016, scientists published a study in which manta rays were shown to exhibit behavior associated with self-awareness. In a modified mirror test, the individuals engaged in contingency checking and unusual self-directed behavior.\nFeeding.\nManta rays are filter feeders as well as macropredators. On the surface, they consume large quantities of zooplankton in the form of shrimp, krill, and planktonic crabs. In deeper depths, mantas consume small to medium-sized fish. Foraging mantas flatten their cephalic fins to channel food into their mouths. During filter feeding, small particles are collected by the tissue between the gill arches. The standard method of feeding for a lone manta is simply swimming horizontally, turning 180 degrees to feed in the other direction. Up and down movements, sideways tilting and 360 degree somersaults are also observed.\nMantas engage in a number of group feeding behaviors. An individual may \"piggy-back\" on a larger, horizontally feeding individual, placing itself over its back. \"Chain-feeding\" involves them aligning back-to-front and swimming horizontally. Chain-feeding mantas may create a circle, with the lead individual meeting up with the stragglers. More individuals may join, creating a \"cyclone\" of mantas spiraling upwards. With a diameter of , these cyclones consist of up to 150 mantas and last up to an hour. Studies have shown that around 27% of the diet of \"M. birostris\" is from the surface, while around 73% is at deeper depths. Mantas may forage on the ocean floor with the cephalic fins splayed apart.\nDuring filter feeding, the gills may get clogged up, forcing mantas to cough and create a cloud of gill waste. The rays commonly do this above cleaning stations, providing a feast for the cleaner fish. Mantas defecate dark red fecal matter which is often mistaken for blood.\nLifecycle.\nMating takes place at different times of the year in different parts of the manta's range. Courtship is difficult to observe in this fast-swimming fish, although mating \"trains\" with multiple individuals swimming closely behind each other are sometimes seen in shallow water. These mating trains often consist of multiple male rays simultaneously pursuing an individual female. The mating sequence may be triggered by a full moon and seems to be initiated by a male following closely behind a female while she travels at around . He makes repeated efforts to grasp her pectoral fin with his mouth, which may take 20 to 30 minutes. Once he has a tight grip, he turns upside-down and presses his ventral side against hers. He then inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca, where it remains for 60\u201390 seconds. The claspers form a tube and a siphon propels semen from the genital papilla into the oviduct. The male continues to grip the female's pectoral fin with his teeth for a further few minutes as both continue to swim, often followed by up to 20 other males. The pair then parts, the female being left with scars on her fin.\nThe fertilized eggs develop within the female's oviduct. At first, they are enclosed in an egg case while the developing embryos absorb the yolk. After hatching, the pups remain in the oviduct and receive additional nutrition from milky secretions called histotroph. With no umbilical cord or placenta, the unborn pup relies on buccal pumping to obtain oxygen. Brood size is usually one or occasionally two. The gestation period is thought to be 12\u201313 months. When fully developed, the pup resembles a miniature adult and is expelled from the oviduct with no further parental care. In wild populations, an interval of two years between births may be normal, but a few individuals become pregnant in consecutive years, demonstrating an annual ovulatory cycle. The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium has had some success in breeding \"M. alfredi\", with one female giving birth in three successive years. In one of these pregnancies, the gestation period was 372 days and at birth the pup had a width of and weight of . In Indonesia, \"M. birostris\" males appear to mature at , while female mature around . In the Maldives, males of \"M. alfredi\" mature at a width of , while females mature at . In Hawaii, \"M. alfredi\" matures at a width of for males and for females. Female mantas appear to mature at 8\u201310 years. Manta rays may live as long as 50 years.\nDistribution and habitat.\nMantas are found in tropical and subtropical waters in all the world's major oceans, and also venture into temperate seas. The furthest from the equator they have been recorded is North Carolina in the United States (31\u00b0N) and the North Island of New Zealand (36\u00b0S). They prefer water temperatures above and \"M. alfredi\" is predominantly found in tropical areas. Both species are pelagic. \"M. birostris\" lives mostly in the open ocean, travelling with the currents and migrating to areas where upwellings of nutrient-rich water increase prey concentrations.\nFish that have been fitted with radio transmitters have traveled as far as from where they were caught, and descended to depths of at least . \"M. alfredi\" is a more resident and coastal species. Seasonal migrations do occur, but they are shorter than those of \"M. birostris\". Mantas are common around coasts from spring to fall, but travel further offshore during the winter. They keep close to the surface and in shallow water in daytime, while at night they swim at greater depths.\nConservation issues.\nThreats.\nThe greatest threat to manta rays is overfishing. \"M. birostris\" is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires, while \"M. alfredi\" is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them.\nBoth commercial and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls, and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin, the latter made into abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their gill rakers, the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for gill rakers, targeted fisheries have developed in the Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily \"M. birostris\", are caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, \"M. birostris\" populations at most of the key aggregation sites around the world are estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.\nManta rays are subject to other human impacts. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards, and because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, ghost nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into their flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become bycatch when entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.\nStatus.\nThe IUCN listed the reef manta as vulnerable in 2019 and the giant manta as endangered in 2020. In 2011, mantas became strictly protected in international waters because of their inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them at increased risk from overfishing. The Manta Trust is a UK-based charity dedicated to research and conservation efforts for manta rays. The organization's website is also an information resource for manta conservation and biology.\nIn 2009, Hawaii became the first state in the United States to introduce a ban on the killing or capturing of manta rays. Previously, no fishery for mantas existed in the state but migratory fish that pass the islands are now protected. In 2010, Ecuador introduced a law prohibiting all fishing for manta and other rays, their retention as bycatch and their sale.\nRelation with humans.\nThe ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped the sea and its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were feared for their size and power. Sailors believed that they were dangerous to humans and could pull ships out to sea by the anchor. This attitude changed around 1976, when divers around the Gulf of California found them to be placid and safe to interact with. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including \"Jaws\" author Peter Benchley.\nAquariums.\nThe Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium acquired mantas in 1978 which survived for four days. In addition, at the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium, a male manta ray, which started captivity in 1992 at its predecessor, the Okinawa Ocean Expo Aquarium, was recorded to have lived for approximately 23 years. The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium houses manta rays in the \"Kuroshio Sea\" tank, one of the largest aquarium tanks in the world. Since 2018 they also keep giant oceanic manta ray. The first manta ray birth in captivity took place there in 2007. Although this pup did not survive, the aquarium has since had the birth of four more manta rays in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. However, although Manta became pregnant in 2012, she was stillborn. In 2013, she became pregnant, but her mother, manta ray, died and the pup that was taken out died. In August 2024, a female all black body manta ray kept in the Kuroshio tank gave birth. The pups were born black all over like their mother, wide, and weighed .\nThere are currently three mantas spending time at the Georgia Aquarium. One notable individual is \"Nandi\", a manta ray which was accidentally caught in shark nets off Durban, South Africa, in 2007. Rehabilitated and outgrowing her aquarium at uShaka Marine World, Nandi was moved to the larger Georgia Aquarium in August 2008, where she resides in its 23,848 m3 (6,300,000 US gal) \"Ocean Voyager\" exhibit. A second manta ray, \"Tallulah\", joined that aquarium's collection in September 2009 and a third was added in 2010.\nThe Atlantis resort on Paradise Island, Bahamas, hosted a manta named \"Zeus\" that was used as a research subject for three years until it was released in 2008.\nTourism.\nManta ray tourism is estimated to generate over US$73 million per year and brings US$140 million per year to local economies. The majority of global revenues come from ten countries: Japan, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mozambique, Thailand, Australia, Mexico, United States, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau. Divers may get a chance to watch mantas visiting cleaning stations and night dives enable viewers to see mantas feeding on plankton attracted by the lights.\nRay tourism benefits locals and visitors by raising awareness of natural resource management and educating them about the animals. It can also provide funds for research and conservation. Constant unregulated interactions with tourists can negatively affect them by disrupting ecological relationships and increasing disease transmission.\nIn 2014, Indonesia banned fishing and export targeting mantas, as manta ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing them to be killed. A dead manta is worth $40 to $500, while the economic impact of tourism at a popular dive site can be $1 million per manta over its life, the most famous spot for Manta Ray spotting being Manta Point located on the Lesser Sundanese island of Labuan Bajo. Indonesia has of ocean, and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for manta rays.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Income tax generally is computed as the product of a tax rate times the taxable income. Taxation rates may vary by type or characteristics of the taxpayer and the type of income.\nThe tax rate may increase as taxable income increases (referred to as graduated or progressive tax rates). The tax imposed on companies is usually known as corporate tax and is commonly levied at a flat rate. Individual income is often taxed at progressive rates where the tax rate applied to each additional unit of income increases (e.g., the first $10,000 of income taxed at 0%, the next $10,000 taxed at 1%, etc.). Most jurisdictions exempt local charitable organizations from tax. Income from investments may be taxed at different (generally lower) rates than other types of income. Credits of various sorts may be allowed that reduce tax. Some jurisdictions impose the higher of an income tax or a tax on an alternative base or measure of income.\nTaxable income of taxpayers' resident in the jurisdiction is generally total income less income producing expenses and other deductions. Generally, only net gain from the sale of property, including goods held for sale, is included in income. The income of a corporation's shareholders usually includes distributions of profits from the corporation. Deductions typically include all income-producing or business expenses including an allowance for recovery of costs of business assets. Many jurisdictions allow notional deductions for individuals and may allow deduction of some personal expenses. Most jurisdictions either do not tax income earned outside the jurisdiction or allow a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions on such income. Nonresidents are taxed only on certain types of income from sources within the jurisdictions, with few exceptions.\nMost jurisdictions require self-assessment of the tax and require payers of some types of income to withhold tax from those payments. Advance payments of tax by taxpayers may be required. Taxpayers not timely paying tax owed are generally subject to significant penalties, which may include jail-time for individuals.\nTaxable income of taxpayers resident in the jurisdiction is generally total income less income producing expenses and other deductions.

Most jurisdictions either do not tax income earned outside the jurisdiction or allow a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions on such income. Nonresidents are taxed only on certain types of income from sources within the jurisdictions, with few exceptions.\nHistory.\nThe concept of taxing income is a modern innovation and presupposes several things: a money economy, reasonably accurate accounts, a common understanding of receipts, expenses and profits, and an orderly society with reliable records.\nFor most of the history of civilization, these preconditions did not exist, and taxes were based on other factors. Taxes on wealth, social position, and ownership of the means of production (typically land and slaves) were all common. Practices such as tithing, or an offering of first fruits, existed from ancient times, and can be regarded as a precursor of the income tax, but they lacked precision and certainly were not based on a concept of net increase.\nEarly examples.\nIn 9 CE, Emperor Wang Mang of the Xin dynasty (9 to 23 CE) established the first income tax through a 10% tax of net earnings from wild herb and fruit collection, fishing, shepherding, and various nonagricultural activities and forms of trading.97 People were obligated to report their taxes to the government and officials would audit these reports.97 The penalty for evading this tax was one year of hard labor and confiscation of the entirety of a person's property.97 Because it caused popular discontent, this income tax was abolished in 22 CE.97\nIn the early days of the Roman Republic, public taxes consisted of modest assessments on owned wealth and property. The tax rate under normal circumstances was 1% and sometimes would climb as high as 3% in situations such as war. These modest taxes were levied against land, homes and other real estate, slaves, animals, personal items and monetary wealth. The more a person had in property, the more tax they paid. Taxes were collected from individuals.\nOne of the first recorded taxes on income was the Saladin tithe introduced by Henry II in 1188 to raise money for the Third Crusade. The tithe demanded that each layperson in England and Wales be taxed one tenth of their personal income and moveable property.\nIn 1641, Portugal introduced a personal income tax called the \"d\u00e9cima\".\nModern era.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe inception date of the modern income tax is typically accepted as 1799, at the suggestion of Henry Beeke, the future Dean of Bristol.\nThis income tax was introduced into Great Britain by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger in his budget of December 1798, to pay for weapons and equipment for the French Revolutionary War.97 Pitt's new graduated (progressive) income tax began at a levy of 2 old pence in the pound (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044120) on incomes over \u00a360 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023), and increased up to a maximum of 2 shillings in the pound (10%) on incomes of over \u00a3200. Pitt hoped that the new income tax would raise \u00a310 million a year, but actual receipts for 1799 totalled only a little over \u00a36 million.\nPitt's income tax was levied from 1799 to 1802, when it was abolished by Henry Addington during the Peace of Amiens. Addington had taken over as prime minister in 1801, after Pitt's resignation over Catholic Emancipation. The income tax was reintroduced by Addington in 1803 when hostilities with France recommenced, but it was again abolished in 1816, one year after the Battle of Waterloo. Opponents of the tax, who thought it should only be used to finance wars, wanted all records of the tax destroyed along with its repeal. Records were publicly burned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but copies were retained in the basement of the tax court.\nIncome tax was reintroduced by Sir Robert Peel by the Income Tax Act 1842. Peel, as a Conservative, had opposed income tax in the 1841 general election, but a growing budget deficit required a new source of funds. The new income tax, based on Addington's model, was imposed on incomes above \u00a3150 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023). Although this measure was initially intended to be temporary, it soon became a fixture of the British taxation system.\nA committee was formed in 1851 under Joseph Hume to investigate the matter, but failed to reach a clear recommendation. Despite the vociferous objection, William Gladstone, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1852, kept the progressive income tax, and extended it to cover the costs of the Crimean War. By the 1860s, the progressive tax had become a grudgingly accepted element of the United Kingdom fiscal system.\nUnited States.\nThe US federal government imposed the first personal income tax on August 5, 1861, to help pay for its war effort in the American Civil War (3% of all incomes over US$800) (equivalent to $ in 2024). This tax was repealed and replaced by another income tax in 1862. It was only in 1894 that the first peacetime income tax was passed through the Wilson-Gorman tariff. The rate was 2% on income over $4000 (equivalent to $ in 2024), which meant fewer than 10% of households would pay any. The purpose of the income tax was to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions. The US Supreme Court ruled the income tax unconstitutional, the 10th amendment forbidding any powers not expressed in the US Constitution, and there being no power to impose any other than a direct tax by apportionment.\nIn 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution cleared the unconstitutionality obstacle which previously had not allowed for the implementation of a federal income tax before 1913 in the United States. In fiscal year 1918, annual internal revenue collections for the first time passed the billion-dollar mark, rising to $5.4 billion by 1920. The amount of income collected via income tax has varied dramatically, from 1% for the lowest bracket in the early days of US income tax to taxation rates of over 90% for the highest bracket during World War II.\nCommon principles.\nWhile tax rules vary widely, certain basic principles are common to most income tax systems. Tax systems in Canada, China, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States, among others, follow most of the principles outlined below. Some tax systems, such as India, may have significant differences from the principles outlined below. Most references below are examples; see specific articles by jurisdiction (\"e.g.\", Income tax in Australia).\nTaxpayers and rates.\nIndividuals are often taxed at different rates than corporations. Individuals include only human beings. Tax systems in countries other than the US treat an entity as a corporation only if it is legally organized as a corporation. Estates and trusts are usually subject to special tax provisions. Other taxable entities are generally treated as partnerships. In the US, many kinds of entities may elect to be treated as a corporation or a partnership. Partners of partnerships are treated as having income, deductions, and credits equal to their shares of such partnership items.\nSeparate taxes are assessed against each taxpayer meeting certain minimum criteria. Many systems allow married individuals to request joint assessment. Many systems allow controlled groups of locally organized corporations to be jointly assessed.\nTax rates vary widely. Some systems impose higher rates on higher amounts of income. Tax rates schedules may vary for individuals based on marital status. In India on the other hand there is a slab rate system, where for income below INR 2.5 lakhs per annum the tax is zero percent, for those with their income in the slab rate of INR 2,50,001 to INR 5,00,000 the tax rate is 5%. In this way the rate goes up with each slab, reaching to 30% tax rate for those with income above INR 15,00,000.\nResidents and non-residents.\nResidents are generally taxed differently from non-residents. Few jurisdictions tax non-residents other than on specific types of income earned within the jurisdiction. See, \"e.g.\", the discussion of taxation by the United States of foreign persons. Residents, however, are generally subject to income tax on all worldwide income. A handful of jurisdictions (notably Singapore and Hong Kong) tax residents only on income earned in or remitted to the jurisdiction. There may arise a situation where the tax payer has to pay tax in one jurisdiction he or she is tax resident and also pay tax to other country where he or she is non-resident. This creates the situation of Double taxation which needs assessment of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement entered by the jurisdictions where the tax payer is assessed as resident and non-resident for the same transaction.\nResidence is often defined for individuals as presence in the jurisdiction for more than 183 days. Most jurisdictions base residence of entities on either place of organization or place of management and control.\nDefining income.\nMost systems define income subject to tax broadly for residents, but tax nonresidents only on specific types of income. What is included in income for individuals may differ from what is included for entities. The timing of recognizing income may differ by type of taxpayer or type of income.\nIncome generally includes most types of receipts that enrich the taxpayer, including compensation for services, gain from sale of goods or other property, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, annuities, pensions, and all manner of other items. Many systems exclude from income part or all of superannuation or other national retirement plan payments. Most tax systems exclude from income health care benefits provided by employers or under national insurance systems.\nDeductions allowed.\nNearly all income tax systems permit residents to reduce gross income by business and some other types of deductions. By contrast, nonresidents are generally subject to income tax on the gross amount of income of most types plus the net business income earned within the jurisdiction.\nExpenses incurred in a trading, business, rental, or other income producing activity are generally deductible, though there may be limitations on some types of expenses or activities. Business expenses include all manner of costs for the benefit of the activity. An allowance (as a capital allowance or depreciation deduction) is nearly always allowed for recovery of costs of assets used in the activity. Rules on capital allowances vary widely, and often permit recovery of costs more quickly than ratably over the life of the asset.\nMost systems allow individuals some sort of notional deductions or an amount subject to zero tax. In addition, many systems allow deduction of some types of personal expenses, such as home mortgage interest or medical expenses.\nBusiness profits.\nOnly net income from business activities, whether conducted by individuals or entities is taxable, with few exceptions. Many countries require business enterprises to prepare financial statements which must be audited. Tax systems in those countries often define taxable income as income per those financial statements with few, if any, adjustments. A few jurisdictions compute net income as a fixed percentage of gross revenues for some types of businesses, particularly branches of nonresidents.\nCredits.\nNearly all systems permit residents a credit for income taxes paid to other jurisdictions of the same sort. Thus, a credit is allowed at the national level for income taxes paid to other countries. Many income tax systems permit other credits of various sorts, and such credits are often unique to the jurisdiction.\nAlternative taxes.\nSome jurisdictions, particularly the United States and many of its states and Switzerland, impose the higher of regular income tax or an alternative tax. Switzerland and U.S. states generally impose such tax only on corporations and base it on capital or a similar measure.\nAdministration.\nIncome tax is generally collected in one of two ways: through withholding of tax at source and/or through payments directly by taxpayers. Nearly all jurisdictions require those paying employees or nonresidents to withhold income tax from such payments. The amount to be withheld is a fixed percentage where the tax itself is at a fixed rate. Alternatively, the amount to be withheld may be determined by the tax administration of the country or by the payer using formulas provided by the tax administration. Payees are generally required to provide to the payer or the government the information needed to make the determinations. Withholding for employees is often referred to as \"pay as you earn\" (PAYE) or \"pay as you go.\"\nIncome taxes of workers are often collected by employers under a withholding or pay-as-you-earn tax system. Such collections are not necessarily final amounts of tax, as the worker may be required to aggregate wage income with other income and/or deductions to determine actual tax. Calculation of the tax to be withheld may be done by the government or by employers based on withholding allowances or formulas.\nNearly all systems require those whose proper tax is not fully settled through withholding to self-assess tax and make payments prior to or with final determination of the tax. Self-assessment means the taxpayer must make a computation of tax and submit it to the government. Some countries provide a pre-computed estimate to taxpayers, which the taxpayer can correct as necessary.\nThe proportion of people who pay their income taxes in full, on time, and voluntarily (that is, without being fined or ordered to pay more by the government) is called the voluntary compliance rate. The voluntary compliance rate is higher in the US than in countries like Germany or Italy. In countries with a sizeable black market, the voluntary compliance rate is very low and may be impossible to properly calculate.\nState, provincial, and local.\nIncome taxes are separately imposed by sub-national jurisdictions in several countries with federal systems. These include Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States, where provinces, cantons, or states impose separate taxes. In a few countries, cities also impose income taxes. The system may be integrated (as in Germany) with taxes collected at the federal level. In Quebec and the United States, federal and state systems are independently administered and have differences in determination of taxable income.\nWage-based taxes.\nRetirement oriented taxes, such as Social Security or national insurance, also are a type of income tax, though not generally referred to as such. In the US, these taxes generally are imposed at a fixed rate on wages or self-employment earnings up to a maximum amount per year. The tax may be imposed on the employer, the employee, or both, at the same or different rates.\nSome jurisdictions also impose a tax collected from employers, to fund unemployment insurance, health care, or similar government outlays.\nEconomic and policy aspects.\nMultiple conflicting theories have been proposed regarding the economic impact of income taxes. Income taxes are widely viewed as a progressive tax (the incidence of tax increases as income increases).\nEffect on labour supply.\nSome studies have suggested that an income tax does not have much effect on the numbers of hours worked. Recent studies found a large price elasticity of supply due to reduction in labor force participation rates and human capital investment.\nThe higher costs to labour and capital imposed by income tax causes dead weight loss in an economy, being the loss of economic activity from people deciding not to invest capital or use time productively because of the burden that tax would impose on those activities. There is also a loss from individuals and professional advisors devoting time to tax-avoiding behaviour instead of economically productive activities.\nTax avoidance.\nTax avoidance strategies and loopholes tend to emerge within income tax codes. They get created when taxpayers find legal methods to avoid paying taxes. Lawmakers then attempt to close the loopholes with additional legislation. That leads to a vicious cycle of ever more complex avoidance strategies and legislation. The vicious cycle tends to benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals that can afford the professional fees that come with ever more sophisticated tax planning, thus challenging the notion that even a marginal income tax system can be properly called progressive.\nBracket creep.\n\"Bracket creep\" is usually defined as the process by which inflation pushes wages and salaries into higher tax brackets, leading to fiscal drag. However, even if there is only one tax bracket, or one remains within the same tax bracket, there will still be bracket creep resulting in a higher proportion of income being paid in tax. That is, although the marginal tax rate remains unchanged with inflation, the average tax rate will increase.\nMost progressive tax systems are not adjusted for inflation. As wages and salaries rise in nominal terms under the influence of inflation they become more highly taxed, even though in real terms the value of the wages and salaries has not increased at all. The net effect is that in real terms taxes rise unless the tax rates or brackets are adjusted to compensate.\nTypes of income.\nMany types of income are subject to income tax, which is very variable. It all depends on the country and its tax laws. In general, countries impose taxes on income from wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and rental income. The most typical ones are wage and salary, which are almost always subject to taxation withheld by employers. Some one-time payments such as bonuses paid to employees are taxable. Dividends and interest (stocks or bonds) are usually also taxed. \nThere is a very wide variation in the amount of taxation in different countries. For example, countries such as Singapore, Belgium and United Arab Emirates levy low income tax on interest and dividends, while countries such as Denmark, France and United States have very high income tax for this type of income. For profits that are earned by selling assets or a real estate (capital gains), the income tax varies between countries, and is different from for any other types of income. Rental income may also sometimes be subject to income tax, but many countries offer deductions or even exemptions for this type of income.\nAround the world.\nIncome taxes are used in most countries around the world. The tax systems vary greatly and can consist of a flat fixed rate, progressive, or regressive, structures depending on the type of tax. Comparison of tax rates around the world is a difficult and somewhat subjective enterprise. Tax laws in most countries are extremely complex, and tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national unit. Of course, services provided by governments in return for taxation also vary, making comparisons all the more difficult.\nCountries that tax income generally use one of two systems: territorial or residential. In the territorial system, only local income \u2013 income from a source inside the country \u2013 is taxed. In the residential system, tax residents of the country are taxed on their worldwide (local and foreign) income, while non-residents are taxed only on their local income. In addition, a very small number of countries, notably the United States, also tax their non-resident citizens on worldwide income.\nCountries with a residential system of taxation usually allow deductions or credits for the tax that residents already pay to other countries on their foreign income. Many countries also sign tax treaties with each other to eliminate or reduce double taxation.\nCountries do not necessarily use the same system of taxation for individuals and corporations. For example, France uses a residential system for individuals but a territorial system for corporations, while Singapore does the opposite, and Brunei taxes corporate but not personal income.\nTransparency and public disclosure.\nPublic disclosure of personal income tax filings occurs in Finland, Norway and Sweden (as of the late-2000s and early 2010s). In Sweden this information has been published in the annual directory \"Taxeringskalendern\" since 1905.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The major part of his career was spent at the Rockefeller Hospital in New York City. Avery was one of the first molecular biologists and a pioneer in immunochemistry, but he is best known for the experiment (published in 1944 with his co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty) that isolated DNA as the material of which genes and chromosomes are made.\nThe Nobel laureate Arne Tiselius said that Avery was the most deserving scientist not to receive the Nobel Prize for his work, though he was nominated for the award throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.\nThe lunar crater Avery was named in his honor.\nFamily.\nOswald Avery's grandfather was Joseph Henry Avery. He was a papermaker, and he was in charge of the papermaking at Oxford University. He discovered a way to make thin paper that could be printed on both sides. This paper was used to make Oxford Bibles.\nAvery's father, Joseph Francis Avery, born in 1846 in Norwich, Norfolk, became a Baptist minister after coming under the influence of C. H. Spurgeon, a Baptist Evangelist. He married his wife, Elizabeth Crowdy, in 1870, and spent three years in England, where he would continue his pastoral service as a Baptist. After this, he would move to Halifax, Nova Scotia with his wife, against the wishes of his friends, believing it to be the Will of God. He remained as a pastor for 14 years in Halifax before traveling to the Mariner's Temple in New York City, where he would preach to a rowdy and poverty-stricken crowd. While here, he would publish an edifying pamphlet entitled \"The Voyage of Life\", edited the church publication Buds and Blossoms, and patented and attempted to sell a preparation known as \"Avery's Auraline\", though it would gain little success. When their home burned to the ground in December 1890, the Baptist community of New York banded together to help pay for the expenses, including one John D. Rockefeller. He would die in 1892, leaving his wife Elizabeth Avery a widow.\nAvery's mother, Elizabeth Crowdy, was the beating heart and soul that made her husband's church the community center it was. After Joseph Francis Avery's death, she would continue editing the publication Buds and Blossoms. She would also continue to work with the Baptist City Mission Society, where she would come into association with a number of wealthy people, including the Sloans, the Vanderbilts, and the Rockefellers.\nOswald had two siblings - an older brother Ernest and a younger brother Roy. Ernest was a gifted child, but became ill at a young age. Roy followed his brother Oswald in the field of bacteriology. He eventually taught at Vanderbilt Medical School in Nashville, Tennessee.\nEarly life and education.\nOswald Avery was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1877 to Francis Joseph Avery, a Baptist minister, and his wife Elizabeth Crowdy. The couple had emigrated from Britain in 1873. Oswald Avery was born and grew up in a small wooden row house on Moran Street in the North End of Halifax, now a designated heritage building. When Avery was 10, his family moved to the Lower East Side of New York City. Oswald Avery began participating in church activities at a young age. He and his older brother Ernest learned how to play the cornet from a German musician who played at church. Soon, both were playing at church themselves. The brothers played on the steps of Mariners' Temple to attract worshippers. Both earned a scholarship to the National Conservatory of Music. Ernest became sick and did not continue, but Oswald pushed onward. He became talented enough to play with the National Academy of Music in Antonin Dvorak's Symphony No. 5, From the New World, under direction of Walter Damrosch.\nOswald Avery began at Colgate University in 1896. Even though Colgate was a Baptist school, there were signs of rebellion against orthodoxy during Avery's time at the university. In Avery's senior year, he and a few of his classmates asked their philosophy professor to create a metaphysics class that would allow them to explore the credibility of the Christian faith. Avery's senior year was entirely electives, but he did not choose to take a single science elective, even though many were offered. Avery made exceptional grades throughout his years at Colgate. He received 8.5 out of 10 or above in all courses his freshman year and 9 out of 10 or above his sophomore through senior year. Avery's top grades were in his public speaking courses, in which he never received lower than a 9.5. He even tied for first with his friend Emerson in an oratorical contest. Avery earned his undergraduate degree in humanities at Colgate University and was a member of the Class of 1900.\nOswald Avery began medical studies at The College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in New York later in the year of 1900. At the college, he made good grades in all of his courses, except bacteriology and pathology. He graduated with a medical degree in 1904, and then he began to practice general medicine.\"\" Avery did not like dealing with patients who had chronic diseases that he was unable to fix. He practiced medicine until 1907 when he began working as an associate director to Benjamin White in Hoagland Laboratory.\nHoagland Laboratory.\nAt Hoagland Laboratory, he began by studying the bacteriology of yogurt and other fermented milk products and their effects on gut bacteria. He recorded his findings in \"Observations on Certain Lactic Acid Bacteria of the Bulgaricus Type\". During the years 1909 through 1913, he performed medical research with bacteriological, immunological, and chemical approaches.\nFor a period of time, White came down with tuberculosis. Avery went with him to Trudea Sanatorium for a cure. Afterwards, Avery went back to take vacations at the sanatorium. He became interested in tuberculosis and began doing research in the Trudea Laboratory, where he looked at the clinical and experimental aspects of tuberculosis. Here he carried out 100 consecutive blood cultures of tuberculosis patients in the active phase of the disease. He never found evidence of secondary infection. His careful clinical investigation caught the eye of Dr. Rufus Cole at Rockefeller Institute.\nAt Hoagland, Avery performed a chemical and toxicological study of a product derived from tubercle bacilli. With White as a colleague, he extracted the product with alkaline ethanol. The research was published in 1912. This further showed his systematic effort to observe and analyze bacterial activity using their chemical structure. In 1911, Avery instructed staff of H. K. Mulford Company in bacteriological techniques, and they taught him the industrial methods for production of antitoxins and vaccines.\nThroughout his time at Hoagland, Avery published nine papers, one of which was a chapter on \"Opsonins and Vaccine Therapy\". He collaborated with Dr. N. B. Potter for this chapter, which was put in Hare's Modern Treatment - a popular medical magazine at the time. Avery also taught a course to student nurses at Hoagland. During the course, he conveyed the dangers of pathogens spread through sneezing. During his teaching, he was given the nicknames \"The Professor\" and \"Fess\". While working at Hoagland, Avery was mailed two written offers from Rockefeller Institute, and he denied them both. Avery did not accept the offer until Rufus Cole from Rockefeller came to offer the position to him in person.\nRockefeller Institute.\nOswald Avery entered Rockefeller Institute as Assistant in 1913, and in 1915, he became an Associate. In 1919, Avery was promoted to an associate member. He was granted full membership in 1923. At the institute, Cole, Avery and Alphonse Dochez developed the first effective immune serum against a strain of pneumococcus, a bacterium causing pneumonia. The serum was produced from the blood of infected horses.\nResearch showed that various pneumonia cultures isolated from different patients had different immunological properties. This made it difficult to develop a serum effective against all of the different strains. Four main groups of pneumococcus had been discovered - type I, type II, type III, and type IV. Avery investigated distribution of different pneumococcus types in healthy individuals versus individuals with symptoms of pneumonia. Avery found different subgroups of type II pneumococcus. These groups were similar to the type strain in certain aspects. However, the subgroups of type II had similarities amongst each other that they did not share with the other main groups of pneumococcus. Avery wrote about the results of his findings in a 1915 paper called \"Varieties of Pneumococcus and Their Relation to Lobar Pneumonia\". In the paper, he argued that people who appeared to be healthy could be carriers of pneumonia Avery also suggested it was important to identify the type of strain, based on agglutination of the pneumococci, when determining the appropriate serum for the patient. Avery suggested pneumococci strains that produced more severe symptoms had higher virulence than strains that cause less severe symptoms. A serum effective against type II pneumonia was developed. Avery tested the serum in horses. He processed the serum and measured its antipneumococcal activity. Avery concentrated the serum so that a minimal amount of foreign protein was needed in it. Avery wrote the monograph, Acute Lobar Pneumonia: Prevention and Serum Treatment, that was published by The Institute explaining this improvement.\nAvery also helped Dochez in his research on specific soluble substances found in the blood and urine of pneumonia patients. The presence of specific soluble substances in a urine sample allowed him to rapidly test the type of pneumonia without having to wait for a culture to grow. Avery and Heidelberger realized that the capsules of different strains of pneumonia had different polysaccharide structures and concluded that polysaccharides play a role in immunological specificity. Their work with specific soluble substances showed that it is important to consider the factor in the chemical composition of organisms to design anti-serums. Avery published papers on specific soluble substance findings between 1923 and 1929, along with an additional paper he published with Goebel in 1933. He worked with Goebel until 1934, and then Gobel continued their work upon his cessation. Later, Avery concluded that a protein determines the specificity of Diplococcus pneumoniae after he observed that the active protein was the same for all pneumococcal strains but different than that of other bacteria.\nAvery became an emeritus member of The Institute when he retired in 1943. However, he continued to work in the lab until 1948.\nDebate over the pathogen in the 1918 influenza epidemic.\nAt the height of the 1918 influenza epidemic, the dominant hypothesis was that the causative agent in the disease was a bacterium \u2014 specifically, \"Haemophilus influenzae\" (then called 'Pfeiffer's bacillus' or \"Bacillus influenzae\"), \na microbe first isolated by German bacteriologist Richard Pfeiffer, which he had identified in nasal samples of patients infected by seasonal influenza decades earlier and which was also found in many but not all samples taken from patients in the 1918 epidemic. The failure to isolate \"B. influenzae\" in some patients was generally attributed to the difficulty of culturing the bacterium.\nPeter Olitsky and Frederick Gates at the Rockefeller Institute found that nasal secretions from infected patients could still cause disease in the lungs of rabbits after having been filtered through a bacterium-excluding Berkefeld filter, but other researchers were unable to reproduce their results. Avery initially doubted Olitsky's and Gates's data, and set out to prove the \"B. influenzae\" hypothesis. For that purpose, he developed improved culture media for \"B. influenzae\", which were widely adopted and reduced the possibility of false negatives. However, \"B. influenzae\" could still not be found in all influenza patients. The true cause of influenza, a virus, would not be discovered until the 1930s.\nDNA as the basis for genes.\nAfter the influenza epidemic, Avery returned to his work on pneumococcus. He identified R and S strains of the bacterium; the latter caused disease and had a polysaccharide capsule, while the former lacked the capsule and was harmless. Griffith's experiment of 1928 showed that the ability to produce a capsule could be transferred from S to R strain bacteria, even if the S strain bacteria were killed first.\nFor many years, genetic information was thought to be contained in cell protein. Continuing the research done by Frederick Griffith, Avery worked with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty on the mystery of inheritance. He had received emeritus status from the Rockefeller Institute in 1943, but continued working for five years, though by that time he was in his late sixties. In 1944 at the Rockefeller Institute's Hospital for medical research, Oswald Avery, along with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, isolated S-strain bacteria and killed them with heat. They used available techniques to remove various macromolecules - proteins, RNA, and DNA - from the bacteria. Then, the killed S-strain bacteria, with various substances removed, were placed with live R-strain bacteria. Avery hypothesized that if the live R-strain bacteria did not transform into S-strain bacteria, then the missing substance contained genetic information and was the \"transforming principle\". Proteins were removed with protease enzymes and upon transfer of S-strain bacteria into R-strain, the R-strain transformed into S-strain. Therefore, proteins were not the \"transforming principle\". Next, the S-strain bacteria were treated with ribonucleases to degrade their RNA, and the remainder of the S-strain was placed with the live R-strain bacteria. The R-strain still transformed into S-strain, suggesting that RNA was not the transforming substance. Finally, the S-strain bacteria were treated with a deoxyribonuclease enzymes, which removed the DNA, and the S-strain bacteria were placed with the live R-strain bacteria. After this treatment, the R-strain bacteria did not transform into S-strain bacteria. The lack of transformation suggested that DNA was the substance that transformed R-strain into S-strain bacteria and indicated that it was the carrier of genetic information in cells.\nAvery's conclusion, that \"The evidence presented supports the belief that a nucleic acid of the desoxyribose type is the fundamental unit of the transforming principle of Pneumococcus Type III\" greatly influenced Erwin Chargaff, who upon reading those words dedicated his work to identify a \"chemistry of heredity\" which he later elucidated in Chargaff's rules. Chargaff would later comment that \"As this transformation represents a permanently inheritable alteration of a cell, the chemical nature of the substance responsible for this alteration had been elucidated for the first time. Seldom has more been said in so few words.\"\nAlfred Hershey and Martha Chase furthered Avery's research in 1952 with the Hershey\u2013Chase experiment. These experiments paved the way for Watson and Crick's discovery of the helical structure of DNA, and thus the birth of modern genetics and molecular biology. Of this event, Avery wrote in a letter to his youngest brother Roy, a bacteriologist at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine: \"It's lots of fun to blow bubbles but it's wiser to prick them yourself before someone else tries to.\"\nNobel laureate Joshua Lederberg stated that Avery and his laboratory provided \"the historical platform of modern DNA research\" and \"betokened the molecular revolution in genetics and biomedical science generally\".\nRetirement and later years.\nWhile working at Rockefeller Institute, Avery contracted Grave's disease, which caused him to experienced mood swings of depression and irritability. After undergoing a thyroidectomy, Avery once again became more lively and began sailing, where he fell in love with the sport. Shortly after, he retired in Nashville, Tennessee, where he lived close to his brother and his brother's family, where he was regarded not as a scientist, but as a pleasant family man and a kind country gentleman. While in the southern United States, Avery took a particular interest in the local flora and would act as a gardener would, learning about and appreciating the flowers and trees.\nAvery's enthusiasm toward researching nucleic acids continued into his retirement, and he would continue his work with Dr. Hugh Morgan, chairman of the department of medicine at Vanderbilt Medical School. Dr. Morgan was given a research grant from the Department of Defense to study immunity to streptococcal infection, and he convinced Avery to help him in his research. Avery worked on this research with Dr. Bertram E. Sprofkin. The two wrote a joint report on \"Studies on the bacteriolytic property of \"Streptomyces albus\" and its action on hemolytic streptococci\".\nDuring his later years, Avery became terminally ill with extensive hepatoma, or liver cancer. He died at age 77 on February 20, 1955, and was buried in Mount Olivet cemetery in Nashville.\nBibliography.\nThe collected papers of Avery are stored at the Tennessee State Library and Archives and at the Rockefeller Archive. Many of his papers, poems, and hand written lab-notes are available at the National Library of Medicine in the Oswald T. Avery Collection, the first of their \"Profiles in Science\" series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After studies in Bologna, where his father lived in exile after a Ghibelline coup in Buggiano, the family returned to Buggiano, which had become more securely part of the Republic of Florence. There he worked as notary and pursued his literary studies, coming into contact with the Florentine humanists Boccaccio and Francesco Nelli. The refined and masterful classical Latin of his letters to Florentine scholars earned him the admiring nickname of \"Ape of Cicero.\" In 1367 Coluccio was appointed chancellor of Todi in the Papal States. Papal secretary Francesco Bruni took Salutati with him to Rome from 1368 to 1370, as assistant in the Papal curia of Pope Urban V recently returned from Avignon. In 1370, through his connections in the curia he was made chancellor of the powerful Tuscan city of Lucca, a post he quickly lost in internecine struggles there.\nChancellor of Florence.\nIn 1374 Coluccio received an appointment in Florence and the following year was appointed Chancellor of Florence, the most important position in the bureaucracy of the Florentine Republic. In his position, Salutati was responsible for the widely circulated official correspondences with other states, drafting confidential instructions to ambassadors, conducting diplomacy and negotiating treaties: \"in its chancellor Florence had someone truly exceptional, endowed not only with legal knowledge, political cunning and diplomatic skill, but also with psychological penetration, a gift for public relations, and unusual literary skill.\" His abilities as a statesman were soon tested as Florence was immediately faced with war with the papacy. Salutati was charged with addressing Pope Gregory XI to assure him that Florence was still a loyal member of the Guelf party. Although he failed to prevent war with the papacy, Salutati soon became the most celebrated chancellor in all of Italy and a master of the formal letter. Florence's principal nemesis during his tenure, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, once remarked that one of Salutati's letters could \"cause more damage than a thousand Florentine horsemen.\" During his life, Florence warred twice against its powerful northern rival, Giangaleazzo Visconti. His treatise \"De tyranno\" (\"On the tyrant\") published in 1400, has, most likely, its model in Visconti, although in it Salutati (despite being a republican) remains a supporter of the providential universal monarch already put forward by Dante. Occasionally his letters had unintended consequences. When he wrote to the people of Ancona in 1376, inciting them, in the name of their freedom, to revolt against the governor imposed by the pope, he called to mind the evils Italy had suffered on behalf of the French. Word of his nasty tone got to the King of France, which prompted a most conciliatory letter from Salutati, assuring the King that he meant no harm and that Florence would always be a friend to France.\nIn testimony to his service as chancellor the city of Florence paid 250 florins for his funeral in 1406.\nCultural achievements.\nColuccio's cultural achievements are perhaps even greater than his political ones. A skilled writer and orator, Coluccio drew heavily upon the classical tradition and developed a powerful prose style based on the Latin of Virgil and Cicero: \"I have always believed,\" Salutati wrote, \"I must imitate antiquity not simply to reproduce it, but in order to produce something new\". In this sense his own view of humanism was broader-based than the antiquarianism of the generation of humanists he fostered.\nAn admiring correspondent of Petrarch, he spent much of his salary on amassing a collection of 800 books, slightly less than his contemporary Niccol\u00f2 de' Niccoli. He also pursued classical manuscripts, making a number of important discoveries, the most important being Cicero's lost \"Letters to his Friends\" (\"Epistulae ad Familiares\"), which showed Cicero as a defender of republican liberty. Coluccio also did important studies of history, tying Florence's origin not to the Roman Empire but to the Roman Republic.\nHe promoted the work of younger humanists such as Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini, Niccol\u00f2 de' Niccoli, Leonardo Bruni and Pier Paolo Vergerio.\nHe also brought the Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras to Florence in 1397 to teach one of the first courses in Greek since the end of the Roman Empire. After Boethius, few Westerners spoke or read Greek. Many ancient Greek works of science and philosophy were not available in Latin translation. By Salutati's time, a few Latin texts of Aristotle had arrived in Europe via Muslim Spain and Sicily. These texts, however, had been translated from Arabic, rather than directly from the Greek. By bringing Chrysoloras to Florence, Salutati made it possible for a select group of scholars (including Bruni and Vergerio) to read Aristotle and Plato in the original ancient Greek.\nWorks.\nComposed of hundreds of letters, Coluccio\u2019s Epistolary deals with a wide array of subjects. Structurally, the collection is divided into two strands: private letters, addressed to friends and acquaintances, and public letters, written in the name of the Republic of Florence. Stylistically, Coluccio\u2019s epistolary stands out for its departure from the medieval letter-writing style, which was dense with the rhetoric of the ars dictandi, making way instead for a tone of cordial and stoic serenity inspired by Cicero\u2019s \"Letters to Friends\" (\"Epistulae ad familiares\") and the lexical repertoire of other classical authors, thus producing what has been defined as a form of mixed Latin.\nAmong his more explicitly philosophical writings, the \"De seculo et religione\" is a key text in which Salutati defends the compatibility of active civic life with Christian religious devotion. Against the view that moral life necessitated withdrawal from worldly affairs, he argued that public engagement, when guided by virtue, was not only permissible but ennobling. A related concern animates his \"De tyranno\", a political treatise that denounces despotism and upholds liberty as a central civic and moral value. Drawing on classical sources and Christian ethics alike, Salutati here anticipates the political philosophy of later Renaissance republicans.\nHis unfinished \"De laboribus Herculis\" represents an ambitious allegorical-philosophical project interpreting the mythological labors of Hercules as symbolic of the soul\u2019s journey toward virtue. Inspired by Stoic and Neoplatonic moral traditions, this treatise reflects his desire to reconcile classical moral philosophy with Christian thought, portraying Hercules not simply as a hero of brute strength, but as a paradigm of ethical struggle and spiritual progress.\nIn his \"Tractatus ex epistola ad Lucilium prima\", Salutati offers a meditation on time, virtue, and human failure, drawing inspiration from the first of Seneca\u2019s Epistulae ad Lucilium. This moral-philosophical treatise explores how much of human life is lost through vice, idleness, or misplaced effort, and exemplifies Salutati\u2019s concern with the ethical use of time and the cultivation of the moral life in a civic context.\n\"De fato et fortuna\" (On Fate and Fortune) (1396-1397) is divided into five tractates; the treatise sets forth the argument of free will and the relationship that exists between it and the events that can hinder its designs. Salutati heavily relies on Augustine's \"De civitate Dei\", which he regards as foundational. He develops the doctrine of coefficiency, proposing that divine providence and free will operate collaboratively rather than being mutually exclusive. Expounding upon Augustine's concept of fortuitous causes, Salutati argues that fortune exists but is ultimately subordinate to God's will. Moreover, Augustine's rejection of astrological determinism influences Salutati's critique of astrologers like Cecco d'Ascoli and geomancers. \"De fato et fortuna\" represents Salutati's synthesis of Augustinian theology with his humanist concerns, offering a nuanced discussion of fate, fortune, and free will that resonates with the political and ethical challenges of his era.\nSalutati also engaged in polemics, most notably in his \"Invectivae\", where he employed his rhetorical skill in defense of Florence against external and ecclesiastical adversaries, including the Antipope Clement VII. These works, deeply political yet stylistically humanist, reflect his belief in the power of eloquence to uphold republican liberty and to resist corruption. Other works include \"De verecundia\" (1390) and \"De nobilitate legum et medicine\" (1399).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He also ruled Lombardy jointly with his uncle Bernab\u00f2. He was the founding patron of the Certosa di Pavia, completing the Visconti Castle at Pavia begun by his father and furthering work on the Duomo of Milan. He captured a large territory of northern Italy and the Po valley. He threatened war with France in relation to the transfer of Genoa to French control as well as issues with his beloved daughter Valentina. When he died of fever in the Castello of Melegnano, his children fought with each other and fragmented the territories that he had ruled.\nBiography.\nDuring his patronage of the Visconti Castle, he contributed to the growth of the collection of scientific treatises and richly illuminated manuscripts in the Visconti Library.\nGian Galeazzo was the son of Galeazzo II Visconti and Bianca of Savoy. His father possessed the signoria of the city of Pavia. In 1385 Gian Galeazzo gained control of Milan by overthrowing his uncle Bernab\u00f2 through treacherous means by faking a religious conversion and ambushing him during a religious procession in Milan. He imprisoned his uncle who soon died, supposedly poisoned on his orders.\nGaleazzo's role as a statesman also took other forms. Soon after seizing Milan, he took Verona, Vicenza, and Padua, establishing himself as \"Signore\" of each, and soon controlled almost the entire valley of the Po, including Piacenza where in 1393 he gave the feudal power to Confalonieri family on the lands they already had in the valleys around Piacenza. He lost Padua in 1390 when it reverted to Francesco Novello da Carrara. He received the title of Duke of Milan from Wenceslaus, King of the Romans in 1395 for 100,000 florins.\nGian Galeazzo spent 300,000 golden florins in attempting to turn from their courses the rivers Mincio from Mantua and the Brenta from Padua, in order to render those cities helpless before the force of his arms.\nNotable are his library, housed in the grandest princely dwelling in Italy, the Castello in Pavia, and his rich collection of manuscripts, many of them the fruits of his conquests. In 1400, Gian Galeazzo appointed a host of clerks and departments entrusted with improving public health. For the new system of administration and bookkeeping this established, he is credited with creating the first modern bureaucracy, with the assistance of his Chancellor Francesco Barbavara.\nConflict with France.\nGaleazzo was a devoted father to his daughter Valentina. He reacted to gossip about Valentina at the French Court by threatening to declare war on France. The wife of King Charles VI of France was Isabeau of Bavaria, the granddaughter of Bernab\u00f2 Visconti, and, thus, a bitter rival of Valentina and her father Gian Galeazzo.\nFurious at French political manoeuvring that had removed Genoa from his influence, Gian Galeazzo had been attempting to stop the transfer of Genoese sovereignty to France and Enguerrand VII was dispatched to warn him that France would consider further interference a hostile act. The quarrel was more than political. Valentina Visconti, the wife of the Duke of Orleans and Gian Galeazzo's beloved daughter, had been exiled from Paris due to the machinations of Queen Isabeau the same month as the departure of the crusade.\nIn 1396, after the disaster of Nicopolis, Galeazzo was strongly suspected of having informed the Ottomans of the Crusaders' plans and of the size and strength of their army as vengeance for his daughter being accused of being behind the illness of King Charles VI of France, and for France's increasing control over the city of Genoa that he had attempted to hamper, for which he had been rebuked by Enguerrand VII before the battle.\nUniting Italy and death.\nGian Galeazzo had dreams of uniting all of northern Italy into one kingdom, a revived Lombard empire. Obstacles included Bologna and especially Florence, who joined with other local potentates in the League of Bologna. In 1402, Gian Galeazzo launched assaults upon these cities. The warfare was extremely costly on both sides, but it was universally believed the Milanese would emerge victorious. The Florentine leaders, especially the chancellor Coluccio Salutati worked successfully to rally the people of Florence, but the Florentines were being taxed hard by famine, disease, and poverty. Galeazzo won another victory over the Bolognese at the Battle of Casalecchio on 26\u201327 June 1402.\nGaleazzo's dreams were to come to nought, however, as he succumbed to a fever at the Castello of Melegnano on 10 August 1402. He died on 3 September. His empire fragmented as infighting among his successors wrecked Milan, partly through the division of his lands among both legitimate and illegitimate children.\nMarriage and issue.\nHis first marriage was to Isabelle of Valois, who brought him the title of comte de Vertus in Champagne, rendered in Italian as \"Conte di Virt\u00f9\", the title by which he was known in his early career. They had:\nAfter Galeazzo's wife Isabelle died in childbirth in 1372, he married secondly, on 2 October 1380, his cousin Caterina Visconti, daughter of Bernab\u00f2; with her he had:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a prelate in the Merovingian kingdom, encompassing Gaul's historic region.\nGregory's most notable work is the ('Ten Books of Histories'), also known as the ('History of the Franks'). is considered a primary source for the study of Merovingian history and chronicles the accounts of the Franks during the period. Gregory is also known for documenting accounts of religious figures, notably that of Martin of Tours.\nBiography.\nGregory was born in Clermont, in the Auvergne region of central Gaul. He was born into the upper stratum of Gallo-Roman society as the son of Florentius, Senator of Clermont, by his wife Armentaria II, niece of Bishop Nicetius of Lyon and granddaughter of both Florentinus, Senator of Geneva, and Saint Gregory of Langres. Relatives of Gregory held the Bishoprics of Tours, Lyon, and Langres at the time of his birth and he claimed that he was related to 13 of the 18 bishops of Tours who preceded him. Gregory's paternal grandmother, Leocadia III, descended from Vettius Epagathus, the illustrious martyr of Lyon.\nHis father died while Gregory was young and his widowed mother moved to Burgundy, where she had property. Gregory went to live with his paternal uncle St. Gallus, bishop of Clermont, under whom, and his successor St. Avitus, Gregory had his education. Gregory also received the clerical tonsure from Gallus. Having contracted a serious illness, Gregory made a visit of devotion to the tomb of St. Martin at Tours. Upon his recovery, he began to pursue a clerical career and was ordained deacon by Avitus. Upon the death of St. Euphronius, he was chosen as bishop by the clergy and people, who had been charmed with his piety, learning, and humility. Their deputies overtook him at the court of King Sigebert of Austrasia, and being compelled to acquiesce, though much against his will, Gregory was consecrated by Giles, bishop of Rheims, on 22 August 573, at the age of 34.\nHe spent most of his career at Tours, although he assisted at the council of Paris in 577. The world in which he lived in was on the cusp between the Western culture of late antiquity and the sweeping changes of early-medieval Europe. Gregory lived also on the border between the Frankish culture of the Merovingians to the north and the Gallo-Roman culture of the south of Gaul.\nAt Tours, Gregory was well placed to hear and meet people of influence in Merovingian culture. Tours was situated on the Loire, five Roman roads radiated from it, and it was on the main route between the Frankish north and Aquitania, with Spain beyond. At Tours, the Frankish influences of the north and the Gallo-Roman influences of the south had their chief contact &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. As the center for the popular cult of St Martin, Tours was a pilgrimage site, hospital, and a political sanctuary to which important leaders fled during periods of violence and turmoil in Merovingian politics.\nGregory struggled through personal relations with four Frankish kings, Sigebert I, Chilperic I, Guntram, and Childebert II, and he personally knew most of the leading Franks.\nWorks.\nGregory wrote in Late Latin, which frequently departed from Classical usage in both syntax and spelling, although with relatively few changes in inflection.\n\"History of the Franks\".\nSummary.\nGregory of Tours' history is densely written, with numerous narratives and characters. It contains Christian tales of miracles, descriptions of omens and natural events, stories of Christian martyrs, dialogues of church debates, discussions of the lives of holy men, nobility, and eccentric peasants, frequent Bible verses and references, and explorations of the complex international relations between numerous tribes and nations including the Lombards, Visigoths, Ostrogoths and Huns, also Gregory's biography and interpretation of events.\nBook 1.\nBook One begins with a pronouncement by the author that he is a Frankish Catholic clergyman who follows the Nicene Creed and abhors heresy like those of the \"wicked\" Arian sect among other heresies. The narrative history begins with a brief epitome of the biblical Old Testament and New Testament, and the subsequent spread of the Christian religion into Gaul. Next, Gregory covers the history of Christianity in Gaul and some of the major events in Roman-Gallo relations. It ends with the death of Saint Martin of Tours in 397.\nBook 2 (397\u2013511).\nBook Two covers the beginnings of the Merovingian dynasty, including King Clovis I's conversion to Christianity by his wife Clotilde, and ending with his death in 511, after his conquest of large tracts of land in modern-day France.\nBook 3 (511\u2013548).\nBook Three follows the four sons of Clovis who equally divide his realms after his death in 511. These four kings, Theuderic I, Chlothar I, Childebert I, and Chlodomer, quarrel and fight for supremacy over the Frankish realm. Despite their disputes, they occasionally work together against an outside threat, such as their attack of the Burgundians in 523. Eventually, Chlothar becomes the most powerful king in the Frankish realm. After the death of Theuderic I in 534, Book Three ends with the death of his son and successor Theudebert I in 548. Theudebert's kingdom is inherited by Theudebald until his own death in 555.\nBook 4 (548\u2013575).\nBook Four continues from when the two remaining sons of Clovis die: Childebert in 558 and Clothar in 561. The last years of Clothar's life see the entire realm of the Franks ruled by him. At the time of his demise in 561 (as under Clovis before him), the kingdom is divided equally between four sons of Clothar: Charibert I, Sigebert I, Guntram, and Chilperic I; they quarrel for control of the entire realm. A truce between them is maintained until after the death of Charibert I in 567. Clothar's remaining sons fight for the supremacy, with Sigibert showing the strongest military force. Book Four ends with the killing of Sigbert in 575, leaving Chilperic as the dominant king. Gregory of Tours blames Fredegund, the wife of Chilperic, for the assassination. Fredegund, he says, had long held a grudge against Sigibert and his wife Brunhilda.\nBook 5 (575\u2013581).\nBook Five begins the part where the author has much personal knowledge about the events in the Frankish kingdom. This book and the ones after are considerably longer and more detailed than the previous, while covering a shorter amount of time. This book also contains Gregory's impressions of ecclesiastical issues he witnessed and had some bearing on. It describes a possible debate that Gregory had with a rival Arian church leader. Moreover, Book 5 also introduces Childebert II, the son of recently slain Sigibert and of the still-living Brunhilda. Childebert is taken along with Brunhilda under the protection of Gunthram, brother and sometime rival of Chilperic.\nBook 6 (581\u2013584).\nIn Book Six, the young Childebert betrays his alliance with his adoptive uncle Gunthram, who had protected Childebert and his mother after his father Sigibert's death. Now Childebert forms an alliance with his uncle, Chilperic, who had often been an enemy of Sigibert. In 584, Chilperic is murdered under mysterious circumstances.\nBook 7 (584).\nIn Book Seven, Fredegund assumes regency for her young son Clothar II. In the future, he will be king of all Franks until his death in 629\u00a0\u2013 beyond Gregory's narrative, which ends in roughly 593. Fredegund and her son are under the protection of Gunthram. She remains in power until her death in 597. Also in this book is the rebellion of Gundovald and its failure. Gundovald claimed to be a lost illegitimate son of dead Chlothar I. Many of the Frankish nobles and the Byzantine emperor Maurice gave some support to this rebellion; however, it is swiftly crushed by Guntram.\nBook 8 (585).\n\"Many evil things were done at this time\", as Gregory writes in Book Eight. It begins with the travels of Guntram to Paris and Orleans and describes numerous confrontations between the king and some bishops. Meanwhile, Guntram becomes ill and fears for his life. Gregory comments that the king's illness is a just punishment since he is planning to send a great number of bishops into exile. Fredegund gives two poisoned daggers to two clerics and sends them away with the order to assassinate Childebert and Brunehild. However, the two clerics are arrested by Childebert, tortured, and executed. Meanwhile, Fredegund is also behind the assassination of bishop Praetextus of Rouen while he is praying in his church. Guntram orders his army to march against Arian-controlled Septimania and Spain without success and blames his army commanders for having allowed atrocities and random destruction.\nBook 9 (586\u2013587).\nIn Book Nine, the Treaty of Andelot is signed in 587 between Guntram, Brunhilda, and Childebert II. It is a close pact of alliance, wherein Childebert is formally adopted as Guntram's heir. Brunhilda also formally allies with Guntram and comes under his protection.\nBook 10 (587\u2013591).\nThe last book is set around 589. Basina, the daughter of Chilperic I and Clotilda (daughter of Charibert) leads a brief revolt from a nunnery.\nThe 18 bishops of Tours are named and described. The book ends with a summary of Gregory's previous written works.\nAnalysis.\nThe is made up of ten books. Books I to IV initially recount the world's history from the Creation (as was traditional for such works); but move quickly on to the Christianization of Gaul, the life and times of Saint Martin of Tours, the conversion of the Franks and the conquest of Gaul under Clovis I, and the more detailed history of the Frankish kings down to the death of Sigebert I in 575. At this date, Gregory had been bishop of Tours for two years.\nWith his fifth book, Gregory embarks (with some relief) on contemporary history, opening: \"Here, I am glad to say, begins Book V\". This, the second part of his history, Books V and VI, closes with Chilperic I's death in 584. During the years that Chilperic held Tours, relations between him and Gregory were tense. After hearing rumours that the bishop of Tours had slandered his wife, Fredegund, Chilperic had Gregory arrested and tried for treason\u00a0\u2013 a charge which threatened both Gregory's bishopric and his life. The most eloquent passage in the is the closing chapter of Book VI, in which Chilperic's character is summed up unsympathetically through the use of an invective: Herod and Nero are among the comparisons employed.\nThe third part, comprising Books VII to X, takes his increasingly personal account to the year 591, and concludes with a plea for further chroniclers to preserve his work in entirety (as indeed would be done). An epilogue was written in 594, the year of Gregory's death.\nProblems of interpretation.\nReaders of the may find that one royal Frankish house is more generously treated than others. Gregory was also a Catholic bishop, and his writing reveals views typical of someone in his position. His views on perceived dangers of Arianism, still strong among the Visigoths, led him to preface the with a detailed expression of his orthodoxy on the nature of Christ. In addition, his ridiculing of pagans and Jews reflected how his works were used to spread the Christian faith. For example, in book 2, chapters 28\u201331, he described the pagans as incestuous and weak and then described the process by which newly converted King Clovis led a much better life than that of a pagan and was healed of all the conundrums he experienced as a pagan.\nGregory's education was the standard Latin one of Late Antiquity, focusing on Virgil's and Martianus Capella's , but also other key texts such as Orosius's \"Chronicles\", which his continues, and Sallust; he referred to all these works in his own. His education, as was typical for the time, did not extend to a broad acquaintance with the pagan classics, but rather progressed to mastery of the Vulgate Bible. It is said that he constantly complained about his use of grammar. He did not understand how to correctly write masculine and feminine phrases, reflecting either a lack of ability or changes in the Latin language. Though he had read Virgil, considered the greatest Latin stylist, he cautioned: \"We ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death.\" By contrast, he seems to have thoroughly studied the lengthy and complex Vulgate Bible, as well as numerous religious works and historical treatises, which he frequently quoted, particularly in the earlier books of the .\nThe main impression that historians once retained from the focused on Gregory's anecdotes about violence; until recently, historians tended to conclude that Merovingian Gaul was a chaotic, brutal place. Recent scholarship have concluded that Gregory's underlying purpose was to highlight the vanity of secular life and contrast it with the miracles of the saints. Though Gregory conveys political and other messages through the , and these are studied very closely, historians now generally agree that this contrast itself is the central and ever-present narrative device.\nHagiographies.\nHis \"Life of the Fathers\" comprises twenty hagiographies of the most prominent religious men of the preceding generation, taking in a wide range the spiritual community of early medieval Gaul, including lives of bishops, clerics, monks, abbots, holy men, and hermits. He praised St. Illidius for purity of heart, St. Brachio the abbot for discipline and determination in study of the scriptures, St Patroclus for unwavering faith in the face of weakness, and St. Nicetius bishop of Lyon for justice. It is the life of St. Nicetius of Trier, though, which dominates this book; his great authority and sense of episcopal responsibility which is the focus of Gregory's account as his figure, predestined to be great, bestrode the lives of the others. It is told that he felt a weight on his head, but was unable to see what it was when turning around, though upon smelling its sweet scent he realised that it was the weight of episcopal responsibility. He surmounted the others in the glory of his miracles and was chosen by God to have the entire succession of past and future Frankish kings revealed to him.\nA further aspect of this work is the appearance of Gregory himself in certain sections, notably in the life of St. Leobardus. This is for two reasons: Firstly, it created a distinct link between the temporal and the spiritual worlds, firmly placing the accounts of the lives in a world which was understandable and recognisable; or, seen from the other angle, confirming the presence of miracles in the temporal world.\nIn 587, Gregory began writing the \"Book of the Glories of the Martyrs\" (), which deals \"almost exclusively with the miracles wrought in Gaul by the martyrs of the Roman persecutions\". But it also tells the story of one Theodore who made a pilgrimage to India and reported the existence of a large monastery where the body of Thomas the Apostle was first interred and where miracles took place.\nFighting heresy.\nGregory's avowed aim in writing this book was to \"fire others with that enthusiasm by which the saints deservedly climbed to heaven\", though this was not his sole purpose, and he most surely did not expect his entire audience to show promise of such piety as to witness the power of God flowing through them in the way that it did for the fathers. More immediate concerns were at the forefront of his mind as he sought to create a further layer of religious commitment, not only to the Church at Rome, but also to local churches and cathedrals throughout Gaul. Along with his other books (notably the \"Glory of the Confessors\", the \"Glory of the Martyrs\", and the \"Life of St. Martin\"), meticulous attention is paid to the local as opposed to universal Christian experience. Within these grandiloquent lives are tales and anecdotes which tie miracles, saints, and their relics to a great diversity of local areas, furnishing his audience with greater knowledge of their local shrine, and providing them with evidence of the work of God in their immediate vicinity, thus greatly expanding their connection with and understanding of their faith. Attacks on heresy also appear throughout his hagiographies; Arianism he took to be the common face of heresy across Europe, exposed to great ridicule. Often, the scenes which expose the weaknesses of heresy focused on images of fire and burning, whilst the Catholics were proved right by the protection lavished on them by God, in Gregory's view.\nThis was of great relevance to Gregory himself as he presided over the important see of Tours, where extensive use was made of the cult of St. Martin in establishing the authority of the bishopric with the congregation and in the context of the Frankish church. Gregory's hagiography was an essential component of this. However, this should not be seen as a selfish grab for power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the \"Life of the Fathers\", but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to be in the best interests of their congregation and the wider church.\nGregory's Creed.\nAs an example of Gregory's zeal in his fight against heresy, the includes a declaration of faith with which Gregory aimed to prove his orthodoxy with respect to the heresies of his time (\"so that my reader may have no doubt that I am Catholic for they are\"). The confession is in many phrases, each of which refutes a specific Christian heresy. Thus, Gregory's creed presents, in the negative, a virtual litany of heresies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I believe, then, in God the Father omnipotent. I believe in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord God, born of the Father, not created. [I believe] that he has always been with the Father, not only since time began but before all time. For the Father could not have been so named unless he had a son; and there could be no son without a father. But as for those who say: \"There was a time when he was not\", [note: a leading belief of Arian Christology] I reject them with curses, and call men to witness that they are separated from the church. I believe that the word of the Father by which all things were made was Christ. I believe that this word was made flesh and by its suffering the world was redeemed, and I believe that humanity, not deity, was subject to the suffering. I believe that he rose again on the third day, that he freed sinful man, that he ascended to heaven, that he sits on the right hand of the Father, that he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe that the holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son, that it is not inferior and is not of later origin, but is God, equal and always coeternal with the Father and the Son, consubstantial in its nature, equal in omnipotence, equally eternal in its essence, and that it has never existed apart from the Father and the Son and is not inferior to the Father and the Son. I believe that this holy Trinity exists with separation of persons, and one person is that of the Father, another that of the Son, another that of the Holy Spirit. And in this Trinity confess that there is one Deity, one power, one essence. I believe that the blessed Mary was a virgin after the birth as she was a virgin before. I believe that the soul is immortal but that nevertheless it has no part in deity. And I faithfully believe all things that were established at Nic\u00e6a by the three hundred and eighteen bishops. But as to the end of the world I hold beliefs which I learned from our forefathers, that Antichrist will come first. An Antichrist will first propose circumcision, asserting that he is Christ; next he will place his statue in the temple at Jerusalem to be worshiped, just as we read that the Lord said: \"You shall see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place.\" But the Lord himself declared that that day is hidden from all men, saying; \"But of that day and that hour knoweth no one not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father alone.\" Moreover we shall here make answer to the heretics [note: the Arians] who attack us, asserting that the Son is inferior to the Father since he is ignorant of this day. Let them learn then that Son here is the name applied to the Christian people, of whom God says: \"I shall be to them a father and they shall be to me for sons.\" For if he had spoken these words of the only begotten Son he would never have given the angels first place. For he uses these words: \"Not even the angels in heaven nor the Son,\" showing that he spoke these words not of the only-begotten but of the people of adoption. But our end is Christ himself, who will graciously bestow eternal life on us if we turn to him.\nViews on wine.\nGregory's writings make ample references to wine and vineyards. He argued in his writings that wine drinking was defensible when consumed with proper gratitude towards God, but that it was problematic when consumed solely for pleasure.\nLegacy.\nThe \"History of the Franks\" by Gregory of Tours is an historical record of great importance. It is a central source for early Frankish history, representing the period of transition from late Roman antiquity to early Medieval times in a nascent Europe. It is believed to be the only reliable source of information to describe the emerging military and political power of the Franks in one kingdom.\nGregory has often been compared to Herodotus, and (with his detailed interest in, and accounts of, ecclesiastical history and maneuverings) to a bloodier Anthony Trollope. According to Robert Win's analysis:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There can be no argument that Gregory deliberately structured his narrative to protect himself from any political attacks and that it was the political circumstances around him that governed what he could and could not write.\nGregory's Latin was relatively poor in comparison with earlier centuries when writers were educated at secular Roman grammar and rhetoric schools. He was self-aware of this and apologized for his poor Latin in his introduction:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hearing continually these complaints and others like them I have undertaken to commemorate the past, in order that it may come to the knowledge of the future; and although my speech is rude, I have been unable to be silent as to the struggles between the wicked and the upright; and I have been especially encouraged because, to my surprise, it has often been said by men of our day: \"few understand the rhetorician but many the rustic speaker\".\nWin further observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The is the only source of that period covering the beginning of the Franks in the decaying Roman Empire from around 397 (the death of Martin of Tours) to 590 (the early reign of king Chlothar II). Gregory's chronology of the Franks is continued with the Fourth Book of Fredegar and its continuations for the events up to 642. Likewise, the fourth Book of Fredegar and its continuations is [\"sic\"] the only source of any significance for much of the period it covers.\nGregory's hagiographies are also a valuable source of anecdotes and stories which enrich modern understanding of life and belief in Merovingian Gaul. The motivation behind his works was to show readers the importance and strength of Christianity, and this bias should always be remembered. Alongside the most outstanding poet Venantius Fortunatus in his lifetime, Gregory of Tours is the unique historian from the 6th-century Merovingian world; and his extensive literary output is itself a testimony to the preservation of learning and to the lingering continuity of Gallo-Roman civic culture through the early Middle Ages.\nGregory's writings have also provided valuable evidence for music scholars studying Gallican liturgy and Gallican chant. His \"Decem Libri Historiarum\" is particular has many liturgical references relating to music.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nThe following represent key modern texts on Gregory of Tours, including the most recent translations of his work.\nWhile Lewis Thorpe's translation of \"The History of the Franks\" is more accessible than Brehaut's, his introduction and commentary are not well regarded by contemporary historians (see \"Secondary sources\", below)."}
{"id": "50853", "revid": "50516169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50853", "title": "Holy Roman Emperor", "text": "Ruler of the Holy Roman Empire from 800 to 1806\nThe Holy Roman Emperor, originally and officially the Emperor of the Romans (; ) during the Middle Ages, and also known as the Roman-German Emperor since the early modern period (; ), was the ruler and head of state of the Holy Roman Empire. The title was held in conjunction with the title of King of Italy (\"Rex Italiae\") from the 8th to the 16th century, and, almost without interruption, with the title of King of Germany (\"Rex Teutonicorum\", lit.\u2009'King of the Teutons') throughout the 12th to 18th centuries.\nThe Holy Roman Emperor title provided the highest prestige among medieval Catholic monarchs, because the empire was considered by the Catholic Church to be the only successor of the Roman Empire during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. Thus, in theory and diplomacy, the emperors were considered \u2014first among equals\u2014among other Catholic monarchs across Europe.\nFrom an autocracy in Carolingian times (AD 800\u2013924), the title by the 13th century evolved into an elective monarchy, with the emperor chosen by the prince-electors. Various royal houses of Europe, at different times, became \"de facto\" hereditary holders of the title, notably the Ottonians (962\u20131024),the Salians (1027\u20131125) and the Hohenstaufen (1138\u20131254). Following the late medieval crisis of government, the Habsburgs kept possession of the title (with only one interruption) from 1452 to 1806. The final emperors were from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, from 1765 to 1806. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Francis II, after a devastating defeat by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz.\nThe emperor was widely perceived to rule by divine right, though he often contradicted or rivaled the pope, most notably during the Investiture controversy. The Holy Roman Empire never had an empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa exerted strong influence. Throughout its history, the position was viewed as a defender of the Catholic faith. Until Maximilian I in 1508, the Emperor-elect (\"Imperator electus\") was required to be crowned by the pope before assuming the imperial title. Charles V was the last to be crowned by the pope in 1530. There were short periods in history when the electoral college was dominated by Protestants, and the electors usually voted in their own political interest. However, even after the Reformation, the elected emperor was always a Catholic.\nTitle.\nFrom the time of Constantine I (r.\u2009306\u00a0\u2013\u00a0337), the Roman Emperors had, with very few exceptions, taken on a role as promoters and defenders of Christianity. The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Great Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to God for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define and maintain orthodoxy. The emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresies, and uphold ecclesiastical unity. Both the title and connection between Emperor and Church continued in the Eastern Roman Empire throughout the medieval period (in exile during 1204\u20131261). The ecumenical councils of the 5th to 8th centuries were convoked by the Eastern Roman Emperors.\nIn Western Europe, the title of \"Emperor in the West\" lapsed after the death of Julius Nepos in 480, although the rulers of the barbarian kingdoms continued to recognize the authority of the Eastern Emperor at least nominally well into the 6th century. While the reconquest of Justinian I had re-established Byzantine presence in the Italian Peninsula, religious frictions existed with the Papacy who sought dominance over the Church of Constantinople. Toward the end of the 8th century, the Papacy still recognised the ruler at Constantinople as the Roman Emperor, though Byzantine military support in Italy had increasingly waned, leading to the Papacy to look to the Franks for protection. In 800 Pope Leo III owed a great debt to Charlemagne, the King of the Franks and King of Italy, for securing his life and position. By this time, the Eastern Emperor Constantine VI had been deposed in 797 and replaced as monarch by his mother, Irene.\nUnder the pretext that a woman could not rule the empire, Pope Leo III declared the throne vacant and crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans (), the successor of Constantine VI as Roman emperor, using the concept of \"translatio imperii\". On his coins, the name and title used by Charlemagne is \"Karolus Imperator Augustus\". In documents, he used \"Imperator Augustus Romanum gubernans Imperium\" (\"Emperor Augustus, governing the Roman Empire\") and (\"most serene Augustus crowned by God, great peaceful emperor governing the empire of the Romans\"). The Eastern Empire eventually relented to recognizing Charlemagne and his successors as emperors, but as \"Frankish\" and \"German emperors\", at no point referring to them as Roman, a label they reserved for themselves.\nThe title of emperor in the West implied recognition by the pope. As the power of the papacy grew during the Middle Ages, popes and emperors came into conflict over church administration. The best-known and most bitter conflict was that known as the investiture controversy, fought during the 11th century between Henry\u00a0IV and Pope Gregory VII.\nAfter the coronation of Charlemagne, his successors maintained the title until the death of Berengar\u00a0I of Italy in 924. The comparatively brief interregnum between 924 and the coronation of Otto the Great in 962 is taken as marking the transition from the Frankish Empire to the Holy Roman Empire.\nUnder the Ottonians, much of the former Carolingian kingdom of Eastern Francia fell within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire.\nSince 911, the various German princes had elected the \"King of the Germans\" from among their peers. The King of the Germans would then be crowned as emperor following the precedent set by Charlemagne, during the period of 962\u20131530. Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned by the pope, and his successor, Ferdinand I, merely adopted the title of \"Emperor elect\" in 1558. The final Holy Roman emperor-elect, Francis\u00a0II, abdicated in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars that saw the Empire's final dissolution.\nThe term \"sacrum\" (i.e., \"holy\") in connection with the German Roman Empire was first used in 1157 under Frederick\u00a0I Barbarossa.\nThe Holy Roman Emperor's standard designation was \"August Emperor of the Romans\" (\"Romanorum Imperator Augustus\"). When Charlemagne was crowned in 800, he was styled as \"most serene Augustus, crowned by God, great and pacific emperor, governing the Roman Empire,\" thus constituting the elements of \"Holy\" and \"Roman\" in the imperial title.\nThe word \"Roman\" was a reflection of the principle of \"translatio imperii\" (or in this case \"restauratio imperii\") that regarded the Holy Roman emperors as the inheritors of the title of emperor of the Western Roman Empire.\nIn German-language historiography, the term \"R\u00f6misch-deutscher Kaiser\" (\"Roman-German emperor\") is used to distinguish the title from that of Roman emperor on one hand, and that of German emperor (\"Deutscher Kaiser\") on the other. The English term \"Holy Roman Emperor\" is a modern shorthand for \"emperor of the Holy Roman Empire\" not corresponding to the historical style or title, i.e., the adjective \"holy\" is not intended as modifying \"emperor\"; the English term \"Holy Roman Emperor\" gained currency in the interbellum period (the 1920s to 1930s); formerly the title had also been rendered as \"German-Roman emperor\" in English.\nSuccession.\nThe elective monarchy of the Kingdom of Germany goes back to the early 10th century, the election of Conrad I of Germany in 911 following the death without issue of Louis the Child, the last Carolingian ruler of Germany. Elections meant the kingship of Germany was only partially hereditary, unlike the kingship of England, although sovereignty frequently remained in a dynasty until there were no more male successors. The process of an election meant that the prime candidate had to make concessions, by which the voters were kept on his side, which was known as \"Wahlkapitulationen\" (electoral capitulation).\nConrad was elected by the German dukes, and it is not known precisely when the system of seven prince-electors was established. The papal decree \"Venerabilem\" by Innocent III (1202), addressed to Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, establishes the election procedure by (unnamed) princes of the realm, reserving for the pope the right to approve of the candidates. A letter of Pope Urban IV (1263), in the context of the disputed vote of 1256 and the subsequent interregnum, suggests that by \"immemorial custom\", seven princes had the right to elect the king and future emperor. The seven prince-electors are named in the Golden Bull of 1356: the archbishop of Mainz, the archbishop of Trier, the archbishop of Cologne, the king of Bohemia, the count palatine of the Rhine, the duke of Saxony and the margrave of Brandenburg.\nAfter 1438, the title remained in the House of Habsburg and Habsburg-Lorraine, with the brief exception of Charles VII, who was a Wittelsbach. Maximilian I (emperor 1508\u20131519) and his successors no longer traveled to Rome to be crowned as emperor by the pope. Maximilian, therefore, named himself elected Roman emperor (\"Erw\u00e4hlter R\u00f6mischer Kaiser\") in 1508 with papal approval. This title was in use by all his uncrowned successors. Of his successors, only Charles V, the immediate one, received a papal coronation.\nThe elector palatine's seat was conferred on the duke of Bavaria in 1621, but in 1648, in the wake of the Thirty Years' War, the elector palatine was restored, as the eighth elector. The Electorate of Hanover was added as a ninth elector in 1692, confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. The whole college was reshuffled in the German mediatization of 1803 with a total of ten electors, a mere three years before the dissolution of the Empire.\nList of emperors.\nThis list includes all 47 German monarchs crowned from Charlemagne until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (800\u20131806).\nSeveral rulers were crowned king of the Romans (king of Germany) but not emperor, although they styled themselves thus, among whom were: Conrad I and Henry the Fowler in the 10th century, and Conrad IV, Rudolf I, Adolf and Albert I during the \"interregnum\" of the late 13th century.\nTraditional historiography assumes a continuity between the Carolingian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, while a modern convention takes the coronation of Otto I in 962 as the starting point of the Holy Roman Empire (although the term \"Sacrum Imperium Romanum\" was not in use before the 13th century).\nRoman Emperors.\nOn Christmas Day, 800, Charlemagne, King of the Franks, was crowned Emperor of the Romans () by Pope Leo III, in opposition to Empress Irene, who was then ruling the Roman Empire from Constantinople. Charlemagne's descendants from the Carolingian Dynasty continued to be crowned Emperor until 899, excepting a brief period when the Imperial crown was awarded to the Widonid Dukes of Spoleto. There is some contention as to whether the Holy Roman Empire dates as far back as Charlemagne, some histories consider the Carolingian Empire to be a distinct polity from the later Holy Roman Empire as established under Otto I in 962.\nHoly Roman Emperors.\nWhile earlier Frankish and Italian monarchs had been crowned as Roman emperors, the actual Holy Roman Empire is often considered to have begun with the crowning of Frederick Barbarossa who called the empire \"the holy empire\", however in general it is already attributed to Otto I, at the time Otto was Duke of Saxony and King of Germany. Because the King of Germany was an elected position, being elected King of Germany was functionally a pre-requisite to being crowned Holy Roman Emperor. By the 13th century, the Prince-electors became formalized as a specific body of seven electors, consisting of three bishops and four secular princes. Up to the mid-14th century, the electors chose freely from among a number of dynasties. A period of dispute during the second half of the 13th century over the kingship of Germany led to there being no emperor crowned for several decades, though this ended in 1312 with the coronation of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor. The period of free election ended with the ascension of the Austrian House of Habsburg, as an unbroken line of Habsburgs held the imperial throne until the 18th century. Later a cadet branch known as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine passed it from father to son until the abolition of the Empire in 1806. Notably, from the 16th century, the Habsburgs dispensed with the requirement that emperors be crowned by the pope before exercising their office. Starting with Ferdinand I, all successive emperors forwent the traditional coronation.\n1220\u20131250: Staufen dynasty.\nThe interregnum of the Holy Roman Empire is taken to have lasted from the deposition of Frederick II by Pope Innocent IV in 1245 (or alternatively from Frederick's death in 1250 or from the death of Conrad IV in 1254) to the election of Rudolf I of Germany (1273). Rudolf was not crowned emperor, nor were his successors Adolf and Albert. The next emperor was Henry VII, crowned on 29 June 1312 by legates of Pope Clement V.\n1452\u20131740: House of Habsburg.\nIn 1508, Pope Julius II allowed Maximilian I to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as \"Electus Romanorum Imperator\" (\"elected Emperor of the Romans\"). Maximilian's successors each adopted the same titulature, usually on becoming the sole ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. Maximilian's predecessor Frederick III was the last to be crowned Emperor by the Pope in Rome, while Maximilian's successor Charles V was the last to be crowned by the pope, though in Bologna, in 1530.\nCoronation.\nThe Emperor was crowned in a special ceremony, traditionally performed by the Pope in Rome. Without that coronation, no king, despite exercising all powers, could call himself Emperor. In 1508, Pope Julius II allowed Maximilian I to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as \"Electus Romanorum Imperator\" (\"elected Emperor of the Romans\"). Maximilian's successors adopted the same titulature, usually when they became the sole ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. Maximilian's first successor Charles V was the last to be crowned Emperor.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50856", "revid": "50813202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50856", "title": "Trivial Pursuit", "text": "Board game\nTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer trivia and popular culture questions. Players move their pieces around a board, the squares they land on determining the subject of a question they are asked from a card (from six categories including \"history\" and \"science and nature\"). Each correct answer allows the player's turn to continue; a correct answer on one of the six \"category headquarters\" spaces earns a plastic wedge which is slotted into the answerer's playing piece. The object of the game is to collect all six wedges from each \"category headquarters\" space, and then return to the center \"hub\" space to answer a question in a category selected by the other players.\nSince the game's first release in 1981, numerous themed editions have been released. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as \"Star Wars\", \"Saturday Night Live\", and \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies).\nHistory.\nThe game was created on December 15, 1979, in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadians Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's \"The Gazette\", and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for \"The Canadian Press\". Various versions of the events leading up to the creation of \"Trivial Pursuit\" exist, most involving the board game \"Scrabble\". The game was designed within 45 minutes on the back of a cigarette carton. The questions were researched over 1980, and the test marketing was done in 1981. With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981 in Canada. During the development of the game, some of the early work and question writing was completed by Chris and John Haney in Weymouth Library, Dorset where they were staying with family. \nBy 1982, the game had sold 100,000 copies in Canada. Sales began in the U.S in 1983. Between 1983 1988, it sold 30 million copies of the original version; retail sales were at 750,000,000$.\nThe rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (later part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008, Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.\nBy 1986, the board game had sold 20 million units, grossing $600 million in sales. As of 2014[ [update]], more than 100 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by \"Games\" magazine. An online version of \"Trivial Pursuit\" was launched in September 2003.\nGameplay.\nThe object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of \"Trivial Pursuit\", the Geography category is blue, Entertainment is pink, History is yellow, Art &amp; Literature is originally brown, later purple, Science &amp; Nature is green, and Sports &amp; Leisure is orange. The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.\nPlaying pieces used in \"Trivial Pursuit\" are round and divided into six sections like wedges of pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called a cheese (like a wedge of cheese), can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress.\nDuring the game, players move their playing pieces around a board which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes, rolling a single die to determine how far to move. The board is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center space is a hexagonal \"hub.\" At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. After landing on a space, the player is asked a question in the category corresponding to its color. A correct answer allows the player to roll the die again and continue their turn, while a miss passes control to the next player in sequence. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Landing on a category headquarters space and answering correctly awards a wedge in that color, if the player does not yet have one; wedges are fitted into the playing pieces as they are earned. The player may move in any available direction and change directions at any category headquarters space or the hub, but may not backtrack.\n\"Roll Again\" spaces allow the player an extra die roll without having to answer a question, while landing on the hub allows a player to answer a question in the category of their choice as long as they do not yet have all six wedges. Any number of playing pieces may occupy a given space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.\nAfter collecting all six wedges and filling their playing piece, the player must land on the hub by exact count and correctly answer a question in a category chosen by the opponents in order to win the game. If the player misses the question, they must leave the hub on their next turn and return to it for another chance to win.\nEditions.\nOver the years, numerous editions of \"Trivial Pursuit\" have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the \"Genus\" edition (or \"Genus I\"). Several different general knowledge editions (such as \"Genus II\") have followed. Other editions include Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, 1990s, \"Harry Potter\", and others. In total, over 100 different editions in different languages have been printed.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Trivial Pursuit\" players complained that the 2006 version of the game was dumbed down in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.\nReception.\nThe Toy Insider mentioned that it can be \"enjoyed by baby boomers, millennials, and everyone in between\", while Board Games Land called it \"The timeless classic and the godfather of trivia games\".\nIn a review for Issue 31 of \"Games,\" Mike Shenk stated the game's questions were \"excellent in quantity, scope, and level of difficulty\" but warned that \"the wait between turns can be uncomfortably long.\" \"Games\" also included \"Trivial Pursuit\" in its Games 100 in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1986, saying \"The game\u2019s winning formula is to offer well-written, entertaining questions in a continuing flow of new categories for players of all ages and interests.\"\n\"Jeux &amp; Strat\u00e9gie\" reviewed \"Trivial Pursuit (\"as \"Remue-m\u00e9ninges\") in Issue 28, generally praising the quality and accessibility of the game's questions, but also expressing that they are sometimes subject to doubt.\nLegal action.\nWorth lawsuit.\nIn October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of \"The Trivia Encyclopedia\", \"Super Trivia\", and \"Super Trivia II\", filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of \"Trivial Pursuit\". He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and deliberately placed misinformation. One of the questions in \"Trivial Pursuit\" was \"What was Columbo's first name?\" with the answer \"Philip\". That information had been fabricated to catch anyone who might try to violate his copyright.\nThe inventors of \"Trivial Pursuit\" acknowledged that Worth's books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the \"Trivial Pursuit\" inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the ruling. Worth asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case, but the Court declined, denying certiorari in March 1988.\nWall lawsuit.\nIn 1994, David Wall of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, launched a lawsuit against the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near Sydney, Nova Scotia, when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers.\nWall's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a \"Trivial Pursuit\"-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall's friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall.\nOver the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled against Wall.\nAdaptations.\nTelevision.\nA version of \"Trivial Pursuit\", hosted by Wink Martindale, aired on The Family Channel in the United States from 1993 to 1994 (Jay Wolpert had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A syndicated version entitled \"\" aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by Christopher Knight. In September 2004, Roger Lodge hosted a sports trivia game show on ESPN entitled \"ESPN Trivial Pursuit\", which aired five episodes. A new version of the game premiered on October 3, 2024 on The CW hosted by LeVar Burton.\nBBC Television produced a \"Trivial Pursuit\" game show based on the game in the UK hosted by Rory McGrath. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on The Family Channel (now Challenge) by Tony Slattery. \nIn 1991, a local version was aired in Austria, hosted by Bernadette Schneider on ORF.\nIn Germany, Birgit Lechtermann hosted a local version for VOX from 1993 to 1994.\nIn 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled \"Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit\" aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of Jimmy Buffett and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians. The actors were Gordon Clapp as John Haney, Malcolm Stewart as Chris Haney and Bruce Pirrie as Scott Abbott.\nIn Spain, a version of the show called \"Trivial Pursuit\" was aired in 2011 and presented by Silvia Jato on Veo7.\nThe Soviet Union in 1989 bought the rights to produce its own version of the board game, and also started an official championship for family teams, finals of which were broadcast on Soviet Central Television as the game show \"Lucky Case\" (russian: \u0421\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439). After the agreement ended in 1991, the show changed their rules, dropping \"Trivial Pursuit\" elements, and continued broadcasting until 2000.\nArcade game.\nIn 1984, Bally Sente released a \"Trivial Pursuit\" arcade game. Like the board game, several variants were also subsequently released.\nHome computer games.\nBritish software company Domark released a home computer version (billed as \"Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game\") for multiple formats during the 1980s. This version included pictorial and musical questions but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game.\nLater, Domark released another version called \"Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning\", also across multiple formats. This version featured a plot about the dying Earth and significantly altered gameplay mechanics.\nHasbro Interactive released a \"Millennium Edition\" in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories:\nThere are also three different ways to answer the questions:\nThis game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People &amp; Places (blue wedge), Arts &amp; Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science &amp; Nature (brown wedge), Sports &amp; Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).\nOnline games.\nIn 1999, Sony Online Entertainment licensed \"Trivial Pursuit\" from Hasbro Interactive to release a downloadable online game on The Station@Sony (home to Everquest at the time), where up to three auto-matched players could chat with each other live while they played. A correct answer on any space earned a wedge on the category answered, the wedge spaces gave the player their choice of category, and the first person to earn four wedges was the winner. It was hosted on The Station until 2001.\nIn 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of \"Trivial Pursuit\" on the now-defunct website Uproar.com where it features five editions such as: \"Genius\", \"Silver Screen\", \"Music\", \"1980s\" and \"TV\".\nVideo games.\nTrivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including Sega CD, Wii, Windows Phone, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3. The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called \"Trivia Crack\" as well as \"Trivial Pursuit Genius Edition\" for the Nokia 3650, 6600, N-Gage, and Siemens SX1.\nUbisoft released \"Trivial Pursuit: Live!\", on 17 December 2014 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, on 18 February 2015 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It is similar to the \"Buzz!\" series. On Xbox One and PS4, it is a part from the Hasbro Game Channel, and it was released in physical on the \"Hasbro Family Fun Pack\" compilation on 25 October 2016. It was ported on 30 October 2018 on Nintendo Switch, for the \"Hasbro Game Night\" compilation in physical or individually for download. A sequel called \"Trivial Pursuit Live! 2\", published by Ubisoft and developed by Snap Finger Click, was released in 2022 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia.\nTrivial Pursuit was also adapted into a featured game on the NTN system of video-bar-trivia games. The game ran during the early 2000s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50857", "revid": "2366721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50857", "title": "Racing", "text": "Speed competition\nIn sports, racing is a competition of speed, in which competitors try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal.\nA race may be run continuously to finish or may be made up of several segments called heats, stages or legs. A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial.\nEarly records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece, which depicted running men vying for first place. A chariot race is described in Homer's \"Iliad\".\nEtymology.\nThe word \"race\" comes from a Norse word. This Norse word arrived in France during the invading of Normandy and gave the word \"raz\" which means \"swift water\" in Brittany, as in a mill race; it can be found in \"Pointe du Raz\" (the most western point of France, in Brittany), and \"raz-de-mar\u00e9e\" (tsunami). The word race to mean a \"contest of speed\" was first recorded in the 1510s.\nA race and its name are often associated with the place of origin, the means of transport and the distance of the race. As a couple of examples, see the Dakar Rally or the Athens Marathon.\nForms.\nRunning a distance is the most basic form of racing, but races may also be done by climbing, swimming, walking, or other types of human locomotion. Races may be conducted with animals such as camels, dogs, horses, pigeons, pigs, snails, or turtles. They also may be done in vehicles such as aircraft, bicycles, boats, cars, or motorcycles; or with another means of transport such as skates, skateboards, skis, sleds, snowboards, or wheelchair. In a relay race members of a team take turns in racing parts of a circuit or performing a certain racing form.\nOrienteering races add an additional task of using a map and compass to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain.\nA race can also involve any other type of goal like eating. A common speed eating challenge is a hot dog eating race, where contestants try to eat more hot dogs than the other racers.\nRacing board games and racing video games are also competitions of speed.\nRacing can also be done in more humoristic and entertaining ways such as the Sausage Race, the Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix and wok racing. Racing can be entertained from around the world.\nSprint finishes.\nA sprint finish is a racing tactic used in many forms of racing where a competitor accelerates towards top speed in the final stages of a race. This tactic is mostly associated with long-distance forms of running and cycling, which often feature large groups of competitors racing at a slower pace for much of the race \u2013 this slower aerobic racing allows for the subsequent anaerobic activity required for sprinting. The tactic relies upon keeping greater energy reserves than your opponent until the last part of the race in order to be able to reach the finish point first. It is the opposing tactic to keeping a steady optimal pace throughout a race to maximise your energy efficiency (see running economy).\nIn track and field, distances from 1500 metres upwards often feature sprint finishes. They can also be found in cross country and road running events, even up to the marathon distance. A runner's ability to sprint at the end of a race is also known as their finishing kick. Multisport races, such as the triathlon, often have running as the final section and sprint finish tactics are applied as they are in running-only events.\nIn cycling, sprint finishes are an integral part of the sport and are used in both track cycling and road cycling. Cycling sprints are often highly tactical, particularly on the track, with cyclists occasionally coming to a near halt at points before reaching a high speed finish. The longer track races such as scratch races often feature sprint finishes, as maintaining a steady pace within the peloton allows opponents to conserve energy through drafting. Road races are similar in this respect, in both short criterium races and long-distance races. Sprint tactics also form a major part of points classifications in road events, where cycling sprinters specialise in reaching an intermediate point first, thus gaining extra points and resulting prizes.\nSprint finish tactics are also used in speedskating, cross-country skiing, long-distance swimming, horse racing and other animal racing sports. The finishes of races which are outright sprinting events in themselves, such as the 100 metres track race, are not normally referred to as sprint finishes, as all competitors are already sprinting by default (thus it is not a racing tactic).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50858", "revid": "294180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50858", "title": "Tlingit", "text": "Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America\nThe Tlingit or Ling\u00edt ( ) are Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America. As of 2022[ [update]], they constitute two of the 231 federally recognized Tribes of Alaska. Most Tlingit are Alaska Natives; however, some are First Nations in Canada.\nTheir mother tongue is the Tlingit language, a Na-Dene language. Tlingit people today belong to several federally recognized Alaska Native tribes including the Angoon Community Association, Central Council of the Tlingit &amp; Haida Indian Tribes, \nChilkat Indian Village, Chilkoot Indian Association, Craig Tribal Association, Hoonah Indian Association, Ketchikan Indian Corporation, Klawock Cooperative Association, the Organized Village of Kasaan, the Organized Village of Kake, the Organized Village of Saxman, Petersburg Indian Association, Skagway Village, the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe, and the Wrangell Cooperative Association. Some citizens of the Carcross/Tagish First Nation in Yukon and the Sitka Tribe of Alaska are of Tlingit heritage. Taku Tlingit are enrolled in the Douglas Indian Association in Alaska and the Taku River Tlingit First Nation in Canada.\nThe Tlingit have a matrilineal kinship system, with children born into the mother's clan, and property and hereditary roles passing through the mother's line. Their culture and society developed in the temperate rainforest of the southeast Alaskan coast and the Alexander Archipelago. The Tlingit have maintained a complex hunter-gatherer culture based on semi-sedentary management of fisheries. Hereditary slavery was practiced extensively until it was outlawed by the United States Government. The Inland Tlingit live in the far northwestern part of the province of British Columbia and the southern Yukon in Canada.\nName.\nTheir autonym \"\u0141ing\u00edt\" means 'People of the Tides'. The Russian name ' (, from a Sugpiaq-Alutiiq term ' for the labret worn by women) or the related German name \"\" may be encountered referring to the people in older historical literature, such as Grigory Shelikhov's 1796 map of Russian America.\nTerritory.\nThe greatest territory historically occupied by the Tlingit extended from the Portland Canal along the present border between Alaska and British Columbia, north to the coast just southeast of the Copper River delta in Alaska. The Tlingit occupied almost all of the Alexander Archipelago, except the southernmost end of Prince of Wales Island and its surroundings, where the Kaigani Haida moved just before the first encounters with European explorers.\nThe Coastal Tlingit tribes controlled one of the mountain passes into the Yukon interior; they were divided into three tribes: the Chilkat Tlingit () along the Chilkat River and on Chilkat Peninsula, the Chilkoot Tlingit () and the Taku Tlingit () along the Taku River.\nInland, the Tlingit occupied areas along the major rivers that pierce the Coast Mountains and Saint Elias Mountains and flow into the Pacific, including the Alsek, Tatshenshini, Chilkat, Taku, and Stikine rivers. With regular travel up these rivers, the Tlingit developed extensive trade networks with Athabascan tribes of the interior, and commonly intermarried with them. From this regular travel and trade, a few relatively large populations of Tlingit settled around Atlin, Teslin, and Tagish Lakes, whose headwaters flow from areas near the headwaters of the Taku River.\nDelineating the current territory of the Tlingit is complicated because they live in both Canada and the United States, they lack designated reservations, other complex legal and political concerns make the situation confusing, and their population is highly mobile. They also share territory with Athabascan peoples such as the Tahltan, Kaska, and Tagish. In Canada, the Interior Tlingit communities, such as Atlin, British Columbia (Taku River Tlingit), Teslin, Yukon (Teslin Tlingit Council), and Carcross, Yukon (Carcross/Tagish First Nation) have reserves.\nTlingits in Alaska lack Indian reservations because the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) established regional corporations throughout Alaska with complex portfolios of land ownership rather than bounded reservations administered by Tribal Governments. The corporation in the Tlingit region is Sealaska Corporation, which serves the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian in Alaska.\nTlingit people participate in the commercial economy of Alaska, and typically live in privately owned housing and land. Many also possess land allotments from Sealaska or from earlier distributions predating ANCSA. Their current residences are within their historical homelands. Land around Yakutat, south through the Alaskan Panhandle, to the lakes in interior Yukon, as being , the Land of the Tlingit.\nThe extant Tlingit territory can be roughly divided into four major sections, paralleling ecological, linguistic, and cultural divisions:\nThese categories reflect differences in cultures, food harvesting, and dialects. Tlingit groups trade among themselves with neighboring communities. These academic classifications are supported by similar self-identification among the Tlingit.\nCulture.\nThe Tlingit culture is multifaceted and complex, a characteristic of Northwest Pacific Coast people with access to easily exploited rich resources. In Tlingit culture a heavy emphasis is placed upon family and kinship, and on a rich oratory tradition. Wealth and economic power are important indicators of rank, but so is generosity and proper behavior, all signs of \"good breeding\" and ties to aristocracy. Art and spirituality are incorporated in nearly all areas of Tlingit culture, with even everyday objects such as spoons and storage boxes decorated and imbued with spiritual power and historical beliefs of the Tlingits.\nTlingit society is divided into two moieties, the Raven and the Eagle. These in turn are divided into numerous clans, which are subdivided into lineages or house groups. They have a matrilineal kinship system, with descent and inheritance passed through the mother's line. These groups have heraldic crests, which are displayed on totem poles, canoes, feast dishes, house posts, weavings, jewelry, and other art forms. The Tlingits pass down \"(s)\" or blankets that represented trust. Only a Tlingit can inherit one but they can also pass it down to someone they trust, who becomes responsible for caring for it but does not rightfully own it.\nLike other Northwest Coast native peoples, the Tlingit did practice hereditary slavery.\nPhilosophy and religion.\nTlingit thought and belief, although never formally codified, was historically a fairly well organized philosophical and religious system whose basic axioms shaped the way Tlingit people viewed and interacted with the world around them. Tlingits were traditionally animists, and hunters ritually purified themselves before hunting animals. Shamans, primarily men, cured diseases, influenced weather, aided in hunting, predicted the future, and protected people against witchcraft. A central tenet of the Tlingit belief system is the reincarnation of both humans and animals.\nBetween 1886 and 1895, in the face of their shamans' inability to treat Old World diseases including smallpox, many Tlingit people converted to Orthodox Christianity. Russian Orthodox missionaries had translated their liturgy into the Tlingit language. It has been argued that they saw Eastern Orthodox Christianity as a way of resisting assimilation to the \"American way of life\", which was associated with Presbyterianism. After the introduction of Christianity, the Tlingit belief system began to erode.\nToday, some young Tlingits look back towards their traditional tribal religions and worldview for inspiration, security, and a sense of identity. While many elders converted to Christianity, contemporary Tlingit \"reconcile Christianity and the 'traditional culture.'\"\nLanguage.\nThe Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska and Western Canada speak the Tlingit language (Ling\u00edt ), which is a branch of the Na-Den\u00e9 language family. Ling\u00edt has a complex grammar and sound system and also uses certain phonemes unheard in almost any other language.\nTlingit has an estimated 200 to 400 native speakers in the United States and 100 speakers in Canada. The speakers are bilingual or near-bilingual in English. Tribes, institutions, and linguists are expending extensive effort into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and its culture. Sealaska Heritage Institute, Goldbelt Heritage Institute and the University of Alaska Southeast have Tlingit language programs, and community classes are held in Klukwan and Angoon.\nHousing.\nTlingit tribes historically built plank houses made from cedar and today call them clanhouses; these houses were built with a foundation such that they could store their belongings under the floors. It is said that these plank houses had no adhesive, nails, or any other sort of fastening devices. Clan houses were usually square or rectangular in shape and had front facing designs and totem poles to represent to which clan and moiety the makers belonged.\nEconomy.\nMany Tlingit men work in the fishing industry while women are employed at canneries or in the local handicraft industry. These handicrafts include items like wood carvings and woven baskets which are sold for practical or tourist consumption.\nHistory.\nVarious cultures of indigenous people have continuously occupied the Alaska territory for thousands of years, leading to the Tlingit. Human culture with elements related to the Tlingit originated around 10,000 years ago near the mouths of the Skeena and Nass Rivers. The historic Tlingit's first contact with Europeans came in 1741 with Russian explorers. Spanish explorers followed in 1775. Tlingits maintained their independence but suffered from epidemics of smallpox and other infectious diseases brought by the Europeans. The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic killed about 60% of the Mainland Tlingit and 37% of the Island Tlingit.\nFood.\nFood is a central part of Tlingit culture, and the land is an abundant provider. Most of the richness of intertidal life found on the beaches of Southeast Alaska can be harvested for food. Though eating off the beach could provide a fairly healthy and varied diet, eating nothing but \"beach food\" is considered contemptible among the Tlingit and a sign of poverty. Indeed, shamans and their families were required to abstain from all food gathered from the beach, and men might avoid eating beach food before battles or strenuous activities in the belief that it would weaken them spiritually and perhaps physically as well. Thus for both spiritual reasons as well as to add some variety to the diet, the Tlingit harvest many other resources for food besides those they easily find outside their front doors. No other food resource receives as much emphasis as salmon; however, seal and game are both close seconds.\nHalibut, shellfish, and seaweed traditionally provided food in the spring, while late spring and summer bring seal and salmon. Summer is a time for gathering wild and tame berries, such as salmonberry, soap berry, and currants. In fall, sea otters are hunted. Herring and eulachon are also important staples, that can be eaten fresh or dried and stored for later use. Fish provide meat, oil, and eggs. Sea mammals, such as sea lions and sea otters, are used for food and clothing materials. In the forests near their homes, Tlingit hunted deer, bear, mountain goats and other small mammals.\nGenetics.\nGenetic analyses of HLA I and HLA II genes as well as HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 gene frequencies links the Ainu people of Japan to some Indigenous peoples of the Americas, especially to populations on the Pacific Northwest Coast such as Tlingit. The scientists suggest that the main ancestor of the Ainu and of the Tlingit can be traced back to Paleolithic groups in Southern Siberia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The state capital, Honolulu, is on O\u02bbahu's southeast coast. The island of O\u02bbahu and the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands constitute the City and County of Honolulu. In 2021, O\u02bbahu had a population of 995,638, up from 953,207 in 2010 (approximately 70% of the total 1,455,271 population of the Hawaiian Islands, with approximately 81% of those living in or near the Honolulu urban area).\nO\u02bbahu is long and across. Its shoreline is long. Including small associated islands such as Ford Island plus those in K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay and off the eastern (windward) coast, its area is , making it the 20th-largest island in the United States.\nWell-known features of O\u02bbahu include Waik\u012bk\u012b, Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay, K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay, Kailua Bay, and the North Shore.\nName.\nThe Island of O\u02bbahu is often nicknamed (or translated as) \"The Gathering Place\"\".\" The translation of \"gathering place\" was suggested as recently as 1922 by \"Hawaiian Almanac\" author Thomas Thrum. Thrum possibly ignored or misplaced the \u02bbokina because the Hawaiian phrase \"\u02bbo ahu\" could be translated as \"gathering of objects\" (\"\u02bbo\" is a subject marker and \"ahu\" means \"to gather\"). The term has no other confirmed meaning in Hawaiian.\nHistory.\nIt is uncertain when O\u02bbahu was first settled by humans. Early archaeological studies suggested that Polynesian explorers from the Marquesas may have arrived as early as the 3rd century A.D., possibly with a second wave arriving from Tahiti around 1100 A.D. However, more modern analyses indicate that the first settlers probably arrived around 900\u20131200 A.D.\nThe first great king of O\u02bbahu was Ma\u02bbilik\u016bkahi, the lawmaker, who initiated a 304-year dynasty of monarchs. Kuali\u02bbi was the first of the warlike kings and was succeeded by his sons. In 1773, the throne fell upon Kahahana, the son of Elani of Ewa.\nOn January 19, 1778, O\u02bbahu was the first of the Hawaiian Islands to be sighted by Captain James Cook during his third voyage of discovery. This was the first recorded encounter of the Hawaiian Islands by non-Polynesian people. Cook bypassed O\u02bbahu, landing instead at Kauai before continuing his original mission to explore the coast of North America. The next year, on February 27, 1779, Cook's second in command, Captain Charles Clerke, became the first recorded non-Polynesian to visit O\u02bbahu when he landed at Waimea Bay. Earlier that month, Cook had been killed at Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaii when a dispute with the local people turned violent. Clerke's visit to O\u02bbahu was brief and the expedition's two ships left Waimea Bay the same day after finding it difficult to obtain fresh water.\nAt the time of Cook's visit, the Hawaiian Islands were divided among several warring chiefdoms. In 1783, Kahekili II, king of the island of Maui, conquered O\u02bbahu. He then made his son, Kalanik\u016bpule, king of O\u02bbahu turning it into a puppet state. Kalanik\u016bpule was later defeated in the Battle of Nu\u02bbuanu in 1795 by Kamehameha I who then founded the Kingdom of Hawaii. The Hawaiian islands were not fully unified until King Kaumuali\u02bbi surrendered the islands of Kaua\u02bbi and Ni\u02bbihau in 1810.29\u201360\nBy the late 18th century, Waik\u012bk\u012b was a major settlement on O\u02bbahu, serving as Kahekili II's residence after 1783.34 However, as trade with foreigners intensified, the nearby town of Honolulu came to eclipse it in size and importance due to its more accessible harbor.27In 1845, Kamehameha III moved his capital to Honolulu from Lahaina on the island of Maui.228 Later, King Kal\u0101kaua had a modern residence built in Honolulu for the royal family \u2013 the \u02bbIolani Palace which still stands as the only royal palace on American soil. In January, 1893, a group of leading American businessmen took up arms near \u02bbIolani Palace and, along with US Marines from the \"USS Boston\" that landed in Honolulu harbor, launched a successful \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" against Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani. The insurgents abolished the monarchy and established the Republic of Hawaii, which later successfully lobbied the US government for annexation to the US.\nOn the morning of December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, O\u02bbahu, bringing the United States into World War II. The attack was aimed at destroying the American will to fight and forcing the US to sue for peace. They attacked the Pacific Fleet of the United States Navy and its defending Army Air Forces and Marine Air Forces. The attack damaged or destroyed 12 American warships, destroyed 188 aircraft, and killed 2,335 American servicemen and 68 civilians (of those, 1,177 were the result of the destruction of the alone).\nAfter World War II, O\u02bbahu became a tourism and shopping destination with more than five million visitors per year, mainly from the contiguous United States and Japan.\nGeography and climate.\nLike all other Hawaiian Islands, O\u02bbahu was formed from the volcanism associated with the Hawaii hotspot; it started to grow from the sea floor 4 million years ago. Today, the island is composed of the remnants of two extinct and extensively eroded shield volcanoes: the Wai\u02bbanae and Ko\u02bbolau Ranges, with a broad valley or saddle between them. The highest point is Ka\u02bbala in the Wai\u02bbanae Range, rising to 4,003 feet (1,220 m) above sea level.\nO\u02bbahu is known for having the longest rain shower in recorded history. K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Ranch reported 247 straight days of rain from August 27, 1993, to April 30, 1994. The average temperature in O\u02bbahu is around . The island is the warmest from June through October. The winter is cooler, but still warm, with an average temperature of .\nTourism.\nO\u02bbahu, along with the rest of the State of Hawaii, relies on tourism as a driving force of the local economy. Popular tourists attractions include beaches such as Ala Moana Beach, Hanauma Bay, K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay, Ko Olina Beach Park, Waik\u012bk\u012b Beach, among others. Other tourist attractions include Ala Moana Center, Bishop Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, \u02bbIolani Palace, Diamond Head, and Kualoa Ranch.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a type of impact printer. \nAs compared to dot matrix printers that print a single column of dots at a time, this printer generally creates an entire line of dots at a time. Therefore, it is also known as a line matrix printer.\nAn advantage of this technology is its low running costs: printer hammers have a lifespan of millions to billions of dots, and ink is transferred using conventional typewriter-style ribbons.\nTechnology.\nThe most common printer to use this technology was the line-matrix printer made by Printronix and its licensees. In this type, the hammers are machined from an oval of magnetically permeable stainless steel, and the hammer-tips form vertical rows. The hammers are arranged as a \"hammerbank\"; a type of comb that oscillates horizontally to produce a line of dots. The original technology was patented by Printronix in 1974.\nThe tungsten carbide hammer is brazed to the center-top of a leaf spring. The top of this stiff spring is initially held back by a magnetic pole-piece. To produce a dot, an electromagnetic coil wrapped around the pole-piece neutralizes the magnetic field, causing the spring to release the hammer and hit the ribbon and the paper behind it, leaving behind the printed dot.\nCharacter matrix printers have also been produced.\nImprovements.\nRecent designs have performed complex optimizations in the magnetic circuit, and eliminated unwanted resonances in the spring. The result was a near-doubling of speed. Other improvements include the use of electrical discharge machining to produce complex, three-dimensional hammers that trade-off the magnetic circuit, mechanical resonances, and printing speed.\nNormal wear occurs on the pole piece when the spring rubs against it as it returns. This eventually requires the pole pieces to be reground and recertified. However, using hexavalent chrome plating on the pole-piece, combined with careful design, more than doubles speeds and improves life-span, allowing approximately a billion impressions per hammer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In a transferred, or figurative sense, it could mean a cloak or a disguise. In English, \"integument\" is a fairly modern word, its origin having been traced back to the early seventeenth century; and refers to a material or layer with which anything is enclosed, clothed, or covered in the sense of \"clad\" or \"coated\", as with a skin or husk.\nBotanical usage.\nIn botany, the term \"integument\" may be used as it is in zoology, referring to the covering of an organ. When the context indicates nothing to the contrary, the word commonly refers to an envelope covering the nucellus of the ovule. The integument may consist of one layer (unitegmic) or two layers (bitegmic), each of which consisting of two or more layers of cells. The integument is perforated by a pore, the micropyle, through which the pollen tube can enter. It may develop into the testa, or seed coat.\nZoological usage.\nThe integument of an organ in zoology typically would comprise membranes of connective tissue such as those around a kidney or liver. In referring to the integument of an animal, the usual sense is its skin and its derivatives: the integumentary system, where \"integumentary\" is a synonym of \"cutaneous\".\nIn arthropods, the integument, or external \"skin\", consists of a single layer of epithelial ectoderm from which arises the cuticle, an outer covering of chitin, the rigidity of which varies as per its chemical composition. The molting of this cuticle and growing of a larger one as part of their growth cycle is characteristic for arthropods, and ecdysozoa in general.\nDerivative terms and sundry usages.\nDerivative terms include various adjectival forms such as integumentary (e.g. system), integumental (e.g. integumental glands, \"peltate glands, the integument being raised like a bladder due to abundant secretion\") and integumented (as opposed to bare).\nOther illustrative examples of usage occur in the following articles:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50871", "revid": "1320169410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50871", "title": "Router (woodworking)", "text": "Woodworking power tool\nThe router is a power tool with a flat base and a rotating blade extending past the base. The spindle may be driven by an electric motor or by a pneumatic motor. It routs (hollows out) an area in hard material, such as wood or plastic. Routers are used most often in woodworking, especially cabinetry. They may be handheld or affixed to router tables. Some woodworkers consider the router one of the most versatile power tools.\nThere is also a traditional hand tool known as a router plane, a form of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond the base plate.\nCNC wood routers add the advantages of computer numerical control (CNC).\nThe laminate trimmer is a smaller, lighter version of the router. Although it is designed for trimming laminates, it can also be used for smaller general routing work.\nRotary tools can also be used similarly to routers with the right bits and accessories (such as plastic router bases).\nHistory.\nBefore power routers existed, the router plane was often used for the same purpose.\nAn incremental step toward modern power routers was the foot-pedal operated router, such as the Barnes Former/Shaper, available in 1877. Barnes patented a reversible rotary cutting head in 1889.\nThe first portable power router was patented in 1906 by George Kelley and marketed by the Kelley Electric Machine Company. The early electric routers were quite heavy, and only nominally \"portable\".\nIn 1915 Oscar and Rudy Onsrud produced an air-powered router, which they referred to as a Jet Motor Hand Router.\nIn the 1930s, Stanley Works acquired a line of portable routers from Roy L. Carter, and marketed an 18000 RPM electric hand router similar to modern routers.\nFurther refinement produced the plunge router, invented by ELU (now part of DeWalt) in Germany around 1949.\nModern routers are often used in place of traditional moulding planes or spindle moulder machines for edge decoration (moulding) of timber.\nProcess.\nRouting is a high speed process of cutting, trimming, and shaping wood, metal, plastic, and a variety of other materials.\nChip formation.\nRouting and milling are conceptually similar, and end mills can be used in routers, but routing wood is different from milling metal in terms of the mechanics. Chip formation is different, so the optimal tool geometry is different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers can run at extremely high speeds, so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of Type I chips cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90\u00b0, and so a Type III chip forms, with waste material produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held.\nWhen milling metals, the material is relatively ductile, although remaining strong even at a small scale. A Type II chip forms, and waste may be produced as continuous swarf. Cutter forces are high, so milling machines must be robust and rigid, usually substantial constructions of cast iron.\nIntermediate materials, such as plastics and sometimes soft aluminium, may be cut by either method, though routing aluminium is usually more of an improvised expedient than a production process, and is noisy and hard on tools.\nProcess characteristics.\nRouting is usually limited to soft metals (aluminium etc.) and rigid non-metals. Specially designed cutters are used for a variety of patterns, cuts, and edging. Both hand controlled and machine controlled/aided routers are common today.\nWorkpiece geometry.\nRouting is a shaping process that produces finished edges and shapes. Some materials that are difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can be shaped and finished neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also be shaped using routers.\nMoulding.\nThe spindle router is positioned at the finer end of the scale of work done by a molding spindle. That is to say it is able to cut grooves, edge molding, and chamfer or radius the edge of a piece of wood. It is also possible to use it for cutting some joints. The shape of cut that is created is determined by the size and shape of the bit (cutter) held in the collet and the depth by the depth adjustment of the sole plate.\nVariety of routers.\nThere are a variety of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different manufacturers produce the routers for different wood works, as plunge routers, fixed-base wood routers, combo routers, variable-speed routers, laminate trimmers, CNC wood routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can be used as a fixed-base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3-horsepower router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on/off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table. This makes the tool even more versatile and stable.\nThe purpose of multiple handle arrangements depends on the bit. Control is easier with different configurations. For example, when shaping the edge of a fine table top, many users prefer a D handle, with variable speed, as it seems to permit better control and burning the wood can be minimized.\nRouters have many uses. With the help of the multitude of jigs and various bits, they are capable of producing dovetails, mortises, and tenons, moldings of infinite varieties, dados, rabbets/rebates, raised-panel doors and frames, cutting circles, and so much more.\nFeatures of the modern spindle router.\nThe tool usually consists of a base housing a vertically mounted universal electric motor with a collet on the end of its shaft. The bit is height-adjustable to allow protrusion through an opening in a flat sole plate, usually via adjusting the motor-mounting height (the mechanism of adjustment is widely varied among manufacturers). Control of the router is derived from a handle or knob on each side of the device, or by the more recently developed \"D-handle\".\nThere are two standard types of router\u2014plunge and fixed. When using a plunge-base router, the sole of the base is placed on the face of the work with the cutting bit raised above the work, then the motor is turned on and the cutter is lowered into the work. With a fixed-base router, the cut depth is set before the tool is turned on. The sole plate is then either rested flat on the workpiece overhanging the edge so that the cutting bit is not contacting the work (and then entering the work from the side once the motor is turned on), or the sole plate is placed at an angle with the bit above the work and the bit is \"rocked\" over into the work once the motor is turned on. In each case, the bit cuts its way in, but the plunge router does it in a more refined way, although the bit used must be shaped so it bores into the wood when lowered.\nThe baseplate (sole plate) is generally circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) and may be used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.\nTable mounted router.\nA router may be mounted upside down in a router table or bench. The router's base plate is mounted to the underside of the table, with a hole allowing the bit to protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some router operations safer to execute. A router table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.\nA simple router table consists of a rigid top with the router bolted or screwed directly to the underside. More complex solutions can be developed to allow the router to be easily removed from the table as well as facilitate adjusting the router's bit height using a \"lift\" mechanism; there is a wide range of commercially available systems.\nIn this mode, the router can perform tasks similar to a spindle moulder. For smaller, lighter jobs, the router used in this way can be more convenient than the spindle moulder, with the task of set up being somewhat faster. There is also a much wider range of bit profiles available for the router, although the size is limited.\nThe router table is usually oriented so that the router bit is vertical and the table over which the work is passed is horizontal. Variations on this include the horizontal router table, in which the table remains horizontal but the router is mounted vertically above the table, so that the router bit cuts from the side. This alternative is for edge operations, such as panel raising and slot cutting.\nAvailable cutters.\nRouter bits come in a large variety of designs to create either decorative effects or joinery aids. Generally, they are classified as either high-speed steel (HSS) or carbide-tipped, however some recent innovations such as solid carbide bits provide even more variety for specialized tasks.\nAside from the materials they are made of, bits can be classified as edge bits or non-edge bits, and whether the bit is designed to be \"anti-kickback\". Edge bits have a small wheel bearing to act as a fence against the work in making edge moldings. These bearings can be changed by using commercially available bearing kits. Changing the bearing, in effect, changes the diameter of the cutting edge. This is especially important with rabbeting/rebating bits. Non-edge bits require the use of a fence, either on a router table or attached to the work or router. Anti-kickback bits employ added non-cutting bit material around the circumference of the bit's shoulders which serves to limit feed-rate. This reduces the chance that the workpiece is pushed too deeply into the bit (which would result in significant kickback from the cutting edge being unable to compensate).\nBits also differ by the diameter of their shank, with &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442-inch, 12\u00a0mm, 10\u00a0mm, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20448-inch, 8\u00a0mm and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444-inch and 6\u00a0mm shanks (ordered from thickest to thinnest) being the most common. Half-inch bits cost more but, being stiffer, are less prone to vibration (giving smoother cuts) and are less likely to break than the smaller sizes. Care must be taken to ensure the bit shank and router collet sizes match exactly. Failure to do so can cause permanent damage to either or both and can lead to the dangerous situation of the bit coming out of the collet during operation. Many routers come with removable collets for the popular shank sizes (in the US &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\u00a0in and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444\u00a0in, in Great Britain &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442\u00a0in, 8\u00a0mm and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444\u00a0in, and metric sizes in Europe\u2014although in the United States the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20448\u00a0in and 8\u00a0mm sizes are often only available for an extra cost).\nMany modern routers allow the speed of the bit's rotation to be varied. A slower rotation allows bits of larger cutting diameter to be used safely. Typical speeds range from 8,000 to 30,000 rpm.\nRouter bits can be made to match almost any imaginable profile. Custom router bits can be ordered. They are especially beneficial for home restoration projects, where production of the original trim and molding has been discontinued.\nSometimes complementary bits come in sets designed to facilitate the joinery used in frame and panel construction. One bit is designed to cut the grove in the rail and stile pieces while the other shapes the edge of the panel to fit in the grove.\nCNC router.\nA CNC wood router is a computer controlled machine to which the router or spindle mounts. The CNC Machine can be either a moving gantry style, where the table is fixed and the router spindle moves over it, or fixed bridge design, where the table moves underneath the router spindle, or hand-held style, where the operator moves the machine to the area to be cut and the machine controls the fine adjustments. CAD/CAM software programming is used to model the part that is to be created in the computer and then create a tool path for the machine to follow to cut out the part. The CNC moves along three axes (X-Y-Z). Most CNC routers have a three motor drive system utilizing either servo or stepper motors. More advanced routers use a four motor system for added speed and accuracy.\nSimilar tools.\nA tool similar to a router, but designed to hold smaller cutting bits\u2014thereby making it easier to handle for small jobs\u2014is a laminate trimmer.\nA related tool, called a \"spindle moulder\" (UK) or shaper (North America), is used to hold \"larger\" cutter heads and can be used for deeper or larger-diameter cuts. Another related machine is the pin router, a larger static version of the hand electric router but normally with a much more powerful motor and other features such as automatic template copying.\nSome profile cutters use a cutting head reminiscent of a spindle router. These should not be confused with profile cutters used for steel plate which use a flame as the cutting method.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50873", "revid": "48105367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50873", "title": "Feather", "text": "Body-covering structure of birds\nFeathers are epidermal growths that form a distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on both avian (bird) and some non-avian dinosaurs and other archosaurs. They are the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates and an example of a complex evolutionary novelty. They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups.\nAlthough feathers cover most of the bird's body, they arise only from certain well-defined tracts on the skin. They aid in flight, thermal insulation, and waterproofing. In addition, coloration helps in communication and protection. The study of feathers is called plumology (or plumage science).\nPeople use feathers in many ways that are practical, cultural, and religious. Feathers are both soft and excellent at trapping heat; thus, they are sometimes used in high-class bedding, especially pillows, blankets, and mattresses. They are also used as filling for winter clothing and outdoor bedding, such as quilted coats and sleeping bags. Goose and eider down have great \"loft\", the ability to expand from a compressed, stored state to trap large amounts of compartmentalized, insulating air. Feathers of large birds (most often geese) have been and are used to make quill pens. Historically, the hunting of birds for decorative and ornamental feathers has endangered some species and helped to contribute to the extinction of others. Today, feathers used in fashion and in military headdresses and clothes are obtained as a waste product of poultry farming, including chickens, geese, turkeys, pheasants, and ostriches. These feathers are dyed and manipulated to enhance their appearance, as poultry feathers are naturally often dull in appearance compared to the feathers of wild birds.\nEtymology.\nFeather derives from the Old English \"fe\u00feer\", which is of Germanic origin; related to Dutch \"veer\" and German \"Feder\", from an Indo-European root shared by Sanskrit's \"patra\" meaning 'wing', Latin's \"penna\" meaning 'feather', and Greek's \"pteron\", \"pterux\" meaning 'wing'.\nQuills, which were early pens used for writing, were made from feathers. The word pen itself is derived from the Latin \"penna\", meaning feather. The French word \"plume\" can mean \"feather\", \"quill\", or \"pen\".\nStructures and characteristics.\nFeathers are among the most complex integumentary appendages found in vertebrates and are formed in tiny follicles in the epidermis, or outer skin layer, that produce keratin proteins. The \u03b2-keratins in feathers, beaks and claws \u2013 and the claws, scales and shells of reptiles \u2013 are composed of protein strands hydrogen-bonded into \u03b2-pleated sheets, which are then further twisted and crosslinked by disulfide bridges into structures even tougher than the \u03b1-keratins of mammalian hair, horns and hooves. The exact signals that induce the growth of feathers on the skin are not known, but it has been found that the transcription factor cDermo-1 induces the growth of feathers on skin and scales on the leg.\nClassification.\nThere are two basic types of feather: vaned feathers which cover the exterior of the body, and down feathers which are underneath the vaned feathers. The pennaceous feathers are vaned feathers. Also called contour feathers, pennaceous feathers arise from tracts and cover the entire body. A third rarer type of feather, the filoplume, is hairlike and are closely associated with pennaceous feathers and are often entirely hidden by them, with one or two filoplumes attached and sprouting from near the same point of the skin as each pennaceous feather, at least on a bird's head, neck and trunk. Filoplumes are entirely absent in ratites. In some passerines, filoplumes arise exposed beyond the pennaceous feathers on the neck. The remiges, or flight feathers of the wing, and rectrices, or flight feathers of the tail, are the most important feathers for flight. A typical vaned feather features a main shaft, called the rachis. Fused to the rachis are a series of branches, or barbs; the barbs themselves are also branched and form the barbules. These barbules have minute hooks called barbicels for cross-attachment. Down feathers are fluffy because they lack barbicels, so the barbules float free of each other, allowing the down to trap air and provide excellent thermal insulation. At the base of the feather, the rachis expands to form the hollow tubular \"calamus\" (or quill) which inserts into a follicle in the skin. The basal part of the calamus is without vanes. This part is embedded within the skin follicle and has an opening at the base (proximal umbilicus) and a small opening on the side (distal umbilicus).\nHatchling birds of some species have a special kind of natal down feathers (neossoptiles) which are pushed out when the normal feathers (teleoptiles) emerge.\nFlight feathers are stiffened so as to work against the air in the downstroke but yield in other directions. It has been observed that the orientation pattern of \u03b2-keratin fibers in the feathers of flying birds differs from that in flightless birds: the fibers are better aligned along the shaft axis direction towards the tip, and the lateral walls of rachis region show structure of crossed fibers.\nFunctions.\nFeathers insulate birds from water and cold temperatures. They may also be plucked to line the nest and provide insulation to the eggs and young. The individual feathers in the wings and tail play important roles in controlling flight. Some species have a crest of feathers on their heads. Although feathers are light, a bird's plumage weighs two or three times more than its skeleton, since many bones are hollow and contain air sacs. Color patterns serve as camouflage against predators for birds in their habitats, and serve as camouflage for predators looking for a meal. As with fish, the top and bottom colors may be different in order to provide camouflage during flight. Striking differences in feather patterns and colors are part of the sexual dimorphism of many bird species and are particularly important in the selection of mating pairs. In some cases, there are differences in the UV reflectivity of feathers across sexes, even though no differences in color are noted in the visible range. The wing feathers of male club-winged manakins \"Machaeropterus deliciosus\" have special structures that are used to produce sounds by stridulation.\nSome birds have a supply of powder down feathers that grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from the ends of the barbules. These particles produce a powder that sifts through the feathers on the bird's body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather conditioner. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage, as in the pigeons and parrots, or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder. Waterproofing can be lost by exposure to emulsifying agents due to human pollution. Feathers can then become waterlogged, causing the bird to sink. It is also very difficult to clean and rescue birds whose feathers have been fouled by oil spills. The feathers of cormorants soak up water and help to reduce buoyancy, thereby allowing the birds to swim submerged.\nBristles are stiff, tapering feathers with a large rachis but few barbs. Rictal bristles are found around the eyes and bill. They may serve a similar purpose to eyelashes and vibrissae in mammals. Although there is as yet no clear evidence, it has been suggested that rictal bristles have sensory functions and may help insectivorous birds to capture prey. In one study, willow flycatchers (\"Empidonax traillii\") were found to catch insects equally well before and after removal of the rictal bristles.\nGrebes are peculiar in their habit of ingesting their own feathers and feeding them to their young. Observations on their diet of fish and the frequency of feather eating suggest that ingesting feathers, particularly down from their flanks, aids in forming easily ejectable pellets.\nDistribution.\nContour feathers are not uniformly distributed on the skin of the bird except in some groups such as the penguins, ratites and screamers. In most birds the feathers grow from specific tracts of skin called \"pterylae\"; between the pterylae there are regions which are free of feathers called \"apterylae\" (or \"apteria\"). Filoplumes and down may arise from the apterylae. The arrangement of these feather tracts, pterylosis or pterylography, varies across bird families and has been used in the past as a means for determining the evolutionary relationships of bird families. Species that incubate their own eggs often lose their feathers on a region of their belly, forming a brooding patch.\nColoration.\nThe colors of feathers are produced by pigments, by microscopic structures that can refract, reflect, or scatter selected wavelengths of light, or by a combination of both.\nMost feather pigments are melanins (brown and beige pheomelanins, black and grey eumelanins) and carotenoids (red, yellow, orange); other pigments occur only in certain taxa \u2013 the yellow to red psittacofulvins (found in some parrots) and the red turacin and green turacoverdin (porphyrin pigments found only in turacos).\nStructural coloration is involved in the production of blue colors, iridescence, most ultraviolet reflectance and in the enhancement of pigmentary colors. Structural iridescence has been reported in fossil feathers dating back 40 million years. White feathers lack pigment and scatter light diffusely; albinism in birds is caused by defective pigment production, though structural coloration will not be affected (as can be seen, for example, in blue-and-white budgerigars).\nThe blues and bright greens of many parrots are produced by constructive interference of light reflecting from different layers of structures in feathers. In the case of green plumage, in addition to yellow, the specific feather structure involved is called by some the Dyck texture. Melanin is often involved in the absorption of light; in combination with a yellow pigment, it produces a dull olive-green.\nIn some birds, feather colors may be created, or altered, by secretions from the uropygial gland, also called the preen gland. The yellow bill colors of many hornbills are produced by such secretions. It has been suggested that there are other color differences that may be visible only in the ultraviolet region, but studies have failed to find evidence. The oil secretion from the uropygial gland may also have an inhibitory effect on feather bacteria.\nThe reds, orange and yellow colors of many feathers are caused by various carotenoids. Carotenoid-based pigments might be honest signals of fitness because they are derived from special diets and hence might be difficult to obtain, and/or because carotenoids are required for immune function and hence sexual displays come at the expense of health.\nA bird's feathers undergo wear and tear and are replaced periodically during the bird's life through molting. New feathers, known when developing as blood, or pin feathers, depending on the stage of growth, are formed through the same follicles from which the old ones were fledged. The presence of melanin in feathers increases their resistance to abrasion. One study notes that melanin based feathers were observed to degrade more quickly under bacterial action, even compared to unpigmented feathers from the same species, than those unpigmented or with carotenoid pigments. However, another study the same year compared the action of bacteria on pigmentations of two song sparrow species and observed that the darker pigmented feathers were more resistant; the authors cited other research also published in 2004 that stated increased melanin provided greater resistance. They observed that the greater resistance of the darker birds confirmed Gloger's rule.\nAlthough sexual selection plays a major role in the development of feathers, in particular, the color of the feathers it is not the only conclusion available. New studies are suggesting that the unique feathers of birds are also a large influence on many important aspects of avian behavior, such as the height at which different species build their nests. Since females are the prime caregivers, evolution has helped select females to display duller colors down so that they may blend into the nesting environment. The position of the nest and whether it has a greater chance of being under predation has exerted constraints on female birds' plumage. A species of bird that nests on the ground, rather than the canopy of the trees, will need to have much duller colors in order not to attract attention to the nest. The height study found that birds that nest in the canopies of trees often have many more predator attacks due to the brighter color of feathers that the female displays. Another influence of evolution that could play a part in why feathers of birds are so colorful and display so many patterns could be due to that birds developed their bright colors from the vegetation and flowers that thrive around them. Birds develop their bright colors from living around certain colors. Most bird species often blend into their environment, due to some degree of camouflage, so if the species habitat is full of colors and patterns, the species would eventually evolve to blend in to avoid being eaten. Birds' feathers show a large range of colors, even exceeding the variety of many plants, leaf, and flower colors.\nFeathers used in mating displays.\nIn sexually dimorphic birds, males often develop distinct coloration or specialized ornamental feathers used in mating displays to attract mates. There are several proposed theories for the origin of ornamental feathers, with the first observed instances being observed in multiple early theropods (see subsection on Origins below).\nThe most well-known example of ornamental feathers used in mating is male peacocks (\"Pavo cristatus)\". Males sport a long train of covert feathers with distinct eyespot patterns, which are coupled with a vigorous display in the courtship process. When performing these displays, males flash their train in a fanning motion, showing their plumage off to females.\nThe evolutionary origin of the peacock's ornamental feathers and display remains unclear, with multiple theories proposing a combination of factors. In a study observing peacock display behavior, captive male peacocks had the length of their trains, the length of their torsi, and the density of the eyespots measured. They were then released into enclosures with female peacocks, with their mating success measured in successful copulations. The results showed that female choice was not influenced by train size, but by eyespot density. This suggests that male peacocks' elaborate feathers and displays evolved as a result of female choice, particularly favoring males with more eyespot patterns.\nStructure and use.\nThe bone morphology of the radius, ulna, and humerus which support ornamental feathers can also affect female choice. For example, the bone morphology of male club-winged manakins (\"Machaeropterus deliciosus\") is highly specialized, with larger and denser ulnas that are bigger in volume and have higher mineral density compared to others in the manakin family. The secondary feathers are enlarged and are used in mating displays; males knock the tips of the enlarged feathers together repeatedly in a \"jump and snap\" motion, producing a distinctive sound. The display ends with a \"beard up\" motion, in which the male shows off their long yellow throat feathers rapidly while performing jumps.\nTail Length.\nTail length is another example of feathers playing a role in mate choice, as seen in the long-tailed widowbird (\"Euplectes progne\"). The males of this species have extremely long tail feathers during the mating season, which correlates with higher success in attracting mates. In a famous study testing the correlation between tail length and fitness, male widowbirds had their tail lengths artificially shortened or elongated and those with elongated tails had higher mating success. It was alternatively proposed that longer ornamental feathers played a role in territory defense and intrasexual competition, as a way of displaying dominance, but there was\u00a0 no substantial evidence supporting this theory.\nOrigin of ornamental feathers.\nOne possible origin of ornamental feathers is in the megalosauroid \"Sciurumimus\", which have a simple, monofilamentous morphology. Monofilamentous feathers have a single, thread-like structure, as opposed to branches or barbs, and are considered to be the earliest form of feather. Monofilamentous feathers have also been found in a wide range of taxa, though \"Sciurumimus\" was the earliest. Monofilamentous feathers have also been found in the tyrannosauroid \"Yutyrannus\" and the therizinosauroid \"Beipiaosaurus\", with proportionally broader monofilaments that were likely a form of early specialized ornamental feathers.\nAn analysis of feathers discovered in Burmese amber revealed unusual coloration along the rachis, suggesting they bore striking color patterns. Early ornamental feathers in the genus \"Schizooura\" suggest an aerodynamic use as well as an ornamental one, with the pin-tailed shape being too narrow to impact aerodynamics.\nParasites.\nThe feather surface is the home for some ectoparasites, notably feather lice (Phthiraptera) and feather mites. Feather lice typically live on a single host and can move only from parents to chicks, between mating birds, and, occasionally, by phoresy. This life history has resulted in most of the parasite species being specific to the host and coevolving with the host, making them of interest in phylogenetic studies.\nFeather holes are chewing traces of lice (most probably \"Brueelia\" spp. lice) on the wing and tail feathers. They were described on barn swallows, and because of easy countability, many evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral publications use them to quantify the intensity of infestation.\nParasitic cuckoos which grow up in the nests of other species also have host-specific feather lice and these seem to be transmitted only after the young cuckoos leave the host nest.\nBirds maintain their feather condition by preening and bathing in water or dust. It has been suggested that a peculiar behavior of birds, anting, in which ants are introduced into the plumage, helps to reduce parasites, but no supporting evidence has been found.\nHuman usage.\nUtilitarian.\nBird feathers have long been used for fletching arrows. Colorful feathers such as those belonging to pheasants have been used to decorate fishing lures.\nFeathers are also valuable in aiding the identification of species in forensic studies, particularly in bird strikes to aircraft. The ratios of hydrogen isotopes in feathers help in determining the geographic origins of birds. Feathers may also be useful in the non-destructive sampling of pollutants.\nThe poultry industry produces a large amount of feathers as waste, which, like other forms of keratin, are slow to decompose. Feather waste has been used in a number of industrial applications as a medium for culturing microbes, biodegradable polymers, and production of enzymes. Feather proteins have been tried as an adhesive for wood board.\nSome groups of Native people in Alaska have used ptarmigan feathers as temper (non-plastic additives) in pottery manufacture since the first millennium BC in order to promote thermal shock resistance and strength.\nIn religion and culture.\nEagle feathers have great cultural and spiritual value to Native Americans in the United States and First Nations peoples in Canada as religious objects. In the United States, the religious use of eagle and hawk feathers is governed by the eagle feather law, a federal law limiting the possession of eagle feathers to certified and enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes.\nIn South America, brews made from the feathers of condors are used in traditional medications. In India, feathers of the Indian peacock have been used in traditional medicine for snakebite, infertility, and coughs.\nMembers of Scotland's Clan Campbell are known to wear feathers on their bonnets to signify authority within the clan. Clan chiefs wear three, chieftains wear two and an armiger wears one. Any member of the clan who does not meet the criteria is not authorized to wear feathers as part of traditional garb and doing so is considered presumptuous.\nDuring the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, there was a booming international trade in plumes for extravagant women's hats and other headgear (including in Victorian fashion). Frank Chapman noted in 1886 that feathers of as many as 40 species of birds were used in about three-fourths of the 700 ladies' hats that he observed in New York City. For instance, South American hummingbird feathers were used in the past to dress some of the miniature birds featured in singing bird boxes. This trade caused severe losses to bird populations (for example, egrets and whooping cranes).\nConservationists led campaigns against the use of feathers in hats, contributing to important measures for environmental protection and to changes in fashion. Examples are the creation of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the UK in 1889, or the passage of the Lacey Act in USA in 1900, The ornamental feather market then largely collapsed.\nMore recently, rooster plumage has become a popular trend as a hairstyle accessory, with feathers formerly used as fishing lures now being used to provide color and style to hair.\nFeather products manufacturing in Europe has declined in the last 60 years, mainly due to competition from Asia.\nFeathers have adorned hats at many prestigious events such as weddings and Ladies Day at racecourses (Royal Ascot).\nEvolution.\nFunctional considerations.\nThe functional view on the evolution of feathers has traditionally focused on insulation, flight and display. Discoveries of non-flying Late Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs in China, however, suggest that flight could not have been the original primary function as the feathers simply would not have been capable of providing any form of lift. There have been suggestions that feathers may have had their original function in thermoregulation, waterproofing, or even as sinks for metabolic wastes such as sulphur. Recent discoveries are argued to support a thermoregulatory function, at least in smaller dinosaurs. Some researchers even argue that thermoregulation arose from bristles on the face that were used as tactile sensors. While feathers have been suggested as having evolved from reptilian scales, there are numerous objections to that idea, and more recent explanations have arisen from the paradigm of evolutionary developmental biology. Theories of the scale-based origins of feathers suggest that the planar scale structure was modified for development into feathers by splitting to form the webbing; however, that developmental process involves a tubular structure arising from a follicle and the tube splitting longitudinally to form the webbing. The number of feathers per unit area of skin is higher in smaller birds than in larger birds, and this trend points to their important role in thermal insulation, since smaller birds lose more heat due to the relatively larger surface area in proportion to their body weight. The miniaturization of birds also played a role in the evolution of powered flight. The coloration of feathers is believed to have evolved primarily in response to sexual selection. In fossil specimens of the paravian \"Anchiornis huxleyi\" and the pterosaur \"Tupandactylus imperator\", the features are so well preserved that the melanosome (pigment cells) structure can be observed. By comparing the shape of the fossil melanosomes to melanosomes from extant birds, the color and pattern of the feathers on \"Anchiornis\" and \"Tupandactylus\" could be determined. \"Anchiornis\" was found to have black-and-white-patterned feathers on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with a reddish-brown crest. This pattern is similar to the coloration of many extant bird species, which use plumage coloration for display and communication, including sexual selection and camouflage. It is likely that non-avian dinosaur species utilized plumage patterns for similar functions as modern birds before the origin of flight. In many cases, the physiological condition of the birds (especially males) is indicated by the quality of their feathers, and this is used (by the females) in mate choice. Additionally, when comparing different \"Ornithomimus edmontonicus\" specimens, older individuals were found to have a pennibrachium (a wing-like structure consisting of elongate feathers), while younger ones did not. This suggests that the pennibrachium was a secondary sex characteristic and likely had a sexual function.\nMolecular evolution.\nSeveral genes have been found to determine feather development. They will be key to understand the evolution of feathers. For instance, some genes convert scales into feathers or feather-like structures when expressed or induced in bird feet, such as the scale-feather converters Sox2, Zic1, Grem1, Spry2, and Sox18.\nFeathers and scales are made up of two distinct forms of keratin, and it was long thought that each type of keratin was exclusive to each skin structure (feathers and scales). However, feather keratin is also present in the early stages of development of American alligator scales. This type of keratin, previously thought to be specific to feathers, is suppressed during embryological development of the alligator and so is not present in the scales of mature alligators. The presence of this homologous keratin in both birds and crocodilians indicates that it was inherited from a common ancestor.\nThis may suggest that crocodilian scales, bird and dinosaur feathers, and pterosaur pycnofibres are all developmental expressions of the same primitive archosaur skin structures; suggesting that feathers and pycnofibers could be homologous. Molecular dating methods in 2011 show that the subfamily of feather \u03b2-keratins found in extant birds started to diverge 143 million years ago, suggesting the pennaceous feathers of \"Anchiornis\" were not made of the feather \u03b2-keratins present in extant birds. However, a study of fossil feathers from the dinosaur Sinosauropteryx and other fossils revealed traces of beta-sheet proteins, using infrared spectroscopy and sulfur-X-ray spectroscopy. The presence of abundant alpha-proteins in some fossil feathers was shown to be an artefact of the fossilization process, as beta-protein structures are readily altered to alpha-helices during thermal degradation. In 2019, scientists found that genes for the production of feathers evolved at the base of archosauria, supporting that feathers were present at early ornithodirans and is consistent with the fossil record.\nFeathered dinosaurs.\nSeveral non-avian dinosaurs had feathers on their limbs that would not have functioned for flight. One theory suggests that feathers originally evolved on dinosaurs due to their insulation properties; then, small dinosaur species which grew longer feathers may have found them helpful in gliding, leading to the evolution of proto-birds like \"Archaeopteryx\" and \"Microraptor zhaoianus\". Another theory posits that the original adaptive advantage of early feathers was their pigmentation or iridescence, contributing to sexual preference in mate selection. Dinosaurs that had feathers or protofeathers include \"Pedopenna daohugouensis\" and \"Dilong paradoxus\", a tyrannosauroid which is 60 to 70 million years older than \"Tyrannosaurus rex.\"\nThe majority of dinosaurs known to have had feathers or protofeathers are theropods, however featherlike \"filamentous integumentary structures\" are also known from the ornithischian dinosaurs \"Tianyulong\" and \"Psittacosaurus\". The exact nature of these structures is still under study. However, it is believed that the stage-1 feathers (see Evolutionary stages section below) such as those seen in these two ornithischians likely functioned in display. In 2014, the ornithischian \"Kulindadromeus\" was reported as having structures resembling stage-3 feathers. The likelihood of scales evolving on early dinosaur ancestors are high. However, this was by assuming that primitive pterosaurs were scaly. A 2016 study analyzes the pulp morphology of the tail bristles of \"Psittacosaurus\" and finds they are similar to feathers but notes that they are also similar to the bristles on the head of the Congo peafowl, the beard of the turkey, and the spine on the head of the horned screamer. A reestimation of maximum likelihoods by paleontologist Thomas Holtz finds that filaments were more likely to be the ancestral state of dinosaurs.\nIn 2010, a carcharodontosaurid named \"Concavenator corcovatus\" was found to have remiges on the ulna suggesting it might have had quill-like structures on the arms. However, Foth et al. 2014 disagrees with the publication where they point out that the bumps on the ulna of \"Concavenator\" are on the anterolateral which is unlike remiges which are in a posterolateral on the ulna of some birds, they consider it more likely that these are attachments for interosseous ligaments. This was refuted by Cuesta Fidalgo and her colleagues, they pointed out that these bumps on the ulna are posterolateral which is unlike that of interosseous ligaments.\nSince the 1990s, dozens of feathered dinosaurs have been discovered in the clade Maniraptora, which includes the clade Avialae and the recent common ancestors of birds, Oviraptorosauria and Deinonychosauria. In 1998, the discovery of a feathered oviraptorosaurian, \"Caudipteryx zoui\", challenged the notion of feathers as a structure exclusive to Avialae. Buried in the Yixian Formation in Liaoning, China, \"C. zoui\" lived during the Early Cretaceous Period. Present on the forelimbs and tails, their integumentary structure has been accepted as pennaceous vaned feathers based on the rachis and herringbone pattern of the barbs. In the clade Deinonychosauria, the continued divergence of feathers is also apparent in the families Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Branched feathers with rachis, barbs, and barbules were discovered in many members including \"Sinornithosaurus millenii\", a dromaeosaurid found in the Yixian formation (124.6 MYA).\nPreviously, a temporal paradox existed in the evolution of feathers\u2014theropods with highly derived bird-like characteristics occurred at a later time than \"Archaeopteryx\"\u2014suggesting that the descendants of birds arose before the ancestor. However, the discovery of \"Anchiornis huxleyi\" in the Late Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation (160 MYA) in western Liaoning in 2009\nresolved this paradox. By predating \"Archaeopteryx\", \"Anchiornis\" proves the existence of a modernly feathered theropod ancestor, providing insight into the dinosaur-bird transition. The specimen shows distribution of large pennaceous feathers on the forelimbs and tail, implying that pennaceous feathers spread to the rest of the body at an earlier stage in theropod evolution. The development of pennaceous feathers did not replace earlier filamentous feathers. Filamentous feathers are preserved alongside modern-looking flight feathers \u2013 including some with modifications found in the feathers of extant diving birds \u2013 in 80 million year old amber from Alberta.\nTwo small wings trapped in amber dating to 100 mya show plumage existed in some bird predecessors. The wings most probably belonged to enantiornithes, a diverse group of avian dinosaurs.\nA large phylogenetic analysis of early dinosaurs by Matthew Baron, David B. Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) found that Theropoda is actually more closely related to Ornithischia, to which it formed the sister group within the clade Ornithoscelida. The study also suggested that if the feather-like structures of theropods and ornithischians are of common evolutionary origin then it would be possible that feathers were restricted to Ornithoscelida. If so, then the origin of feathers would have likely occurred as early as the Middle Triassic, though this has been disagreed upon. The lack of feathers present in large sauropods and ankylosaurs could be that feathers were suppressed by genomic regulators.\nEvolutionary stages.\nSeveral studies of feather development in the embryos of modern birds, coupled with the distribution of feather types among various prehistoric bird precursors, have allowed scientists to attempt a reconstruction of the sequence in which feathers first evolved and developed into the types found on modern birds.\nFeather evolution was broken down into the following stages by Xu and Guo in 2009:\nHowever, Foth (2011) showed that some of these purported stages (stages 2 and 5 in particular) are likely simply artifacts of preservation caused by the way fossil feathers are crushed and the feather remains or imprints are preserved. Foth re-interpreted stage 2 feathers as crushed or misidentified feathers of at least stage 3, and stage 5 feathers as crushed stage 6 feathers.\nThe following simplified diagram of dinosaur relationships follows these results, and shows the likely distribution of plumaceous (downy) and pennaceous (vaned) feathers among dinosaurs and prehistoric birds. The diagram follows one presented by Xu and Guo (2009) modified with the findings of Foth (2011). The numbers accompanying each name refer to the presence of specific feather stages. Note that 's' indicates the known presence of scales on the body.\nIn pterosaurs.\nPterosaurs were long known to have filamentous fur-like structures covering their body known as pycnofibres, which were generally considered distinct from the \"true feathers\" of birds and their dinosaur kin. However, a 2018 study of two small, well-preserved pterosaur fossils from the Jurassic of Inner Mongolia, China indicated that pterosaurs were covered in an array of differently-structured pycnofibres (rather than just filamentous ones), with several of these structures displaying diagnostic features of feathers, such as non-veined grouped filaments and bilaterally branched filaments, both of which were originally thought to be exclusive to birds and other maniraptoran dinosaurs. Given these findings, it is possible that feathers have deep evolutionary origins in ancestral archosaurs, though there is also a possibility that these structures independently evolved to resemble bird feathers via convergent evolution. Mike Benton, the study's senior author, lent credence to the former theory, stating \"We couldn't find any anatomical evidence that the four pycnofiber types are in any way different from the feathers of birds and dinosaurs. Therefore, because they are the same, they must share an evolutionary origin, and that was about 250 million years ago, long before the origin of birds.\" But the integumentary structures of the anurognathid specimens is still based gross morphology as Liliana D'Alba pointed out. The pycnofibres of the two anurognathid specimens might not be homologous with the filamentous appendages on dinosaurs. Paul M. Barrett suspects that during the integumentary evolution of pterosaurs, pterosaurs primitively lost scales and pycnofibers started to appear.\n\"Cascocauda\" was almost entirely covered in an extensive coat of pycnofibres, which appear to have come in two types. The first are simple, curved filaments that range in length from 3.5\u201312.8\u2009mm long. These filaments cover most of the animal, including the head, neck, body, limbs and tail. The second type consists of tufts of filaments joined near the base, similar to the branching down feathers of birds and other coelurosaurian dinosaurs, around 2.5\u20138.0\u2009mm long and only cover the wing membranes. Studies of sampled pycnofibres revealed the presence of microbodies within the filaments, resembling the melanosome pigments identified in other fossil integuments, specifically phaeomelanosomes. Furthermore, infrared spectral analysis of these pycnofibres show similar absorption spectra to red human hair. These pycnofibres likely provided both insulation and may have helped streamline the body and wings during flight.\nThe identity of these branching structures as pycnofibres or feathers was challenged by Unwin &amp; Martill (2020), who interpreted them as bunched-up and degraded aktinofibrils\u2013stiffening fibres found in the wing membrane of pterosaurs\u2013and attributed the melanosomes and keratin to skin rather than filaments. These claims were refuted by Yang and colleagues, who argue that Unwin and Martill's interpretations are inconsistent with the specimen's preservation. Namely, they argue that the consistent structure, regular spacing, and extension of the filaments beyond the wing membrane support their identification as pycnofibres. Further, they argue that the restriction of melanosomes and keratin to the fibres, as occurs in fossil dinosaur feathers, supports the case they are filaments and is not consistent with contamination from preserved skin. Protofeathers likely evolved in early archosaurs, not long after the P-T extinction event during the time metabolic rates of early archosaurs and synapsids were increasing, postures becoming erect, and sustained activity.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50874", "revid": "9021902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50874", "title": "Geography of Madagascar", "text": " \nMadagascar is a large island in the Indian Ocean located off the eastern coast of Southern Africa, east of Mozambique. It has a total area of with of land and of water. Madagascar is the fourth-largest island in the world. The highest point is Maromokotro, in the Tsaratanana Massif region in the north of the island, at .\nThe Republic of Madagascar is the second-largest island country in the world. Its capital Antananarivo is in the Central Highlands near the centre of the island. It has the 25th largest exclusive economic zone of .\nGeographical regions.\nMadagascar can be divided into five general geographical regions: the east coast, the Tsaratanana Massif, the Central Highlands, the west coast, and the southwest. The highest elevations parallel the east coast. The total size is , which makes it the world's second largest island country.\nEast coast.\nThe east coast consists of a narrow band of lowlands about wide, formed from the sedimentation of alluvial soils, and an intermediate zone composed of steep bluffs alternating with ravines bordering an escarpment of about in elevation, which gives access to the Central Highlands. The coastal region runs roughly from north of Baie d'Antongil, the most prominent feature on the Masoala Peninsula, to the far north of the island. The coastline is straight, with the exception of a bay, offering less in the way of natural harbors than the west coast.\nThe Canal des Pangalanes, an lagoon formed naturally by the washing of sand up on the island by the Indian Ocean currents and by the silting of rivers, is a feature of the coast; it has been used both as a means of transportation up and down the coast and as a fishing area. The beach slopes steeply into deep water. The east coast is considered dangerous for swimmers and sailors because of the large number of sharks that frequent the shoreline.\nTsaratanana Massif.\nThe Tsaratanana Massif region at the north end of the island contains Maromokotro, the highest point on the island at . Further north is the Montagne d'Ambre (Ambohitra), which is of volcanic origin. The coastline is deeply indented; two prominent features are the natural harbor at Antsiranana (Diego Su\u00e1rez), just south of the Cap d'Ambre (Tanjon' i Bobaomby), and the large island of Nosy Be to the west. The mountainous topography of the Tsaratanana Massif limits the potential of the port at Antsiranana by impeding the flow of traffic from other parts of the island. They are a focus for big wall climbing.\nCentral Highlands.\nThe Central Highlands, which range from in elevation, contain a wide variety of topographies: rounded and eroded hills, massive granite outcrops, extinct volcanoes, eroded peneplains, and alluvial plains and marshes, which have been converted into irrigated rice fields. The Central Highlands extend from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to the Ivakoany Massif in the south. They are defined rather clearly by the escarpments along the east coast, and they slope gently to the west coast. The Central Highlands include the Anjafy High Plateaus; the volcanic formations of Itasy (Lake Itasy is in a volcanic crater) and the Ankaratra Massif, reaching a height of . The Isalo Ruiniform Massif lies between the central highlands and the west coast.\nAntananarivo, the national capital, is located in the northern portion of the Central Highlands at above sea level. A prominent feature of the Central Highlands is a rift valley running north to south, located east of Antananarivo and including Lake Alaotra, the largest body of water on the island. The lake is located above sea level and is bordered by two cliffs, rising to the west and to the east, which form the walls of a valley. This region has experienced geological subsidence, and earth tremors are frequent.\nWest coast.\nThe west coast, composed of sedimentary formations, is more indented than the east coast, thus offering a number of harbors sheltered from cyclones, such as the harbor at Mahajanga. Deep bays and well-protected harbors have attracted explorers, traders, and pirates from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East since ancient times; thus, the area has served as an important bridge between Madagascar and the outside world. Silting up of harbors on this coast, caused by sediment from the high levels of erosion suffered inland in Madagascar, is a major problem. The broad alluvial plains found on the coast between Mahajanga and Toliara, which are believed to have great agricultural potential, are thinly inhabited, in many places covered with swamps of Madagascar mangroves, and remain largely unexplored, although they are the subject of mineral and hydrocarbon exploration activity. The giant oil fields of Tsimiroro (heavy oil) and Bemolanga (ultra heavy oil) lie towards the west of the island.\nSouthwest.\nThe southwest is bordered on the east by the Ivakoany Massif and on the north by the Isalo Ruiniform Massif. It includes two regions along the south coast, the Mahafaly Plateau and the desert region occupied by the Antandroy people.\nRivers and lakes.\nThe Mananara and Mangoro rivers flow from the Central Highlands to the east coast, as does the Maningory, which flows from Lake Alaotra. Other rivers flowing east into the Indian Ocean include the Bemarivo, the Ivondro, and the Mananjary. These rivers tend to be short because the watershed is located close to the east coast. Owing to the steep elevations, they flow rapidly, often over spectacular waterfalls.\nThe rivers flowing to the west coast discharge into the Mozambique Channel and tend to be lengthier and have a lesser gradient. The major rivers on the west coast are the Sambirano, the Mahajamba, the Betsiboka (part of Mahajanga is located at the mouth), the Mania, the North and South Mahavavy, the Mangoky, and the Onilahy. The Ikopa, which flows past Antananarivo, is a tributary of the Betsiboka. The Onilahy, located in the driest part of the island, occasionally dries up during droughts.\nImportant lakes, aside from Alaotra, include Lake Kinkony in the northwest, Lake Itasy in the center and Lake Ihotry in the southwest.\nGeographic features.\nSomali Plate.\nMadagascar originated as part of the Gondwana supercontinent. Its west coast was formed when Africa broke off from Gondwana around 165 million years ago. Madagascar eventually broke off from India about 88 million years ago. It is geologically located within the Somali Plate.\nSoils.\nMadagascar has been called the \"Great Red Island\" because of the prominence of red lateritic soils. The red soils predominate the Central Highlands, although there are much richer soils in the regions of former volcanic activity, Itasy and Ankaratra, and Tsaratanana to the north. A narrow band of alluvial soils is found all along the east coast and at the mouths of the major rivers on the west coast; clay, sand, and limestone mixtures are found in the west; and shallow or skeletal laterite and limestone are located in the south. Deforestation and grazing cause aggressive erosion in many locations.\nTidal Flats.\nA 2019 global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were of tidal flats in Madagascar, making it the 18th ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.\nClimate.\nThe climate is tropical along the coast, temperate inland, and arid in the south. The weather is dominated by the southeastern trade winds that originate in the Indian Ocean anticyclone, a center of high atmospheric pressure that seasonally changes its position over the ocean. Madagascar has two seasons: a warm, wet season from November to April; and a cooler, dry season from May to October. There is, however, great variation in climate owing to elevation and position relative to dominant winds. Overall, surface water is most abundant along the east coast and in the far north (with the exception of the area around Cap d'Ambre, which has relatively little surface water). Amounts diminish to the west and south, and the driest regions are in the extreme south.\nThe east coast has a tropical rainforest climate; being most directly exposed to the trade winds, it has the highest rainfall, averaging as high as annually in some places. This region has a hot, humid climate in which tropical fevers are endemic. Destructive cyclones occur during the rainy season, coming in principally from the direction of the Mascarene Islands. Because rain clouds discharge much of their moisture east of the highest elevations on the island, the Central Highlands are drier and, owing to the altitude, also cooler. Thunderstorms are common during the rainy season in the Central Highlands and the eastern coastal lowlands.\nAntananarivo receives practically all of its average annual of rainfall between November and April. The dry season is sunny, although somewhat chilly, especially in the mornings. Although frosts are rare in Antananarivo, they are common at higher elevations. Hail is common in many of the higher areas of the island (including Antananarivo), but there is no snowfall except on the Ankaratra massif where above it may occasionally fall and even remain for several days.\nThe west coast is drier than either the east coast or the Central Highlands because the trade winds lose their humidity by the time they reach this region. The southwest and the extreme south are semidesert; as little as of rain falls annually at Toliara.\nCyclones.\nMadagascar occasionally experiences the impact of cyclones. During February 2\u20134, 1994, Madagascar was struck by Cyclone Geralda. The cyclone killed seventy people and destroyed enough property to leave approximately 500,000 homeless, including 30,000 in Antananarivo and 80,000 in Toamasina. The cyclone also significantly damaged the country's infrastructure, most notably coastal roads, railroads, and telecommunications, as well as agriculture. The damage was estimated at US$45 million.\nDuring March 1\u201318, 2004, Madagascar was impacted by Cyclone Gafilo, the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean. The National Rescue Council in Antananarivo reported 237 dead, 181 missing, 879 injured, and 304,000 homeless (174,000 in Antalaha alone). More than 20,000 homes were destroyed, as well as 413 public buildings and 3,400 schools were damaged, including 1,400 schools completely destroyed. The Cyclone left an estimated damage of US$250 million.\nIn February 2022, Cyclone Batsirai killed at least 10 people and caused floods, power outages, and structural damages, mere weeks after Cyclone Ana had killed 55 and displaced 130,000 people on the island.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe island of Madagascar has been described as an \"alternate world\" or a \"world apart\" because of the uniqueness and rarity of many of its plant and animal species. Their characteristics are believed to reflect the island's origins as a part of Gondwanaland and its many millions of years of isolation following the breakup of the landmass.\nMany of the characteristic African species\u2014large mammals such as the elephant, rhinoceros, giraffe, zebra, and antelope and predators such as lions and leopards\u2014do not exist in Madagascar. In addition, the island has been spared the great variety of venomous snakes indigenous to the African continent. Although it is assumed that most life forms on the island had an African (or South American) origin, isolation has allowed old species\u2014elsewhere extinct\u2014to survive and new species unique to the island to evolve. Thus, a great number of plant, insect, reptile, and fish species are endemic to Madagascar, and all indigenous land mammal species\u201466 in all\u2014are unique to the island.\nMadagascar was once covered almost completely by forests, but slash and burn practices for dry rice cultivation has denuded most of the landscape, especially in the Central Highlands. Rain forests are concentrated on the steep hillsides along a slender north\u2013south axis bordering the east coast, from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to Tolagnaro in the south. Secondary growth, which has replaced the original forest and consists to a large extent of traveller's trees, raffia palm, and baobabs, is found in many places along the east coast and in the north. The vegetation of the Central Highlands and the west coast is for the most part savanna or steppe, and coarse prairie grass predominates where erosion has not exposed the orange-red lateritic soil. In the southwest, the vegetation is adapted to desert conditions.\nThe remaining rain forest contains a great number of unique plant species. The country has some 900 species of orchid. Bananas, mangoes, coconut, vanilla, and other tropical plants grow on the coasts, and the eucalyptus tree, brought from Australia, is widespread today.\nWood and charcoal from the forests are used to meet 80% of domestic fuel needs. As a result, wood has become scarce. In 1990, the World Bank launched an environmental program that has increased the planting of pine and eucalyptus to satisfy fuel needs.\nNatural resources.\nMadagascar has a number of natural resources, including nickel, cobalt, graphite, chromite, coal, bauxite, rare Earth elements, salt, quartz, tar sands, semi-precious stones and mica. There are also fishing areas offshore and potential for hydropower. \nIn 2011, it was estimated that 5.96% of the land area was used for arable land and 1.02% had permanent crops. Twenty-six percent of the land is forested. \nThe majority of the population depends on subsistence farming, largely rice and cattle. The manufacturing sector is small but growing.\nEnvironmental issues.\nMadagascar is currently suffering in some areas from soil erosion as a result of deforestation and overgrazing, desertification, and contamination of surface water with raw sewage and organic waste.

Centuries of intermarriages between both groups created the Malagasy people, who are roughly an equal mixture of both groups. They speak Malagasy, an Austronesian language with Bantu, French and Arabic influences. \nBy the Middle Ages, over a dozen distinct ethnic identities had emerged on the island, typified by rule under a local chieftain. Some communities, such as the Sakalava, Merina and Betsimisaraka, were unified by leaders who established kingdoms, which gained wealth and power through commerce with Europeans and Arabs. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, pirate activity in the coastal areas of Madagascar was common. The Sakalava and Merina kingdoms in particular exploited European trade to strengthen the power of their kingdoms, trading Malagasy slaves for European firearms and other goods. Beginning in the early 19th century, the British and French competed for influence in Madagascar.\nBy the turn of the 19th century, King Andrianampoinimerina had reunited the highly populous Kingdom of Imerina in the central highlands, with its capital at Antananarivo. His son Radama I the Great expanded its authority to the island's other polities and was the first Malagasy sovereign to be recognized by foreign states as the ruler of the greater Merina Kingdom. During the rule of Queen Ranavalona I (r. 1828\u20131861), the kingdom was further expanded to encompass most of the island. Madagascar's population is estimated to have declined by half from 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839 from war, disease, slavery, and other violence. She also attempted to eradicate European and Christian influence in the country.\nChristianity was made the state religion under Queen Ranavalona II (r. 1868\u20131883). In the 1880s, Britain recognised France's authority on the island. This led in 1890 to the Malagasy Protectorate, which was however rejected by the Kingdom of Madagascar, which led to the two Franco-Hova Wars which ended with France capturing the capital in September 1895. Conflict continued in the Menalamba rebellion against French rule that was defeated in 1897. The monarchy was dissolved, and the queen was exiled. Following conquest, the French abolished slavery in 1896, freeing approximately 500,000 slaves.\nDuring French rule, Malagasy people were required to fulfill corv\u00e9e labor on French-run plantations while access to education or skilled positions were limited, although basic services like schools and clinics were extended across the island. Several militant nationalist secret societies emerged in opposition to French rule, of which the most prominent was Vy Vato Sakelika formed in 1913. Many Malagasy were conscripted to fight for France during the First (1914\u20131918) and Second World Wars (1939\u20131945), and during the latter Madagascar came under Vichy French control before being captured by the British in the Battle of Madagascar and returned to Free French control in 1942. In 1944, Madagascar became an overseas territory with representatives in the French National Assembly. Militant nationalists launched a large uprising in 1947 that was brutally suppressed by 1949.\nThe country gained full independence from France in 1960. Madagascar's First Republic (1960\u20131972) was established as a democratic system modeled on that of France and led by President Philibert Tsiranana. Popular unrest led to the socialist Democratic Republic of Madagascar under Admiral Didier Ratsiraka (1975\u20131992) distinguished by economic isolationism and political alliances with pro-Soviet states. By 1992, free and fair multiparty elections were held, ushering in the democratic Third Republic (1992\u20132009). Under the new constitution, the Malagasy public elected successive presidents Albert Zafy, Didier Ratsiraka, and Marc Ravalomanana. This latter was ousted in the 2009 Malagasy political crisis by a popular movement under the leadership of Andry Rajoelina. Elections were held on December 20, 2013, to elect a new president and return the country to constitutional governance.\nFirst inhabitants and settlements (500 BCE\u2013700 CE).\nArchaeological evidence for date of first settlement.\nThe earliest unambiguous evidence of continuous human presence in Madagascar was found at Andavakoera and dates to 490 CE, and there is no archaeological evidence for human occupation in the highlands until around 1200. However, there is scattered evidence for much earlier human visits.\nIn 2009, archaeological excavations at Christmas River (south-central Madagascar) by Pat Wright and James Hansford located a purported elephant bird kill site, with bones showing human cut marks. These were dated to 8,500 BCE, but as yet there is no indication as to the identity of the hunters. Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BCE.\nThere is potential evidence in the form of a cutmarked subfossil lemur bone from a palaeontological site, Taolambiby, in the southwest. One date was obtained, calibrated 530 to 300 BC (Godfrey &amp; Jungers 2003). The cutmarking looks plausible, but there is a potential problem of old carbon from the limestone landscape compromising the date, and there are no associated artifacts or archaeological sites in the vicinity. Nearly contemporaneous potential evidence comes from cannabis or humulus pollen which occurs in a pollen column from the central highlands at an interpolated date of c. 2200 Before Present (BP). There is a hypothesis that cannabis may have reached Africa 3000 years ago.\nNecho II's Phoenician expedition c. 595 BCE circumnavigated Africa but did not see Madagascar when passing through the Mozambique Channel, as it stayed within sight of the African mainland. The island was likely uninhabited.\nFinally, a cutmarked pygmy hippo bone from Ambolisatra has been dated and calibrated to between 60 BC and 130 AD (2 SDs), but it is from a coastal swamp without indications of settlement in a heavily karstic region. Moreover, a similar bone from the same collection from a nearby site gave two widely divergent dates of 2020 and 3495 BC (MacPhee &amp; Burney 1991). Transient visits to Madagascar that did not result in enduring settlement cannot be ruled out, and may have left some traces.\nA common Austronesian origin: The \"Vahoaka Ntaolo\".\nFactual information about the peopling of Madagascar remains incomplete, but much recent multidisciplinary research and work in archaeology, genetics, linguistics, and history confirms that the Malagasy people were originally and overwhelmingly Austronesian peoples native to the Sunda Islands. They probably arrived on the west coast of Madagascar with outrigger canoes (\"waka\") at the beginning of our era or as much as 300 years sooner according to archaeologists, and perhaps even earlier under certain geneticists' assumptions. On the basis of plant cultigens, Blench proposed the migrations occurred \"at the earliest century BCE\". Archaeological work of Ardika and Bellwood suggests migration between 500 and 200 BCE.\nThe Borobudur Ship Expedition in 2003\u20132004 confirmed scholars' ideas that ships from ancient Indonesia may have reached Madagascar and the West African coast for trade as early as the 8th century. \"Samudra Raksa\", a traditional Borobudur ship with outriggers, was reconstructed and sailed in this expedition from Jakarta to Madagascar and Ghana. As for the ancient route, one possibility is that Indonesian Austronesians came directly across the Indian Ocean from Java to Madagascar. It is likely that they went through the Maldives, where evidence of old Indonesian boat design and fishing technology persists until the present. The Malagasy language originated from the Southeast Barito language, and the Ma'anyan language is its closest relative, with numerous Malay and Javanese loanwords. It is known that Ma'anyan people were brought as laborers and slaves by Malay and Javanese people in their trading fleets, which reached Madagascar by ca. 50\u2013500 AD. These pioneers are known in the Malagasy oral tradition as the \"Ntaolo\", from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian \"*tau-ulu\", literally 'first men', from \"*tau\", 'man', and \"*ulu\", 'head; first; origin, beginning. It is likely that those ancient people called themselves *\"va-waka\", \"the canoe people\" from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian \"*va\", 'people', and \"*waka\" 'canoe'. Today the term means 'people' in Malagasy.\nThe Southeast Asian origin of the first Malagasy people explains certain features common among the Malagasy, for instance, the epicanthic fold common among all Malagasy, regardless of coastal or highlands origin or skin color. This original population (\"vahoaka ntaolo\") can be called the \"proto-Malagasy\". They are the source of:\nAs for the cause of the arrival of these Austronesians, the history of the Indian Ocean from the early first millennium remains poorly understood. Madagascar may have played an important role in the trade of spices (especially cinnamon and cassia) and timber between Southeast Asia and the Middle East, directly or through the African coast and Madagascar.\n\"Vazimba\" and \"Vezo\".\nThe first known concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced \"tavy\" (slash-and-burn agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of their crops. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's wealth of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction.\nBy 600, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and began clearing the forests of the central highlands (\"Imerina\"), where they particularly planted taro (\"saonjo\") and probably rice (\"vary\"). These \"Vahoaka Ntaolo\", hunters-gatherers and farmers, who decided to settle \"in the forest\", especially in the forests of the central highlands are known by the tradition as the Vazimba (from \"*ba/va-yimba-\" 'those of the forest', from \"*yimba-\" 'forest' in Proto\u2013Southeast Barito, today \"barimba\" or \"orang rimba\" in Malay). Rafandrana, an ancestor of the Merina royal dynasty, for example, is known to have been a Vazimba. Rafohy and Rangita, the two founding queens of the Merina royalty, were also called Vazimbas.\nOn the other side, the fishermen who, from the beginning, remained on the southwestern coast (probably the coasts of the first landing) were, according to the linguists, probably originally called the \"Vezo\" (from \"*ba/va/be/ve-jau\" \u2013 \"those of the coast\", borrowed from Proto-Malayo-Javanese, today \"veju\" in Bugis, \"bejau\" in Malay, and \"bajo\" in Javanese), which today is still the name of a Southwestern tribe.\nAfter the arrival of the newcomers (see below), as growing population density necessitated higher crop yields, irrigated rice paddies emerged in Betsileo country by 1600 and were complemented with terraced paddies throughout the central highlands a century later. Zebu were introduced around 1000 by Bantu-speaking migrants from the African Great Lakes region (see below), who maintained large herds. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage in the central highlands had largely transformed the region from a forest ecosystem to barren grassland by the 17th century.\nTraders, explorers, and immigration (700\u20131500).\nBy the mid-first millennium (ca 700) until about 1500, the inner Vazimbas as much as the coastal Vezos clans welcomed new visitors or immigrants. These goods and/or slave traders came from the Middle East (Shirazi Persians, Omani Arabs, Arabized Jews), Africa (Swahilis), and from Asia (Gujaratis, Malays, Javanese, Bugis). They were sometimes integrated within the coastal Vezos and the inner Vazimbas clans.\nOmani Arabs (from the 7th century).\nThe written history of Madagascar begins in the 7th century when Omanis established trading posts along the northwest coast and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as the sorabe alphabet), Arab astrology and other cultural elements. During this early period, Madagascar served as an important transoceanic trading port for the East African coast that gave Africa a trade route to the Silk Road and served simultaneously as a port for incoming ships. There is evidence that Bantu or Swahili sailors or traders may have begun sailing to the western shores of Madagascar as early as around the 6th and 7th century.\nAccording to the traditions of some Malagasy peoples, the first Bantus and Arabs to settle in Madagascar came as refugees from the civil wars that followed the death of Muhammad in 632.\nBeginning in the 10th or 11th century, Arabic and Zanzibari slavers worked their way down the Swahili coast in their dhows and established settlements on the west coast of Madagascar. Notably they included the Zafiraminia, traditional ancestors of the Antemoro, Antanosy and other east coast ethnicities. The last wave of Arab immigrants, the Antalaotra, immigrated from Swahili colonies. They settled the northwest of the island (the Mahajanga area) and introduced, for the first time, Islam to Madagascar.\nArab immigrants, though few in number compared to the native Austronesians and Bantus, nevertheless left a lasting impression. The Malagasy names for seasons, months, days, and coins in certain regions come from Arabic origins, as do cultural features such as the practice of circumcision, the communal grain-pool, and different forms of salutation (such as \"salama\").\nNeo-Austronesians: Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and Orang Laut (from the 8th century).\nAccording to oral tradition, new Austronesian clans (Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and Orang Laut), historically referred to in general, regardless of their native island, as the \"Hova\" (from Old Bugis \"uwa\", \"commoner\") landed in the north-west and east coast of the island. Adelaar's observations of Old Malay (Sanskritised), Old Javanese (Sanskritised) and Old Bugis borrowings in the initial Proto-Southeast-Barito language indicate that the first Hova waves came probably in the 7th century at the earliest. Marre and Dahl pointed out that the number of Sanskrit words in Malagasy is very limited compared with the large number now found in Indonesian languages, which means that the Indonesian settlers must have come at an early stage of Hindu influence, that is ca. 400 AD.\nThe Hova were probably derived from Indonesian thalassocracies. Their leaders were known as the \"diana\" in the Southeast and \"andriana\" or \"raondriana\" in the Center and the West (from \"(ra)-hadi-an\", \"lord\" or \"master\" in Old Javanese, modern Javanese \"raden\", also found in the Bugis noble title and the Tagalog word for \"king\" \"hari\"). They for the most part allied with Vazimba clans:\nWith the arrival of Islam, Persian and Arab traders soon supplanted the Indonesians on the coast of Africa and eventually extended their control over the Comoro Islands and parts of the coast of Madagascar. Meanwhile, with competition in the new joint naval powers of Song China and Chola South India, the thalassocracies of Indonesia were in rapid decline, though the Portuguese still encountered Javanese sailors in Madagascar in the sixteenth century.\nBantus (from the 9th century).\nThere is archaeological evidence that Bantu peoples, agro-pastoralists from East Africa, may have begun migrating to the island as early as the 6th and 7th centuries. Other historical and archaeological records suggest that some of the Bantus were descendants of Swahili sailors and merchants who used dhows to traverse the seas to the western shores of Madagascar. Finally, some sources theorize that during the Middle Ages, Arab, Persian and Neo-Austronesian slave-traders brought Bantu people to Madagascar, transported by Swahili merchants to feed foreign demand for slaves. Years of intermarriages created the Malagasy peoples, who primarily speak Malagasy, an Austronesian language with Bantu influences. There are consequently many (Proto-)Swahili borrowings in the initial Proto-SEB Malagasy language. This substratum is especially significantly present in the domestic and agricultural vocabulary (e.g. \"omby\" or \"aombe\", \"beef\", from Swahili \"ng'ombe\"; \"tongolo\" \"onion\" from Swahili \"kitunguu\"; Malagasy \"nongo\" \"pot\" from \"nunggu\" in Swahili).\nEuropeans (from 1500).\nEurope knew of Madagascar through Arab sources; thus \"The Travels of Marco Polo\" claimed that \"the inhabitants are Saracens, or followers of the law of Mohammed\", without mentioning other inhabitants. Other than its size and location, everything about the island in the book describes southeastern Africa, not Madagascar. European contact began on 10 August 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island after his ship separated from a fleet going to India. The Portuguese traded with the islanders and named the island \"S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o\" (Saint Lawrence). In 1666, Fran\u00e7ois Caron, the director general of the newly formed Louis XIV's East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The company failed to establish a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon (now R\u00e9union) and Isle de France (now Mauritius). In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. On Nosy Borah, a small island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar, Captain Misson and his pirate crew allegedly founded the famous pirate utopia of Libertatia in the late 17th century. From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar was a favourite haunt for pirates. Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century. Sailors sometimes called Madagascar \"Island of the Moon\".\nEuropean settlements.\nBy the 15th century, Europeans had wrested control of the spice trade from the Muslims. They did this by bypassing the Middle East and sending their cargo ships around the Cape of Good Hope to India. The Portuguese mariner Diogo Dias became the first European to set foot on Madagascar when his ship, bound for India, blew off course in 1500. In the ensuing 200 years, the English and French tried (and failed) to establish settlements on the island.\nFever, dysentery, hostile Malagasy, and the trying arid climate of southern Madagascar soon terminated the English settlement near Toliara in 1646. Another English settlement in the north in \u00cele Sainte-Marie came to an end in 1649. The French colony at T\u00f4lanaro (Fort Dauphin) fared a little better: it lasted thirty years. On Christmas night 1672, local Antanosy tribesmen, perhaps angry because fourteen French soldiers in the fort had recently divorced their Malagasy wives to marry fourteen French orphan-women sent out to the colony, massacred the fourteen grooms and thirteen of the fourteen brides. The Antanosy then besieged the stockade at T\u00f4lanaro for eighteen months. A ship of the French East India Company rescued the surviving thirty men and one widow in 1674.\nIn 1665, Fran\u00e7ois Caron, the Director General of the newly formed Louis XIV's East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The Company failed to found a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and \u00cele-de-France (today's R\u00e9union and Mauritius respectively). In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast.\nPirates and slave-traders.\nBetween 1680 and 1725, Madagascar became a pirate stronghold. Many unfortunate sailors became shipwrecked and stranded on the island. Those who survived settled among the natives, or more often, found French or English colonies on the island, or even pirate havens, and thus became pirates themselves. One such case, that of Robert Drury,\nresulted in a journal giving one of the few written depictions of southern Madagascar in the 18th century.\nNotable pirates, including William Kidd, Henry Every, John Bowen, and Thomas Tew, made Antongil Bay and Nosy Boraha their bases of operations. The pirates plundered merchant ships in the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. They deprived Europe-bound ships of their silks, cloth, spices, and jewels. Vessels captured while travelling in the opposite direction (to India) lost their cargo, including coin, gold, and silver. The pirates robbed the Indian cargo ships that traded between ports in the Indian Ocean as well as ships commissioned by the East India Companies of France, England, and the Netherlands. The pilgrim fleet sailing between Surat in India and Mokha on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula was a favourite target, because the wealthy Muslim pilgrims often carried jewels and other finery with them to Mecca. Merchants in India, various ports of Africa, and R\u00e9union showed willingness to fence the pirates' stolen goods. The low-paid seamen who manned merchant ships in the Indian Ocean hardly put up a fight, seeing as they had little reason or motivation to risk their lives. The pirates often recruited crewmen from the ships they plundered.\nWith regard to piracy in Malagasy waters, note the (semi-)legendary accounts of the alleged pirate-state of Libertalia.\nPrior to the arrival of the Europeans, certain Malagasy tribes occasionally waged wars to capture and enslave prisoners. They either sold the slaves to Arab traders or kept them on-hand as laborers. Following the arrival of European slavers, human slaves became more valuable, and the coastal tribes of Madagascar took to warring with each other to obtain prisoners for the lucrative slave-trade. Instead of spears and cutlasses, the tribesmen fought with muskets, musket balls, and gunpowder that they obtained from the Europeans, conducting fierce and brutal wars. On account of their relationship to the pirates, the Betsimisaraka in eastern Madagascar had more firearms than anyone else. They overpowered their neighbors, the Antankarana and Tsimihety, and even raided the Comoro Islands. As the tribe on the west coast with the most connections to the slave trade, the Sakalava people also had access to guns and powder.\nToday, the people of Madagascar can be considered as the product of mixing between the first occupants, the \"vahoaka ntaolo\" Austronesians (\"Vazimba\" and \"Vezo\") and those arrived later (\"Hova\" neo-Austronesians, Persians, Arabs, Africans and Europeans).\nGenotypically, the original Austronesian heritage is more or less evenly distributed throughout the island. Researchers have noticed the \"Polynesian motif\" everywhere: an old marker of Austronesian populations from before the great immigration to the islands of Polynesia and Melanesia. This fact would require a common starting point among the Proto-Malagasy' vahoaka ntaolo' (who migrated west to Madagascar) and the ancestors of the current Polynesians (who left for the Pacific Islands in the East) between 500 BCE and 1 CE.\nFeudal era (1500\u20131895).\nRise of the great kingdoms.\nThose new immigrants of the Middle Ages were a minority in numbers, yet their cultural contributions, political and technological to the neo-Vazimba and neo-Vezo world substantially altered their society and is the cause of the major upheavals of the sixteenth century that led to the Malagasy feudal era.\nOn the coasts, the integration of the East Asians, Middle Easterns, Bantus and Portuguese led to the establishment of the kingdoms of the Antakarana, Boina, Menabe and Vezo on the west coast, the Mahafaly and Antandroy in the south, and the Antesaka, Antambahoaka, Antemoro, Antanala and Betsimisaraka on the east coast.\nIn the interior, the struggle for hegemony between the different Neo-Vazimba clans of central highlands, called the \"Hova\" by the coastal Neo-Vezo clans, led to the creation of the Merina, Betsileo, Bezanozano, Sihanaka, Tsimihety and Bara kingdoms.\nThe birth of these kingdoms/tribes essentially altered the political structure of the ancient world of the Vahoaka Ntaolo, but for the most part the common language, customs, traditions, religion and economy was preserved.\nAmong the Central Kingdoms, the most important were the Betsileo kingdoms (Fandriana, Fisakana, Manandriana, Isandra) to the south, and the Merina kingdoms to the north. These were definitively unified in the early 19th century by Andrianampoinimerina. His son and successor Radama I (reigning 1810\u20131828) opened his country to foreign influence. With the support of the British, he extended its authority over much of the island. From 1817, the central Merina kingdoms, Betsileo, Bezanozano, and Sihanaka, unified by Radama I were known to the outside world as the Kingdom of Madagascar.\nSakalava.\nThe island's West clan chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbors, first with Arab, Persian and Somali traders who connected Madagascar with East Africa, the Middle East and India, and later with European slave traders. The wealth created in Madagascar through trade created a state system ruled by powerful regional monarchs known as the Maroserana. These monarchs adopted the cultural traditions of subjects in their territories and expanded their kingdoms. They took on divine status, and new nobility and artisan classes were created. Madagascar functioned as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as Sofala, Kilwa, Mombasa and Zanzibar. By the Middle Ages, large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe (centered in what is now the town of Morondava) and of Boina (centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara.\nThe island's chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbours, notably East Africa, the Middle East and India. Large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe, centred in what is now the town of Morondava, and of Boina, centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga (Majunga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara.\nAccording to local tradition, the founders of the Sakalava kingdom were Marosera\u00f1a (or Maroseranana, \"those who owned many ports\") princes, from the Fiherenana (now Toliara). They quickly subdued the neighbouring princes, starting with the southern ones, in the Mahafaly area. The true founder of Sakalava dominance was Andriamisara; his son Andriandahifotsy (c. 1610\u20131658) then extended his authority northwards, past the Mangoky River. His two sons, Andriamanetiarivo and Andriamandisoarivo, extended gains further up to the Tsongay region (now Mahajanga). At about that time, the empire's unity starts to split, resulting in a southern kingdom (Menabe) and a northern kingdom (Boina). Further splits resulted, despite continued extension of the Boina princes' reach into the extreme north, in Antankarana country.\nThe Sakalava rulers of this period are known through the memoirs of Europeans such as Robert Drury, James Cook, Barnvelt (1719), Valentyn (1726).\nMerina monarchy.\nKing Andrianampoinimerina (1785\u20131810) and his son, Radama I (1810\u20131828) succeeded in uniting nearly all of Madagascar under Merina rule. These kings and their successors descended from a line of ancient Merina royalty who ruled the lands of Imerina in the central Highlands of Madagascar since at least the 16th century. Even prior to their eventual domination and unification of the entire island, the political and cultural activities of Merina royalty were to leave an indelible mark on contemporary Malagasy identity.\nWith the establishment of dominion over the greater part of the Highlands, Andrianampoinimerina became the first Merina monarch to be considered a king of Madagascar. The island continued to be ruled by a succession of Merina monarchs until the last of them, Ranavalona III, was deposed and exiled to Algeria by French forces who conquered and colonized the island in 1895.\nKing Andrianampoinimerina.\nAndrianampoinimerina, grandson of King Andriambelomasina and successor to his uncle King Andrianjafy, successfully reunited the fragmented Merina kingdom through a combination of diplomacy, strategic political marriages and successful military campaigns against rival princes. Andrianampoinimerina distinguished himself from other kings by codifying laws and supervising the building of dikes and trenches to increase the amount of arable land around his capital at Antananarivo in a successful bid to end the famines that had wracked Imerina for decades. The king ambitiously proclaimed: \"Ny ranomasina no valapariako\" (\u201cthe sea is the boundary of my rice-field\u201d), and by the time of his death in 1810 he had conquered the Bara and Betsileo highland tribes, laying the groundwork for expansion of his kingdom to the shores of the island.\nKing Radama I (1810\u20131828).\nAndrianampoinimerina's son Radama I (Radama the Great) assumed the throne during a turning-point in European history that had repercussions for Madagascar. With the defeat of Napol\u00e9on in 1814/1815, the balance of power in Europe and overseas shifted in Britain's favor. The British, eager to exert control over the trade routes of the Indian Ocean, had captured the islands of R\u00e9union and Mauritius from the French in 1810. Although they returned R\u00e9union to France, they kept Mauritius as a naval base which would maintain trade links throughout the British Empire. Mauritius's governor, in a bid to woo Madagascar from French control, recognized Radama I as King of Madagascar, a diplomatic maneuver meant to underscore the idea of the sovereignty of the island and thus to preclude claims by any European powers.\nRadama I signed treaties with the United Kingdom outlawing the slave trade and admitting Protestant missionaries into Madagascar. As a result of these treaties Protestant missionaries from Britain would spread British influence in Madagascar; while outlawing the slave trade would weaken R\u00e9union's economy by depriving the island of slave laborers for France's sugar plantations. In return for outlawing the slave trade, Madagascar received what the treaty called \"The Equivalent\": an annual sum of a thousand dollars in gold, another thousand in silver, stated amounts of gunpowder, flints, and muskets, plus 400 surplus British Army uniforms. The governor of Mauritius also sent military advisers who accompanied and sometimes led Merina soldiers in their battles against the Sakalava and Betsimisaraka. In 1824, having defeated the Betsimisaraka, Radama I declared, \"Today, the whole island is mine! Madagascar has but one master.\" The king died in 1828 while leading his army on a punitive expedition against the Betsimisaraka.\nQueen Ranavalona I (1828\u20131861).\nThe 33-year reign of Queen Ranavalona I, the widow of Radama I, was characterized by an increase in the size of the Kingdom of Madagascar as it conquered neighboring states as well as an effort to maintain the cultural and political sovereignty of Madagascar in the face of increasing foreign influence. The queen repudiated the treaties that Radama I had signed with Britain and, in 1835 after issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar, she expelled British missionaries from the island and began persecuting Christian converts who would not renounce their religion. Malagasy Christians would remember this period as \"ny tany maizina\", or \"the time when the land was dark\".\nDuring her reign, constant warfare, disease, slave labor, and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among the Malagasy population; the population of the island is estimated to have declined by half from 5\u00a0million to 2.5\u00a0million between 1833 and 1839.\nUnbeknownst to the queen, her son and heir, the crown-prince (the future Radama II), attended Roman Catholic masses in secret. The young man grew up under the influence of French nationals in Antananarivo. In 1854, he wrote a letter to Napol\u00e9on III inviting France to invade and uplift Madagascar. On 28 June 1855 he signed the Lambert Charter. This document gave Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert, an enterprising French businessman who had arrived in Madagascar only three weeks before, the exclusive right to develop all minerals, forests, and unoccupied land in Madagascar in exchange for a 10-percent royalty payable to the Merina monarchy. In years to come, the French would show the Lambert Charter and the prince's letter to Napol\u00e9on III to explain the Franco-Hova Wars and the annexation of Madagascar as a colony. In 1857, the queen uncovered a plot by her son (the future Radama II) and French nationals in the capital to remove her from power. She immediately expelled all foreigners from Madagascar, sparing her son. Ranavalona died in 1861.\nKing Radama II (1861\u20131863).\nIn his brief two years on the throne, King Radama II re-opened trade with Mauritius and R\u00e9union, invited Christian missionaries and foreigners to return to Madagascar, and re-instated most of Radama I's reforms. His liberal policies angered the aristocracy, however, and Rainivoninahitriniony, the prime minister, engineered a coup d'\u00e9tat in which Radama II was strangled to death.\nQueen Rasoherina (1863\u20131868).\n A council of princes headed by Rainilaiarivony approached Rabodo, the widow of Radama II, the day after the death of her husband. They gave her the conditions under which she could succeed to the throne. These conditions included the suppression of trial by ordeal as well as the monarchy's defense of freedom of religion. Rabodo, crowned queen on 13 May 1863 under the throne name of Rasoherina, reigned until her death on 1 April 1868.\nThe Malagasy people remember Queen Rasoherina for sending ambassadors to London and Paris and for prohibiting Sunday markets. On 30 June 1865, she signed a treaty with the United Kingdom giving British citizens the right to rent land and property on the island and to have a resident ambassador. With the United States of America she signed a trade agreement that also limited the importation of weapons and the export of cattle. Finally, with France the queen signed a peace between her descendants and the descendants of the \"Emperor of France\". Rasoherina married her prime minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, but public outcry against his involvement in the murder of Radama II soon forced his resignation and exile to Betsileo country south of Imerina. She then married his brother, Rainilaiarivony, head of the army at the time of Radama II's murder who was promoted to the post of Prime Minister upon the resignation and exile of his older brother. Rainilaiarivony would rule Madagascar from behind the scenes for the remaining 32 years of the Merina monarchy, marrying each of the final three queens of Madagascar in succession.\nQueen Ranavalona II (1868\u20131883).\nIn 1869, Queen Ranavalona II, previously educated by the London Missionary Society, underwent baptism into the Church of England and subsequently made the Anglican faith the official state religion of Madagascar.\nThe queen had all the \"sampy\" (traditional royal idols) burned in a public display. Catholic and Protestant missionaries arrived in numbers to build churches and schools. The reign of Queen Ranavalona II proved the high water mark of British influence in Madagascar. British goods and weapons arrived on the island by way of South Africa.\nQueen Ranavalona III (1883\u20131897).\nHer public coronation as queen took place on 22 November 1883 and she took the name Ranavalona III. As her first order of business she confirmed the nomination of Rainilaiarivony and his entourage in their positions. She also promised to do away with the French threat.\nEnd of the monarchy.\nAngry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property seized from French citizens, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first Franco-Hova War (\"Hova\" as a name referring to the Merina aristocrats). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded Antsiranana (Di\u00e9go Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 gold francs to the heirs of Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert. In Europe, meanwhile, European diplomats had worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to establish control over the Sultanate of Zanzibar, ceded its rights over the island of Heligoland to Germany and renounced all claims of influence in Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement spelled the end of the Malagasy political independence. Rainilaiarivony had succeeded in playing the various European powers against one another, but now France could act without fear of British support towards the Malagasies.\nIn 1895, a French flying column landed in Mahajanga (Majunga) and marched by way of the Betsiboka River to the capital, Antananarivo, taking the city's defenders by surprise (they had expected an attack from the much closer east coast). Twenty French soldiers died fighting and 6,000 died of malaria and other diseases before the second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896 the French Parliament voted to annex Madagascar. The 103-year-old Merina monarchy ended with the royal family sent into exile in Algeria.\nInternational recognition and modernization of the Kingdom (1817\u20131895).\nThe kingdom of Madagascar continued its transformation throughout the 19th century from a locally grown monarchy into a modern state.\nBefore Radama I the Malagasy language was written in a script known as sorabe. In 1820 under the direction of David Jones, a Welsh missionary of the London Missionary Society, Radama I codified the new Malagasy Latin alphabet of 21 letters which replaced the old sorabe alphabet. By 1830 the Bible was the first book written in this new Malagasy Latin alphabet. It is the oldest complete translation of the bible into a sub-Saharan African language.\nThe United States and the Kingdom of Madagascar concluded a commercial convention in 1867 after which Queen Rasoherina and Prime Minister Rainilaiarivoy exchanged gifts with president Andrew Johnson. A treaty of peace, friendship, and commerce was then signed in 1881.\nDuring the reign of Ranavalona I, early attempts at industrialization took place from 1835 under the direction of the French Jean Laborde (a survivor of a shipwreck off the east coast), producing soap, porcelain, metal tools and firearms (rifles, cannons, etc.)..\nIn 1864 Antananarivo opened the first hospital and a modern medical school. Two years later appeared the first newspaper. A scientific journal in English (\"Antananarivo Annual\") was released from 1875. In 1894, on the eve of the establishment of colonial rule, the schools of the kingdom, mainly led by the Protestant missions, were attended by over 200,000 students.\nFrench colonization.\nIn 1750, the ruler of the Kingdom of Betsimisaraka, Bety of Betsimisaraka, ceded the island Nosy Boraha (\u00cele Sainte-Marie) to the Kingdom of France. However, in 1752 the French Colonists were massacred when the local population rebelled. France left the settlement abandoned for roughly half a century until returning in 1818.\nIn 1840 Tsiomeko, the ruler of Nosy Be island, accepted French protection in 1840. The French took possession of the island in 1841, and in 1849 an unsuccessful attempt was made to expel them.\nIn the Berlin Treaty, the British accepted the claims of France to exert its influence on Madagascar, and after the first Franco-Hova Wara treaty of alliance between France and Madagascar was signed on 17 December 1885 by Queen Ranavalona III, granting France a protectorate over the Diego-Suarez bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of Nosy-Be and \u00cele Sainte-Marie.\nDisagreements on the implementation of this treaty served as a pretext for the French invasion of 1895, which first met little resistance. The authority of the prime minister Rainilaiarivony, in power since 1864, had become very unpopular with the public.\nThe British accepted the imposition of a French protectorate over Madagascar in 1890 in return for recognition of British sovereignty over Zanzibar (subsequently part of Tanzania) and as part of an overall definition of spheres of influence in the area. The intention of the French was initially to maintain the protectorate in order to control the economy and foreign relations of the island. But later, the outbreak of the Menalamba rebellion and the arrival of General Gallieni (responsible for \"pacifying\" the country) in 1896 led to the colonization of the island and the exile of the queen to Algeria.\nIn 1904\u20131905 Madagascar was the scene of a large-scale uprising by various tribes and tribal leaders, among whom Kotavy, a former French corporal who defected to the rebels, filled a preponderant role.\nMalagasy troops fought in France, Morocco, and Syria during World War II. Prior to the implementation of the Final Solution, Nazi Germany had considered the Madagascar Plan, which would have relocated European Jews to Madagascar. After France fell to the Germans in 1940, the Vichy government administered Madagascar until 1942, when British and Commonwealth troops occupied the strategic island in the Battle of Madagascar. The United Kingdom handed over control of the island to Free French Forces in 1943.\nRevolt and decolonization (1947\u20131960).\nIn 1948, with French prestige at a low ebb, the French government, headed by Prime Minister Paul Ramadier of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) party, suppressed the Madagascar revolt, a nationalist uprising.\nThe French subsequently established reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully toward independence. The Malagasy Republic, proclaimed on 14 October 1958, became an autonomous state within the French Community. On 26 March 1960 France agreed to Madagascar becoming fully independent. On 26 June 1960 Madagascar became an independent country and Philibert Tsiranana became its first president.\nIndependence.\nFirst Republic (1960\u20131972).\nTsiranana's rule represented continuation, with French settlers (or \"colons\") still in positions of power. Unlike many of France's former colonies, the Malagasy Republic strongly resisted movements towards communism.\nIn 1972, protests against these policies came to a head and Tsiranana had to step down. He handed power to General Gabriel Ramanantsoa of the army and his provisional government. This r\u00e9gime reversed previous policy in favour of closer ties with the Soviet Union.\nOn 5 February 1975, Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava became the President of Madagascar. After six days as head of the country, he died in an assassination while driving from the presidential palace to his home. Political power passed to Gilles Andriamahazo.\nSecond Republic (1972\u20131991).\nOn 15 June 1975, Lieutenant-Commander Didier Ratsiraka (who had previously served as foreign minister) came to power in a coup. Elected president for a seven-year term, Ratsiraka moved further towards socialism, nationalising much of the economy and cutting all ties with France. These policies hastened the decline in the Malagasy economy that had begun after independence as French immigrants left the country, leaving a shortage of skills and technology behind. Ratsiraka's original seven-year term as president continued after his party (Avant-garde de la R\u00e9volution Malgache or AREMA) became the only legal party in the 1977 elections.\nIn the 1980s, Madagascar moved back towards France, abandoning many of its communist-inspired policies in favour of a market economy, though Ratsiraka still kept hold of power.\nEventually, opposition, both within and without, forced Ratsiraka to consider his position and in 1992 the country adopted a new and democratic constitution.\nThird Republic (1991\u20132002).\nThe first multi-party elections came in 1993, with Albert Zafy defeating Ratsiraka. Despite being a strong proponent of a liberal, free-market economy, Zafy ran on a ticket critical of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. During his presidency the country struggled to implement IMF and World Bank guidelines that were, on the short term, suicidal politically.\nAs president Zafy was frustrated by the restraints placed upon the powers of his office by the new constitution. His quest for increased executive power put him on a collision course with the parliament led by then prime minister Francisque Ravony. Zafy eventually won the power he sought after but suffered impeachment at the hands of the disenfranchised parliament in 1996 for violating the constitution by refusing to promulgate specific laws.\nThe ensuing elections saw a turnout of less than 50% and unexpectedly resulted in the re-election of Didier Ratsiraka.\nHe moved further towards capitalism. The influence of the IMF and the World Bank led to widespread privatisation.\nOpposition to Ratsiraka began to grow again. Opposition parties boycotted provincial elections in 2000, and the 2001 presidential election produced more controversy. The opposition candidate Marc Ravalomanana claimed victory after the first round (in December) but the incumbent rejected this position. In early 2002 supporters of the two sides took to the streets and violent clashes took place. Ravalomanana claimed that fraud had occurred in the polls. After an April recount the High Constitutional Court declared Ravalomanana president. Ratsiraka continued to dispute the result but his opponent gained international recognition, and Ratsiraka had to go into exile in France, though forces loyal to him continued activities in Madagascar.\nPost-Ratsiraka.\nRavalomanana's Tiako I Madagasikara party achieved overwhelming electoral success in December 2001 and he survived an attempted coup in January 2003. He used his mandate to work closely with the IMF and the World Bank to reform the economy, to end corruption and to realise the country's potential.\nRatsiraka went on trial (\"in absentia\") for embezzlement (the authorities charged him with taking $8m of public money with him into exile) and the court sentenced him to ten years' hard labour.\nRavalomanana is credited with improving the country's infrastructure, such as roads, along with making improvements in education and health, but has faced criticism for his lack of progress against poverty; purchasing power is said to have declined during his time in office. On 18 November 2006, his plane was forced to divert from Madagascar's capital during a return trip from Europe following reports of a coup underway in Antananarivo and shooting near the airport; however, this alleged coup attempt was unsuccessful.\nRavalomanana ran for a second term in the presidential election held on December 3, 2006. According to official results, he won the election with 54.79% of the vote in the first round; his best results were in Antananarivo Province, where he received the support of 75.39% of voters. He was sworn in for his second term on January 19, 2007.\nRavalomanana dissolved the National Assembly in July 2007, prior to the end of its term, following a constitutional referendum earlier in the year. Ravalomanana said that a new election needed to be held so that the National Assembly would reflect the changes made in this referendum.\nHe became involved in a political standoff after he closed the TV station belonging to Antananarivo mayor Andry Rajoelina. In January 2009, protests which then turned violent were organized and spearheaded by Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of the capital city of Antananarivo and a prominent opponent of President Ravalomanana.\nThe situation fundamentally changed on 10 March 2009 when army leaders forced the recently appointed defense secretary to resign (the previous one had decided to resign after the killings by the presidential guard on 7 February 2009). They also announced that they gave the opponents 72 hours to dialogue and find a solution to the crisis before they would take further action. This move came after the leaders of the main military camp had announced a day earlier that they would not execute orders coming from the presidency any more since their duty was to protect the people, and not to oppress them, as groups of the military had done over the last few days.\nOn 16 March 2009, the army seized the presidential palace in the centre of Antananarivo. Ravalomanana was not in the palace at the time. He handed his resignation to the army, which then decided to hand over power to his fierce political rival, Andry Rajoelina. The second round of the postponed presidential elections was held in December 2013 and the results were announced in January 2014. The winner and the next president was Hery Rajaonarimampianina. He was backed by Rajoelina who led the 2009 coup and still was very influential political figure.\nIn 2018 the first round of the presidential election was held on 7 November and the second round was held on 10 December. Three former presidents and the most recent president were the main candidates of the elections. Former president Andry Rajoelina won the second round of the elections. He was previously president from 2009 to 2014. Former president Marc Ravalomanana lost the second round and he did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud. Ravalomanana was president from 2002 to 2009. The most recent president Hery Rajaonarimampianina received very modest support in the first round. In January 2019 the High Constitutional Court declared Rajoelina as the winner of the elections and the new president.\nIn 2019, an epidemic of measles killed 1,200 people.\nIn 2021, Madagascar's worst drought in 40 years left more than a million people in southern Madagascar food insecure. This forced thousands of people to leave their homes to search for food.\nIn November 2023, Andry Rajoelina was re-elected to another term with 58.95% of the vote in the first round of the election. Turnout was 46.36%, the lowest in a presidential election in the country's history.\nIn June 2025, the Franco-Malagasy Joint Commission will meet. This commission is responsible for deciding on the return of the Scattered Islands to Madagascar.\nIn September 2025, widespread protests erupted against frequent water and power cuts, causing the deaths of over 20 people. In response, Rajoelina sacked Prime Minister Christian Ntsay on 29 September 2025. He said, without providing evidence, that some politicians were plotting to take advantage of the protests and had considered staging a coup while he was addressing the United Nations. On 12 October, Rajoelina's office said that an attempt to topple his government was underway; a statement said the situation was under control. However, on 13 October, an opposition lawmaker reported that Rajoelina had fled the country. Rajoelina addressed the nation later that day, saying that he fled \"in fear for his life\" but remained defiant, saying that he \"would not allow Madagascar to be destroyed\" and refusing to step down. After attempting to dissolve the National Assembly, he was impeached and removed from office as the military said that they have seized power. On 17 October 2025, Colonel Michael Randrianirina was sworn in as the new president of Madagascar."}

The first census in 1975 counted 7.4 million Malagasy people, the second one in 1993 censused 12.3 million citizens and the 18 May to 10 June 2018 census numbered 25,674,186 inhabitants.\nPopulation.\nThe problem with population estimation in Madagascar is that data is very old and limited. The last population census was carried out in 1993, after an initial 1975 census. There was an attempt at a census in 2009, but this attempt ultimately failed due to political instability. Therefore, the demographic situation is inferred but reliability of any estimates from any source has a large margin of error.\nAccording to the total population was in , compared to only 4,084,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 43.1%, 53.8% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.1% was 65 years or older.\nPopulation Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.VII.2019) (Unrevised data.

This group is further subdivided a number of ethnic groups, often into the standard eighteen. In addition, communities of Indians, Arabs and Somalis in Madagascar have long been established on the island and have assimilated into local communities to varying degrees, in some places having long since become identified \"Malagasy\" ethnic groups, and in others maintaining distinct identities and cultural separation. More recent arrivals include Europeans and Chinese immigrants.\nMadagascar was probably uninhabited prior to Austronesian settlement in the early centuries AD. Austronesian (particularly Malay) features are most predominant in the central highlands peoples, while coastal peoples are phenotypically more East African, sometimes with minor Arab, Somali, European and Indian admixtures. The largest coastal groups are the Betsimisaraka (1,500,000) and the Tsimihety and Sakalava (700,000 each). Malagasy society has long been polarized between the politically and economically advantaged highlanders of the central plateaux and the people along the coast. For example, in the 1970s there was widespread opposition among coastal ethnics against the policy of \"Malagasization\" which intended to phase out the use of the French language in public life in favour of a more prominent position for the Malagasy language, whose orthography is based on the Merina dialect. \nIndians in Madagascar descend mostly from traders who arrived in the newly independent nation looking for better opportunities. The majority of them came from the west coast of India known as Karana (Muslim) and Banian (Hindu). The majority speak Hindi or Gujarati, although some other Indian languages are also spoken. Nowadays[ [update]] the younger generations speak at least three languages, including French, Gujarati and Malagasy. A large number of the Indians in Madagascar have a high level of education, particularly the younger generation.\nA sizeable number of Europeans also reside in Madagascar, mostly of French descent.\nLanguages.\nMalagasy is the national language, and shares the status of official language with French.\nAccording to the 2018 census, 99.9% of the population aged 3 and more can speak Malagasy, 23.6% can speak French, 8.2% can speak English, and 0.6% can speak another language.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 1993 national census, 41% of Malagasies practised Christianity and 52% practise traditional religion, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the \"razana\" (ancestors); by 2020, only 4.5% of Malagasies exclusively practised folk religions and 85% were Christian (according to the Pew Research Center). The Association of Religion Data Archives noted that in 2020, 58.1% of the population is Christian, 2.1% is Muslim and 39.2% practices traditional faiths, while 0.6% of the population is non-religious or adheres to other faiths.\nMadagascar's traditional religions tend to emphasize links between the living and the dead. They believe that the dead join their ancestors in the ranks of divinity and that ancestors are intensely concerned with the fate of their living descendants. This spiritual communion is celebrated by the Merina and Betsileo reburial practice of famadihana, or \"turning over the dead\". In this ritual, relatives' remains are removed from the family tomb, rewrapped in new silk shrouds, and returned to the tomb following festive ceremonies in their honor. In the festivities, they eat, drink, and literally dance with the dead. After one or two days of celebrating, they shower the body with gifts and rebury it.\nMalagasy Christians are roughly 50% Catholic and 50% Protestant (mainly Reformed Protestant Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (FJKM), Lutheran, and Anglican), but there are also smaller groups such as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Eastern Orthodox Christians and evangelicals. Many incorporate the cult of the dead with their other religious beliefs and bless their dead at church before proceeding with the traditional burial rites. They also may invite a pastor to attend a famadihana. A historical rivalry exists between the predominantly Catholic masses, considered to be underprivileged, and the predominantly Protestant Merina aristocrats, who tend to prevail in the civil service, business, and professions.\nFollowers of Islam constitute approximately 3% of the population in 2022, according to the US Department of State; there are also small numbers of Hindus and Jews.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had more than 13,000 members in 42 congregations in Madagascar in 2013.\nA small community started practicing Judaism in 2010, and formally converted in 2016 with the assistance of Kulanu, a nonprofit organization focusing on remote Jewish communities."}
