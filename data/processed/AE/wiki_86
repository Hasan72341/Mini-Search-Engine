The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, and Michael Ironside. Based on the 1966 short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" by Philip K. Dick, \"Total Recall\" tells the story of Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker who receives an implanted memory of a fantastical adventure on Mars. He subsequently finds his adventure occurring in reality as agents of a shadow organization try to prevent him from recovering memories of his past as a Martian secret agent aiming to stop the tyrannical regime of the planet's dictator Vilos Cohaagen (Cox).\nShusett bought the rights to Dick's short story in 1974 and developed a script with O'Bannon. Although considered promising, the ambitious scope kept the project in development hell at multiple studios over sixteen years, seeing forty script drafts, seven different directors, and multiple actors cast as Quaid. \"Total Recall\" eventually entered the early stages of filming in 1987 under the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group shortly before its bankruptcy. Schwarzenegger, who had long held an interest in the project but had been dismissed as inappropriate for the lead role, convinced Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights and develop the film with him as the star. On an estimated $48\u201380million budget (making it one of the most expensive films made in its time), filming took place on expansive sets at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico over six months. Cast and crew experienced numerous injuries and illnesses during filming.\n\"Total Recall\" was anticipated to be one of the year's most successful films. On its release, the film earned approximately $261.4million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year. Its critical reception was mixed, with reviewers praising its themes of identity and questioning reality, but criticizing content perceived as vulgar and violent. The practical special effects were well received, earning the film an Academy Award, and the score by Jerry Goldsmith has been praised as one of his best works.\nSince its release, \"Total Recall\" has been praised for its ambiguous ending positing whether Quaid's adventures are real or a fantasy, and it has also been analyzed for themes of authoritarianism and colonialism. Retrospective reviews have called it one of Schwarzenegger's best films and placed it among the best science fiction films ever made. Alongside comic books and video games, \"Total Recall\" has been adapted into the 1999 television series \"Total Recall 2070\". An early attempt at a sequel, based on Dick's \"The Minority Report\", became the 2002 standalone film \"Minority Report\", while a 2012 remake, also titled \"Total Recall\", failed to replicate the success of the original.\nPlot.\nIn 2084, Mars is a colonized world under the tyrannical regime of Vilos Cohaagen, who controls the mining of valuable turbinium ore. On Earth, construction worker Douglas Quaid experiences recurring dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman. Intrigued, Quaid visits Rekall, a company that implants realistic false memories, and chooses one set on Mars (with a blue sky) where he is a Martian secret agent. However, before the implant is completed he lashes out, already thinking he is a secret agent. Believing Cohaagen's \"Agency\" has suppressed Quaid's memories, the Rekall employees erase evidence of Quaid's visit and send him home.\nEn route, Quaid is attacked by men led by his colleague Harry because he unknowingly revealed his past; Quaid's instincts take over and he kills his assailants. At home, he is assaulted by his wife Lori, who claims she was assigned to monitor Quaid by the Agency and that their marriage is a false memory implant. He flees but is pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband. A man who says he is Quaid's former acquaintance gives him a suitcase containing supplies and a video recording in which Quaid identifies himself as Hauser, a Cohaagen ally who defected after falling in love. According to the recording, Cohaagen brainwashed Hauser to become Quaid and conceal his secrets before securing him on Earth. Hauser instructs Quaid to return to Mars and stop Cohaagen.\nOn Mars, Quaid evades Richter and, following a note from Hauser, travels to Venusville, a district populated by humans and those mutated by air pollution and solar radiation within the cheaply built domes protecting the colony. He meets Melina, the woman from his dreams, who knows him as Hauser and believes he is still working for Cohaagen. In his hotel room, Quaid is confronted by Lori and Dr. Edgemar from Rekall, who tell Quaid he is still at Rekall on Earth, trapped in his fantasy memory and on the verge of permanent brain damage. Quaid notices Edgemar is sweating and, believing he is real, kills him. Quaid is captured by Richter's men, but Melina rescues him and Quaid kills Lori. The pair escape with taxi driver Benny to Venusville.\nThe mutants lead them to a hidden rebel base, where Quaid meets their leader Kuato, a mutant growing out of the abdomen of his brother George. Kuato psychically reads Quaid's mind, learning that Cohaagen is hiding a 500,000-year-old alien reactor built into a mountain that, once activated, produces breathable air but could also destroy all turbinium, ending Cohaagen's monopoly over both resources. Benny shoots George, revealing himself to be in Cohaagen's employ, and Cohaagen's forces attack the base, killing the rebels. Before he is shot by Richter, Kuato implores Quaid to start the reactor. Cohaagen disables Venusville's air supply to slowly suffocate the remaining inhabitants.\nQuaid and Melina are brought to Cohaagen, who explains that Hauser was his close friend who volunteered to become Quaid as an elaborate ruse to bypass the mutants' psychic abilities, infiltrate the rebellion, and destroy it. Quaid's Rekall visit had activated him earlier than planned and Cohaagen has been helping him to survive the oblivious Richter's pursuit. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be restored in Quaid and Melina to be reprogrammed as his subservient lover, but they manage to escape to the mines below the reactor. Benny, Richter, and his men attack them, but the pair outwits and kills them all.\nCohaagen awaits them in the reactor control room, claiming that activating it will destroy the planet. He activates an explosive to destroy the controls, but Quaid throws the explosive into a nearby tunnel, where it detonates and creates a breach to the Martian surface. The explosive decompression blows Cohaagen out to the surface where he suffocates and dies. Quaid activates the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. \nThe reactor melts the planet's ice core into gas that bursts to the surface, forming a breathable atmosphere and saving Quaid, Melina, and the rest of Mars's population. As everyone beholds the now-blue sky, Quaid momentarily wonders if everything was a dream, before he and Melina kiss.\nCast.\nThe Earth-based cast features Ray Baker as Rekall salesman Bob McClane, Robert Costanzo as Harry, and Alexia Robinson as Tiffany. Robert Picardo provides the voice and visual likeness of Johnnycab, an automated taxi driver.\nThe Martian cast includes Lycia Naff as Mary, a mutant three-breasted prostitute, Marc Alaimo as Captain Everett, Dean Norris as Tony, Debbie Lee Carrington as Thumbelina, Sasha Rionda as Mutant Child, Mickey Jones as Burly Miner, and Priscilla Allen as \"Fat lady\".\nProduction.\nEarly development.\nThe development of \"Total Recall\" began in 1974, when producer Ronald Shusett purchased the adaptation rights to science fiction writer Philip K. Dick's 1966 short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" for $1,000. Shusett had read the 23-page story by the then-little-known pulp fiction writer in an April 1966 edition of \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\". Dick's story depicts a meek clerk on Earth named Quail who visits Rekal Incorporated to receive a memory implant of being a secret agent on Mars. However, the process uncovers his true identity as a secret agent who previously visited Mars and whose death will bring about an alien invasion.\nRenaming it \"Total Recall\", Shusett worked with Dan O'Bannon to write the script. O'Bannon exhausted the existing material quickly, and the short story's abrupt ending meant he could only write thirty pages, effectively only the first act, and an original second and third act were needed; he suggested sending Quaid to Mars. Shusett and O'Bannon disagreed over the third act, the former wanting something more dramatic. O'Bannon's ending revealed the handprint on the alien machine as Quaid's, who is a replica of the original, and placing his hand on it grants him total memory recall. O'Bannon described the filmed ending as \"lame\". Dick read the script prior to his death in 1982 and, according to O'Bannon, enjoyed it. Although studios deemed Shusett and O'Bannon's script an ambitious and brilliant idea, it was essentially considered unfilmable, in part because of the extensive special effects and high budget that would be required.\nThe pair moved on to collaborating on the script for the science fiction horror film \"Alien\" (1979), the success of which earned Shusett a development deal at Walt Disney Studios. He pursued the \"Total Recall\" project at the studio, initially budgeted at $20million, but the idea did not progress because issues with the third act could not be resolved. The project was sold to Dino De Laurentiis's De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG) in 1982.\nDevelopment under De Laurentiis Entertainment Group.\nDe Laurentiis considered Richard Rush, Lewis Teague, Russell Mulcahy, and Fred Schepisi to direct the film, before choosing David Cronenberg in 1984. Cronenberg was unfamiliar with Dick's work but was interested in the script. Even so, problems remained with the third act and Cronenberg spent the next year writing twelve separate drafts. In his finished script, Quaid's true identity is Chairman Mandrell, the dictator of Earth who, following a failed assassination attempt on his life, is convinced by Mars Administrator Cohaagen to confront the organization that suppressed his memory. Cohaagen later reveals that Quaid is an inconsequential government worker chosen to play the role of Mandrell to facilitate Cohaagen usurping control of the Earth. Quaid defeats Cohaagen and assumes the identity of Mandrell. Cronenberg was responsible for the mutant characters, including Kuato (originally called Quato), and further developed an idea by Shusett about mutant animals, known as Ganzibulls, in the Martian sewers; Cronenberg made them mutant camels.\nCronenberg found himself at odds with Shusett regarding the tone, as Shusett and De Laurentiis did not want it to be as serious as the science fiction film \"Blade Runner\" (1982)\u2014an adaptation of Dick's novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (1968). Shusett described Cronenberg's work as bringing the film back to Dick's original short story, whereas they wanted an adventure closer to \"\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" go to Mars\". Cronenberg did not want to make that film and chose to quit. He was also frustrated by his disagreements with Shusett and De Laurentiis, and the casting of Richard Dreyfuss in the lead role. Dreyfuss had requested further rewrites to have Quaid reflect the everyman persona he had established in his previous films, rather than the action-focus of the Shusett/O'Bannon story. Cronenberg had wanted to cast William Hurt as the lead instead and focus more on the concepts of memory and identity. Christopher Reeve, Jeff Bridges, and Harrison Ford were also considered for Quaid. De Laurentiis threatened to sue Cronenberg for quitting but was placated by Cronenberg agreeing to work with him on a different film. A few years later, De Laurentiis offered Cronenberg the opportunity to make \"Total Recall\" as he had wanted, but Cronenberg was not interested and did not want to argue with Shusett again.\nDe Laurentiis sought to keep the budget low following the financial failure of \"Dune\" (1984), and wanted to reduce costs by eliminating Mars entirely, but Shusett and O'Bannon dissented. Problems with finalizing the script and the high budget continued to stall \"Total Recall\" for the next few years. In 1987, De Laurentiis again considered hiring Rush as director, but De Laurentiis disliked the finale featuring a breathable atmosphere on Mars while Rush supported the idea. De Laurentiis accepted he was wrong after hiring director Bruce Beresford, who also supported the ending. Around this time, writer Gary Goldman was offered an opportunity to refine the script, but he turned it down to focus on his own project, called \"Warrior\", that he was working on alongside director Paul Verhoeven at Warner Bros. Pictures. Beresford began preparations for a version of \"Total Recall\" described by Shusett as less gritty and more \"Spielbergian\" in tone, and Patrick Swayze was cast as Quaid. Set construction was underway in Australia when DEG filed for bankruptcy in 1988. Approximately 80 crew were fired and the sets had to be destroyed. By this point, the project had already accrued $8million in pre-production costs, and $6million in turnaround costs\u2014a process allowing other studios to purchase the idea.\nDevelopment under Carolco Pictures.\nArnold Schwarzenegger became aware of \"Total Recall\" in the mid-1980s, either during filming of \"Commando\" (1985) or \"Raw Deal\" (1986). He liked the script and agreed to pursue it alongside producer Joel Silver while filming \"Predator\" (1987), but the project remained unrealized due to its prohibitive budget and because De Laurentiis did not think Schwarzenegger was right for the lead role. Following DEG's bankruptcy, Schwarzenegger convinced Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar, co-owners of the independent film studio Carolco Pictures, with whom he had made \"Red Heat\" (1988), to purchase the rights for $3million, including pre-production costs. Schwarzenegger wanted to star in the film, pending rewrites to his satisfaction, and his fame and international appeal justified the studio investing the necessary budget. Carolco completed its acquisition of the majority of DEG's business and assets in April 1989. Schwarzenegger was given substantial influence over the project: he retained Shusett as a screenwriter and co-producer alongside producer Buzz Feitshans, and oversaw script revisions, casting decisions, and set construction. He described himself as effectively an executive producer without the responsibility, but he involved himself heavily because he wanted the project to work. He received a $10\u2013$11million salary, plus 15% of the film's profits.\nSchwarzenegger hired Verhoeven as the director after being impressed by his science fiction film \"RoboCop\" (1987), for which Schwarzenegger had been considered in the lead role. Verhoeven had previously been courted by Shusett to direct the film based on his work on \"Soldier of Orange\" (1977), but declined then because he did not like science fiction. Even so, Verhoeven accepted Schwarzenegger's offer after reading the Mars hotel scene where Dr. Edgemar attempts to convince Quaid he is still on Earth. Verhoeven had wanted to avoid special effects-heavy films after \"RoboCop\" and said that he did not realize how much effects work would be involved. He requested Goldman be brought in to help with rewrites, as well as some core personnel from \"RoboCop,\" including cinematographer Jost Vacano, production designer William Sandell, and special effects artist Rob Bottin. By this point, approximately thirty drafts had been completed, credited to a combination of Shusett and either O'Bannon, Jon Povill, or Steven Pressfield, among others. Verhoeven read each one and highlighted those he wanted Goldman to reference.\nWriting.\nGoldman had little knowledge of Dick's work but tried to respect the source material and work of previous screenwriters. He considered the second half of the film a concession to traditional Hollywood narratives and so retained most of the structure from Beresford's shooting script. Because the creative team wanted to commence soon, Goldman believed he did not have the freedom to make substantial changes to the script and focused on refining the existing content and making the scientific aspects more realistic. Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger agreed that everything after Dr. Edgemar's visit to Quaid on Mars was not working. Verhoeven wanted a significant change, to indicate that Edgemar could be telling the truth and Quaid is actually having a mental breakdown on Earth. Goldman rewrote the script to make it possible for the film to be viewed as both reality and fantasy. He also made Hauser an ally to Cohaagen, clearly defining Quaid and Hauser as separate identities. Goldman believed that making Hauser evil would better justify Quaid not returning to his original personality. It would also explain why Hauser becomes Quaid: to conceal his intentions from the psychic mutants. Goldman made the Benny character a villain, because he believed African Americans were typically typecast as good characters and the reveal would be surprising.\nThe script also had to be revised to match Schwarzenegger's action-hero public image, although Goldman tried to make it less comical than some of the actor's previous films. The meek clerk Quail was renamed Quaid, to avoid referencing then-vice president Dan Quayle, and became a muscle-bound construction worker, while fight scenes were rewritten to include more feats of strength and less martial arts or running. Second unit director and stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong, among other stunt people who had worked with Schwarzenegger on \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982) and \"Red Sonja\" (1985), said that they knew what he could physically do without looking silly. Schwarzenegger also wanted more creative methods to dispatch Quaid's foes because he had been criticized for an over-reliance on guns to kill people in films like \"Commando\". After Goldman's first rewrite, he discussed it with Verhoeven, Schwarzenegger, Shusett, Vajna, and Kassar. Schwarzenegger and Shusett believed the climax lacked emotion, which was an intentional choice by Verhoeven, who did not take the Martian rebel plot very seriously and prioritized the intellectual aspects of the narrative. To appease Schwarzenegger, Goldman conceived of Cohaagen shutting off the oxygen to the mutants in Venusville. After nearly sixteen years in development, seven directors, four co-writers, and forty script drafts, \"Total Recall\" went into production.\nCast and characters.\nVerhoeven chose Michael Ironside to portray Cohaagen's henchman Richter. Ironside had previously auditioned for the lead in \"RoboCop\" and Verhoeven had also offered him the role of antagonist Clarence Boddicker, which he turned down because he did not want to portray another \"psychopath\" character following his role in \"Extreme Prejudice\" (1987). Ironside said he considered Richter more of a \"sociopath\", who had personal ambitions and covets Cohaagen's position. Turning down a role on \"RoboCop\" and a separate film had created the impression that Ironside was difficult to work with, so he had to complete an audition before being offered the role. In it, he portrayed someone having an emotional breakdown leading to him lying on the floor crying as Verhoeven moved in for a closeup shot. Schwarzenegger believed Ironside's physical presence made him a credible threat to his portrayal of Quaid.\nThe female leads, Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone, were chosen in part for their athleticism, which was needed for the physically demanding roles. Stone said that her physically formidable character resulted in the cast and crew treating her like she was \"one of the guys\", and that Ironside \"was the one guy who never forgot I was a woman. When I was thrown down, he would help me up.\" Verhoeven's daughters were responsible for casting Benny, picking Mel Johnson Jr.'s screen test for the available options. He recounted having just finished filming a \"horrible\" black exploitation film when he read the \"Total Recall\" script and, after seeing Benny described as a \"black jivester\", he threw the script across the room. Nonetheless, he eventually read it through and decided to audition because he believed the character was more fully realized, saying \"this guy is cold and calculating and the story was intriguing.\"\nCox had previously worked with Verhoeven on \"RoboCop\" and traded on the actor's history of playing good-natured characters to make his villainous turn more impactful. Describing his portrayal, Cox said that he did not employ method acting but did try to understand how the character would feel and think and how he would react to situations and that would determine his performance. The character's hairstyle came about after Cox's hair was slicked-back in order to make a face mold for special effects purposes. Cox knew it was the right look and convinced Verhoeven to reshoot two days of Cox's scenes with the new style. When Marshall Bell auditioned for the role, the script did not explain the relationship between George and Kuato, and he was confused as to why George had so few lines. Although voice actors were considered for Kuato, Verhoeven decided to use Bell. Verhoeven based the appearance and physicality of Brocksmith's Dr. Edgemar on the central scientist character portrayed by Paul Newman in Alfred Hitchcock's 1966 thriller \"Torn Curtain\". He wanted an actor who looked \"naive and strange and a bit weird.\"\nFilming and post-production.\nPrincipal photography for \"Total Recall\" began in April\u2013May 1989. Filmed almost entirely in sequence\u2014a rare feat\u2014the production took place over 20 weeks. The initial budget was reported as $30million, but the final budget was reported as being between $48million and $80million. \"Total Recall\" was filmed almost entirely on sets at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, Mexico, where 43 cast and up to 500 crew members worked across forty-five sets on ten soundstages. The Earth train station was filmed in the Mexico City Metro and many exterior Mars scenes took place at the Valley of Fire State Park in Overton, Nevada.\nShusett and Goldman were present on set, providing additional rewrites where necessary; Goldman estimated the script was changed \"less than one percent\". Verhoeven sometimes required up to twenty takes of scenes, but remained faithful to the script and discouraged improvisation. Even so, some scenes, such as Benny's death, lacked sufficient detail and in these cases dialogue was mostly improvised. Although Verhoeven had been adamant that he did not want a second unit director\u2014having fired three of them on \"RoboCop\"\u2014Armstrong ended up filming 1,200 different setups and all of the fight scenes; Verhoeven was happy with his work. Armstrong's first scene was filming Schwarzenegger drilling cement.\nFilming was beset by injuries and illness. Almost everyone involved suffered from dust inhalation on set. Food poisoning and gastroenteritis from the local Mexican cuisine was also a problem, except for Shusett and Schwarzenegger, who had his food brought from the United States after a negative experience while filming \"Predator\" in Mexico. The illness compounded the difficulties Lycia Naff had filming her scenes as the three-breasted prostitute. She said she felt like crying because even though the breasts were artificial, she felt exposed in front of the cast and crew. Schwarzenegger cut his wrist while smashing a train window when an explosive designed to pre-detonate the glass failed. His injuries were patched up and concealed by his jacket. He also incurred other minor cuts and broken fingers.\nIronside cracked his sternum and separated two ribs after running into Michael Champion, who was holding an Uzi during the pursuit of Quaid and Melina in a Martian hotel. Filming had to be paused while he recovered, as Richter was involved in most of the remaining scenes. After three weeks, a producer asked that he return to filming but they could not obtain insurance unless Ironside performed fifty push-ups. Despite the doctor's advice, he attempted the feat and reinjured himself; after thirty push-ups, the doctor said it was sufficient. Ironside's first scene upon his return involved him fighting Schwarzenegger on an elevator, but he struggled to lift his arm. The doctor had Oakland Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett drop off a brace built for his own injury, which held Ironside's chest in a stable position, although it made breathing difficult. Ironside filmed his scene over the remainder of the day, only being hit once accidentally by Schwarzenegger, who was cautious due to his condition. A separate fight between Stone and Ticotin was arranged to feature one of the actresses and one stunt person because padding could not be concealed under their outfits. Verhoeven wanted the actresses to perform the fight stunts themselves, but Armstrong insisted on using a stunt person.\nSchwarzenegger was known for his pranks on the set, such as arranging styrofoam snowball fights and water pistol battles during dinners as well as booking parties to reward the crew for the six-day working weeks and practical stunts. Even so, Ironside recounted how Schwarzenegger helped him stay in regular contact with his ill sister using the personal phone in his trailer, at a time before widespread use of mobile phones or internet access. Ironside later learned Schwarzenegger was also regularly calling his sister to check on her.\nInitially scheduled for release on June 15, \"Total Recall\"'s post-production schedule was rushed to move the date forward two weeks to avoid competition from other films, particularly \"Dick Tracy\" with its cast of popular stars. Editor Frank J. Urioste worked overtime to complete \"Total Recall\"'s 113-minute cut early. This meant there was no time to test screen the film, which Verhoeven and Goldman believed worked against the finished product, including its third act. The film also had to be trimmed to remove violent content and gore, including a longer version of Benny's death, to avoid an X rating, which would have restricted attendance to audience members over the age of 17. \"Total Recall\" ultimately received an R rating, allowing younger people to see it when accompanied by an adult.\nSpecial effects and design.\nThe development of the film's special effects was led by Dream Quest Images, with Eric Brevig serving as visual effects supervisor, Alex Funke as special effects photographer, Thomas L. Fisher as special effects supervisor, William Sandell as production designer, and Mary Siceloff as effects producer. Rob Bottin, who previously worked with Verhoeven on \"RoboCop\", provided the character visual effects. Concept artist Ron Cobb and illustrator Ron Miller contributed to designs for technology, vehicles, and locations. Additional effects were provided by Metrolight Studios, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic.\n\"Total Recall\" features over 100 visual effects, including miniatures and bluescreen effects. The film was made at the onset of computer-generated imagery (CGI), which was not a suitable option for photorealistic or textured imagery, and was used mainly in the X-ray machine sequence. Most other effects were practical, employing sophisticated prosthetics and animatronics to realize automated taxi drivers, \"fat lady\" disguises, mutants, and scenes of explosive decompression. \"Total Recall\" features thirty-five sets across eight of Estudios Churubusco's soundstages. The sets were expansive and connected by tunnels so long that they continued outside of the stage, making it possible to drive between them on film.\nExpansive locations, including Martian exteriors, were created using miniature sets produced by Stetson Visual Services in Los Angeles, and supervised by Mark Stetson and Robert Spurlock. The sets were large, with the alien reactor being among the largest and most complex sets ever constructed in cinema, and the largest set built for the film. It had to be built vertically to fit on Dream Quest's stage. Even so, it was limited by the high ceilings. The Martian mountain set was also substantial, measuring tall and in diameter, with only the frontside constructed, allowing special effects to be operated from behind.\nMusic.\nThe score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The producers intended to have him record the score in Munich because the pay for musicians there was lower, but the players were unfamiliar with Goldsmith's style and the resulting score was disappointing. Instead, Goldsmith was given the funding necessary to record the score in London with the National Philharmonic Orchestra, who were more fitting to Goldsmith's musical intentions with brass and string instruments combined with electronic sounds. The recording was put on hiatus for three months so Verhoeven could have time to edit the special effects, during which Goldsmith recorded the score for \"\" (1990), before returning to finish his work on \"Total Recall\". Goldsmith also performed the commercial jingles and elevator music heard in the film, and composer Bruno Louchouarn provided additional pieces heard on Mars.\nRelease.\nContext.\nFollowing the previous year's record $5billion box office, more films than ever were expected to surpass $100million at box office as fifty films were scheduled for release during the summer theater season of 1990 (May 18 \u2013 September 3). \"Dick Tracy\" was predicted to dominate the box office, and films such as \"Another 48 Hrs.\", \"Back to the Future Part III\", \"Days of Thunder\", \"Die Hard 2\", \"RoboCop 2\", and \"Total Recall\" were expected to perform well based on their brand recognition and star appeal. These films were all scheduled for release by the end of June to ensure a long theatrical run during the peak time of the year, and other releases were scheduled to avoid opening against them. The importance of domestic box office grosses was also decreasing as studios increasingly earned profits from home media releases, television rights, and markets outside of the United States and Canada. These growing markets were, in turn, increasing film production costs as stars commanded higher salaries to compensate for their international appeal, with \"Total Recall\", \"Die Hard 2\", and \"Days of Thunder\" among the most expensive films being released. Average salaries for male leads had also increased to between $7\u2013$11million.\nMarketing.\nThe teaser for \"Total Recall\", made by distributor Tri-Star Pictures, disappointed Schwarzenegger and tested poorly with audiences. It lacked the action scenes and special effects, and presented the film in a vague, dramatic way. Schwarzenegger believed it \"cheapened\" the film, saying \"it looks like a $20million movie in this trailer... it's like a $50million movie.\" He contacted Peter Guber, the head of Tri-Star's owner Sony Pictures Studios, who contracted a different company, Cimmaron/Bacon/O'Brien, to produce a new trailer focusing on the action and special effects; it fared much better with audiences and attracted praise from industry professionals, such as Joel Silver.\nBox office.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, \"Total Recall\" was released on June1, 1990, in 2,060 theaters. It grossed $25.5million\u2014an average of $12,395 per theater\u2014and finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of \"Back to the Future Part III\" ($10.3million), which was in its second weekend of release, and \"Bird on a Wire\" ($6.3million), in its third. This figure gave it the highest opening weekend gross of the year to date, narrowly beating \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\"'s $25.4million. This was also the highest opening for an R-rated film, and one of the ten highest-grossing three-day opening weekends ever. The film fell to number two in its second weekend, with an additional gross of $15million (a decline of forty-one percent), behind the debut of \"Another 48 Hrs.\" ($19.5million), and to the number three position in its third week with an additional gross of $10.2million, behind \"Another 48 Hrs.\" ($10.7million) and the debut of \"Dick Tracy\" ($22.5million).\nBy mid-July, the film had earned over $100million and was classified as a success. During the remainder of its sixteen-weekend theatrical run, \"Total Recall\" never regained the number one position, leaving the top-ten highest-grossing films by the end of July. \"Total Recall\" earned an approximate total box office gross of $119.4million. This figure made it the second-highest-grossing film of the summer, behind the surprise success of \"Ghost\", and the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year behind \"The Hunt for Red October\" ($120.1million), \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" ($135.3million), \"Pretty Woman\" ($178.4million), \"Dances with Wolves\" ($184.2million), \"Ghost\" ($217.6million), and \"Home Alone\" ($285.8million).\nFigures are unavailable for all theatrical releases outside of the U.S. and Canada, but the film is estimated to have earned a further $142million, giving it a cumulative worldwide gross of $261.4million, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year, behind \"Dances with Wolves\" ($424.2million), \"Pretty Woman\" ($432.6million), \"Home Alone\" ($476.7million), and \"Ghost\" ($517.6million). Taking into account production fees, interest, residual payments, and other costs, \"Total Recall\" is estimated to have returned $36million in profit to the studio.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn its release, \"Total Recall\" received mixed reviews from critics, who generally praised the production values and Schwarzenegger's performance, but criticized the violent content. Audience polls by CinemaScore reported moviegoers gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.\nThe narrative polarized reviewers; some praised it as an above-average, complex, and visually interesting science fiction film that successfully blends humor with satirization of the genre's tropes, while others found it lacked humor, romance, or a strong narrative structure. Gene Siskel and Peter Travers believed the latter half of the film, after Quaid reaches Mars, to be where \"Total Recall\" became \"mechanical\", abandoning logic and artistic ambition for excessive action and violence. Travers described it as a transitory blockbuster in contrast to \"The Terminator\" (1984) (also starring Schwarzenegger), which he said would \"haunt our dreams\". Several reviewers agreed that the hotel confrontation between Quaid and Rekall's Dr. Edgemar on Mars, in which the former learns everything he has experienced is potentially a dream, was the best scene, and found the concept of overwriting memories and identity to be a genuinely horrifying concept. Jonathan Rosenbaum called it a \"worthy entry in the dystopian\" genre initiated by \"Blade Runner\" that avoided being derivative of its predecessors.\nThe film was often compared to Verhoeven's previous work on \"RoboCop\", with some reviews remarking that \"Total Recall\" lacked the same \"impudence and incandescence\" or satirization of 1980s action films as the earlier film. Some said the film was only fun when Verhoeven inserted moments of \"RoboCop\"'s camp style. \"The Washington Post\"'s review compared it unfavorably with the Sylvester Stallone action film \"Cobra\" (1986), saying it was disappointing in its overuse of violence and abandonment of cynicism and creativity for machoism and misogyny. Several reviews focused on the excessive violence, with Vincent Canby describing it as part of an influx of action-adventure films featuring numerous deaths, counting seventy-four kills in the film and over two hundred in \"Die Hard 2\". Some were concerned by the dismissive and sometimes comical depiction of the deaths, and the general reliance on violence as a solution to all problems posed. Even so, the \"Los Angeles Times\"'s review said the violence never seemed to be deliberately sadistic or callous. Despite this criticism, Bottin's practical effects were roundly praised, particularly the three-breasted prostitute and mutants that provided many of the film's standout visuals, despite their sometimes perverse or macabre nature.\nReviews praised Schwarzenegger for playing against his public action hero image by portraying a confused, vulnerable, and sympathetic character, with Roger Ebert considering him vital to the film's success. Desson Howe and Travers described it as Schwarzenegger's finest and most interesting work since \"The Terminator\". Even so, others believed the actor's \"superman presence\" and comic one-liners were out of place and undermined attempts to make the audience emotionally connect with Quaid's genuine fears about his identity. Janet Maslin wrote that this was further harmed by the narrative failing to emphasize his dual identities. Some reviews considered the role to be beyond Schwarzenegger's acting abilities, describing him as \"unusually oafish... a cross between Frankenstein's monster, a hockey puck, and Colonel Klink\", incapable of generating a romantic connection with Stone's or Ticotin's characters. Some female reviewers were critical of the film's treatment of women, who they perceived as \"hybrid hooker-commandos\" and \"basically whores\", writing that the three-breasted prostitute is the film's idea of a \"witty mutation\" while Ticotin \"registers less strongly than Stone's ambiguous, blonde slut-wife\".\nAccolades.\nAt the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991, \"Total Recall\" won the award for Best Visual Effects (Eric Brevig, Rob Bottin, Tim McGovern, and Alex Funke). The film received a further two nominations: Best Sound (Nelson Stoll, Michael J. Kohut, Carlos Delarios, and Aaron Rochin) and Best Sound Effects Editing (Stephen Hunter Flick). At the 44th British Academy Film Awards, the film received one nomination, for Best Special Visual Effects (losing to the comedy film \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" (1989)). At the 17th Saturn Awards, \"Total Recall\" was named Best Science Fiction Film. It was also nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (losing to fantasy romance film \"Edward Scissorhands\").\nPost-release.\nAftermath.\nFollowing \"Total Recall\", Schwarzenegger's popularity continued to grow as he went on to star in \"Kindergarten Cop\" (1990), \"\" (1991), and \"True Lies\" (1994), earning over $1billion combined at the box office and solidifying his status as the most popular international film celebrity, based on surveys of studio executives and talent agents. Verhoeven worked with Stone again when he directed the box office success \"Basic Instinct\" (1992) for Carolco. Despite their desire to collaborate on another project, Schwarzenegger and Verhoeven did not work together again. Their last attempt to do so, the big-budget historical drama \"Crusade\", was abandoned by Carolco in the mid-1990s in favor of \"Cutthroat Island\" (1995), a box office flop that contributed to Carolco entering bankruptcy the same year.\nShusett and Goldman did not like aspects of \"Total Recall\", believing it was overly long and failed to make the audience care about the mutants, as well as disliking the excessive swearing, violence, and deaths. They also thought the special effect of Schwarzenegger's and Ticotin's swelling heads went on too long and, alongside Verhoeven, they regretted the rushed post-production and lack of test screenings to solicit feedback that could have led to a \"tighter\" re-edit on the third act. \"Total Recall\" also failed to impress Cronenberg, who believed Schwarzenegger was not the right actor for the lead role. Two lawsuits followed the film's release. John J. Goncz, a prop maker, sued for $3million alleging that his credit was removed from \"Total Recall\" after he refused permission for Carolco to merchandise a survival knife he made for it. A separate suit, also for $3million, was brought by the Southern California Consortium, who said \"Total Recall\" used animated sequences they had created for scientific videos about planets orbiting the Sun. The outcomes of these lawsuits are unknown.\nHome media.\n\"Total Recall\" was released on VHS and LaserDisc on November 1, 1990; it was rushed out to take advantage of the Christmas season. It was priced at $24.99, a relatively low figure compared to standard prices closer to $90, because audience research had shown a willingness to purchase the film due to its rewatchability. Although retailers normally avoided selling films with violent or sexual content, they were willing to stock \"Total Recall\". It was predicted to perform well as a purchase and rental. It became one of the bestselling home entertainment products of the year, in which purchases outperformed rentals for the first time. It was also one of the top rentals in December, trading the number one position back and forth with \"Pretty Woman\".\nThe film was first released on DVD in 2000, and received criticism from \"IGN\" for what was perceived as poor image quality. It was followed by a special edition version in 2001 that included a commentary track with Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger and a documentary about the film's production, including its release and subsequent reaction. A special \"Total Recall: Mind-Bending Edition\" Blu-ray was released in 2012, featuring a high-definition restoration from the original negative. This version included a new interview with Verhoeven and a comparison of the restored footage against the original. For its 30th anniversary in 2021, the film was remastered as a 4K resolution Ultra HD Blu-ray (including a digital copy) based on a digital scan from the original 35mm film negatives under Verhoeven's supervision. As well as content from the 2012 Blu-ray, this release introduced a 60-minute documentary about the success and failure of Carolco Pictures, and retrospectives on the film score, special effects, and production. A separate 5-disc collectors edition was released with a double-sided poster, art cards, essays about the film and the score on compact disc (CD).\nGoldsmith's score was first released on CD in 1990 with 10 tracks. A deluxe edition was released in 2000 with 27 tracks. Coinciding with the 30th anniversary, Quartet Records released the remastered soundtrack on a 2-CD and limited edition 3-Vinyl record set. The anniversary edition included the score plus alternates and source music, restored by Goldsmith's long-time sound mixer Bruce Botnick.\nOther media.\nA novelization of the film, written by Piers Anthony and based on the script and Dick's original novel, was released in 1990; it retains the original character name of Douglas Quail. That same year, an action-platformer video game, \"Total Recall\", was released for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and Nintendo Entertainment System, and Amiga, and Atari ST computers. A ZX Spectrum version was planned but cancelled because it would not be ready for the Christmas 1990 release date. A comic book adaptation of the film was also released in 1990 by DC Comics. A 2011 four-issue miniseries comic book was released by Dynamite Entertainment. Written by Vince Moore with art by Cezar Rezak, the series' narrative continues on from the end of the film, depicting Quaid dealing with a Mars still in chaos following Cohaagen's death.\nThemes and analysis.\nThemes.\nThe main theme of \"Total Recall\" is the question of whether or not Quaid's experiences are real or a dream induced by his failed Rekall memory implantation. Despite the film's deviations from Dick's original story, both focus on this theme. Verhoeven explicitly wanted both possibilities to be viable, although his personal preference is that Quaid's experiences are a dream. He explained \"it's a dream, which is disturbing to the audience because they don't want that, of course. They want an adventure story, they don't want a fake adventure story. So they are on [Quaid's] side trying to believe that it's all true, while [Dr. Edgemar] is trying to tell him that it's not true.\" Quaid chooses to believe in his reality and kills Dr. Edgemar. Lori confirming that the Quaid persona is effectively a dream breaks down the barrier between reality and fantasy, leaving Quaid and the audience unable to definitively determine the reality of what they are experiencing.\nIt is left up to the audience to determine what is real, and because of Schwarzenegger's public image as a superhuman action hero, the possibility remains that Quaid's adventures on Mars are real. Verhoeven said that re-watching the film can induce more doubt in the audience, particularly when the Rekall manager, Bob McClane, effectively outlines everything that will happen to Quaid after the memory implantation. During the same scene, Melina is shown on the Rekall screen before Quaid has met her. At the film's end, Quaid still questions if everything is a dream, and Melina suggests that he kiss her before he wakes up. English professor Jason P. Vest said that by not including herself in Quaid's possible delusion, Melina both suggests and denies she is a creation of Quaid's fantasy. Ironside stated that he believed the film is an analog for manipulating reality for the common people through news and the media at the behest of those in power. Writer Bek Aliev believed that this theme remains relevant in the age of social media, where the line between a person's average life and more curated online life becomes blurred.\nAnother theme of \"Total Recall\" is the meaning of identity in a world where memories are commodities that can be erased or fabricated completely. Vest contrasted this with \"Blade Runner,\" in which memory is presented as a precious and vital component of the human experience, while in \"Total Recall,\" memories can be easily removed, replaced, or revised and these changes are generally embraced. When Quaid learns that he is really Hauser, he affirms to himself \"I am Quaid\" and rejects the Hauser personality.\nAuthor David Hughes wrote that Quaid is not an altered version of Hauser but a completely separate personality with his own memories and morality. He contrasted Quaid with \"Blade Runner\"'s replicants\u2014artificial humans\u2014except that it is Quaid's mind that is artificial. Quaid is forced to choose between returning to his original but antagonistic persona or remaining as the artificial but benevolent construct of Quaid. Hughes considered this an interesting moral choice and true to Dick's work. Quaid is offered a chance at a better life by being restored to Hauser's higher social status, but will lose himself in the process. Goldman believed Quaid's refusal to be the authentic choice because he did not believe someone would willingly and permanently give up their identity. \"SyFy\" writer Noah Berlatsky said that as an everyday worker who desires grand adventures, Quaid is an audience stand-in, and suggested the hologram projector that creates a duplicate image of Quaid to be akin to the audience viewing themselves through the phantom personality that is Quaid.\nThe film presents a politically, morally, and visually unattractive future in which the Earth's locations are covered in brutalist, concrete architecture. Verhoeven specifically chose to use this style because he believed it suggested a cruel society indifferent to the suffering of the Martian colonists as long as turbinium ore mining continues. Mars is represented ubiquitously with various red hues, invoking associations with blood, danger, and a hellish domain. The in-film Propaganda networks show reality being altered in real-time, as they brand the resistance as terrorists and describe the indiscriminate slaughter of them as restoring order with minimal use of force.\nAnalysis.\nAccording to Vest and English professor Frank Grady, most political assessments of the film considered it left-wing for its anti-corporation and revolutionary message but Vest perceived a more conservative subtext in which the \"white protagonist saves a society of the less well-off who cannot save themselves\". They identified \"Total Recall\" as one of many films produced throughout the 1980s\u2014such as \"\" (1985) and \"Predator\"\u2014that were \"fronted by white male characters who employ violence to preserve American righteousness, liberty, autonomy, and reinforce an idealistic American image of combating unnecessary bureaucracy, fascists, communists, and foreign and domestic threats\". Schwarzenegger identified himself as a conservative and supporter of U.S. president Ronald Reagan, which Vest opined made him \"an unusual choice to portray the protagonist who liberates Mars from Cohaagen's dictatorship\". Quaid's rejection of the Hauser persona can be seen as an example of self-determination and American exceptionalism, but in doing so he also avoids responsibility or punishment for Hauser's acts, which Grady considered an act of moral cynicism. Historian Stephen Prince described Quaid's choice not as the loss of self, but conscious rejection of it. Remarking on the similarities between \"Total Recall\" and the science fiction film \"The Matrix\" (1999), educator Neal King found that both protagonists begin as discontented workers who learn their life is a fabrication, become instrumental to those rebelling against overwhelming authority, and eventually learn they were deliberately created to quash the rebellion. Any good deeds they perform are a result of who they were programmed to be, meaning their free will is an illusion.\nGrady and \"SyFy\" writer Stephanie Williams described the privatization of air in \"Total Recall\" as the extreme of unchecked corporate power, comparing it to the real world privatization of water sources by companies whose core incentive is to increase profits, such as in the Flint water crisis. The mutants on Mars are the result of early colonists exposed to a toxic atmosphere because of cheap domes, and their offspring still serve Cohaagen, meaning the authorities have escaped any responsibility for their involvement. In the end, Cohaagen suffocates in a toxic atmosphere that he could have changed at any time. The film also contains a number of product placements for brands such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and Jack in the Box, promoting corporate interests while portraying an anti-corporate stance.\nLinda Mizejewski, a professor of women's studies at the Ohio State University, suggests that the name \"Cohaagen\" is supposed to sound Afrikaans and this, along with the character's links to the mining industry, is part of an analogy between Apartheid-era South Africa, in which there was a highly prosperous mining industry, and sharply defined class divisions, akin to those in the film between the mining executives and the ordinary, oppressed Martians. Likewise, Aliev considered the relationship between the lower classes on Mars and the government to be analogous to real-world colonial and post-colonial social structures, such as Apartheid. The technology that undermines the existing power structure is a metaphor for decolonization and championing the voices of the oppressed. Vest believed \"Total Recall\" did not offer a positive representation of minorities, as Benny, the only important African American character, collaborates with Cohaagen and helps assassinate the Martian freedom fighter Kuato. Vest believed that his repeated references to having multiple children \"reinforced stereotypes of African American men as irresponsible and promiscuous\", and that \"his alliance with Cohaagen presents the character as untrustworthy, selfish, and corrupt\".\nVest identified certain elements in the film as sexist and misogynistic. Many female characters are presented as prostitutes or mutants, which he believed suggested that \"femininity is a source of moral or physical deformity\". Many female characters are violently killed throughout, such as Lori, who is dispatched while Schwarzenegger quips that she should \"consider that a divorce\". However, while Melina is sometimes reliant on Quaid to save her, both she and Lori are portrayed as effective fighters and Melina is essential to saving Quaid's life at the end. Union College film studies co-director Michelle Chilcoat wrote that \"Total Recall\" began a decade of cyberpunk films that focused on a separation and transformation of the mind away from a traditional human body, such as \"The Lawnmower Man\" (1992), \"Strange Days\" (1995), and \"The Matrix\". Even so, Chilcoat argues that given the option to become anything via Rekall, \"Total Recall\" repeatedly asserts Quaid's heterosexuality.\nLegacy.\nModern reception.\nSince its release, several publications have named \"Total Recall\" as one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Rotten Tomatoes named it one of the 300 essential films to watch, and it is also listed in the book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average score of . The consensus reads, \"Under Paul Verhoeven's frenetic direction, \"Total Recall\" is a fast-paced rush of violence, gore, and humor that never slacks.\" The film has a score of 60 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 17 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nIn a 2012 retrospective, \"Vulture\" wrote that despite its anachronistic aspects, such as outdated technology, \"Total Recall\" remained relevant, particularly in its themes of the oppressed fighting back against their oppressors, which was compared to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement. Discussing the film in 2016, \"The A.V. Club\" described it as one of the best 1980s-style action films. Other publications have called it one of Schwarzenegger's most entertaining films and one of his best roles. The film's score, by Jerry Goldsmith, is considered among his finest work and, in his own words, one of his \"greatest scores\".\nA 2020 \"Inverse\" retrospective argued that \"Total Recall\", not \"Blade Runner\", was the best adaptation of Dick's work, despite its deviations from the source material. He argued that \"Blade Runner\" presented a stylish and cool future, whereas \"Total Recall\" presents an \"ugly, banal, and grimy\" future. Similarly, he believed Quaid's upbeat, amoral antihero protagonist was closer to Dick's traditional protagonists. Even so, \"Comic Book Resources\" wrote that \"its weirdness and appreciation of dumb-fun\" meant that it would probably never be as highly considered as \"Blade Runner\" or films such as \"\" (1968). To mark Schwarzenegger's 75th birthday in 2022, \"Variety\" listed \"Total Recall\" as the fourth-best film in his 46-year career.\nCultural influence.\n\"Total Recall\" became one of the most expensive films ever made in its time, and one of the last big-budget films to use almost entirely practical special effects. It is also seen as among the films responsible for a significant rise in the costs of film production because of the high salaries studios like Carolco paid to stars with international appeal such as Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Mel Gibson, recouping their investment by selling their films to the rapidly growing film markets outside of the U.S. and Canada. Alongside the boost to Schwarzenegger's career, \"Total Recall\" also redefined Stone from a model to a legitimate film star.\nA 2020 \"SyFy\" article credited \"Total Recall\" as one of three action films, along with \"Terminator 2\" and \"True Lies\" (1994), that revived Schwarzenegger's career after a series of less successful action films such as \"The Running Man\" (1987), and \"Red Heat\". Schwarzenegger recounted coming across the film on television that year, and believing it still held up, saying: \"that is really great filmmaking... when you can, after 30 years, watch a movie and it still feels the same.\" Schwarzenegger also named his 2012 memoir \"Total Recall\".\nIn 2020, \"The Guardian\" wrote that, with hindsight, \"Total Recall\" formed the middle of Verhoeven's unofficial science fiction action film trilogy about authoritarian governance, following \"RoboCop\" and preceding \"Starship Troopers\" (1997). Quaid's line, \"consider that a divorce\", after killing Lori, is considered one of Schwarzenegger's most iconic one-line quips from his filmography, and the three-breasted prostitute, portrayed by Lycia Naff, is regarded as an iconic character in cinematic history. Although she eventually came to terms with the role, Naff was initially embarrassed by her appearance in \"Total Recall\" and avoided interviews or fan interactions, saying \"I decided not to answer every letter from every prisoner in the world who was writing to me...\"\n\"Total Recall\" influenced films such as \"The Matrix\", \"The 6th Day\" (2000), also starring Schwarzenegger, as well as other media such as \"Rick and Morty\", \"South Park\", and \"The Expanse\". It has been referenced in politics when, during his 2020 address to the Austrian World Summit climate conference about the urgency of their 2050 climate neutrality goal, Dutch politician and European Commissioner for Climate Action, Frans Timmermans, said, \"it's been 30 years since \"Total Recall\" and \"Kindergarten Cop\" \u2014 I mean these things go so fast... we have to act now and we can.\"\nSequel and adaptations.\n\"Total Recall\"'s success led to development of a sequel. Goldman had optioned another of Dick's works, the 1956 novella \"The Minority Report\", intending to direct it himself. Unable to make progress on that project, he and Shusett worked together on adapting \"The Minority Report\" into a \"Total Recall\" sequel in 1993, depicting Quaid as the head of an organization that uses mutants with precognition abilities to predict and stop crimes before they happen. Carolco struggled to secure either funding or Schwarzenegger's interest to progress the project before its bankruptcy. The television rights to \"Total Recall\" were bought by DFL Entertainment for $1.2million to develop the television series \"Total Recall 2070\" (1999). The show, set entirely on Earth, was not based on the film and was described by author David Hughes as closer to a \"Blade Runner\" adaptation. In the interim, Shusett and Goldman had removed the \"Total Recall\" elements from their script to develop it as a standalone film, \"Minority Report\" (2002).\nThe film rights to \"Total Recall\" were bought by Dimension Films for $3.15million at Carolco's bankruptcy auction. The studio began development of a sequel, intending to bring back the principal cast, but not Verhoeven. Matt Cirulnick developed a script, but Shusett's original contract guaranteed him first draft rights to a sequel and he, based on an earlier agreement, was obliged to work with Goldman. The pair's story continued from the end of \"Total Recall\" with Mars now an independent planet. The rebels explore Quaid's mind for Hauser's memories of a mind-control project. It featured several twists, including Quaid waking up at Rekall on Earth, and other hints that he is living within a dream. Schwarzenegger became actively involved by 1998, but believed their idea was overly complicated. Cirulnick wrote another draft, revealing that Hauser and Quaid are both fabricated personalities, and depicting the destruction of Mars to save Earth from a bomb placed in the Sun. This draft was well received by Dimension, but he was asked to rewrite it to lower the budget. Development eventually ceased as a series of failed films had harmed Dimension financially, and the studio was unable to reach an agreement with Schwarzenegger.\nThe rights to \"Total Recall\" were eventually purchased by Columbia Pictures and a remake was announced in 2009. Released in 2012, the film, also called \"Total Recall\", starred Colin Farrell, Bryan Cranston, Kate Beckinsale, and Jessica Biel. Its plot follows elements of the 1990 film but omits Mars entirely, taking place on a mostly uninhabitable Earth. The film failed to replicate the financial or critical success of the original.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55329", "revid": "5230605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55329", "title": "Neturei Karta", "text": "Haredi Jewish anti-Zionist organization\nNeturei Karta () is a Jewish anti-Zionist organization that was founded in Jerusalem in 1938 and is primarily active in parts of Israel and the Western world. It was established by Haredi Jews originally affiliated with World Agudath Israel, which represented the most devout members of the Haredi community of the Old Yishuv. The organization's members, who adhere to stringent interpretations of Jewish religious law, are known for their religious conservatism and insular lifestyles. Neturei Karta's international political activism is rooted in its opposition to Israel's existence, which, in turn, is rooted in its members' core religious belief that the Jewish exile is to be maintained until the coming of the Messiah.\nInitially, World Agudath Israel largely disagreed with the secular orientation of political Zionism, believing that it did not place enough importance on Judaism and thus constituted a threat to Haredi communities globally. However, it eventually reneged to reach an understanding with Zionist aspirations in light of World War II and the Holocaust. The founders of Neturei Karta, Amram Blau and Aharon Katzenelbogen, disagreed with the Aguda's accommodationist stance and broke off from the movement.\nMembers of Neturei Karta believe that Israel's founding was an affront to God because it provided the means for an effectively secular undoing of the Jewish exile, while also being a Jewish state that does not absolutely govern by religious law. The organization believes that the Jewish people may only be restored to the Land of Israel by the Messiah, who will bring about the resurrection of the dead, the ingathering of the exiles, and a complete return to Torah law. As such, it does not recognize Israel and has pursued relationships with entities seeking to destroy Israel. With regard to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Neturei Karta endorses a form of the one-state solution in which the Palestinian people control the combined territory of Israel and the State of Palestine.\nThe views of Neturei Karta's members are considered fringe, even within Haredi Jewish circles. On numerous occasions, a number of anti-Zionist Orthodox Jewish movements have denounced Neturei Karta for its pursuit of relationships with the Iranian government, neo-Nazis, and Holocaust deniers, particularly after Neturei Karta members attended the 2006 International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, which was condemned by the United Nations and much of the international community.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Neturei Karta\" means \"city guards\" in Aramaic and is derived from an \"aggadta\" recorded in several texts of the Talmud, including the Jerusalem Talmud Hagigah 1:7 (page six in the standard Vilna edition). There, it is related that:\nJudah the Prince sent rabbis to tour the cities of Israel and establish for them teachers and scribes. They came to one place and did not find a teacher or a scribe. They said, \"Bring us the city guards,\" and the city watchmen were brought. They said, \"These are the city ruiners, but those are the city guards.\" And who were the city guards? The scribes and the teachers, who guard the Torah day and night.\nThe name thus reflects Neturei Karta's original mission to oppose efforts in the Old Yishuv to establish a Jewish armed force during the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt, as the group believed that such a force would be destructive and that Torah scholars are the true guards of the Jewish people. Today, Neturei Karta members generally understand the name to mean that they defend their interpretation of Jewish religious law against that of other rabbis, namely those who do not oppose modern Israel's existence.\nHistory.\nBefore modern Israel.\nIn the Old Yishuv under the Ottoman Empire, the religious Jewish communities primarily concentrated in the Jewish holy cities of Jerusalem, Safed, Hebron, and Tiberias largely eschewed the secular orientation of political Zionism, which they saw as a potential threat to their way of life. They resented the new arrivals, who were predominantly non-religious, while they asserted that Jewish redemption could be brought about only by the Jewish messiah.\nIn 1921, some of the most devout of the Ashkenazi Old Yishuv formed the Haredi Council of Jerusalem as a counterpoint to the Chief Rabbinate, created by the British Mandatory Palestine government. The Haredi saw the rabbinate as a capitulation to the secular Zionists and their nationalist aspirations.\nThe Aguda movement represented by the Haredi Council opposed the formation of a Jewish political state in the Land of Israel and discouraged its European members from immigrating to Palestine. However, in the 1930s, the movement adopted a more compromising and accommodationist approach to the Zionist movement in response to rising antisemitism in Europe. Aguda's leniency was too much for Rabbi Amram Blau, active in Aguda's Jerusalem chapter. Along with Rabbi Aharon Katzenelbogen, Blau split with the Aguda in 1937 and co-founded Chevrat HaChayim, quickly renamed Neturei Karta.\nSince Israeli independence.\nAfter the creation of the modern State of Israel in 1948, Neturei Karta refused to recognize the Israeli government or any of its institutions. The group began holding public protests that often turned violent over what they perceived as the secularization of Jerusalem, the violation of Shabbat in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, and public gender mixing.\nAfter the Six-Day War, Neturei Karta began cultivating friendly relationships in the Arab world. In 1969, the group protested Israel outside the United Nations, then in 1970 held a similar protest with the new Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Then Neturei Karta leader Moshe Hirsch befriended PLO leader Yasir Arafat, who many Israelis viewed as their public enemy number one. Arafat appointed Hirsch to the symbolic position of Jewish affairs minister, receiving a $30,000 monthly salary. Two Neturei Karta members participated in a 2004 prayer vigil for Arafat outside the Percy Military Hospital in Paris, France, where he lay on his death bed, an act widely condemned by other Orthodox Jewish organizations, including many other anti-Zionist Haredi organizations, both in New York and Jerusalem. Hirsh attended Arafat's funeral in Ramallah.\nFollowing the Hamas incursion into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and the subsequent Israeli offensive in Gaza, Yisroel Dovid Weiss, spokesman for the worldwide religious group Neturei Karta, and his Neturei Karta colleagues, have been active in advocating for Palestinians in Gaza.\nNK activists have appeared almost every day at U.S. cease-fire rallies, where hundreds of members live.\nIn 1 March 2024, NK members joined a protest in New York that defaced the Wall Street statue with \"Death to Israel.\" Nine people were arrested.\nIn September 2024, NK rabbis\u2019 were present at an interfaith meeting in New York with Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian during General Assembly of the United Nations.\nMembers.\nGenerally, members of Neturei Karta are descendants of Hungarian Jews and Lithuanian Jews who were students of the Gaon of Vilna (known as \"Perushim\") who had settled in Jerusalem in the early nineteenth century. In the late nineteenth century, their ancestors participated in the creation of new neighborhoods outside the city walls to alleviate overcrowding in the Old City, and most are now concentrated in the neighborhood of Batei Ungarin and the larger Meah Shearim neighborhood.\nNeturei Karta is notoriously vague about its size, and there are no official population statistics available, in 1971, it was reported to consist of several hundred families in Israel and throughout the diaspora. As recently as 2007, the group was reported to have a few thousand members. \"Haaretz\" estimated in 2024 that the group had a membership in the low thousands, predominantly in Israel, but also in diaspora locations with large populations of ultra-Orthodox Jews.\nRelationship with other Jewish movements.\nThe group's strong anti-Zionist stance and controversial tactics place Neturei Karta on the fringe, even in Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox circles. Other movements, including anti-Zionist sects like the Satmar, have disavowed Neturei Karta and condemned its activities. The Satmar movement criticized Neturei Karta for attending the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in Tehran in 2006. During the Gaza war, Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, one of the two Grand Rebbes of Satmar, condemned Neturei Karta, calling the group's support for Hamas \"a terrible desecration of God's name.\" Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Jacobson, a leading Chabad rabbi, condemned Neturei Karta and described their actions as \"like somebody marching with Hitler.\"\nOne of the targets of the 2008 Mumbai attacks was the Nariman House, which was operated by the Jewish Chabad movement. Neturei Karta subsequently issued a leaflet criticising the Chabad movement for its relations with \"the filthy, deplorable traitors \u2013 the cursed Zionists that are your friends.\" It added that the Chabad movement has been imbued with \"false national sentiment\" and criticised the organisation for allowing all Jews to stay in its centres, without differentiating \"between good and evil, right and wrong, pure and impure, a Jew and a person who joins another religion, a believer and a heretic.\" The leaflet also criticised the invitation of Israeli state officials to the funerals of the victims, claiming that they \"uttered words of heresy and blasphemy.\" The leaflet concluded that \"the road [Chabad] have taken is the road of death and it leads to doom, assimilation and the uprooting of the Torah.\"\nJewish groups often accuse Neturei Karta of selling out their fellow Jews by allying with antisemitic groups and using their appearance at rallies as token Jews. Neturei Karta have compared Zionists to Nazis; they have denied the Judaism of Zionists, with statements like: \"Zionists are not Jews, only racists\" and \"Zionism does not represent the Jewish people.\"\nBeliefs.\nExile of the Jewish people.\nNeturei Karta stress what is said in the mussaf Shemona Esrei (\"The Standing Prayer\") of Yom Tov, that because of their sins, the Jewish people went into exile from the Land of Israel (\"\"umipnei chatoeinu golinu meiartzeinu\"\"). Additionally, they maintain the view that any form of forceful recapture of the Land of Israel is a violation of divine will. They believe that the restoration of the Land of Israel to the Jews should happen only with the coming of the Messiah, not by self-determination, and some believe that the introduction of less-observant Jews would cause problems in the sacred land as defined by the Torah.\nConditions for Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel.\nNeturei Karta believes that the Messiah will usher in a Jewish theocracy to rule over the Land of Israel. The messiah will bring about the resurrection of the dead, the ingathering of the exiles, and a complete return to Torah law.\nNeturei Karta believe that the exile of the Jews can end only with the arrival of the Messiah, and that human attempts to establish Jewish sovereignty over the Land of Israel are sinful. In Neturei Karta's view, Zionism is a presumptuous affront against God. Chief among their arguments against Zionism is the Talmudic concept of the so-called Three Oaths, extracted from the discussion of certain portions of the Bible. It states that a pact consisting of three oaths was made between God, the Jewish people, and the nations of the world, when the Jews were sent into exile. One provision of the pact was that the Jews would not rebel against the non-Jewish world that gave them sanctuary; a second was that they would not immigrate en masse to the Land of Israel. In return, the gentile nations promised not to persecute the Jews. By rebelling against this pact, they argued, the Jewish people were engaging in rebellion against God.\nThe Neturei Karta synagogues follow the customs of the Gaon of Vilna, due to Neturei Karta's origin within the Lithuanian rather than Hasidic branch of Haredi Judaism. Neturei Karta is not a Hasidic but a Litvish group; they are often mistaken for Hasidim because their style of dress (including a shtreimel on Shabbos) is very similar to that of Hasidim. This style of dress is not unique to Neturei Karta, but is also the style of other Jerusalem Litvaks, such as Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv and his followers. Furthermore, Shomer Emunim, a Hasidic group with a similar anti-Zionist ideology, is often bundled together with Neturei Karta. Typically, the Jerusalem Neturei Karta will keep the customs of the \"Old \"Yishuv\"\" of the city of Jerusalem even when living outside of Jerusalem or even when living abroad, as a demonstration of their love for and connection to the Holy Land.\nRelationship with the State of Israel.\nIn July 2013, the Shin Bet arrested a 46-year-old member of Neturei Karta for allegedly attempting to spy on Israel for Iran. As part of a plea deal, the man was sentenced to 4&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 years in prison. Neturei Karta has denied that he had ever been a member of their group.\nNeturei Karta's website states that its members \"frequently participate[s] in public burning of the Israeli flag.\" On the Jewish holiday of Purim, Neturei Karta members have routinely burned Israeli flags in celebrations in cities such as London, Brooklyn and Jerusalem.\nWhile many in Neturei Karta chose to simply ignore the State of Israel, this has become more difficult. Some took steps to condemn Israel and bring about its eventual dismantling until the coming of the Messiah. Chief among these was Moshe Hirsch, leader of an activist branch of Neturei Karta, who served in Yasser Arafat's cabinet as Minister for Jewish Affairs.\nActivities.\nPalestinian nationalism.\nNeturei Karta supports a sovereign Palestinian state in the present, however, argues for complete Jewish sovereignty in the Holy Land upon the arrival of the Messiah.\nIn addition to halakhic opposition to the organization of a Jewish state in the Holy Land, Neturei Karta also criticizes Israeli policies of aggression towards Palestinian people. They have rejected the claim that Israel is democratic, citing what they refer to as racist, genocidal treatment of Palestinians.\nRelations with Palestinian groups.\nAfter the Gaza War, four Neturei Karta members crossed into Gaza in 2010 as part of the Gaza Freedom March to celebrate Jewish \"Shabbos\" and show support for Palestinians.\nIn January 2023, three members of Neturei Karta met with prominent Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) officials and families of Palestinian militants during a visit to the Jenin refugee camp. The Neturei Karta members also visited the home of Bassam al-Saadi, who was jailed by Israel for PIJ leadership activities. Upon their return to Israel, Israeli authorities arrested two of the Neturei Karta members for unlawful entry to Area A of the West Bank. The Satmar rebbe publicly denounced the group for their conduct, remarking in his speech that \"It is a terrible desecration of God's name to support murderers in the name of the holy Torah and God's name.\"\nNeturei Karta asserts that the mass media deliberately downplays their viewpoint and makes them out to be few in number. Their protests in America are usually attended by, at most, a few dozen people. In Israel, the group's protests typically attract several hundred participants, depending on the nature of the protest and its location.\nNeturei Karta regularly participates in pro-Palestine protests, including protests organized by Palestinian-led groups like Within Our Lifetime. Their signs at Gaza war protests criticize Israel and include slogans such as: \"Torah true Jews oppose the aggression in al-Aqsa and the occupation of all Palestine\" and \u201cState of \u2018Israel\u2019 does not represent world Jewry!\" They took part in the Columbia University pro-Palestinian campus protests and occupations during the Gaza war. According to \"The Forward\", the bulk of their statements at protests do not reference their halakhic opposition to Israel but publicly appear close to the views of left-wing American Jewish groups such as IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace.\nRelationship with Iran.\nIn October 2005, Neturei Karta leader Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss issued a statement criticising Jewish attacks on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Weiss wrote that Ahmadinejad's statements were not \"indicative of anti-Jewish sentiments\", but rather, \"a yearning for a better, more peaceful world\", and \"re-stating the beliefs and statements of Ayatollah Khomeini, who always emphasized and practiced the respect and protection of Jews and Judaism.\"\nIn March 2006, several members of a Neturei Karta's faction visited Iran, where they met with Iranian leaders, including the vice-president, and praised Ahmadinejad for calling for the \"Zionist regime\" occupying Jerusalem to vanish from the pages of time. The spokesmen commented that they shared Ahmadinejad's aspiration for \"a disintegration of the Israeli government\". In an interview with Iranian television reporters, Rabbi Weiss remarked: \"The Zionists use the Holocaust issue to their benefit. We, Jews who perished in the Holocaust, do not use it to advance our interests. We stress that there are hundreds of thousands Jews around the world who identify with our opposition to the Zionist ideology and who feel that Zionism is not Jewish, but a political agenda. ... What we want is not a withdrawal to the '67 borders, but to everything included in it, so the country can go back to the Palestinians and we could live with them ...\".\nAttendance at Holocaust denial conference in Tehran.\nIn December 2006, members of Neturei Karta, including Yisroel Dovid Weiss, attended the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, a controversial conference held in Tehran, Iran that attracted a number of high-profile Holocaust deniers.\nIn his speech, Weiss explained that the occurrence of the Nazi Holocaust was irrefutable and spoke about the murder of his own grandparents at Auschwitz, but claimed that Zionists had \"collaborated with the Nazis\" and \"thwarted...efforts to save...Jews\" and expressed solidarity with the Iranian position of anti-Zionism. Yonah Metzger, the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of Israel, immediately called for those who went to Tehran to be put into 'cherem', a form of ex-communication. Subsequently, the Satmar Hassidism court called on Jews \"to keep away from them and condemn their actions\".\nOn 21 December, the Edah HaChareidis rabbinical council of Jerusalem also released a statement calling on the public to distance itself from those who went to Iran. The Edah's statement followed, in major lines, the Satmar statement released a few days earlier. In January 2007, a group of protesters stood outside the Neturei Karta synagogue in Monsey, New York, demanding that they leave Monsey and move to Iran. Neturei Karta and their supporters from Monsey's Orthodox community responded with a counter-protest.\nFactionalism.\nIn the United States, the Neturei Karta were led by Moshe Ber Beck of Monsey, New York, until his death in 2021. They affiliate with the radical branch that was led by Moshe Hirsch. Beck had courted controversy by meeting with Nation of Islam leader Minister Louis Farrakhan, who has been accused of inciting antisemitism and of describing Judaism as a \"gutter religion\" (Farrakhan says his words were misinterpreted). In addition, after meeting with the representatives from Neturei Karta, Farrakhan indicated he would be more cautious in his choice of words in the future.\n\"Sikrikim\".\nA radical breakaway faction called \"Sikrikim\" is based in Israel, mainly in Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh. The group's engagement in acts of vandalism, \"mafia-like intimidation\" and violent protests caused several people, including authority figures, to push for officially labeling them as a terrorist group, along with Neturei Karta.\nFootnotes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55335", "revid": "46051904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55335", "title": "Discounting", "text": "When a creditor delays payments from a debtor in exchange for a fee\nIn finance, discounting is a mechanism in which a debtor obtains the right to delay payments to a creditor, for a defined period of time, in exchange for a charge or fee. Essentially, the party that owes money in the present purchases the right to delay the payment until some future date. This transaction is based on the fact that most people prefer current interest to delayed interest because of mortality effects, impatience effects, and salience effects. The discount, or charge, is the difference between the original amount owed in the present and the amount that has to be paid in the future to settle the debt.\nThe discount is usually associated with a \"discount rate\", which is also called the \"discount yield\". The discount yield is the proportional share of the initial amount owed (initial liability) that must be paid to delay payment for 1 year.\nformula_1\nSince a person can earn a return on money invested over some period of time, most economic and financial models assume the discount yield is the same as the rate of return the person could receive by investing this money elsewhere (in assets of similar risk) over the given period of time covered by the delay in payment. The concept is associated with the opportunity cost of not having use of the money for the period of time covered by the delay in payment. The relationship between the discount yield and the rate of return on other financial assets is usually discussed in economic and financial theories involving the inter-relation between various market prices, and the achievement of Pareto optimality through the operations in the capitalistic price mechanism, as well as in the discussion of the efficient (financial) market hypothesis. The person delaying the payment of the current liability is essentially compensating the person to whom he/she owes money for the lost revenue that could be earned from an investment during the time period covered by the delay in payment. Accordingly, it is the relevant \"discount yield\" that determines the \"discount\", and not the other way around.\nAs indicated, the rate of return is usually calculated in accordance to an annual return on investment. Since an investor earns a return on the original principal amount of the investment as well as on any prior period investment income, investment earnings are \"compounded\" as time advances. Therefore, considering the fact that the \"discount\" must match the benefits obtained from a similar investment asset, the \"discount yield\" must be used within the same compounding mechanism to negotiate an increase in the size of the \"discount\" whenever the time period of the payment is delayed or extended. The \"discount rate\" is the rate at which the \"discount\" must grow as the delay in payment is extended. This fact is directly tied into the time value of money and its calculations.\nThe \"time value of money\" indicates there is a difference between the \"future value\" of a payment and the \"present value\" of the same payment. The rate of return on investment should be the dominant factor in evaluating the market's assessment of the difference between the future value and the present value of a payment; and it is the market's assessment that counts the most. Therefore, the \"discount yield\", which is predetermined by a related return on investment that is found in the different markets in the financial sector, is what is used within the time-value-of-money calculations to determine the \"discount\" required to delay payment of a financial liability for a given period of time.\nBasic calculation.\nIf we consider the value of the original payment presently due to be \"P\", and the debtor wants to delay the payment for \"t\" years, then a market rate of return denoted \"r\" on a similar investment asset means the future value of \"P\" is formula_2, and the discount can be calculated as\n formula_3\nWe wish to calculate the present value, also known as the \"discounted value\" of a payment. Note that a payment made in the future is worth less than the same payment made today which could immediately be deposited into a bank account and earn interest, or invest in other assets. Hence we must discount future payments. Consider a payment \"F\" that is to be made \"t\" years in the future, we calculate the present value as \n formula_4\nSuppose that we wanted to find the present value, denoted \"PV\" of $100 that will be received in five years time. If the interest rate \"r\" is 12% per year then\n formula_5\nDiscount rate.\nThe discount rate which is used in financial calculations is usually chosen to be equal to the cost of capital. The cost of capital, in a financial market equilibrium, will be the same as the market rate of return on the financial asset mixture the firm uses to finance capital investment. Some adjustment may be made to the discount rate to take account of risks associated with uncertain cash flows, with other developments.\nThe discount rates typically applied to different types of companies show significant differences:\nThe higher discount rate for start-ups reflects the various disadvantages they face, compared to established companies:\nOne method that looks into a correct discount rate is the capital asset pricing model. This model takes into account three variables that make up the discount rate:\nDiscount factor.\nThe discount factor, \"DF(T)\", is the factor by which a future cash flow must be multiplied in order to obtain the present value. For a zero-rate (also called spot rate) \"r\", taken from a yield curve, and a time to cash flow \"T\" (in years), the discount factor is:\n formula_6\nIn the case where the only discount rate one has is not a zero-rate (neither taken from a zero-coupon bond nor converted from a swap rate to a zero-rate through bootstrapping) but an annually-compounded rate (for example if the benchmark is a US Treasury bond with annual coupons) and one only has its yield to maturity, one would use an annually-compounded discount factor:\n formula_7\nHowever, when operating in a bank, where the amount the bank can lend (and therefore get interest) is linked to the value of its assets (including accrued interest), traders usually use daily compounding to discount cash flows. Indeed, even if the interest of the bonds it holds (for example) is paid semi-annually, the value of its book of bond will increase daily, thanks to accrued interest being accounted for, and therefore the bank will be able to re-invest these daily accrued interest (by lending additional money or buying more financial products). In that case, the discount factor is then (if the usual money market day count convention for the currency is ACT/360, in case of currencies such as United States dollar, euro, Japanese yen), with \"r\" the zero-rate and \"T\" the time to cash flow in years:\n formula_8\nor, in case the market convention for the currency being discounted is ACT/365 (AUD, CAD, GBP):\n formula_9\nSometimes, for manual calculation, the continuously-compounded hypothesis is a close-enough approximation of the daily-compounding hypothesis, and makes calculation easier (even though its application is limited to instruments such as financial derivatives). In that case, the discount factor is:\n formula_10\nOther discounts.\nFor discounts in marketing, see discounts and allowances, sales promotion, and pricing. The article on discounted cash flow provides an example about discounting and risks in real estate investments.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55336", "revid": "32990417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55336", "title": "Cash", "text": "Physical money\nCash is money in the physical form of currency, such as banknotes and coins.\nIn book-keeping and financial accounting, cash is current assets comprising currency or currency equivalents that can be accessed immediately or near-immediately (as in the case of money market accounts). Cash is seen either as a reserve for payments, in case of a structural or incidental negative cash flow, or as a way to avoid a downturn on financial markets.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"cash\" originally meant 'money box', and later came to have a secondary meaning 'money'. This secondary usage became the sole meaning in the 18th century. The word \"cash\" comes from the Middle French 'money box', which comes from the Old Italian , and ultimately from the Latin 'box'.\nHistory.\nIn Western Europe, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, coins, silver jewelry and hacksilver (silver objects hacked into pieces) were for centuries the only form of money, until Venetian merchants started using silver bars for large transactions in the early Middle Ages. In a separate development, Venetian merchants started using paper bills, instructing their banker to make payments. Similar marked silver bars were in use in lands where the Venetian merchants had established representative offices. The Byzantine Empire and several states in the Balkan area and Kievan Rus also used marked silver bars for large payments. As the world economy developed and silver supplies increased, in particular after the colonization of South America, coins became larger and a standard coin for international payment developed from the 15th century: the Spanish and Spanish colonial coin of 8 reales. Its counterpart in gold was the Venetian ducat.\nCoin types would compete for markets. By conquering foreign markets, the issuing rulers would enjoy extra income from seigniorage (the difference between the value of the coin and the value of the metal the coin was made of). Successful coin types of high nobility would be copied by lower nobility for seigniorage. Imitations were usually of a lower weight, undermining the popularity of the original. As feudal states coalesced into kingdoms, imitation of silver types abated, but gold coins, in particular, the gold ducat and the gold florin were still issued as trade coins: coins without a fixed value, going by weight. Colonial powers also sought to take away market share from Spain by issuing trade coin equivalents of silver Spanish coins, without much success.\nIn the early part of the 17th century, English East India Company coins were minted in England and shipped to the East. In England, over time the word \"cash\" was adopted from Sanskrit \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937 karsa, a weight of gold or silver but akin to the Old Persian \ud800\udfa3\ud800\udfbc\ud800\udfc1 karsha, unit of weight (83.30 grams). East India Company coinage had both Urdu and English writing on it, to facilitate its use within the trade. In 1671, the directors of the East India Company ordered a mint to be established at Bombay, known as Bombaim. In 1677 this was sanctioned by the Crown, the coins, having received royal sanction, were struck as silver rupees; the inscription runs \"The rupee of Bombaim\", by the authority of Charles II.\nAround that time, coins were also being produced for the East India Company at the Madras mint. The Tamil the word for money is kaasu, which may have been modified into 'cash'. Both words, 'kaasu' and 'cash', have the same meaning, unlike money box. The currency at the company's Bombay and Bengal administrative regions was the rupee. At Madras, however, the company's accounts were reckoned in \"pagodas\", \"fractions\", \"fanams\", \"faluce\" and \"cash\". This system was maintained until 1818 when the rupee was adopted as the unit of currency for the company's operations.\nPaper money was first used in China during the Tang dynasty, 500 years prior to it catching on in Europe. During his visit to China in the 13th century, Marco Polo was amazed to find that people traded paper money for goods rather than valuable coins made of silver or gold. He wrote extensively about how the Great Kaan used a part of the Mulberry Tree to create the paper money as well as the process with which a seal was used to impress on the paper to authenticate it. Marco Polo also talks about the chance of forgery and states that someone caught forging money would be punished with death. In the 17th century, European countries started to use paper money in part due to a shortage of precious metals, leading to fewer coins being produced and put into circulation. At first, it was most popular in the colonies of European powers. In the 18th century, important paper issues were made in colonies such as Ceylon and the bordering colonies of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice. John Law did pioneering work on banknotes with the \"Banque Royale\". The relation between money supply and inflation was still imperfectly understood and the bank went under rendering its notes worthless, because they had been over-issued. The lessons learned were applied to the Bank of England, which played a crucial role in financing the Peninsular War against French troops, hamstrung by a metallic Franc de Germinal.\nThe ability to create paper money made nation-states responsible for the management of inflation, through control of the money supply. It also made a direct relation between the metal of the coin and its denomination superfluous. From 1816, coins generally became token money, though some large silver and gold coins remained standard coins until 1927. The World War I saw standard coins disappear to a very large extent. Afterward, standard gold coins, mainly British sovereigns, would still be used in colonies and less developed economies and silver Maria Theresa thalers dated 1780 would be struck as trade coins for countries in East Asia until 1946 and possibly later locally.\nCash has now become a very small part of the money supply. Its remaining role is to provide a form of currency storage and payment for those who do not wish to take part in other systems, and make small payments conveniently and promptly, though this latter role is being replaced more and more frequently by electronic payment systems. Research has found that the demand for cash decreases as debit card usage increases because merchants need to make less change for customer purchases.\nCash is increasing in circulation. The amount of the United States dollar in circulation increased by 42% from 2007 to 2012. The amount of pound sterling banknotes in circulation increased by 29% from 2008 to 2013. The amount of euro in circulation increased by 34% from August 2008 to August 2013 (2% of the increase was due to the adoption of euro in Slovakia 2009 and in Estonia 2011).\nMotives of cash holding.\nIn economic theory (according Keynesian economics), the cash holding of cash (especially sight deposits) is roughly attributed to three motives:\nThe transactions motive covers the business needs of economic subjects, the precautionary motive serves to hold money for liquidity purposes and to provide for crisis situations, and the speculation motive, according to John Maynard Keynes, results from the uncertainty about future interest rate developments and relates to financial investments.\nIn addition to this purely economic importance, there are other aspects of cash use:\nIn practice, there may be a combination of such motives, with the precautionary motive of preserving value and anonymous payment being decisive. Due to its unique characteristics, there is no perfect substitute for cash. Demonetisation or capital control can destabilize the economy if electronic means of payment are not readily available (e.g. 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation).\nCash in circulation.\nCash in circulation is characterized by strong seasonal fluctuations. Wage and salary payment dates, tax payment dates or holidays lead to statistically perceptible increases in cash in circulation, for which the credit institutions are preparing. Since cash holdings at banks do not earn interest and can also lead to security problems (bank robbery), banks usually only hold very small amounts of cash. They are therefore forced to involve the central bank in times of higher cash requirements. Therefore, the cash in circulation only remains unchanged if the banks hand over cash from their own cash holdings to their bank customers or take cash deposits from their customers into their own holdings.\nThe ratio of the cash in circulation in relation to the gross domestic product (cash to GDP ratio) is a good indicator of cash usage and payment behavior in an economy. In countries like the United States, increased use of debit and credit cards is increasing the amount of cash in circulation at a slower rate than in countries with a high amount of cash payments. In 2018, it ranged from 1.3% (in Sweden) to more than 21% (in Japan), 10.5% in Switzerland and 10.7% in the eurozone. \nSince around 2018, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, cash in circulation in the eurozone has increased significantly while the share of cash payments (i.e. transactions) has decreased, known as the \"paradox of banknotes\". Analyzes show that private households are increasingly keeping cash as a precaution against crises and that negative interest rates also play a role. This effect is also observed in many other currency areas, e.g. in the United States and Japan.\nBanknote tracking.\nIn most jurisdictions, banknotes are not routinely tracked by serial number. There are the following exceptions in cash applications:\nSince 2016, the People's Bank of China has requested the recording of banknotes issued and deposited at ATMs and bank counters, arguing that counterfeit money will be prosecuted. \nWith Directive ECB/2010/14, the European Central Bank (ECB) requires banks to check the authenticity of deposited and withdrawn banknotes at bank counters and ATMs using tested devices. They are required to trace the origin of suspected counterfeit banknotes to the depositing account holder. They must also physically seize any counterfeit notes and coins.\nCompetition of cash.\nCashless payments.\nCashless society can be defined as one in which all financial transactions are handled through \"digital\" forms (debit and credit cards) in preference to cash (physical banknotes and coins). Cashless societies have been a part of history from the very beginning of human existence. Barter and other methods of exchange were used to conduct a wide variety of trade transactions during this time period.\nSince the 1980s, the use of banknotes has increasingly been displaced by credit and debit cards, electronic money transfers and mobile payments, but much slower than expected. The cashless society has been predicted for more than forty years, but cash remains the most widely used payment instrument in the world and on all continents. In 17 out of 24 studied countries, cash represents more than 50% of all payment transactions, with Austria at 85%, Germany at 80%, France at 68%. The United Kingdom at 42%, Australia at 37%, United States at 32%, Sweden at 20%, and South Korea at 14% are among the countries with lower cash usage.\nBy the 2010s, cash was no longer the preferred method of payment in the United States. In 2016, the United States User Consumer Survey Study reported that three out of four of the participants preferred a debit or credit card payment instead of cash. Some nations have contributed to this trend, by regulating what type of transactions can be conducted with cash and setting limits on the amount of cash that can be used in a single transaction.\nCash is still the primary means of payment (and store of value) for unbanked people with a low income and helps avoiding debt traps due to uncontrolled spending of money. It supports anonymity and avoids tracking for economic or political reasons. In addition, cash is the only means for contingency planning in order to mitigate risks in case of natural disasters or failures of the technical infrastructure like a large-scale power blackout or shutdown of the communication network. Therefore, central banks and governments are increasingly driving the sufficient availability of cash. The US Federal Reserve has provided guidelines for the continuity of cash services, and the Swedish government is concerned about the consequences in abandoning cash and is considering to pass a law requiring all banks to handle cash.\nDigital and virtual currencies.\nDigital currency is a generic term for various approaches to support secure transactions of the public or using a distributed ledger, like blockchain, as a new technology for decentralized asset management. The blockchain 1.0 era has enabled the application of virtual digital currencies in the marketplace, such as money transfer and payment systems. It considers establishing an electronic version of the national currency which is backed by the central bank as the issuer. Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, such as Bitcoin. Facebook's concept for the diem is based on a token to be backed by financial assets such as a basket of national currencies. \nIn 2012, Bank of Canada was considering introducing digital currency. Meanwhile, it rates digital currency a fairly complicated decision and is analyzing the pros and cons and working to determine under which conditions it may make sense to, one day, issue a digital currency. As a threat, a central bank digital currency could increase the risk of a run on the banking system. \nAlso in 2012, Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, was reported to analyze technological advances with regard to electronic money and payment methods for digital currency as an alternative to cash. In 2019, it is investigating whether Swedish krona need to be made available in electronic form, the so-called e-krona, and if so, how it would affect Swedish legislation and the Riksbank's task. It has started procuring a technical supplier to develop and test solutions for a potential future e-krona. No decisions have yet been taken on issuing an e-krona.\nCosts of payment.\nAn analysis by the Deutsche Bundesbank in 2017 found that a cash payment in retail costs an average of 24 euro cents, while payments with a girocard cost 30 cents (or often 0.3 to 0.4% of sales plus a transaction fee) and with a credit card charge one euro which is included in the sales price. This is why retailers often refuse to accept card payments below a minimum amount. Depending on the account model, there are also booking costs for the account holder with an average of 35 euro cents charged for each(!) account posting. Because of this convenient source of income, commercial banks and credit card companies favor cashless payments.\nIn the case of cashless payment transactions, in addition to the documentation of the payment itself, the personal details of the payer are usually linked to the data of the payee according to the Know Your Customer (KYC) principle. This enables the payment process to be precisely traced for the payer and the payee. The constant increase in digitization leads to a more detailed recording of cashless payment transactions and their evaluation for advertising and marketing campaigns.

At the age of 20 (1904) he began studying in the military institute founded by Lu Jianzhang at Beijing and had since become Lu's favorite. In 1912 the troops of Lu and Feng Yuxiang, now subordinates of Yuan Shikai, were regrouped and Feng had then been Song's superior.\nMilitary career.\nIn 1917, a year after being appointed the head of 1st battalion of Feng's 2nd regiment, his battalion spearheaded the removal of Zhang Xun from his imperial restoration in 1917. As part of the Guominjun he became Governor of Jehol Province in 1926. Following the defeat of the Guominjun in the Anti\u2013Fengtian War Feng Yuxiang participated in the Northern Expedition, S\u00f2ng assumed the Chairmanship of Shaanxi province in November 1927 and in April of the same year the head of 4th division under the II Corps of the National Revolutionary Army.\nSwitching sides to the Kuomintang after the abortive coup d'\u00e9tat in 1930 of Feng against Chiang Kai-shek, his troops were designated as the 29th Army and garrisoned in southern Shanxi province where he was responsible for the frontiers of the Rehe and Chahar provinces against the Japanese in Manchukuo.\nChair of Chahar province.\nSong was the chairman of Chahar province when Japan invaded the provinces in the end of year 1932. Though poorly equipped compared to the better armed Japanese, Song led the 29th army to resist the aggression in a war known as the Defense of the Great Wall (\u71b1\u6cb3\u9577\u57ce\u4e4b\u6230). Japanese troops then entered the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin after the predictable victory. Song was relieved from his post but reinstalled as commander after the He\u2013Umezu Agreement.\nLater years.\nIn the Battle of Lugou Bridge, his 29th Army bore the brunt of the Japanese Kwantung Army. His troops were halved after the defeat and chased by the Japanese along the Jinpu Railway into Shandong Province during the Beiping\u2013Hankou Railway Operation. However Han Fuqu, chairman of the province and suspected for his clandestine Japanese liaison, forbade Song to retreat across the Yellow River, resulting in the 29th Army being shattered at Shijiazhuang in December 1937 and January 1938. Remaining forces suffered various losses against the Imperial Japanese Army and were delegated to guerrilla combat after retreating into the mountainous regions at the borders of Henan and Shanxi province in February 1938.\nHe soon suffered various illnesses and died at the age of 54 in Mianyang County, Sichuan province after several unsuccessful medical treatments in Guilin, Chongqing, and Chengdu."}

{"id": "55345", "revid": "50151310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55345", "title": "Net present value", "text": "Valuation in finance\nThe net present value (NPV) or net present worth (NPW) is a way of measuring the value of an asset that has cashflow by adding up the present value of all the future cash flows that asset will generate. The present value of a cash flow depends on the interval of time between now and the cash flow because of the time value of money (which includes the annual effective discount rate). It provides a method for evaluating and comparing capital projects or financial products with cash flows spread over time, as in loans, investments, payouts from insurance contracts plus many other applications.\nTime value of money dictates that time affects the value of cash flows. For example, a lender may offer 99 cents for the promise of receiving $1.00 a month from now, but the promise to receive that same dollar 20 years in the future would be worth much less today to that same person (lender), even if the payback in both cases was equally certain. This decrease in the current value of future cash flows is based on a chosen rate of return (or discount rate). If for example there exists a time series of identical cash flows, the cash flow in the present is the most valuable, with each future cash flow becoming less valuable than the previous cash flow. A cash flow today is more valuable than an identical cash flow in the future because a present flow can be invested immediately and begin earning returns, while a future flow cannot.\nHow NPV is determined.\nNPV is determined by calculating the costs (negative cash flows) and benefits (positive cash flows) for each period of an investment. After the cash flow for each period is calculated, the present value (PV) of each one is achieved by discounting its future value (see Formula) at a periodic rate of return (the rate of return dictated by the market). NPV is the sum of all the discounted future cash flows.\nBecause of its simplicity, NPV is a useful tool to determine whether a project or investment will result in a net profit or a loss. A positive NPV results in profit, while a negative NPV results in a loss. The NPV measures the excess or shortfall of cash flows, in present value terms, above the cost of funds. In a theoretical situation of unlimited capital budgeting, a company should pursue every investment with a positive NPV. However, in practical terms a company's capital constraints limit investments to projects with the highest NPV whose cost cash flows, or initial cash investment, do not exceed the company's capital. NPV is a central tool in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and is a standard method for using the time value of money to appraise long-term projects. It is widely used throughout economics, financial analysis, and financial accounting.\nIn the case when all future cash flows are positive, or incoming (such as the principal and coupon payment of a bond) the only outflow of cash is the purchase price, the NPV is simply the PV of future cash flows minus the purchase price (which is its own PV). NPV can be described as the \"difference amount\" between the sums of discounted cash inflows and cash outflows. It compares the present value of money today to the present value of money in the future, taking inflation and returns into account.\nThe NPV of a sequence of cash flows takes as input the cash flows and a discount rate or discount curve and outputs a present value, which is the current fair price. The converse process in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis takes a sequence of cash flows and a price as input and as output the discount rate, or internal rate of return (IRR) which would yield the given price as NPV. This rate, called the yield, is widely used in bond trading.\nFormula.\nEach cash inflow/outflow is discounted back to its present value (PV). Then all are summed such that NPV is the sum of all terms:\nformula_1\nwhere:\nThe result of this formula is multiplied with the Annual Net cash in-flows and reduced by Initial Cash outlay the present value, but in cases where the cash flows are not equal in amount, the previous formula will be used to determine the present value of each cash flow separately. Any cash flow within 12 months will not be discounted for NPV purpose, nevertheless the usual initial investments during the first year \"R\"0 are summed up a negative cash flow.\nThe NPV can also be thought of as the difference between the discounted benefits and costs over time. As such, the NPV can also be written as:\nformula_5\nwhere:\nGiven the (period, cash inflows, cash outflows) shown by (t, formula_6, formula_7) where N is the total number of periods, the net present value formula_8 is given by:\nformula_9\nwhere:\nThe NPV can be rewritten using the net cash flow formula_12 in each time period as:formula_13By convention, the initial period occurs at time formula_14, where cash flows in successive periods are then discounted from formula_15 and so on. Furthermore, all future cash flows during a period are assumed to be at the end of each period. For constant cash flow R, the net present value formula_8 is a finite geometric series and is given by:\nformula_17\nInclusion of the formula_3 term is important in the above formulae. A typical capital project involves a large negative formula_3 cashflow (the initial investment) with positive future cashflows (the return on the investment). A key assessment is whether, for a given discount rate, the NPV is positive (profitable) or negative (loss-making). The IRR is the discount rate for which the NPV is exactly 0.\nCapital efficiency.\nThe NPV method can be slightly adjusted to calculate how much money is contributed to a project's investment per dollar invested. This is known as the capital efficiency ratio. The formula for the net present value per dollar investment (NPVI) is given below:\nformula_20\nwhere:\nExample.\nIf the discounted benefits across the life of a project are $ and the discounted net costs across the life of a project are $ then the NPVI is:\nNPVI= \u2248 0.6667\nThat is for every dollar invested in the project, a contribution of $ is made to the project's NPV.\nAlternative discounting frequencies.\nThe NPV formula assumes that the benefits and costs occur at the end of each period, resulting in a more conservative NPV. However, it may be that the cash inflows and outflows occur at the beginning of the period or in the middle of the period.\nThe NPV formula for mid period discounting is given by:\nformula_23\nOver a project's lifecycle, cash flows are typically spread across each period (for example spread across each year), and as such the middle of the year represents the average point in time in which these cash flows occur. Hence mid period discounting typically provides a more accurate, although less conservative NPV.\n\u0427\u0438\u043a\u0419\nThe NPV formula using beginning of period discounting is given by:\nformula_24\nThis results in the least conservative NPV.\nThe discount rate.\nThe rate used to discount future cash flows to the present value is a key variable of this process.\nA firm's weighted average cost of capital (after tax) is often used, but many people believe that it is appropriate to use higher discount rates to adjust for risk, opportunity cost, or other factors. A variable discount rate with higher rates applied to cash flows occurring further along the time span might be used to reflect the yield curve premium for long-term debt.\nAnother approach to choosing the discount rate factor is to decide the rate which the capital needed for the project could return if invested in an alternative venture. If, for example, the capital required for Project A can earn 5% elsewhere, use this discount rate in the NPV calculation to allow a direct comparison to be made between Project A and the alternative. Related to this concept is to use the firm's reinvestment rate. Re-investment rate can be defined as the rate of return for the firm's investments on average. When analyzing projects in a capital constrained environment, it may be appropriate to use the reinvestment rate rather than the firm's weighted average cost of capital as the discount factor. It reflects opportunity cost of investment, rather than the possibly lower cost of capital.\nAn NPV calculated using variable discount rates (if they are known for the duration of the investment) may better reflect the situation than one calculated from a constant discount rate for the entire investment duration. Refer to the tutorial article written by Samuel Baker for more detailed relationship between the NPV and the discount rate.\nFor some professional investors, their investment funds are committed to target a specified rate of return. In such cases, that rate of return should be selected as the discount rate for the NPV calculation. In this way, a direct comparison can be made between the profitability of the project and the desired rate of return.\nTo some extent, the selection of the discount rate is dependent on the use to which it will be put. If the intent is simply to determine whether a project will add value to the company, using the firm's weighted average cost of capital may be appropriate. If trying to decide between alternative investments in order to maximize the value of the firm, the corporate reinvestment rate would probably be a better choice.\nRisk-adjusted net present value (rNPV).\nUsing variable rates over time, or discounting \"guaranteed\" cash flows differently from \"at risk\" cash flows, may be a superior methodology but is seldom used in practice. Using the discount rate to adjust for risk is often difficult to do in practice (especially internationally) and is difficult to do well.\nAn alternative to using discount factor to adjust for risk is to explicitly correct the cash flows for the risk elements using risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV) or a similar method, then discount at the firm's rate.\nUse in decision making.\nNPV is an indicator of how much value an investment or project adds to the firm. With a particular project, if formula_2 is a positive value, the project is in the status of positive cash inflow in the time of\u00a0\"t\". If formula_2 is a negative value, the project is in the status of discounted cash outflow in the time of\u00a0\"t\". Appropriately risked projects with a positive NPV could be accepted. This does not necessarily mean that they should be undertaken since NPV at the cost of capital may not account for opportunity cost, i.e., comparison with other available investments. In financial theory, if there is a choice between two mutually exclusive alternatives, the one yielding the higher NPV should be selected. A positive net present value indicates that the projected earnings generated by a project or investment (in present dollars) exceeds the anticipated costs (also in present dollars). This concept is the basis for the Net Present Value Rule, which dictates that the only investments that should be made are those with positive NPVs.\nAn investment with a positive NPV is profitable, but one with a negative NPV will not necessarily result in a net loss: it is just that the internal rate of return of the project falls below the required rate of return.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of using Net Present Value.\nNPV is an indicator for project investments, and has several advantages and disadvantages for decision-making.\nAdvantages.\nThe NPV includes all relevant time and cash flows for the project by considering the time value of money, which is consistent with the goal of wealth maximization by creating the highest wealth for shareholders.\nThe NPV formula accounts for cash flow timing patterns and size differences for each project, and provides an easy, unambiguous dollar value comparison of different investment options.\nThe NPV can be easily calculated using modern spreadsheets, under the assumption that the discount rate and future cash flows are known. For a firm considering investing in multiple projects, the NPV has the benefit of being additive. That is, the NPVs of different projects may be aggregated to calculate the highest wealth creation, based on the available capital that can be invested by a firm.\nDisadvantages.\nThe NPV method has several disadvantages.\nThe NPV approach does not consider hidden costs and project size. Thus, investment decisions on projects with substantial hidden costs may not be accurate.\nRelies on input parameters such as knowledge of future cash flows.\nThe NPV is heavily dependent on knowledge of future cash flows, their timing, the length of a project, the initial investment required, and the discount rate. Hence, it can only be accurate if these input parameters are correct; although, sensitivity analyzes can be undertaken to examine how the NPV changes as the input variables are changed, thus reducing the uncertainty of the NPV.\nRelies on choice of discount rate and discount factor.\nThe accuracy of the NPV method relies heavily on the choice of a discount rate and hence discount factor, representing an investment's true risk premium. The discount rate is assumed to be constant over the life of an investment; however, discount rates can change over time. For example, discount rates can change as the cost of capital changes. There are other drawbacks to the NPV method, such as the fact that it displays a lack of consideration for a project\u2019s size and the cost of capital.\nLack of consideration of non-financial metrics.\nThe NPV calculation is purely financial and thus does not consider non-financial metrics that may be relevant to an investment decision.\nDifficulty in comparing mutually exclusive projects.\nComparing mutually exclusive projects with different investment horizons can be difficult. Since unequal projects are all assumed to have duplicate investment horizons, the NPV approach can be used to compare the optimal duration NPV.\nInterpretation as integral transform.\nThe time-discrete formula of the net present value\n formula_27\ncan also be written in a continuous variation\n formula_28\nwhere\nformula_29 is the rate of flowing cash given in money per time, and formula_29\u00a0=\u00a00 when the investment is over.\nNet present value can be regarded as Laplace- respectively Z-transformed cash flow with the integral operator including the complex number \"s\" which resembles to the interest rate \"i\" from the real number space or more precisely \"s\"\u00a0=\u00a0ln(1\u00a0+\u00a0\"i\").\n formula_31\nFrom this follow simplifications known from cybernetics, control theory and system dynamics. Imaginary parts of the complex number \"s\" describe the oscillating behaviour (compare with the pork cycle, cobweb theorem, and phase shift between commodity price and supply offer) whereas real parts are responsible for representing the effect of compound interest (compare with damping).\nExample.\nA corporation must decide whether to introduce a new product line. The company will have immediate costs of 100,000 at\u00a0\"t\" = 0. Recall, a cost is a negative for outgoing cash flow, thus this cash flow is represented as \u2212100,000. The company assumes the product will provide equal benefits of 10,000 for each of 12 years beginning at\u00a0\"t\" = 1. For simplicity, assume the company will have no outgoing cash flows after the initial 100,000 cost. This also makes the simplifying assumption that the net cash received or paid is lumped into a single transaction occurring \"on the last day\" of each year. At the end of the 12 years the product no longer provides any cash flow and is discontinued without any additional costs. Assume that the effective annual discount rate is 10%.\nThe present value (value at\u00a0\"t\" = 0) can be calculated for each year:\nThe total present value of the incoming cash flows is 68,136.91. The total present value of the outgoing cash flows is simply the 100,000 at time\u00a0\"t\" = 0.\nThus:\n formula_32\nIn this example:\n formula_33\nObserve that as \"t\" increases the present value of each cash flow at \"t\" decreases. For example, the final incoming cash flow has a future value of 10,000 at \"t\" = 12 but has a present value (at\u00a0\"t\" = 0) of 3,186.31. The opposite of discounting is compounding. Taking the example in reverse, it is the equivalent of investing 3,186.31 at \"t\" = 0 (the present value) at an interest rate of 10% compounded for 12 years, which results in a cash flow of 10,000 at \"t\" = 12 (the future value).\nThe importance of NPV becomes clear in this instance. Although the incoming cash flows (10,000 \u00d7 12 = 120,000) appear to exceed the outgoing cash flow (100,000), the future cash flows are not adjusted using the discount rate. Thus, the project appears misleadingly profitable. When the cash flows are discounted however, it indicates the project would result in a net loss of 31,863.09. Thus, the NPV calculation indicates that this project should be disregarded because investing in this project is the equivalent of a loss of 31,863.09 at\u00a0\"t\" = 0. The concept of time value of money indicates that cash flows in different periods of time cannot be accurately compared unless they have been adjusted to reflect their value at the same period of time (in this instance,\u00a0\"t\" = 0). It is the present value of each future cash flow that must be determined in order to provide any meaningful comparison between cash flows at different periods of time. There are a few inherent assumptions in this type of analysis:\nMore realistic problems would also need to consider other factors, generally including: smaller time buckets, the calculation of taxes (including the cash flow timing), inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, hedged or unhedged commodity costs, risks of technical obsolescence, potential future competitive factors, uneven or unpredictable cash flows, and a more realistic salvage value assumption, as well as many others.\nA more simple example of the net present value of incoming cash flow over a set period of time, would be winning a Powerball lottery of $. If one does not select the \"CASH\" option they will be paid $ per year for 20 years, a total of $, however, if one does select the \"CASH\" option, they will receive a one-time lump sum payment of approximately $, the NPV of $ paid over time. See \"other factors\" above that could affect the payment amount. Both scenarios are before taxes.\nSoftware support.\nMany computer-based spreadsheet programs have built-in formulae for PV and NPV.\nHistory.\nNet present value as a valuation methodology dates at least to the 19th century. Karl Marx refers to NPV as fictitious capital, and the calculation as \"capitalising,\" writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The forming of a fictitious capital is called capitalising. Every periodically repeated income is capitalised by calculating it on the average rate of interest, as an income which would be realised by a capital at this rate of interest.\nIn mainstream neo-classical economics, NPV was formalized and popularized by Irving Fisher, in his 1907 \"The Rate of Interest\" and became included in textbooks from the 1950s onwards, starting in finance texts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally designed for use on floppy and hard disks, it can also be found on read-only media such as CD-ROMs. HFS is also referred to as Mac OS Standard (or HFS Standard), while its successor, HFS Plus, is also called Mac OS Extended (or HFS Extended).\nWith the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6, Apple dropped support for formatting or writing HFS Standard disks and images, which remained supported as read-only volumes until macOS 10.15. Starting with macOS 10.15, HFS Standard disks can no longer be read.\nHistory.\nApple introduced HFS in September 1985, specifically to support Apple's first hard disk drive for the Macintosh, replacing the Macintosh File System (MFS), the original file system which had been introduced over a year and a half earlier with the first Macintosh computer. HFS drew heavily upon Apple's first operating system with a hierarchical file system, SOS for the failed Apple III, which also served as the basis for hierarchical file systems on the Apple IIe and Apple Lisa. HFS was developed by Patrick Dirks and Bill Bruffey. It shared a number of design features with MFS that were not available in other file systems of the time (such as DOS's FAT). Files could have multiple forks (normally a data and a resource fork), which allowed the main data of the file to be stored separately from resources such as icons that might need to be localized. Files were referenced with unique file IDs rather than file names, and file names could be up to 31 characters long.\nHowever, MFS had been optimized to be used on very small and slow media, namely floppy disks, so HFS was introduced to overcome some of the performance problems that arrived with the introduction of larger media, notably hard drives. The main concern was the time needed to display the contents of a folder. Under MFS all of the file and directory listing information was stored in a single file, which the system had to search to build a list of the files stored in a particular folder. This worked well with a system with a few hundred kilobytes of storage and perhaps a hundred files, but as the systems grew into megabytes and thousands of files, the performance degraded rapidly.\nThe solution was to replace MFS's directory structure with one more suitable to larger file systems. HFS replaced the flat table structure with the \"Catalog File\" which uses a B-tree structure that could be searched very quickly regardless of size. HFS also redesigned various structures to be able to hold larger numbers, 16-bit integers being replaced by 32-bit almost universally. Oddly, one of the few places this \"upsizing\" did not take place was the file directory itself, which limits HFS to a total of 65,535 files on each logical disk.\nWhile HFS is a proprietary file system format, it is well-documented; there are usually solutions available to access HFS-formatted disks from most modern operating systems.\nApple introduced HFS out of necessity with its first 20\u00a0MB hard disk offering for the Macintosh in September 1985, where it was loaded into RAM from a MFS floppy disk on boot using a patch file (\"Hard Disk 20\"). However, HFS was not widely introduced until it was included in the 128K ROM that debuted with the Macintosh Plus in January 1986 along with the larger 800\u00a0KB floppy disk drive for the Macintosh that also used HFS. The introduction of HFS was the first advancement by Apple to leave a Macintosh computer model behind: the original 128K Macintosh, which lacked sufficient memory to load the HFS code and was promptly discontinued.\nIn 1998, Apple introduced HFS Plus to address inefficient allocation of disk space in HFS and to add other improvements. HFS Plus is still supported by current versions of Mac OS, but starting with Mac OS X, an HFS Standard volume cannot be used for booting, and beginning with Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), HFS Standard volumes are read-only and cannot be created or updated. In macOS Sierra (10.12), Apple's release notes state that \"The HFS Standard filesystem is no longer supported.\" However, read-only HFS Standard support continued to work until the release of macOS 10.15, ending official support for classic HFS Standard after 35 years.\nDesign.\nA storage volume is inherently divided into \"logical blocks\" of 512 bytes. The Hierarchical File System groups these logical blocks into \"allocation blocks\", which can contain one or more logical blocks, depending on the total size of the volume. HFS uses a 16-bit value to address allocation blocks, limiting the number of allocation blocks to 65,535 (216-1).\nFive structures make up an HFS volume:\nLimitations.\nThe Catalog File, which stores all the file and directory records in a single data structure, results in performance problems when the system allows multitasking, as only one program can write to this structure at a time, meaning that many programs may be waiting in queue due to one program \"hogging\" the system. It is also a serious reliability concern, as damage to this file can destroy the entire file system. This contrasts with other file systems that store file and directory records in separate structures (such as DOS's FAT file system or the Unix File System), where having structure distributed across the disk means that damaging a single directory is generally non-fatal and the data may possibly be re-constructed with data held in the non-damaged portions.\nAdditionally, the limit of 65,535 allocation blocks resulted in files having a \"minimum\" size equivalent 1/65,535th the size of the disk. Thus, any given volume, no matter its size, could only store a maximum of 65,535 files. Moreover, any file would be allocated more space than it actually needed, up to the allocation block size. When disks were small, this was of little consequence, because the individual allocation block size was trivial, but as disks started to approach the 1 GB mark, the smallest amount of space that any file could occupy (a single allocation block) became excessively large, wasting significant amounts of disk space. For example, on a 1 GB disk, the allocation block size under HFS is 16 KB, so even a 1 byte file would take up 16 KB of disk space. This situation was less of a problem for users having large files (such as pictures, databases or audio) because these larger files wasted less space as a percentage of their file size. Users with many small files, on the other hand, could lose a copious amount of space due to large allocation block size. This made partitioning disks into smaller logical volumes very appealing for Mac users, because small documents stored on a smaller volume would take up much less space than if they resided on a large partition. The same problem existed in the FAT16 file system.\nHFS saves the case of a file that is created or renamed but is case-insensitive in operation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before the emergence of the Internet, such music was often \"piped\" to businesses and homes through telephone lines, private networks or targeted radio broadcasting (as in the BBC's \"Music While You Work\", where powerful speakers were set up in factories to make the broadcast audible).\nThere is no specific sound associated with elevator music, but it usually involves simple instrumental themes from \"soft\" popular music, or \"light\" classical music being performed by slow strings. This type of music was produced, for instance, by the Mantovani Orchestra, and conductors such as Franck Pourcel and James Last, peaking in popularity around the 1970s.\nOther uses.\nThe term can also be used for kinds of easy listening, lounge, piano solo, jazz, bossa nova or middle of the road music, or what are known as \"beautiful music\" radio stations.\nThis style of music is sometimes used to comedic effect in mass media such as film, where intense or dramatic scenes may be interrupted or interspersed with such anodyne music while characters use an elevator. Some video games have used music similarly: ' where a few elevator music-themed tracks are accessible on the in-game iPod, as well as \"System Shock\", ', \"GoldenEye 007\", \"Mass Effect\", and \"Earthworm Jim\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

RAM drives provide high-performance temporary storage for demanding tasks and protect non-volatile storage devices from wearing down, since RAM is not prone to wear from writing, unlike non-volatile flash memory as used in solid-state drives.\nIt is sometimes referred to as a virtual RAM drive or software RAM drive to distinguish it from a hardware RAM drive that uses separate hardware containing RAM, which is a type of battery-backed solid-state drive.\nRAM drives were originally conceived to bridge the performance gap between primary memory and secondary storage devices. With the advent of solid-state drives this advantage was reduced. However, solid-state drives suffer from wear from frequent writing. RAM does not suffer this damage or does so far less, so RAM devices still offer an advantage to store frequently changing data, like temporary or cached information.\nPerformance.\nThe performance of a RAM drive is generally orders of magnitude faster than other forms of digital storage, such as SSD, tape, optical, hard disk, and floppy drives. This performance gain is due to multiple factors, including access time, maximum throughput, and file system characteristics.\nFile access time is greatly reduced since a RAM drive is solid state (no moving parts). A physical hard drive, optical (e.g, CD-ROM, DVD, and Blu-ray) or other media (e.g. magnetic bubble, acoustic storage, magnetic tape) must move the information to a particular position before reading or writing can occur. RAM drives can access data with only the address, eliminating this latency.\nSecond, the maximum throughput of a RAM drive is limited by the speed of the RAM, the data bus, and the CPU of the computer. Other forms of storage media are further limited by the speed of the storage bus, such as IDE (PATA), SATA, USB or FireWire. Compounding this limitation is the speed of the actual mechanics of the drive motors, heads, or eyes.\nThird, the file system in use, such as NTFS, HFS+, UFS, ext2, etc., uses extra accesses, reads and writes to the drive, which although small, can add up quickly, especially in the event of many small files vs. few larger files (temporary internet folders, web caches, etc.).\nBecause the storage is in RAM, it is volatile memory, which means it will be lost in the event of power loss, whether intentional (computer reboot or shutdown) or accidental (power failure or system crash). This is, in general, a weakness (the data must periodically be backed up to a persistent-storage medium to avoid loss), but is sometimes desirable: for example, when working with a decrypted copy of an encrypted file, or using the RAM drive to store the system's temporary files.\nIn many cases, the data stored on the RAM drive is created from data permanently stored elsewhere, for faster access, and is re-created on the RAM drive when the system reboots.\nApart from the risk of data loss, the major limitation of RAM drives is capacity, which is constrained by the amount of installed RAM. Multi-terabyte SSD storage has become common, but RAM is still measured in gigabytes.\nRAM drives use normal system memory as if it were a partition on a physical hard drive rather than accessing the data bus normally used for secondary storage. Though RAM drives can often be supported directly in the operating system via special mechanisms in the OS kernel, it is generally simpler to access a RAM drive through a virtual device driver. This makes the non-disk nature of RAM drives invisible to both the OS and applications.\nUsually no battery backup is needed due to the temporary nature of the information stored in the RAM drive, but an uninterruptible power supply can keep the system running during a short power outage.\nSome RAM drives use a compressed file system such as cramfs to allow compressed data to be accessed on the fly, without decompressing it first. This is convenient because RAM drives are often small due to the higher price per byte than conventional hard drive storage.\nHistory and operating system specifics.\nThe first software RAM drive for microcomputers was invented and written by Jerry Karlin in the UK in 1979/80. The software, known as the Silicon Disk System, was further developed into a commercial product and marketed by JK Systems Research which became Microcosm Research Ltd when the company was joined by Peter Cheesewright of Microcosm Ltd. The idea was to enable the early microcomputers to use more RAM than the CPU could directly address. Making bank-switched RAM behave like a disk drive was much faster than the disk drives. especially before hard drives were readily available on such machines. The Silicon Disk was launched in 1980, initially for the CP/M operating system and later for MS-DOS.\nThe 128kB Atari 130XE (with DOS 2.5) and Commodore 128 natively support RAM drives, as does ProDOS for the Apple II. On systems with 128kB or more of RAM, ProDOS automatically creates a RAM drive named /RAM.\nIBM added a RAM drive named VDISK.SYS to PC DOS (version 3.0) in August 1984, which was the first DOS component to use extended memory. VDISK.SYS was not available in Microsoft's MS-DOS as it, unlike most components of early versions of PC DOS, was written by IBM. Microsoft included the similar program RAMDRIVE.SYS in MS-DOS 3.2 (released in 1986), which could also use expanded memory. It was discontinued in Windows 7. DR-DOS and the DR family of multi-user operating systems also came with a RAM disk named VDISK.SYS. In Multiuser DOS, the RAM disk defaults to the drive letter M: (for memory drive). AmigaOS has had a built in RAM drive since the release of version 1.1 in 1985 and still has it in AmigaOS 4.1 (2010). Apple Computer added the functionality to the Apple II series with ProDOS and, later, to Apple Macintosh with System 7's Memory control panel in 1991, and kept the feature through the life of Mac OS 9.\nA RAM drive innovation introduced in 1986 but made generally available in 1987 by Perry Kivolowitz for AmigaOS was the ability of the RAM drive to survive most crashes and reboots. Called the ASDG Recoverable Ram Disk, the device survived reboots by allocating memory dynamically in the reverse order of default memory allocation (a feature supported by the underlying OS) so as to reduce memory fragmentation. A \"super-block\" was written with a unique signature which could be located in memory upon reboot. The super-block, and all other RRD disk \"blocks\" maintained check sums to enable the invalidation of the disk if corruption was detected. At first, the ASDG RRD was locked to ASDG memory boards and used as a selling feature. Later, the ASDG RRD was made available as shareware carrying a suggested donation of 10 dollars. The shareware version appeared on Fred Fish Disks 58 and 241. AmigaOS itself would gain a Recoverable Ram Disk (called \"RAD\") in version 1.3.\nMany Unix and Unix-like systems provide some form of RAM drive functionality, such as /dev/ram on Linux, or md(4) on FreeBSD. RAM drives are particularly useful in high-performance, low-resource applications for which Unix-like operating systems are sometimes configured. There are also a few specialized \"ultra-lightweight\" Linux distributions which are designed to boot from removable media and stored in a ramdisk for the entire session.\nDedicated hardware RAM drives.\nThere have been RAM drives which use DRAM memory that is exclusively dedicated to function as an extremely low latency storage device. This memory is isolated from the processor and not directly accessible in the same manner as normal system memory. Some of the first dedicated RAM drives were released in 1983-1985.\nAn early example of a hardware RAM drive was introduced by Assimilation Process in 1986 for the Macintosh. Called the \"Excalibur\", it was an external 2MB RAM drive, and retailed for between $599 and $699 US. With the RAM capacity expandable in 1MB increments, its internal battery was said to be effective for between 6 and 8 hours, and, unusual for the time, it was connected via the Macintosh floppy disk port.\nIn 2002, Cenatek produced the \"Rocket Drive\", max 4 GB, which had four DIMM slots for PC133 memory, with up to a maximum of four gigabytes of storage. At the time, common desktop computers used 64 to 128 megabytes of PC100 or PC133 memory. The one gigabyte PC133 modules (the largest available at the time) cost approximately $1,300 (). A fully outfitted Rocket Drive with four GB of storage would have cost $5,600 ().\nIn 2005, Gigabyte Technology produced the i-RAM, max 4 GB, which functioned essentially identically to the Rocket Drive, except upgraded to use the newer DDR memory technology, though also limited to a maximum of 4 GB capacity.\nFor both of these devices, the dynamic RAM requires continuous power to retain data; when power is lost, the data fades away. For the Rocket Drive, there was a connector for an external power supply separate from the computer, and the option for an external battery to retain data during a power failure. The i-RAM included a small battery directly on the expansion board, for 10-16 hours of protection.\nBoth devices used the SATA 1.0 interface to transfer data from the dedicated RAM drive to the system. The SATA interface was a slow bottleneck that limited the maximum performance of both RAM drives, but these drives still provided exceptionally low data access latency and high sustained transfer speeds, compared to mechanical hard drives.\nIn 2006, Gigabyte Technology produced the GC-RAMDISK, max 8GB, which was the second generation creation for the i-RAM. It has a maximum of 8 GB capacity, twice that of the i-RAM. It used the SATA-II port, again twice that of the i-RAM. One of its best selling points is that it can be used as a boot device.\nIn 2007, ACard Technology produced the ANS-9010 Serial ATA RAM disk, max 64 GB. Quote from the tech report: The ANS-9010 \"which has eight DDR2 DIMM slots and support for up to 8 GB of memory per slot. The ANS-9010 also features a pair of Serial ATA ports, allowing it to function as a single drive or masquerade as a pair of drives that can easily be split into an even faster RAID 0 array.\"\nIn 2009, Acard Technology produced the ACARD ANS-9010BA 5.25\" Dynamic SSD SATA-II RAM Disk, max 64GB. It uses a single SATA-II port.\nBoth variants are equipped with one or more CompactFlash card interface located in the front panel, allowing non-volatile data being stored on the RAM drive to be copied on the CompactFlash card in case of power failure and low backup battery. Two pushbuttons located on the front panel allows the user to manually backup / restore data on the RAM drive. The CompactFlash card itself is not accessible to the user by normal means as the CF card is solely intended for RAM backup and restoration. The CF card's capacity has to meet / exceed the RAM module's total capacity in order to effectively work as a reliable backup.\nIn 2009, DDRdrive, LLC produced the DDRDrive X1, which claims to be the fastest solid state drive in the world. The drive is a primary 4GB DDR dedicated RAM drive for regular use, which can back up to and recall from a 4GB SLC NAND drive. The intended market is for keeping and recording log files. If there is a power loss the data can be saved to an internal 4GB ssd in 60 seconds, via the use of a battery backup. Thereafter the data can be recovered back in to RAM once power is restored. A host power loss triggers the DDRdrive X1 to back up volatile data to on-board non-volatile storage.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As an eclectic martial art, it relies on a fighting style heavily influenced by Wing Chun, Tai Chi, taekwondo, boxing, fencing and jujutsu. Jeet Kune Do, which Lee intended to have practical applications in life without the traditional routines and metaphysics of conventional martial arts, also incorporates a set of principles to help practitioners make quick decisions and improve their mental and physical health.\nLee, who based Jeet Kune Do upon his experiences in unarmed fighting and self defense, as well as upon his eclectic, Zen Buddhist, Confucianist and Taoist philosophies, did not formally codify JKD before his death. As a result, later JKD practitioners had to rely on their own interpretations of Lee's philosophy.\nAs a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines, Jeet Kune Do is often deemed a predecessor of mixed martial arts (MMA).\nOverview and philosophy.\nGrowing up in Hong Kong, Lee was a student of Wing Chun Grandmaster Ip Man. Around 1964, following his duel with Wong Jack-man, Lee disavowed the rigidity of systematized martial arts. Lee then began a journey of research in order to refine his way of practicing martial arts. In 1965, he outlined the basic concepts of Jeet Kune Do in a press interview, but Lee resisted giving his school of thought a name. It was not until 1967 that he came up with the name Jeet Kune Do, but Lee's philosophy is still known by other names, such as Jun Fan Gung Fu. As Lee explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have not invented a \"new style,\" composite, modified or otherwise that is set within distinct form as apart from \"this\" method or \"that\" method. On the contrary, I hope to free my followers from clinging to styles, patterns, or molds. Remember that Jeet Kune Do is merely a name used, a mirror in which to see \"ourselves\". . . Jeet Kune Do is not an organized institution that one can be a member of. Either you understand or you don't, and that is that. There is no mystery about my style. My movements are simple, direct, and non-classical. The extraordinary part of it lies in its simplicity. Every movement in Jeet Kune Do is being so of itself. There is nothing artificial about it. I always believe that the easy way is the right way. Jeet Kune Do is simply the direct expression of one's feelings with the minimum of movements and energy. The closer to the true way of Kung Fu, the less wastage of expression there is. Finally, a Jeet Kune Do man who says Jeet Kune Do is exclusively Jeet Kune Do is simply not with it. He is still hung up on his self-closing resistance, in this case, anchored down to a reactionary pattern, and naturally is still bound by another modified pattern and can move within its limits. He has not digested the simple fact that truth exists outside all molds; pattern and awareness is never exclusive.\nAgain let me remind you Jeet Kune Do is just a name used, a boat to get one across, and once across it is to be discarded and not to be carried on one's back.\nThe metaphor Bruce Lee borrowed from Chan Buddhism was of constantly filling a cup with water, and then emptying it, used for describing Lee's philosophy of \"casting off what is useless\". Lee considered traditional form-based martial arts, which practiced pre-arranged patterns, forms and techniques, to be restrictive and ineffective in dealing with chaotic self-defence situations. Bruce Lee believed that real combat was alive and dynamic, and conceived Jeet Kune Do to enable its practitioners to adapt to the changes of live combat, believing that it was only through its use in real combat that a martial arts practitioner could judge a technique worthy of adoption.\nPrinciples.\nBruce Lee incorporated into Jeet Kune Do four universal combat truths that he felt were self-evident and would lead to combat success if followed. The \"4 Combat Ranges\" in particular are what he felt were instrumental in becoming a \"total\" martial artist. This is also the principle most related to mixed martial arts. These concepts help create a framework for adaptive, real-time decision-making in self-defence scenarios.\nJKD practitioners also subscribe to the notion that the best defence is a strong offense, hence the principle of \"Intercepting\". Lee believed that in order for an opponent to attack someone they had to move towards them. This provided an opportunity to \"intercept\" that attack or movement. The principle of interception covers more than just intercepting physical attacks. Lee believed that many non-verbal telegraphs (subtle movements that an opponent is unaware of) could be perceived or \"intercepted\" and thus be used to one's advantage. The \"5 Ways of Attack\" are attacking categories that help Jeet Kune Do practitioners organize their fighting repertoire and comprise the offensive portion of JKD. The concepts of stop hits &amp; stop kicks and simultaneous parrying &amp; punching were borrowed from European fencing and Wing Chun's theory of simultaneous defending and attacking. They comprise the defensive portion of JKD. These concepts were modified for unarmed combat and implemented into the JKD framework by Lee. These concepts also complement the principle of interception.\nBe like water.\nBruce Lee believed that martial systems should be as flexible as possible. He often used water as an analogy for describing why flexibility is a desired trait in martial arts. Water is infinitely flexible. It can be seen through, and yet at other times it can obscure things from sight. It can split and go around things, re-joining on the other side, or it can crash through things. It can erode the hardest rocks by gently lapping away at them or it can flow past the tiniest pebble. Lee believed that a martial system should have these attributes. JKD students reject traditional systems of training, fighting styles and the Confucian pedagogy used in traditional Kung Fu schools because of this lack of flexibility. JKD is claimed to be a dynamic concept that is forever changing, thus being extremely flexible. \"Absorb what is useful; disregard that which is useless\" is an often quoted Bruce Lee maxim. A JKD student is encouraged to study every form of combat possible, both to add to his arsenal and to know how to defend against such tactics.\nEconomy of motion.\nJKD students are told to waste no time or movement. This technique can be called the technique of \"least action\" - strike the opponent with the least distance, time and energy possible but also giving a powerful and precise strike. When it comes to combat JKD practitioners believe the simplest things work best. \"Efficiency, directness, and simplicity are the hallmark of Jeet Kune Do,\" according to Bruce Lee.\nStop hits and stop kicks.\nAdherents of JKD are taught to intercept an opponent's attack with an attack of their own, rather than simply blocking the attack. JKD practitioners consider this to be the most difficult defensive skill to develop. This strategy is a feature of some traditional Chinese martial arts, as well as an essential component of European \u00e9p\u00e9e fencing (known in fencing terminology as the \"counter-attack\").\nSimultaneous parrying and punching.\nWhen confronting an incoming attack, the attack is parried or deflected and a counterattack is delivered at the same time. This is not as advanced as a stop hit but is more effective than blocking and then counterattacking in sequence. This is also practiced by some Chinese martial arts.\nNo high kicks.\nJKD practitioners believe they should target their kicks to their opponent's shins, knees, thighs, midsection, and no higher, as these targets are the closest to the (kicking) foot, provide more stability, and are more difficult to defend against. However, as with all other JKD principles, nothing is written in stone, and if a target of opportunity above the midsection presents itself, one may take advantage of it without feeling hampered by this principle.\nThe four ranges of combat.\nJeet Kune Do students train in each of four \"ranges\" equally: Kicking, Punching, Trapping, and Grappling. According to Lee, this range of training differentiates JKD from other martial arts, as most traditional martial systems specialize in training at one or two ranges. Lee's theories have been especially influential in the field of Mixed Martial Arts, as the MMA Phases of Combat are essentially the same concept as the JKD combat ranges. The ranges in JKD have evolved over time. Initially the ranges were categorized as short or close, medium, and long range. These terms proved ambiguous and eventually evolved into their more descriptive forms although there may still be some practitioners who prefer the three categories.\nThree parts of JKD.\nJKD practitioners believe that techniques should contain the following properties:\nCentreline.\nThe centreline refers to an imaginary line running down the centre of one's body. The theory is to exploit, control and dominate one's opponent's centreline. All attacks, defences and footwork are designed to preserve one's own centreline and open one's opponent's. Lee incorporated this theory into JKD from Wing Chun. This notion is closely related to maintaining control of the centre squares in the strategic game chess.\nThe three guidelines for centreline are:\nBranches.\nAlthough Bruce Lee officially closed his martial arts schools two years before his death, he allowed his curriculum to be taught privately. Since his death, Jeet Kune Do is argued to have split into different groups. They are:\nTo understand the branches of JKD it is important to understand the difference between the two \"types\" or viewpoints of Jeet Kune Do:\nLee believed that this freedom of adoption was a distinguishing property from traditional martial arts.\nThere are many who confuse the JKD Framework with a JKD Personal System (e.g., Bruce Lee's personal JKD) thinking them to be one and the same. The system that Bruce Lee personally expressed was his own personal JKD; tailored for himself. Before he could do this, however, he needed to first develop the \"JKD Framework\" process. Many of the systems that Bruce Lee studied were not to develop his \"Personal JKD\" but rather was used to gather the \"principles\" for incorporation in the JKD Framework approach. The uniqueness of JKD to Lee is that it was a \"process\" not a \"product\" and thus not a \"style\" but a system, concept, or approach. Traditional martial arts styles are essentially a product that is given to a student with little provision for change. These traditional styles are usually fixed and not tailored for individuals. Bruce Lee claimed there were inherent problems with this approach and established a \"Process\" based system rather than a fixed style which a student could then utilize to make a \"tailored\" or \"Personal\" product of their own.\nThe two branches of JKD differ in what should be incorporated or offered within the \"JKD Framework\". The Original (or Jun Fan) JKD branch believes that the original principles before Bruce Lee died are all that is needed for the construction of personalized systems. The JKD Concepts branch believes that there are further principles that can be added to construct personalized systems. The value of each branch can be determined by individual practitioners based on whatever merits they deem important.\nOriginal JKD is further divided into two points of view - OJKD and JFJKD both hold Wing Chun, Western boxing and fencing as the cornerstones on Bruce's JKD.\nConditioning.\nSome of the exercises Lee did included \"Da Sam Sing\" or \"Gak Sam Sing, a\" traditional method of forearm conditioning practiced in classical Kung Fu. He also did exercises simulating a fight against a four-limbed human using the traditional \"Mook Yan Jong\" used in Wing Chun. Lee was also an avid follower of Indian wrestler The Great Gama's training routine. He read articles about him and how he employed his exercises to build his strength for wrestling, incorporating them into his own routine. The training routines Lee used included isometrics as well as \"the cat stretch\", \"the squat\" (known as \"baithak\"), and also known as the \"deep-knee bend.\"\nInfluence and references in popular culture.\nKato from \"Green Hornet\" is the first fictional character to use Jeet Kune Do, as he was portrayed by Bruce Lee in the 1966 TV series. In the aforementioned TV series, Lee would demonstrate various techniques associated with Jeet Kune Do. Following Lee's death, Kato would utilize JKD in subsequent incarnations of Green Hornet media.\nIn Arrow, Jeet Kune Do is the martial arts style of the League of Assassins.\nFighting games.\nVarious video game characters utilize Jeet Kune Do as their choice way of fighting. These include:\nNotable practitioners.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The final printed issue was #359 in September 2007. Shortly after the last print issue shipped in mid-August 2007, Wizards of the Coast (part of Hasbro, Inc.), the publication's current copyright holder, relaunched \"Dragon\" as an online magazine, continuing on the numbering of the print edition. The last published issue was No. 430 in December 2013. A digital publication called \"Dragon+\", which replaced \"Dragon\" magazine, was launched in 2015. It was created by the advertising agency Dialect in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, and its numbering system for issues started at No. 1.\nHistory.\nTSR.\nIn 1975, TSR, Inc. began publishing \"The Strategic Review\". At the time, roleplaying games were still seen as a subgenre of the wargaming industry, and the magazine was designed not only to support \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and TSR's other games, but also to cover wargaming in general. In short order, however, the popularity and growth of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" made it clear that the game had not only separated itself from its wargaming origins, but had launched an entirely new industry unto itself.\nTSR canceled \"The Strategic Review\" the following year after only seven issues, and replaced it with two magazines, \"Little Wars\", which covered miniature wargaming, and \"The Dragon\", which covered role playing games. After twelve issues, \"Little Wars\" ceased independent publication and issue 13 was published as part of \"Dragon\" issue 22.\nThe magazine debuted as \"The Dragon\" in June 1976. TSR co-founder Gary Gygax commented years later: \"When I decided that \"The Strategic Review\" was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce \"The Dragon\", I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide... At no time did I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan.\"\n\"Dragon\" is the launching point for a number of rules, spells, monsters, magic items, and other ideas that were incorporated into later official products of the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game. A prime example is the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, which first became known through a series of \"Dragon\" articles in the 1980s by its creator Ed Greenwood. It subsequently went on to become one of the primary campaign \"worlds\" for official \"Dungeons and Dragons\" products, starting in 1987. The magazine appeared on the cover as simply \"Dragon\" from July 1980, later changing its name to \"Dragon Magazine\" starting November 1987.\nWizards of the Coast.\nWizards of the Coast purchased TSR and its intellectual properties, including \"Dragon Magazine\", in 1997. Production was then transferred from Wisconsin to Washington state. In 1999, Wizards of the Coast was itself purchased by Hasbro, Inc. \"Dragon Magazine\" suffered a five-month gap between #236 and #237 but remained published by TSR as a subsidiary of WotC starting September 1997, and until January 2000 when WotC became the listed de facto publisher. They removed the word \"magazine\" from the cover title starting with the June 2000 issue, changing the publication's name back to simply \"Dragon\".\nIn 1999 a CD-ROM compilation of the first 250 issues, called \"Dragon Magazine Archive\", was released in PDF format with a special viewer. It includes the seven issues of \"The Strategic Review\". The \"Dragon Magazine Archive\" is out of print because of issues raised with the 2001 ruling in \"Greenberg v. National Geographic\" regarding the reprint rights of various comic strips that had been printed in \"Dragon\" over the years and Paizo Publishing's policy that creators of comics retain their copyright. These comic strips include \"Wormy\", \"What's New with Phil &amp; Dixie\", \"Snarf Quest\", and \"Knights of the Dinner Table\" which is covered in TSR's own statement in the first issue that \"All material published herein becomes the exclusive property of the publisher unless special arrangements to the contrary are made.\"\nPaizo.\nIn 2002, Paizo Publishing acquired the rights to publish both \"Dragon\" and \"Dungeon\" under license from Wizards of the Coast. \"Dragon\" was published by Paizo starting September 2002. It ties \"Dragon\" more closely to \"Dungeon\" by including articles supporting and promoting its major multi-issue adventures such as the \"Age of Worms\" and \"Savage Tide\". \"Class Acts\", a monthly publication with one- or two-page articles offering ideas for developing specific character classes, were also introduced by Paizo.\nReturn to Wizards of the Coast.\nOn April 18, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced that it would not be renewing Paizo's licenses for \"Dragon\" and \"Dungeon,\" instead opting for online publishing. Paizo published the last print editions of \"Dragon\" and \"Dungeon\" magazines for September 2007.\nIn August 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the fourth edition of the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game and that \"D&amp;D Insider\" subscriber content would include the new, online versions of both \"Dungeon\" and \"Dragon\" magazines along with tools for building campaigns, managing character sheets, and other features. In its online form, \"Dragon\" continues to publish articles aimed at \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" players, with rules data from these articles feeding the D&amp;D Character Builder and other online tools.\nCessation.\nIn the September 2013 issue of \"Dragon\" (#427) an article by Wizards of the Coast game designer and editor Chris Perkins announced that both \"Dragon\" and its sibling publication \"Dungeon\" would be going on hiatus starting January 2014 pending the release of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 5th edition. The final online version released is Issue #430 in December 2013.\nDragon+.\nA new and fully digital bi-monthly publication called \"Dragon+\", was launched on April 30, 2015, succeeding the existing versions of \"Dragon\" and \"Dungeon\" magazines. Created by Dialect in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, the online edition ceased continuity with the printed and digital versions of both magazines, and restarted its numbering system for issues at No. 1.\nThe magazine branded itself as an app with content \"showcasing what\u2019s new in Dungeons &amp; Dragons \u2013 from backstory and world information to discussions about what's coming next from the creators and developers of your favorite D&amp;D products\". Articles included cover content such as: game strategies and insights; details of the current D&amp;D storyline; interviews; ongoing comic series; lore; Forgotten Realms world information; community updates and fan submissions; and videos. Additional content in the magazine is also accessible through links to the magazine's content in Facebook and Twitter feeds.\n\"Dragon+\" ran for 41 issues in total with the last issue published in April 2022; Wizards of the Coast published an update in July 2022 announcing the cancellation of the publication. On November 15, 2022, Wizards of the Coast announced that \"\"Dragon+\" will be removed from app stores on or around November 15th, and dragonmag.com will be redirected and its content will no longer be available\".\nContent.\nMany of the gaming world's most famous writers, game designers and artists have published work in the magazine. Through most of its run the magazine frequently published fantasy fiction, either short stories or novel excerpts. After the 1990s, the appearance of fiction stories became relatively rare. One late example was issue #305's featured excerpt from George R.R. Martin's later Hugo-nominated novel \"A Feast for Crows\". It also featured book reviews of fantasy and science fiction novels, and occasionally of films of particular interest (such as the TV movie of \"Mazes and Monsters\").\nFrom the magazine's beginning until issue 274, from August 2000, \"Dragon\" published articles for various versions of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and, at various times, other gaming systems. With issue 274, \"Dragon\" published exclusively 3rd Edition \"D&amp;D\" content, or content for other games published by Wizards Of The Coast's d20 System games. With the release of the 3.5 Edition update in July 2003, issue 309 onward published only Edition 3.5 content and carried a \"100% Official \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\"\" masthead. The magazine switched to exclusively 4th Edition \"D&amp;D\" content from issue 364 on the release of 4th Edition in June 2008.\nArticles.\nMost of the magazine's articles provide supplementary material for \"D&amp;D\" including new prestige classes, races, and monsters. A long-running column \"Sage Advice\" offers official answers to \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" questions submitted by players. Other articles provide tips and suggestions for players and Dungeon Masters (DMs). It sometimes discusses meta-gaming issues, such as getting along with fellow players. At the end of its print run, the magazine also features four comics; \"Nodwick\", \"Dork Tower\", \"Zogonia\", and a specialized version of the webcomic \"The Order of the Stick\". Previous gamer-oriented comic strips include \"Knights of the Dinner Table\", \"Finieous Fingers\", \"What's New with Phil &amp; Dixie\", \"Wormy\", \"Yamara\", and \"SnarfQuest\".\n\"Dragon\"'s \"Ecology of ...\" articles were initially written in the voice of the fictional sage Elminster, who reviewed a D&amp;D monster in-depth. Under Paizo's tenure such ecology articles became heavier in game mechanics than narrative and description. The \"Dragon\" submissions guidelines explicitly state that Ecology articles \"should have a hunter\u2019s guidebook approach, although it should not be written 'in voice'\" and further specify the exact format of Ecology articles, leaving less room for artistic license by the author.\nIn the early 1980s, almost every issue contains a role playing adventure, a simple board game, or some kind of special game supplement (such as a cardboard cut-out castle). For instance, Tom Wham's \"Snit's Revenge\", \"The Awful Green Things from Outer Space\" and \"File 13\" all started as supplements within \"The Dragon\". These bonus features are infrequent after the 1986 launch of \"Dungeon\" magazine, which published several new \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" adventures in each issue.\nDuring the 1980s, after TSR had purchased Simulations Publications Inc., the magazine had a subsection called \"Ares Magazine\", based on SPI's magazine of that name, specializing in science fiction and superhero role playing games, with pages marked by a gray border. The content included write-ups for various characters of the Marvel Universe for TSR's \"Marvel Super-Heroes\".\nSpecial issues.\nAs noted above \"The Dragon\" was preceded by seven issues of \"The Strategic Review\". In the magazine's early years it also published five \"Best of\" issues, reprinting highly regarded articles from \"The Strategic Review\" and \"The Dragon\". From 1996 to 2001, \"Dragon Magazine\" published the \"Dragon Annual\", a thirteenth issue of all new content.\nEditors.\nPrint versions:\nDigital (online/PDF) versions:\nOther releases.\nA collection of \"Dragon\" was released as the \"Dragon Magazine Archive\" in 1999. It was released as a CD-ROM with a Windows application and PDF files. The \"Dragon Magazine Archive\" was directed by Rob Voce, and published by TSR/Wizards of the Coast. \"Pyramid\" reviewed it, saying that the archive was \"worth the price\", but that its application's Windows-only format limits other platforms from being able to read the PDFs manually. It was reviewed in \"Backstab\" #19.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

SIMD describes computers with multiple processing elements that perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously. SIMD can be internal (part of the hardware design) and it can be directly accessible through an instruction set architecture (ISA), but it should not be confused with an ISA.\nSuch machines exploit data level parallelism, but not concurrency: there are simultaneous (parallel) computations, but each unit performs exactly the same instruction at any given moment (just with different data). A simple example is to add many pairs of numbers together, all of the SIMD units are performing an addition, but each one has different pairs of values to add. SIMD is especially applicable to common tasks such as adjusting the contrast in a digital image or adjusting the volume of digital audio. Most modern central processing unit (CPU) designs include SIMD instructions to improve the performance of multimedia use. In recent CPUs, SIMD units are tightly coupled with cache hierarchies and prefetch mechanisms, which minimize latency during large block operations. For instance, AVX-512-enabled processors can prefetch entire cache lines and apply fused multiply-add operations (FMA) in a single SIMD cycle.\nConfusion between SIMT and SIMD.\nSIMD has three different subcategories in Flynn's 1972 Taxonomy, one of which is single instruction, multiple threads (SIMT). SIMT should not be confused with software threads or hardware threads, both of which are task time-sharing (time-slicing). SIMT is true simultaneous parallel hardware-level execution, such as in the ILLIAC IV.\nSIMD should not be confused with Vector processing, characterized by the Cray 1 and clarified in Duncan's taxonomy. The\ndifference between SIMD and vector processors is primarily the presence of a Cray-style instruction.\nHistory.\nThe first known operational use to date of SIMD within a register was the TX-2, in 1958. It was capable of 36-bit operations and two 18-bit or four 9-bit sub-word operations.\nThe first commercial use of SIMD instructions was in the ILLIAC IV, which was completed in 1972.\nVector supercomputers of the early 1970s such as the CDC Star-100 and the Texas Instruments ASC could operate on a \"vector\" of data with a single instruction. Vector processing was especially popularized by Cray in the 1970s and 1980s. Vector processing architectures are now considered separate from SIMD computers: Duncan's Taxonomy includes them whereas Flynn's Taxonomy does not, due to Flynn's work (1966, 1972) pre-dating the Cray-1 (1977). The complexity of Vector processors however inspired a simpler arrangement known as SIMD within a register.\nThe first era of modern SIMD computers was characterized by massively parallel processing-style supercomputers such as the Thinking Machines Connection Machine CM-1 and CM-2. These computers had many limited-functionality processors that would work in parallel. For example, each of 65,536 single-bit processors in a Thinking Machines CM-2 would execute the same instruction at the same time, allowing, for instance, to logically combine 65,536 pairs of bits at a time, using a hypercube-connected network or processor-dedicated RAM to find its operands. Supercomputing moved away from the SIMD approach when inexpensive scalar multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) approaches based on commodity processors such as the Intel i860 XP became more powerful, and interest in SIMD waned.\nThe current era of SIMD processors grew out of the desktop-computer market rather than the supercomputer market. As desktop processors became powerful enough to support real-time gaming and audio/video processing during the 1990s, demand grew for this type of computing power, and microprocessor vendors turned to SIMD to meet the demand. This resurgence also coincided with the rise of DirectX and OpenGL shader models, which heavily leveraged SIMD under the hood. The graphics APIs encouraged programmers to adopt data-parallel programming styles, indirectly accelerating SIMD adoption in desktop software. Hewlett-Packard introduced Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions (MAX) instructions into PA-RISC 1.1 desktops in 1994 to accelerate MPEG decoding. Sun Microsystems introduced SIMD integer instructions in its \"VIS\" instruction set extensions in 1995, in its UltraSPARC I microprocessor. MIPS followed suit with their similar MDMX system.\nThe first widely deployed desktop SIMD was with Intel's MMX extensions to the x86 architecture in 1996. This sparked the introduction of the much more powerful AltiVec system in the Motorola PowerPC and IBM's POWER systems. Intel responded in 1999 by introducing the all-new SSE system. Since then, there have been several extensions to the SIMD instruction sets for both architectures. Advanced vector extensions AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 are developed by Intel. AMD supports AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 in their current products.\nDisadvantages.\nWith SIMD, an order of magnitude increase in code size is not uncommon, when compared to equivalent scalar or equivalent vector code, and an order of magnitude \"or greater\" effectiveness (work done per instruction) is achievable with Vector ISAs.\nARM's Scalable Vector Extension takes another approach, known in Flynn's Taxonomy more commonly known today as \"Predicated\" (masked) SIMD. This approach is not as compact as vector processing but is still far better than non-predicated SIMD. Detailed comparative examples are given at . In addition, all versions of the ARM architecture have offered Load and Store multiple instructions, to Load or Store a block of data from a continuous block of memory, into a range or non-continuous set of registers.\nHardware.\nCPUs.\nSmall-scale (64 or 128 bits) SIMD became popular on general-purpose CPUs in the early 1990s and continued through 1997 and later with Motion Video Instructions (MVI) for Alpha. SIMD instructions can be found, to one degree or another, on most CPUs, including IBM's AltiVec and Signal Processing Engine (SPE) for PowerPC, Hewlett-Packard's (HP) PA-RISC Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions (MAX), Intel's MMX and iwMMXt, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), SSE2, SSE3 SSSE3 and SSE4.x, AMD's 3DNow!, ARC's ARC Video subsystem, SPARC's VIS and VIS2, Sun's MAJC, ARM's Neon technology, MIPS' MDMX (MaDMaX) and MIPS-3D.\nIntel's AVX-512 SIMD instructions process 512 bits of data at once.\nCoprocessors.\nThe IBM, Sony, Toshiba co-developed Cell processor's Synergistic Processing Element's (SPE's) instruction set is heavily SIMD based.\nSome, but not all, GPUs are SIMD-based. AMD GPUs since the TeraScale (microarchitecture) are SIMD-based, a feature that has remained in the 2020s microartectures RDNA and CDNA, with a layer of single instruction, multiple threads (SIMT) above. On the other hand, Nvidia's CUDA architectures use scalar cores with SIMT.\nPhilips, now NXP, developed several SIMD processors named Xetal. The Xetal has 320 16-bit processor elements especially designed for vision tasks.\nApple's M1 and M2 chips also incorporate SIMD units deeply integrated with their GPU and Neural Engine, using Apple-designed SIMD pipelines optimized for image filtering, convolution, and matrix multiplication. This unified memory architecture helps SIMD instructions operate on shared memory pools more efficiently. (The CPU part implements ordinary NEON).\nSoftware.\nSIMD instructions are widely used to process 3D graphics, although modern graphics cards with embedded SIMD have largely taken over this task from the CPU. Some systems also include permute functions that re-pack elements inside vectors, making them especially useful for data processing and compression. They are also used in cryptography. The trend of general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU) may lead to wider use of SIMD in the future. Recent compilers such as LLVM, GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), and Intel's ICC offer aggressive auto-vectoring options. Developers can often enable these with flags like codice_1 or codice_2, which guide the compiler to restructure loops for SIMD compatibility.\nAdoption of SIMD systems in personal computer software was at first slow, due to a number of problems. One was that many of the early SIMD instruction sets tended to slow overall performance of the system due to the re-use of existing floating point registers. Other systems, like MMX and 3DNow!, offered support for data types that were not interesting to a wide audience and had expensive context switching instructions to switch between using the FPU and MMX registers. Compilers also often lacked support, requiring programmers to resort to assembly language coding.\nSIMD on x86 had a slow start. The introduction of 3DNow! by AMD and SSE by Intel confused matters somewhat, but today the system seems to have settled down (after AMD adopted SSE) and newer compilers should result in more SIMD-enabled software. Intel and AMD now both provide optimized math libraries that use SIMD instructions, and open source alternatives like libSIMD, SIMDx86 and SLEEF have started to appear (see also libm).\nApple Computer had somewhat more success, even though they entered the SIMD market later than the rest. AltiVec offered a rich system and can be programmed using increasingly sophisticated compilers from Motorola, IBM and GNU, therefore assembly language programming is rarely needed. Additionally, many of the systems that would benefit from SIMD were supplied by Apple itself, for example iTunes and QuickTime. However, in 2006, Apple computers moved to Intel x86 processors. Apple's APIs and development tools (XCode) were modified to support SSE2 and SSE3 as well as AltiVec. Apple was the dominant purchaser of PowerPC chips from IBM and Freescale Semiconductor. Even though Apple has stopped using PowerPC processors in their products, further development of AltiVec is continued in several PowerPC and Power ISA designs from Freescale and IBM.\n\"SIMD within a register\", or SWAR, is a range of techniques and tricks used for performing SIMD in general-purpose registers on hardware that does not provide any direct support for SIMD instructions. This can be used to exploit parallelism in certain algorithms even on hardware that does not support SIMD directly.\nProgrammer interface.\nIt is common for publishers of the SIMD instruction sets to make their own C and C++ language extensions with intrinsic functions or special datatypes (with operator overloading) guaranteeing the generation of vector code. Intel, AltiVec, and ARM NEON provide extensions widely adopted by the compilers targeting their CPUs. (More complex operations are the task of vector math libraries.)\nThe GNU C Compiler takes the extensions a step further by abstracting them into a universal interface that can be used on any platform by providing a way of defining SIMD datatypes. The LLVM Clang compiler also implements the feature, with an analogous interface defined in the IR. Rust's crate (and the experimental ) uses this interface, and so does Swift 2.0+.\nC++ has an experimental interface that works similarly to the GCC extension. LLVM's libcxx seems to implement it. For GCC and libstdc++, a wrapper library that builds on top of the GCC extension is available.\nMicrosoft added SIMD to .NET in RyuJIT. The package, available on NuGet, implements SIMD datatypes. Java also has a new proposed API for SIMD instructions available in OpenJDK 17 in an incubator module. It also has a safe fallback mechanism on unsupported CPUs to simple loops.\nInstead of providing an SIMD datatype, compilers can also be hinted to auto-vectorize some loops, potentially taking some assertions about the lack of data dependency. This is not as flexible as manipulating SIMD variables directly, but is easier to use. OpenMP 4.0+ has a hint. This OpenMP interface has replaced a wide set of nonstandard extensions, including Cilk's , GCC's , and many more.\nAn example of the use of platform-specific, generic vector-based, and generic hint-based interfaces is \"SIMD everywhere\", a collection of C/C++ headers implementing of platform-specific intrinsics for other platforms (e.g. SSE intrinsics for ARM NEON).\nSIMD multi-versioning.\nConsumer software is typically expected to work on a range of CPUs covering multiple generations, which could limit the programmer's ability to use new SIMD instructions to improve the computational performance of a program. The solution is to include multiple versions of the same code that uses either older or newer SIMD technologies, and pick one that best fits the user's CPU at run-time (dynamic dispatch). There are two main camps of solutions:\nFMV, manually coded in assembly language, is quite commonly used in a number of performance-critical libraries such as glibc and libjpeg-turbo. Intel C++ Compiler, GNU Compiler Collection since GCC 6, and Clang since clang 7 allow for a simplified approach, with the compiler taking care of function duplication and selection. GCC and clang requires explicit labels in the code to \"clone\" functions, while ICC does so automatically (under the command-line option ). The Rust programming language also supports FMV. The setup is similar to GCC and Clang in that the code defines what instruction sets to compile for, but cloning is manually done via inlining.\nAs using FMV requires code modification on GCC and Clang, vendors more commonly use library multi-versioning: this is easier to achieve as only compiler switches need to be changed. Glibc supports LMV and this functionality is adopted by the Intel-backed Clear Linux project.\nSIMD on the web.\nIn 2013 John McCutchan announced that he had created a high-performance interface to SIMD instruction sets for the Dart programming language, bringing the benefits of SIMD to web programs for the first time. The interface consists of two types:\nInstances of these types are immutable and in optimized code are mapped directly to SIMD registers. Operations expressed in Dart typically are compiled into a single instruction without any overhead. This is similar to C and C++ intrinsics. Benchmarks for 4\u00d74 matrix multiplication, 3D vertex transformation, and Mandelbrot set visualization show near 400% speedup compared to scalar code written in Dart.\nIntel announced at IDF 2013 that they were implementing McCutchan's specification for both V8 and SpiderMonkey. However, by 2017, SIMD.js was taken out of the ECMAScript standard queue in favor of pursuing a similar interface in WebAssembly. Support for SIMD was added to the WebAssembly 2.0 specification, which was finished on 2022 and became official in December 2024. LLVM's autovectoring, when compiling C or C++ to WebAssembly, can target WebAssembly SIMD to automatically make use of SIMD, while SIMD intrinsic are also available.\nCommercial applications.\nIt has generally proven difficult to find sustainable commercial applications for SIMD-only processors in general-purpose computing.\nOne that has had some measure of success is the GAPP, which was developed by Lockheed Martin and taken to the commercial sector by their spin-off Teranex. The GAPP's recent incarnations have become a powerful tool in real-time video processing applications like conversion between various video standards and frame rates (NTSC to/from PAL, NTSC to/from high-definition television (HDTV) formats, etc.), deinterlacing, image noise reduction, adaptive video compression, and image enhancement.\nA more ubiquitous application for SIMD is found in video games: nearly every modern video game console since 1998 has incorporated a SIMD processor somewhere in its architecture. The PlayStation 2 was unusual in that one of its vector-float units could function as an autonomous digital signal processor (DSP) executing its own instruction stream, or as a coprocessor driven by ordinary CPU instructions. 3D graphics applications tend to lend themselves well to SIMD processing as they rely heavily on operations with 4-dimensional vectors. Microsoft's Direct3D 9.0 now chooses at runtime processor-specific implementations of its own math operations, including the use of SIMD-capable instructions.\nA later processor that used vector processing is the Cell processor used in the PlayStation 3, which was developed by IBM in cooperation with Toshiba and Sony. It uses a number of SIMD processors (a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture, each with independent local store and controlled by a general purpose CPU) and is geared towards the huge datasets required by 3D and video processing applications. It differs from traditional ISAs by being SIMD from the ground up with no separate scalar registers.\nZiilabs produced an SIMD type processor for use on mobile devices, such as media players and mobile phones.\nLarger scale commercial SIMD processors are available from ClearSpeed Technology, Ltd. and Stream Processors, Inc. ClearSpeed's CSX600 (2004) has 96 cores each with two double-precision floating point units while the CSX700 (2008) has 192. Stream Processors is headed by computer architect Bill Dally. Their Storm-1 processor (2007) contains 80 SIMD cores controlled by a MIPS CPU.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is implemented on versions of the PowerPC processor architecture, including Motorola's G4, IBM's G5 and POWER6 processors, and P.A. Semi's PWRficient PA6T. AltiVec is a trademark owned solely by Freescale, so the system is also referred to as Velocity Engine by Apple and VMX (Vector Multimedia Extension) by IBM and P.A. Semi.\nWhile AltiVec refers to an instruction set, the implementations in CPUs produced by IBM and Motorola are separate in terms of logic design. To date, no IBM core has included an AltiVec logic design licensed from Motorola or vice versa.\nAltiVec is a standard part of the Power ISA v.2.03 specification. It was never formally a part of the PowerPC architecture until this specification although it used PowerPC instruction formats and syntax and occupied the opcode space expressly allocated for such \npurposes.\nComparison to x86-64 SSE.\nBoth VMX/AltiVec and SSE feature 128-bit vector registers that can represent sixteen 8-bit signed or unsigned chars, eight 16-bit signed or unsigned shorts, four 32-bit ints or four 32-bit floating-point variables. Both provide cache-control instructions intended to minimize cache pollution when working on streams of data.\nThey also exhibit important differences. Unlike SSE2, VMX/AltiVec supports a special RGB \"pixel\" data type, but it does not operate on 64-bit double-precision floats, and there is no way to move data directly between scalar and vector registers. In keeping with the \"load/store\" model of the PowerPC's RISC design, the vector registers, like the scalar registers, can only be loaded from and stored to memory. However, VMX/AltiVec provides a much more complete set of \"horizontal\" operations that work across all the elements of a vector; the allowable combinations of data type and operations are much more complete. Thirty-two 128-bit vector registers are provided, compared to eight for SSE and SSE2 (extended to 16 in x86-64), and most VMX/AltiVec instructions take three register operands compared to only two register/register or register/memory operands on IA-32.\nVMX/AltiVec is also unique in its support for a flexible vector permute instruction, in which each byte of a resulting vector value can be taken from any byte of either of two other vectors, parametrized by yet another vector. This allows for sophisticated manipulations in a single instruction.\nRecent versions of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), IBM VisualAge compiler and other compilers provide intrinsics to access VMX/AltiVec instructions directly from C and C++ programs. As of version 4, the GCC also includes auto-vectorization capabilities that attempt to intelligently create VMX/Altivec accelerated binaries without the need for the programmer to use intrinsics directly. The \"vector\" type keyword is introduced to permit the declaration of native vector types, e.g., \"codice_1\" declares a 128-bit vector variable named \"foo\" containing sixteen 8-bit unsigned chars. The full complement of arithmetic and binary operators is defined on vector types so that the normal C expression language can be used to manipulate vector variables. There are also overloaded intrinsic functions such as \"codice_2\" that emit the appropriate opcode based on the type of the elements within the vector, and very strong type checking is enforced. In contrast, the Intel-defined data types for IA-32 SIMD registers declare only the size of the vector register (128 or 64 bits) and in the case of a 128-bit register, whether it contains integers or floating-point values. The programmer must select the appropriate intrinsic for the data types in use, e.g., \"codice_3\" for adding two vectors containing eight 16-bit integers.\nDevelopment history.\nThe Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) was developed between 1996 and 1998 by a collaborative project between Apple, IBM, and Motorola. \nApple was the primary customer for Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) until Apple switched to Intel-made, x86-based CPUs on June 6, 2005. They used it to accelerate multimedia applications such as QuickTime, iTunes and key parts of Apple's Mac OS X including in the Quartz graphics compositor. Other companies such as Adobe used AltiVec to optimize their image-processing programs such as Adobe Photoshop. Motorola was the first to supply AltiVec enabled processors starting with their G4 line. AltiVec was also used in some embedded systems for high-performance digital signal processing.\nIBM consistently left VMX out of their earlier POWER microprocessors, which were intended for server applications where it was not very useful. The POWER6 microprocessor, introduced in 2007, implements AltiVec. The last desktop microprocessor from IBM, the PowerPC 970 (dubbed the \"G5\" by Apple) also implemented AltiVec with hardware similar to that of the PowerPC 7400.\nAltiVec is a brandname trademarked by Freescale (previously Motorola) for the standard \"Category:Vector\" part of the Power ISA v.2.03 specification. This category is also known as VMX (used by IBM), and \"Velocity Engine\" (a brand name previously used by Apple).\nThe Cell Broadband Engine, used in (amongst other things) the PlayStation 3, also supports Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) in its PPU, with the SPU ISA being enhanced but architecturally similar.\nFreescale is bringing an enhanced version of AltiVec to e6500 based QorIQ processors.\nVMX128.\nIBM enhanced VMX for use in Xenon (Xbox 360) and called this enhancement VMX128. The enhancements comprise new routines targeted at gaming (accelerating 3D graphics and game physics) and a total of 128 registers. VMX128 is not entirely compatible with VMX/Altivec, as a number of integer operations were removed to make space for the larger register file and additional application-specific operations.\nVSX (Vector Scalar Extension).\nPower ISA v2.06 introduced VSX vector-scalar instructions which extend SIMD processing for the Power ISA to support up to 64 registers, with support for regular floating point, decimal floating point and vector execution. POWER7 is the first Power ISA processor to implement Power ISA v2.06.\nNew instructions are introduced by IBM under the Vector Media Extension category for integer operations as part of the VSX extension in Power ISA 2.07.\nNew integer vector instructions were introduced by IBM following the VMX encodings as part of the VSX extension in Power ISA v3.0. Shall be introduced with POWER9 processors.\nIssues.\nIn C++, the standard way of accessing AltiVec support is mutually exclusive with the use of the Standard Template Library codice_4 class template due to the treatment of \"vector\" as a reserved word when the compiler does not implement the context-sensitive keyword version of vector. However, it may be possible to combine them using compiler-specific workarounds; for instance, in GCC one may do codice_5 to remove the codice_6 keyword, and then use the GCC-specific codice_7 keyword in its place.\nAltiVec prior to Power ISA 2.06 with VSX lacks loading from memory using a type's natural alignment. For example, the code below requires special handling for Power6 and below when the effective address is not 16-byte aligned. The special handling adds 3 additional instructions to a load operation when VSX is not available.\ntypedef __vector unsigned char uint8x16_p;\ntypedef __vector unsigned int uint32x4_p;\nint main(int argc, char* argv)\n /* Natural alignment of vals is 4; and not 16 as required */\n unsigned int vals[4] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };\n uint32x4_p vec;\n vec = vec_xl(0, vals);\n const uint8x16_p perm = vec_lvsl(0, vals);\n const uint8x16_p low = vec_ld(0, vals);\n const uint8x16_p high = vec_ld(15, vals);\n vec = (uint32x4_p)vec_perm(low, high, perm);\nAltiVec prior to Power ISA 2.06 with VMX lacks 64-bit integer support. Developers who wish to operate on 64-bit data will develop routines from 32-bit components. For example, below are examples of 64-bit codice_8 and codice_9 in C using a vector with four 32-bit words on a big-endian machine. The permutes move the carry and borrow bits from columns 1 and 3 to columns 0 and 2 like in school-book math. A little-endian machine would need a different mask.\ntypedef __vector unsigned char uint8x16_p;\ntypedef __vector unsigned int uint32x4_p;\n/* Performs a+b as if the vector held two 64-bit double words */\nuint32x4_p add64(const uint32x4_p a, const uint32x4_p b)\n const uint8x16_p cmask = {4,5,6,7, 16,16,16,16, 12,13,14,15, 16,16,16,16};\n const uint32x4_p zero = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n uint32x4_p cy = vec_addc(vec1, vec2);\n cy = vec_perm(cy, zero, cmask);\n return vec_add(vec_add(vec1, vec2), cy);\n/* Performs a-b as if the vector held two 64-bit double words */\nuint32x4_p sub64(const uint32x4_p a, const uint32x4_p b)\n const uint8x16_p bmask = {4,5,6,7, 16,16,16,16, 12,13,14,15, 16,16,16,16};\n const uint32x4_p amask = {1, 1, 1, 1};\n const uint32x4_p zero = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n uint32x4_p bw = vec_subc(vec1, vec2);\n bw = vec_andc(amask, bw);\n bw = vec_perm(bw, zero, bmask);\n return vec_sub(vec_sub(vec1, vec2), bw);\nPower ISA 2.07 used in Power8 finally provided the 64-bit double words.

{"id": "55364", "revid": "12794385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55364", "title": "MMX (instruction set)", "text": "Instruction set designed by Intel\nMMX is a \"single instruction, multiple data\" (SIMD) instruction set architecture designed by Intel, introduced on January 8, 1997 with its Pentium P5 (microarchitecture) based line of microprocessors, named \"Pentium with MMX Technology\". It developed out of a similar unit introduced on the Intel i860, and earlier the Intel i750 video pixel processor. MMX is a processor supplementary capability that is supported on IA-32 processors by Intel and other vendors as of 1997[ [update]]. AMD also added MMX instruction set in its K6 processor.\n\"The New York Times\" described the initial push, including Super Bowl advertisements, as focused on \"a new generation of glitzy multimedia products, including videophones and 3-D video games.\"\nMMX has subsequently been extended by several programs by Intel and others: 3DNow!, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), and ongoing revisions of Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX).\nOverview.\nNaming.\nMMX is officially a meaningless initialism trademarked by Intel; unofficially, the initials have been variously explained as standing for \nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), during one of its many court battles with Intel, produced marketing material from Intel indicating that MMX stood for \"Matrix Math Extensions\". Since an initialism cannot be trademarked, this was an attempt to invalidate Intel's trademark. In 1995, Intel filed suit against AMD and Cyrix Corp. for misuse of its trademark MMX. AMD and Intel settled, with AMD acknowledging MMX as a trademark owned by Intel, and with Intel granting AMD rights to use the MMX trademark as a technology name, but not a processor name. Also the \"MMX\" term is sometimes confused with the separate MultiMedia Extensions API on Windows 3.x and Windows 9x.\nTechnical details.\nMMX defines eight processor registers, named MM0 through MM7, and operations that operate on them. Each register is 64 bits wide and can be used to hold either 64-bit integers, or multiple smaller integers in a \"packed\" format: one instruction can then be applied to two 32-bit integers, four 16-bit integers, or eight 8-bit integers at once.\nMMX provides only integer operations. When originally developed, for the Intel i860, the use of integer math made sense (both 2D and 3D calculations required it), but as graphics cards that did much of this became common, integer SIMD in the CPU became somewhat redundant for graphical applications. Alternatively, the saturation arithmetic operations in MMX could significantly speed up some digital signal processing applications.\nTo avoid compatibility problems with the context switch mechanisms in existing operating systems, the MMX registers are aliases for the existing x87 floating-point unit (FPU) registers, which context switches would already save and restore. Unlike the x87 registers, which behave like a stack, the MMX registers are each directly addressable (random access).\nAny operation involving the floating-point stack might also affect the MMX registers and vice versa, so this aliasing makes it difficult to work with floating-point and SIMD operations in the same program. To maximize performance, software often used the processor exclusively in one mode or the other, deferring the relatively slow switch between them as long as possible.\nEach 64-bit MMX register corresponds to the mantissa part of an 80-bit x87 register. The upper 16 bits of the x87 registers thus go unused in MMX, and these bits are all set to ones, making them \"Not a Number\" (NaN) data types, or infinities in the floating-point representation. This can be used by software to decide whether a given register's content is intended as floating-point or SIMD data.\nSoftware support.\nSoftware support for MMX developed slowly. Intel's C Compiler and related development tools obtained intrinsics for invoking MMX instructions and Intel released libraries of common vectorized algorithms using MMX. Both Intel and Metrowerks attempted automatic vectorization in their compilers, but the operations in the C programming language mapped poorly onto the MMX instruction set and custom algorithms as of 2000 typically still had to be written in assembly language.\nSuccessors.\nAMD, a competing x86 microprocessor vendor, enhanced Intel's MMX with their own 3DNow! instruction set. 3DNow is best known for adding single-precision (32-bit) floating-point support to the SIMD instruction-set, among other integer and more general enhancements.\nFollowing MMX, Intel's next major x86 extension was the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), introduced with the Pentium III family in 1999, roughly a year after AMD's 3DNow! was introduced.\nSSE addressed the core shortcomings of MMX (inability to mix integer-SIMD ops with any floating-point ops) by creating a new 128-bit wide register file (XMM0\u2013XMM7) and new SIMD instructions for it. Like 3DNow!, SSE focused exclusively on single-precision floating-point operations (32-bit); integer SIMD operations were still performed using the MMX register and instruction set. However, the new XMM register-file allowed SSE SIMD-operations to be freely mixed with either MMX or x87 FPU ops.\n\"Streaming SIMD Extensions 2\" (SSE2), introduced with the Pentium 4, further extended the x86 SIMD instruction set with integer (8/16/32 bit) and double-precision floating-point data support for the XMM register file. SSE2 also allowed the MMX \"operation codes\" (opcodes) to use XMM register operands, extended to even wider YMM and ZMM registers by later SSE revisions.\nMMX in embedded applications.\nIntel's and Marvell Technology Group's XScale microprocessor core starting with PXA270 include an SIMD instruction set architecture extension to the ARM architecture core named \"Intel Wireless MMX Technology\" (iwMMXt) which functions are similar to those of the IA-32 MMX extension. It provides arithmetic and logic operations on 64-bit integer numbers, in which the software may choose to instead perform two 32-bit, four 16-bit or eight 8-bit operations in one instruction. The extension contains 16 data registers of 64-bits and eight control registers of 32-bits. All registers are accessed through standard ARM architecture coprocessor mapping mechanism. iwMMXt occupies coprocessors 0 and 1 space, and some of its opcodes clash with the opcodes of the earlier floating-point extension, FPA.\nLater versions of Marvell's ARM processors support both \"Wireless MMX\" (WMMX) and \"Wireless MMX2\" (WMMX2) opcodes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55365", "revid": "42783819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55365", "title": "Streaming SIMD Extensions", "text": "Computer chip instruction set extension\nIn computing, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) is a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction set extension to the x86 architecture, designed by Intel and introduced in 1999 in its Pentium III series of central processing units (CPUs) shortly after the appearance of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD's) 3DNow!. SSE contains 70 new instructions (65 unique mnemonics using 70 encodings), most of which work on single precision floating-point data. SIMD instructions can greatly increase performance when exactly the same operations are to be performed on multiple data objects. Typical applications are digital signal processing and graphics processing.\nIntel's first IA-32 SIMD effort was the MMX instruction set. MMX had two main problems: it re-used existing x87 floating-point registers making the CPUs unable to work on both floating-point and SIMD data at the same time, and it only worked on integers. SSE floating-point instructions operate on a new independent register set, the XMM registers, and adds a few integer instructions that work on MMX registers.\nSSE was subsequently expanded by Intel to SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3 and SSE4. Because it supports floating-point math, it had wider applications than MMX and became more popular. The addition of integer support in SSE2 made MMX largely redundant, though further performance increases can be attained in some situations by using MMX in parallel with SSE operations.\nSSE was originally called Katmai New Instructions (KNI), Katmai being the code name for the first Pentium III core revision. During the Katmai project Intel sought to distinguish it from its earlier product line, particularly its flagship Pentium II. It was later renamed Internet Streaming SIMD Extensions (ISSE), then SSE. \nAMD added a subset of SSE, 19 of them, called \"new MMX instructions\", and known as several variants and combinations of SSE and MMX, or otherwise as Integer SSE (ISSE, not to be confused with \"Internet Streaming SIMD Extensions\", an early name for SSE) shortly after with the release of the original Athlon in August 1999 (see 3DNow! extensions). AMD eventually added full support for SSE instructions (sometimes referred to as 3DNow! Professional) starting with its Athlon XP (Corvette and Palomino cores) and Duron (Morgan core) processors.\nRegisters.\nSSE originally added eight new 128-bit registers known as codice_1 through codice_2. The AMD64 extensions from AMD added a further eight registers codice_3 through codice_4, and this extension is duplicated in the Intel 64 architecture. There is also a new 32-bit control/status register, codice_5. The registers codice_3 through codice_4 are accessible only in 64-bit operating mode.\nSSE used only a single data type for XMM registers:\nSSE2 would later expand the usage of the XMM registers to include:\nBecause these 128-bit registers are additional machine states that the operating system must preserve across task switches, they are disabled by default until the operating system explicitly enables them. This means that the OS must know how to use the codice_8 and codice_9 instructions, which is the extended pair of instructions that can save all x86 and SSE register states at once. This support was quickly added to all major IA-32 operating systems.\nThe first CPU to support SSE, the Pentium III, shared execution resources between SSE and the floating-point unit (FPU). While a compiled application can interleave FPU and SSE instructions side-by-side, the Pentium III will not issue an FPU and an SSE instruction in the same clock cycle. This limitation reduces the effectiveness of pipelining, but the separate XMM registers do allow SIMD and scalar floating-point operations to be mixed without the performance hit from explicit MMX/floating-point mode switching.\nSSE instructions.\nSSE introduced both scalar and packed floating-point instructions.\nFloating-point instructions.\nFloating operations are IEEE 754-1985 compliant, with the exception of codice_10, which is not specified in the standard.\nExample.\nThe following simple example demonstrates the advantage of using SSE. Consider an operation like vector addition, which is used very often in computer graphics applications. To add two single precision, four-component vectors together using x86 requires four floating-point addition instructions.\nvec_res.x = v1.x + v2.x;\nvec_res.y = v1.y + v2.y;\nvec_res.z = v1.z + v2.z;\nvec_res.w = v1.w + v2.w;\nThis corresponds to four x86 FADD instructions in the object code. On the other hand, as the following pseudo-code shows, a single 128-bit 'packed-add' instruction can replace the four scalar addition instructions.\nmovaps xmm0, [v1] ;xmm0 = v1.w | v1.z | v1.y | v1.x \naddps xmm0, [v2] ;xmm0 = v1.w+v2.w | v1.z+v2.z | v1.y+v2.y | v1.x+v2.x\nmovaps [vec_res], xmm0 ;xmm0\nIdentifying.\nThe following programs can be used to determine which, if any, versions of SSE are supported on a system\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Development started in 1999 by Roger Bowler, a mainframe systems programmer.\nHercules runs under multiple parent operating systems including Linux, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and macOS and is released under the open source software license QPL. It is analogous to Bochs and QEMU in that it emulates CPU instructions and select peripheral devices only. A vendor (or distributor) must still provide an operating system, and the user must install it. Hercules was the first mainframe emulator to incorporate 64-bit z/Architecture support.\nDesign.\nThe emulator is written almost entirely in C. Its developers ruled out using machine-specific assembly code to avoid problems with portability even though such code could significantly improve performance. There are two exceptions: Hercules uses hardware assists to provide inter-processor consistency when emulating multiple CPUs on SMP host systems, and Hercules uses assembler assists to convert between little-endian and big-endian data on platforms where the operating system provides such services and on x86/x86-64 processors.\nOperating systems status.\nHercules is technically compatible with all IBM mainframe operating systems, even older versions which no longer run on newer mainframes. However, many mainframe operating systems require vendor licenses to run legally. Newer licensed operating systems, such as OS/390, z/OS, VSE/ESA, z/VSE, VM/ESA, z/VM, TPF/ESA, and z/TPF are technically compatible but cannot legally run on the Hercules emulator except in very limited circumstances, and they must always be licensed from IBM. IBM's Coupling Facility control code, which enables Parallel Sysplex, and UTS also require licenses to run.\nOperating systems which may legally be run, without license costs, on Hercules include:\nUsage.\nHercules can be used as a development environment to verify that code is portable (across Linux processor architectures, for example), supports symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and is 64-bit \"clean.\"\nThere is also a large community of current and former mainframe operators and programmers, as well as those with no prior experience, who use Hercules and the public domain IBM operating systems as a hobby and for learning purposes. Most of the skills acquired when exploring classic IBM mainframe operating system versions are still relevant when transitioning to licensed IBM machines running the latest versions.\nThe open source nature of Hercules means that anyone can produce their own customized version of the emulator. For example, a group of developers independent of the Hercules project implemented a hybrid mainframe architecture which they dubbed \"S/380\" using modifications to both Hercules and to freely available classic versions of MVS (and later VM and DOS/VS), enhancing the operating systems with some degree of 31-bit (and as of 2016, 64-bit) binary compatibility with later operating system versions (and as of 2018, 32-bit is also supported).\nPerformance.\nIt is difficult to determine exactly how Hercules emulation performance corresponds to real mainframe hardware, but the performance characteristics are understandably quite different. This is partially due to the difficulty of comparing real mainframe hardware to other PCs and servers as well as the lack of concrete, controlled performance comparisons. Performance comparisons are likely legally impossible for licensed IBM operating systems, and those operating systems are quite different from other operating systems, such as Linux.\nHercules expresses its processing performance in MIPS. Due to the age of the earlier System/360 and System/370 hardware, it is a relatively safe assumption that Hercules will outperform them when running on moderately powerful hardware, despite the considerable overhead of emulating a computer architecture in software. However, newer, partially or fully configured System z machines outperform Hercules by a wide margin. A relatively fast dual processor X86 machine running Hercules is capable of sustaining about 50 to 60 MIPS for code that utilizes both processors in a realistic environment, with sustained rates rising to a reported 300 MIPS on leading-edge (early 2009) PC-class systems. Hercules can produce peaks of over 1200 MIPS when running in a tight loop, such as in a synthetic instruction benchmark or with other small, compute-intensive programs.\nTom Lehmann, co-founder of TurboHercules, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...We can run a reasonably sized load (800 MIPS with our standard package). If the machine in question is larger than that, we can scale to 1600 MIPS with our quad Nehalem based package, and we have been promised an 8 way Nehalem EX based machine early next year that should take us to the 3200 MIPS mark. Anything bigger than that is replicated by a collection of systems.\nHercules generally outperforms IBM's PC based mainframes from the mid-1990s, which have an advertised peak performance of around 29 MIPS. Compared to the more powerful but still entry-level IBM Multiprise 2000 and 3000 mainframes (also from the 1990s), Hercules on typical x86 hardware would be considered a mid-range server in performance terms. For every mainframe after the 9672 Generation 1, Hercules would generally be the lowest end system. For comparison, 2010-era high-end IBM zEnterprise 196 systems can deliver over 52,000 MIPS per machine, and they have considerable I/O performance advantages. With the same number of emulated Sys Z processors, z/PDT is about 3 times faster than Hercules.\nNote that there are other non-functional system attributes beyond performance which are typically relevant to mainframe operators. These include high availability, failover, hot-plug CPU and RAM, I/O routing over I/O meshes, system migration and LPAR management. For example, the 370/390/ESA/z architectures implement I/O using four instructions: large, complex I/O operations can be set up and handed over to the peripheral for processing; the CPU has no further involvement in the I/O until the I/O device notifies that it has completed the operation. This results in mainframe systems where the vast majority of \"CPU cycles\" are used not in mainframe CPU itself, but the assortment of processors embedded in the I/O peripherals. The mainframe CPU then acts more as orchestra conductor, coordinating data movement, rather than \"computing\" per se. The simplest I/O devices can be emulated; complex systems would pose a challenge.\nTurboHercules.\nIn 2009, Roger Bowler founded TurboHercules SAS, based in France, to commercialize the Hercules technology. In July 2009, TurboHercules SAS asked IBM to license z/OS to its customers for use on systems sold by TurboHercules. IBM declined the company's request. In March 2010, TurboHercules SAS filed a complaint with European Commission regulators, alleging that IBM infringed EU antitrust rules through its alleged tying of mainframe hardware to its mainframe operating system, and the EC opened a preliminary investigation. In November 2010, TurboHercules announced that it had received an investment from Microsoft Corporation. In September 2011, EC regulators closed their investigation without action.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These regions are called partitions. It is typically the first step of preparing a newly installed disk after a partitioning scheme is chosen for the new disk before any file system is created. The disk stores the information about the partitions' locations and sizes in an area known as the partition table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk. Each partition then appears to the operating system as a distinct \"logical\" disk that uses part of the actual disk. System administrators use a program called a partition editor to create, resize, delete, and manipulate the partitions. Partitioning allows the use of different filesystems to be installed for different kinds of files. Separating user data from system data can prevent the system partition from becoming full and rendering the system unusable. Partitioning can also make backing up easier. A disadvantage is that it can be difficult to properly size partitions, resulting in having one partition with too much free space and another nearly totally allocated.\nHistory.\nOne of the earliest such forms of segmentation of a disk drive was IBM's 1966 usage in its CP-67 operating system of \"minidisk\" as a separate segment of a hard disk drive.\nData General's RDOS operating system for their Nova computers used the term \"partition\" for subregions of a disk. Each partition had its own directory.\nIBM in its 1983 release of PC DOS version 2.0 also used the term \"partition\" to describe dividing a block storage device such as an HDD into physical segments. The term's usage is now ubiquitous. Other terms used include \"logical disk\", \"minidisk\", \"portions\", \"pseudo-disk\", \"section\", \"slice\" and \"virtual drive\".\nPartitioning schemes.\nDOS, Windows, and OS/2.\nWith DOS, Microsoft Windows, and OS/2, a common practice is to use one primary partition for the active file system that will contain the operating system, the page/swap file, all utilities, applications, and user data. On most Windows consumer computers, the drive letter C: is routinely assigned to this primary partition. Other partitions may exist on the HDD that may or may not be visible as drives, such as recovery partitions or partitions with diagnostic tools or data. (Windows drive letters do not correspond to partitions in a one-to-one fashion, so there may be more or fewer drive letters than partitions.)\nMicrosoft Windows 2000 and later versions include a 'Disk Management' program which allows for the creation, deletion and resizing of FAT and NTFS partitions. The Windows Disk Manager in Windows Vista and Windows 7 utilizes a 1 MB partition alignment scheme which is fundamentally incompatible with Windows 2000, XP, OS/2, DOS as well as many other operating systems.\nUnix-like systems.\nOn Unix-based and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, macOS, BSD, and Solaris, it is possible to use multiple partitions on a disk device. Each partition can be formatted with a file system or as a swap partition.\nMultiple partitions allow directories such as /boot, /tmp, /usr, /var, or /home to be allocated their own filesystems. Such a scheme has a number of advantages:\nA common minimal configuration for Linux systems is to use three partitions: one holding the system files mounted on \"/\" (the root directory), one holding user configuration files and data mounted on /home (home directory), and a swap partition.\nBy default, macOS systems also use a single partition for the entire filesystem and use a swap file inside the file system (like Windows) rather than a swap partition.\nIn Solaris, partitions are sometimes known as slices. This is a conceptual reference to the slicing of a cake into several pieces.\nThe term \"slice\" is used in the FreeBSD operating system to refer to Master Boot Record partitions, to avoid confusion with FreeBSD's own disklabel-based partitioning scheme. However, GUID Partition Table partitions are referred to as \"partition\" worldwide.\nMulti-boot systems.\nMulti-boot systems are computers where the user can boot into more than one distinct operating system (OS) stored in separate storage devices or in separate partitions of the same storage device. In such systems a menu at startup gives a choice of which OS to boot/start (and only one OS at a time is loaded).\nThis is distinct from virtual operating systems, in which one operating system is run as a self-contained virtual \"program\" within another already-running operating system. (An example is a Windows OS \"virtual machine\" running from within a Linux OS.)\nGUID Partition Table.\nThe GUID Partition Table (GPT) (GUID is from Globally Unique IDentifier) is a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard for the layout of the partition table on a physical hard disk. Many operating systems now support this standard. However, Windows does not support this on BIOS based computers.\nPartition recovery.\nWhen a partition is deleted, its entry is removed from a table and the data is no longer accessible. The data remains on the disk until it is overwritten. Specialized recovery utilities may be able to locate \"lost\" file systems and recreate a partition table which includes entries for these recovered file systems. Some disk utilities may overwrite a number of beginning sectors of a partition they delete. For example, if Windows Disk Management (Windows 2000/XP, etc.) is used to delete a partition, it will overwrite the first sector (relative sector 0) of the partition before removing it. It still may be possible to restore a FAT or NTFS partition if a backup boot sector is available.\nCompressed disks.\nHDDs can be compressed to create additional space. In DOS and early Microsoft Windows, programs such as Stacker (DR-DOS except 6.0), SuperStor (DR\u00a0DOS 6.0), DoubleSpace (MS-DOS 6.0\u20136.2), or DriveSpace (MS-DOS 6.22, Windows 9x) were used. This compression was done by creating a very large file on the partition, then storing the disk's data in this file. At startup, device drivers opened this file and assigned it a separate letter. Frequently, to avoid confusion, the original partition and the compressed drive had their letters swapped, so that the compressed disk is C:, and the uncompressed area (often containing system files) is given a higher name.\nVersions of Windows using the NT kernel, including the most recent version, Windows 10, contain intrinsic disk compression capability. The use of separate disk compression utilities has declined sharply.\nPartition table.\nA partition table is a table maintained on a disk by the operating system that outlines and describes the partitions on that disk. The terms \"partition table\" and \"partition map\" are similar terms and can be used interchangeably. The term is most commonly associated with the MBR partition table of a Master Boot Record (MBR) in PCs, but it may be used generically to refer to other formats that divide a disk drive into partitions, such as: GUID Partition Table (GPT), Apple partition map (APM), or BSD disklabel.\nPC partition types.\nMBR.\nThis section describes the master boot record (MBR) partitioning scheme, as used historically in DOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux (among others) on PC-compatible computer systems. As of the mid-2010s, most new computers use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme instead. For examples of other partitioning schemes, see the general article on partition tables.\nThe total data storage space of a PC HDD on which MBR partitioning is implemented can contain at most four \"primary partitions\", or alternatively three primary partitions and an \"extended partition\". The \"Partition Table\", located in the master boot record, contains 16-byte entries, each of which describes a partition.\nThe \"partition type\" is identified by a 1-byte code found in its partition table entry. Some of these codes (such as 0x05 and 0x0F) may be used to indicate the presence of an extended partition. Most are used by an operating system's bootloader (that examines partition tables) to decide if a partition contains a file system that can be \"mounted / accessed\" for reading or writing data.\nPrimary partition.\nA primary partition contains one file system. In DOS and all early versions of Microsoft Windows systems, Microsoft required what it called the system partition to be the first partition. All Windows operating systems from Windows 95 onwards can be located on (almost) any partition, but the boot files (codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, etc.) must reside on a primary partition. However, other factors, such as a PC's BIOS (see Boot sequence on standard PC) may also impose specific requirements as to which partition must contain the primary OS.\nThe partition type \"code\" for a primary partition can either correspond to a file system contained within (e.g., 0x07 means either an NTFS or an OS/2 HPFS file system) or indicate that the partition has a special use (e.g., code 0x82 usually indicates a Linux \"swap\" partition). The FAT16 and FAT32 file systems have made use of a number of partition type codes due to the limits of various DOS and Windows OS versions. Though a Linux operating system may recognize a number of different file systems (ext4, ext3, ext2, ReiserFS, etc.), they have all consistently used the same partition type code: 0x83 (Linux native file system).\nExtended partition.\nAn HDD may contain only one extended partition, but that extended partition can be subdivided into multiple logical partitions. DOS/Windows systems may then assign a unique drive letter to each logical partition. GUID partition table (GPT) only has the primary partition, doesn't have the extended partition and the logical partition.\nBoot partitions.\nBIOS boot partition.\nBIOS boot partition (BIOS BP) is a share of the storage device used to keep software that boots the operating system, a bootloader. It may be an operating system kernel image or bootloader or a completely separate piece of software.136\nEFI system partition.\nEFI system partition is the same as BIOS BP, but is loaded by EFI firmware instead of BIOS.136\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term is derived from Medieval Latin , from Latin 'above, beyond, outside of' + 'nature'. Although the corollary term \"nature\" has had multiple meanings since the ancient world, the term \"supernatural\" emerged in the Middle Ages and did not exist in the ancient world.\nThe supernatural is featured in religious and folkloric contexts, but can also feature as an explanation in more secular contexts, as in the cases of superstitions or belief in the paranormal. The term is attributed to non-physical entities, such as spirits, angels, demons, gods, and goddesses. It also includes claimed abilities embodied in or provided by such beings, including magic, telekinesis, levitation, precognition and extrasensory perception.\nThe supernatural is hypernymic to religion. Religions are standardized supernaturalist worldviews, or at least more complete than single supernaturalist views. Supernaturalism is the adherence to the supernatural (beliefs, and not violations of causality and the physical laws).\nEtymology and history of the concept.\nOccurring as both an adjective and a noun, antecedents of the modern English compound \"supernatural\" enter the language from two sources: via Middle French () and directly from the Middle French's term's ancestor, post-Classical Latin (). Post-classical Latin first occurs in the 6th century, composed of the Latin prefix and (see nature). The earliest known appearance of the word in the English language occurs in a Middle English translation of Catherine of Siena's \"Dialogue\" (\"orcherd of Syon\", around 1425; ).\nThe semantic value of the term has shifted over the history of its use. Originally the term referred exclusively to Christian understandings of the world. For example, as an adjective, the term can mean \"belonging to a realm or system that transcends nature, as that of divine, magical, or ghostly beings; attributed to or thought to reveal some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature; occult, paranormal\" or \"more than what is natural or ordinary; unnaturally or extraordinarily great; abnormal, extraordinary\". Obsolete uses include \"of, relating to, or dealing with metaphysics\". As a noun, the term can mean \"a supernatural being\", with a particularly strong history of employment in relation to entities from the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.\nHistory of the concept.\nThe ancient world had no word that resembled \"supernatural\". Dialogues from Neoplatonic philosophy in the third century AD influenced the development of the concept of the supernatural, which later evolved through Christian theology. The term \"nature\" had existed since antiquity, with Latin authors like Augustine using the word and its cognates at least 600 times in \"City of God\". In the medieval period, \"nature\" had ten different meanings and \"natural\" had eleven different meanings. Peter Lombard, a medieval scholastic of the 12th century, explored causes beyond nature, questioning how certain phenomena could be attributed solely to God. In his writings, he used the term \"praeter naturam\" to describe these occurrences. In the scholastic period, Thomas Aquinas classified miracles into three categories: \"above nature\", \"beyond nature\" and \"against nature\". In doing so, he sharpened the distinction between nature and miracles more than the early Church Fathers had done. As a result, he had created a dichotomy of sorts of the natural and supernatural. Though the phrase \"supra naturam\" was used since the 4th century AD, it was in the 1200s that Thomas Aquinas used the term \"\"supernaturalis\".\" Despite this, the term had to wait until the end of the medieval period before it became more popularly used. The discussions on \"nature\" from the scholastic period were diverse and unsettled with some postulating that even miracles are natural and that natural magic was a natural part of the world.\nEpistemology and metaphysics.\nThe metaphysical considerations of the existence of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis, the natural, will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected. One complicating factor is that there is disagreement about the definition of \"natural\" and the limits of naturalism. Concepts in the supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in religious spirituality and occultism or spiritualism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For sometimes we use the word \"nature\" for that \"Author of nature\" whom the schoolmen, harshly enough, call \"natura naturans\", as when it is said that \"nature\" hath made man partly corporeal and partly immaterial. Sometimes we mean by the \"nature\" of a thing the \"essence\", or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the \"quiddity\" of a thing, namely, the \"attribute\" or \"attributes\" on whose score it is what it is, whether the thing be corporeal or not, as when we attempt to define the \"nature\" of an \"angle\", or of a \"triangle\", or of a \"fluid\" body, as such. Sometimes we take \"nature\" for an internal principle of motion, as when we say that a stone let fall in the air is by \"nature\" carried towards the centre of the earth, and, on the contrary, that fire or flame does \"naturally\" move upwards toward firmament. Sometimes we understand by \"nature\" the established course of things, as when we say that \"nature\" makes the night succeed the day, \"nature\" hath made respiration necessary to the life of men. Sometimes we take \"nature\" for an aggregate of powers belonging to a body, especially a living one, as when physicians say that \"nature\" is strong or weak or spent, or that in such or such diseases \"nature\" left to herself will do the cure. Sometimes we take nature for the universe, or system of the corporeal works of God, as when it is said of a phoenix, or a chimera, that there is no such thing in \"nature\", i.e. in the world. And sometimes too, and that most commonly, we would express by \"nature\" a semi-deity or other strange kind of being, such as this discourse examines the notion of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And besides these more absolute acceptions, if I may so call them, of the word \"nature\", it has divers others (more relative), as \"nature\" is wont to be set or in opposition or contradistinction to other things, as when we say of a stone when it falls downwards that it does it by a \"natural motion\", but that if it be thrown upwards its motion that way is \"violent\". So chemists distinguish vitriol into \"natural\" and \"fictitious\", or made by art, i.e. by the intervention of human power or skill; so it is said that water, kept suspended in a sucking pump, is not in its \"natural\" place, as that is which is stagnant in the well. We say also that wicked men are still in the state of \"nature\", but the regenerate in a state of \"grace\"; that cures wrought by medicines are natural operations; but the miraculous ones wrought by Christ and his apostles were \"supernatural\".\nNomological possibility is possibility under the actual laws of nature. Most philosophers since David Hume have held that the laws of nature are metaphysically contingent\u2014that there could have been different natural laws than the ones that actually obtain. If so, then it would not be logically or metaphysically impossible, for example, for you to travel to Alpha Centauri in one day; it would just have to be the case that you could travel faster than the speed of light. But of course there is an important sense in which this is not nomologically possible; given that the laws of nature are what they are. In the philosophy of natural science, impossibility assertions come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proved to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying scientific theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible. While an impossibility assertion in natural science can never be absolutely proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single counterexample. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined. Some philosophers, such as Sydney Shoemaker, have argued that the laws of nature are in fact necessary, not contingent; if so, then nomological possibility is equivalent to metaphysical possibility.\nThe term \"supernatural\" is often used interchangeably with paranormal or preternatural\u2014the latter typically limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed what is possible within the boundaries of the laws of physics. Epistemologically, the relationship between the supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that, \"ex hypothesi,\" violate the laws of nature, in so far as such laws are realistically accountable.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Parapsychologists use the term psi to refer to an assumed unitary force underlying the phenomena they study. Psi is defined in the \"Journal of Parapsychology\" as \"personal factors or processes in nature which transcend accepted laws\" (1948: 311) and \"which are non-physical in nature\" (1962:310), and it is used to cover both extrasensory perception (ESP), an \"awareness of or response to an external event or influence not apprehended by sensory means\" (1962:309) or inferred from sensory knowledge, and psychokinesis (PK), \"the direct influence exerted on a physical system by a subject without any known intermediate energy or instrumentation\" (1945:305).\u2014\u200a\nViews on the \"supernatural\" vary, for example it may be seen as:\nCross cultural studies.\nAnthropological studies across cultures indicate that people do not hold or use natural and supernatural explanations in a mutually exclusive or dichotomous fashion. Instead, the reconciliation of natural and supernatural explanations is normal and pervasive across cultures. Cross cultural studies indicate that there is coexistence of natural and supernatural explanations in both adults and children for explaining numerous things about the world, such as illness, death, and origins. Context and cultural input play a large role in determining when and how individuals incorporate natural and supernatural explanations. The coexistence of natural and supernatural explanations in individuals may be the outcomes two distinct cognitive domains: one concerned with the physical-mechanical relations and another with social relations. Studies on indigenous groups have allowed for insights on how such coexistence of explanations may function.\nSupernatural concepts.\nDeity.\nA \"deity\" ( or ) is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred. The \"Oxford Dictionary of English\" defines deity as \"a god or goddess (in a polytheistic religion)\", or anything revered as divine. C. Scott Littleton defines a deity as \"a being with powers greater than those of ordinary humans, but who interacts with humans, positively or negatively, in ways that carry humans to new levels of consciousness, beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary life.\" A male deity is a god, while a female deity is a goddess.\nReligions can be categorized by how many deities they worship. Monotheistic religions accept only one deity (predominantly referred to as God), polytheistic religions accept multiple deities. Henotheistic religions accept one supreme deity without denying other deities, considering them as equivalent aspects of the same divine principle; and nontheistic religions deny any supreme eternal creator deity but accept a pantheon of deities which live, die and are reborn just like any other being.\nVarious cultures have conceptualized a deity differently than a monotheistic God. A deity need not be omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent or eternal, The monotheistic God, however, does have these attributes. Monotheistic religions typically refer to God in masculine terms, while other religions refer to their deities in a variety of ways \u2013 masculine, feminine, androgynous and gender neutral.\nHistorically, many ancient cultures \u2013 such as Ancient India, Ancient Iraq, Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Greek, Ancient Roman, Nordic and Asian culture \u2013 personified natural phenomena, variously as either their conscious causes or simply their effects, respectively. Some Avestan and Vedic deities were viewed as ethical concepts. In Indian religions, deities have been envisioned as manifesting within the temple of every living being's body, as sensory organs and mind. Deities have also been envisioned as a form of existence (Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra) after rebirth, for human beings who gain merit through an ethical life, where they become guardian deities and live blissfully in heaven, but are also subject to death when their merit runs out.\nAngel.\nAn angel is generally a supernatural being found in various religions and mythologies. In Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, angels are often depicted as benevolent celestial beings who act as intermediaries between God or Heaven and Earth. Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings and carrying out God's tasks. Within Abrahamic religions, angels are often organized into hierarchies, although such rankings may vary between sects in each religion, and are given specific names or titles, such as Gabriel or \"Destroying angel\". The term \"angel\" has also been expanded to various notions of spirits or figures found in other religious traditions. The theological study of angels is known as \"angelology\".\nIn fine art, angels are usually depicted as having the shape of human beings of extraordinary beauty; they are often identified using the symbols of bird wings, halos and light.\nProphecy.\nProphecy involves a process in which messages are communicated by a god to a prophet. Such messages typically involve inspiration, interpretation, or revelation of divine will concerning the prophet's social world and events to come (compare divine knowledge). Prophecy is not limited to any one culture. It is a common property to all known ancient societies around the world, some more than others. Many systems and rules about prophecy have been proposed over several millennia.\nRevelation.\nIn religion and theology, revelation is the revealing or disclosing of some form of truth or knowledge through communication with a deity or other supernatural entity or entities.\nSome religions have religious texts which they view as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired. For instance, Orthodox Jews, Christians and Muslims believe that the \"Torah\" was received from Yahweh on biblical Mount Sinai. Most Christians believe that both the Old Testament and the New Testament were inspired by God. Muslims believe the Quran was revealed by God to Muhammad word by word through the angel Gabriel (\"Jibril\"). In Hinduism, some Vedas are considered \"\", \"not human compositions\", and are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called \"\u015bruti\", \"what is heard\". Aleister Crowley stated that \"The Book of the Law\" had been revealed to him through a higher being that called itself \"Aiwass\".\nA revelation communicated by a supernatural entity reported as being present during the event is called a vision. Direct conversations between the recipient and the supernatural entity, or physical marks such as stigmata, have been reported. In rare cases, such as that of Saint Juan Diego, physical artifacts accompany the revelation. The Roman Catholic concept of interior locution includes just an inner voice heard by the recipient.\nIn the Abrahamic religions, the term is used to refer to the process by which God reveals knowledge of himself, his will and his divine providence to the world of human beings. In secondary usage, revelation refers to the resulting human knowledge about God, prophecy and other divine things. Revelation from a supernatural source plays a less important role in some other religious traditions such as Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism.\nReincarnation.\nReincarnation is the philosophical or religious concept that an aspect of a living being starts a new life in a different physical body or form after each biological death. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra doctrine of cyclic existence. It is a central tenet of all major Indian religions, namely Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures, and a belief in rebirth/metempsychosis was held by Greek historic figures, such as Pythagoras, Socrates and Plato. It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as Spiritism, Theosophy and Eckankar and as an esoteric belief in many streams of Orthodox Judaism. It is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Australia, East Asia, Siberia and South America.\nAlthough the majority of denominations within Christianity and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Cathars, Alawites, the Druze and the Rosicrucians. The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manicheanism and Gnosticism of the Roman era as well as the Indian religions, have been the subject of recent scholarly research. Unity Church and its founder Charles Fillmore teaches reincarnation.\nIn recent decades, many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation, and many contemporary works mention it.\nKarma.\nKarma (; , ; ) means action, work or deed; it also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering.\nWith origins in ancient India's Vedic civilization, the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions (particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism) as well as Taoism. In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life, as well as the nature and quality of future lives \u2013 one's \"sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\".\nChristian theology.\nIn Catholic theology, the supernatural order is, according to New Advent, defined as \"the ensemble of effects exceeding the powers of the created universe and gratuitously produced by God for the purpose of raising the rational creature above its native sphere to a God-like life and destiny.\" The \"Modern Catholic Dictionary\" defines it as \"the sum total of heavenly destiny and all the divinely established means of reaching that destiny, which surpass the mere powers and capacities of human nature.\"\nProcess theology.\nProcess theology is a school of thought influenced by the metaphysical process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (1861\u20131947) and further developed by Charles Hartshorne (1897\u20132000).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is not possible, in process metaphysics, to conceive divine activity as a \"supernatural\" intervention into the \"natural\" order of events. Process theists usually regard the distinction between the supernatural and the natural as a by-product of the doctrine of creation \"ex nihilo\". In process thought, there is no such thing as a realm of the natural in contrast to that which is supernatural. On the other hand, if \"the natural\" is defined more neutrally as \"what is in the nature of things\", then process metaphysics characterizes the natural as the creative activity of actual entities. In Whitehead's words, \"It lies in the nature of things that the many enter into complex unity\" (Whitehead 1978, 21). It is tempting to emphasize process theism's denial of the supernatural and thereby highlight that the processed God cannot do in comparison what the traditional God could do (that is, to bring something from nothing). In fairness, however, equal stress should be placed on process theism's denial of the natural (as traditionally conceived) so that one may highlight what the creatures cannot do, in traditional theism, in comparison to what they can do in process metaphysics (that is, to be part creators of the world with God).\u2014\u200a\nHeaven.\n\"Heaven\", or \"the heavens\", is a common religious, cosmological, or transcendent place where beings such as gods, angels, spirits, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to Earth or incarnate, and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases enter heaven alive.\nHeaven is often described as a \"higher place\", the holiest place, a Paradise, in contrast to hell or the Underworld or the \"low places\" and universally or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of divinity, goodness, piety, faith, or other virtues or right beliefs or simply the will of God. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a \"world to come\".\nAnother belief is in an axis mundi or world tree which connects the heavens, the terrestrial world and the underworld. In Indian religions, heaven is considered as \"Svarga loka\", and the soul is again subjected to rebirth in different living forms according to its \"karma\". This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves \"Moksha\" or \"Nirvana\". Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (Heaven, Hell, or other) is referred to as \"otherworld.\"\nUnderworld.\nThe \"underworld\" is the supernatural world of the dead in various religious traditions, located below the world of the living. Chthonic is the technical adjective for things of the underworld.\nThe concept of an underworld is found in almost every civilization and \"may be as old as humanity itself\". Common features of underworld myths are accounts of living people making journeys to the underworld, often for some heroic purpose. Other myths reinforce traditions that entrance of souls to the underworld requires a proper observation of ceremony, such as the ancient Greek story of the recently dead Patroclus haunting Achilles until his body could be properly buried for this purpose. Persons having social status were dressed and equipped in order to better navigate the underworld.\nA number of mythologies incorporate the concept of the soul of the deceased making its own journey to the underworld, with the dead needing to be taken across a defining obstacle such as a lake or a river to reach this destination. Imagery of such journeys can be found in both ancient and modern art. The descent to the underworld has been described as \"the single most important myth for Modernist authors\".\nSpirit.\nA \"spirit\" is a supernatural being, often but not exclusively a non-physical entity; such as a demon, ghost, fairy, jinn or angel. The concepts of a person's spirit and soul, often also overlap, as both are either contrasted with or given ontological priority over the body and both are believed to survive bodily death in some religions, and \"spirit\" can also have the sense of \"ghost\", i.e. a manifestation of the spirit of a deceased person. In English Bibles, \"the Spirit\" (with a capital \"S\"), specifically denotes the Holy Spirit.\nSpirit is often used metaphysically to refer to the consciousness or personality.\nHistorically, it was also used to refer to a \"subtle\" as opposed to \"gross\" material substance, as in the famous last paragraph of Sir Isaac Newton's \"Principia Mathematica\".\nDemon.\nA \"demon\" (from Koine Greek \"daim\u00f3nion\") is a supernatural and often malevolent being prevalent in religion, occultism, literature, fiction, mythology and folklore.\nIn Ancient Near Eastern religions as well as in the Abrahamic traditions, including ancient and medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity, below the heavenly planes which may cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism. In Western occultism and Renaissance magic, which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco-Roman magic, Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology, a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled.\nMagic.\n\"Magic\" or \"sorcery\" is the use of rituals, symbols, actions, gestures, or language with the aim of utilizing supernatural forces. Belief in and practice of magic has been present since the earliest human cultures and continues to have an important spiritual, religious and medicinal role in many cultures today. The term \"magic\" has a variety of meanings, and there is no widely agreed upon definition of what it is.\nScholars of religion have defined magic in different ways. One approach, associated with the anthropologists Edward Tylor and James G. Frazer, suggests that magic and science are opposites. An alternative approach, associated with the sociologists Marcel Mauss and Emile Durkheim, argues that magic takes place in private, while religion is a communal and organised activity. Many scholars of religion have rejected the utility of the term \"magic\" and it has become increasingly unpopular within scholarship since the 1990s.\nThe term \"magic\" comes from the Old Persian \"magu\", a word that applied to a form of religious functionary about which little is known. During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BC, this term was adopted into Ancient Greek, where it was used with negative connotations, to apply to religious rites that were regarded as fraudulent, unconventional and dangerous. This meaning of the term was then adopted by Latin in the first century BC. The concept was then incorporated into Christian theology during the first century AD, where magic was associated with demons and thus defined against religion. This concept was pervasive throughout the Middle Ages, although in the early modern period Italian humanists reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to establish the idea of natural magic. Both negative and positive understandings of the term were retained in Western culture over the following centuries, with the former largely influencing early academic usages of the word.\nThroughout history, there have been examples of individuals who practiced magic and referred to themselves as magicians. This trend has proliferated in the modern period, with a growing number of magicians appearing within the esoteric milieu. British esotericist Aleister Crowley described magic as the art of effecting change in accordance with will.\nDivination.\nDivination (from Latin \"divinare\" \"to foresee, to be inspired by a god\", related to \"divinus\", divine) is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic, standardized process or ritual. Used in various forms throughout history, diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs, events, or omens, or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency.\nDivination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Fortune-telling, on the other hand, is a more everyday practice for personal purposes. Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.\nDivination is dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstition. In the 2nd century, Lucian devoted a witty essay to the career of a charlatan, \"Alexander the false prophet\", trained by \"one of those who advertise enchantments, miraculous incantations, charms for your love-affairs, visitations for your enemies, disclosures of buried treasure and successions to estates\".\nWitchcraft.\nWitchcraft or witchery broadly means the practice of and belief in magical skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. \"Witchcraft\" is a broad term that varies culturally and societally and thus can be difficult to define with precision, and cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious divinatory or medicinal role and is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view.\nMiracle.\nA \"miracle\" is an event not explicable by natural or scientific laws. Such an event may be attributed to a supernatural being (a deity), a miracle worker, a saint or a religious leader.\nInformally, the word \"miracle\" is often used to characterise any beneficial event that is statistically unlikely but not contrary to the laws of nature, such as surviving a natural disaster, or simply a \"wonderful\" occurrence, regardless of likelihood, such as a birth. Other such miracles might be: survival of an illness diagnosed as terminal, escaping a life-threatening situation or 'beating the odds'. Some coincidences may be seen as miracles.\nA true miracle would, by definition, be a non-natural phenomenon, leading many rational and scientific thinkers to dismiss them as physically impossible (that is, requiring violation of established laws of physics within their domain of validity) or impossible to confirm by their nature (because all possible physical mechanisms can never be ruled out). The former position is expressed for instance by Thomas Jefferson and the latter by David Hume. Theologians typically say that, with divine providence, God regularly works through nature yet, as a creator, is free to work without, above, or against it as well. The possibility and probability of miracles are then equal to the possibility and probability of the existence of God.\nSkepticism.\nSkepticism (American English) or scepticism (British English; see spelling differences) is generally any questioning attitude or doubt towards one or more items of putative knowledge or belief. It is often directed at domains such as the supernatural, morality (moral skepticism), religion (skepticism about the existence of God), or knowledge (skepticism about the possibility of knowledge, or of certainty).\nIn fiction and popular culture.\nSupernatural entities and powers are common in various works of fantasy. Examples include the television shows \"Supernatural\" and \"The X-Files\", the magic of the \"Harry Potter\" series, \"The Lord of the Rings\" series, \"The Wheel of Time\" series and \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The rigid nature of the platters is what gives them their name (as opposed to the flexible materials which are used to make floppy disks). Hard drives typically have several platters which are mounted on the same spindle. A platter can store information on both sides, typically requiring two recording heads per platter, one per surface.\nDesign.\nThe magnetic surface of each platter is divided into small sub-micrometer-sized magnetic regions, each of which is used to represent a single binary unit of information. A typical magnetic region on a hard-disk platter (as of 2006) is about 200\u2013250 nanometers wide (in the radial direction of the platter) and extends about 25\u201330 nanometers in the down-track direction (the circumferential direction on the platter), corresponding to about 100 billion bits per square inch of disk area (15.5\u00a0Gbit/cm2). The material of the main \"magnetic medium\" layer is usually a cobalt-based alloy. In today's hard drives each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic grains, which are the base material that gets magnetized. As a whole, each magnetic region will have a magnetization.\nOne reason magnetic grains are used as opposed to a continuous magnetic medium is that they reduce the space needed for a magnetic region. In continuous magnetic materials, formations called \"N\u00e9el spikes\" tend to appear. These are spikes of opposite magnetization, and form for the same reason that bar magnets will tend to align themselves in opposite directions. These cause problems because the spikes cancel each other's magnetic field out, so that at region boundaries, the transition from one magnetization to the other will happen over the length of the N\u00e9el spikes. This is called the transition width.\nMany hard drive platters have a layer of lubricant made of amorphous carbon such as diamond-like carbon, called an overcoat, which is deposited onto the disk using sputtering, or using chemical vapor deposition. Silicon Nitride, PFPE and hydrogenated carbon have also been used as overcoats. Alternatively PFPE can be used as a lubricant on top of the overcoat.\n Granular media is oriented based on whether longitudinal or perpendicular magnetic recording is used. Ordered granular media can allow for higher storage densities than conventional granular media, and bit patterned media can succeed ordered granular media in storage density.\nGrains help solve this problem because each grain is in theory a single magnetic domain (though not always in practice). This means that the magnetic domains cannot grow or shrink to form spikes, and therefore the transition width will be on the order of the diameter of the grains. Thus, much of the development in hard drives has been in reduction of grain size.\nManufacture.\nPlatters are typically made using an aluminium, glass or ceramic substrate. Laptop hard drive platters are made from glass while aluminum platters are often found in desktop computers. In disk manufacturing, a thin coating is deposited on both sides of the substrate, mostly by a vacuum deposition process called magnetron sputtering. The coating has a complex layered structure consisting of various metallic (mostly non-magnetic) alloys as underlayers, optimized for the control of the crystallographic orientation and the grain size of the actual magnetic media layer on top of them, i.e. the film storing the bits of information. On top of it a protective carbon-based overcoat is deposited in the same sputtering process. Platters typically contain several layers of materials such as a seed layer, soft magnetic under layers (SULs) that may contain Cobalt and Iron made of materials such as, an antiferromagnetic (A-FM) layer made of Nickel oxide, Nickel-Manganese or Iron-Manganese alloy, intermediate layer made of Ruthenium and a layer of Cobalt-Chromium-Palladium alloy with oxide. In post-processing a nanometer thin polymeric lubricant layer gets deposited on top of the sputtered structure by dipping the disk into a solvent solution, after which the disk is buffed by various processes to eliminate small defects and verified by a special sensor on a flying head for absence of any remaining asperities or other defects (where the size of the bit given above roughly sets the scale for what constitutes a significant defect size). In the hard-disk drive the hard-drive heads fly and move radially over the surface of the spinning platters to read or write the data. Extreme smoothness, durability, and perfection of finish are required properties of a hard-disk platter.\nIn 1990, the Toshiba MK1122FC hard drive was released in Japan. It introduced the first platter with glass substrate, replacing the aluminium alloys used in earlier hard drives. In February 1991, Areal Technology released the MD-2060, one of the first hard drives to use a glass substrate. It was originally designed for laptops, for which the greater shock resistance of glass substrates are more suitable. In April 1991, the Toshiba MK1122FC was released in North America; Toshiba's factories were able to produce many more drives than Areal, which soon disappeared from the market. Around 2000, other hard drive manufacturers started transitioning from aluminum to glass platters because glass platters have several advantages over aluminum platters.\nIn 2005\u201306, a major shift in technology of hard-disk drives and of magnetic disks/media began. Originally, in-plane magnetized materials were used to store the bits, but this has now been replaced by perpendicular recording. The reason for this transition is the need to continue the trend of increasing storage densities, with perpendicularly oriented media offering a more stable solution for a decreasing bit size. Orienting the magnetization perpendicular to the disk surface has major implications for the disk's deposited structure and the choice of magnetic materials, as well as for some of the other components of the hard-disk drive (such as the head and the electronic channel).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Israeli city, first known as Migdal (), was founded in 1949 approximately 4\u00a0km inland from ancient Ascalon at the Palestinian town of al-Majdal (). Its inhabitants had been exclusively Muslims and Christians, and the area had been allocated to Palestine in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine; on the eve of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War the inhabitants numbered 10,000 and in October 1948, the city accommodated thousands more Palestinian refugees from nearby villages. The town was conquered by Israeli forces on 5 November 1948, by which time much of the Arab population had fled, leaving some 2700 inhabitants, of whom Israeli soldiers deported 500 in December 1948, and most of the rest were deported by 1950. Today, the city's population is almost entirely Israeli Jews.\nMigdal, as it was called in Hebrew, was initially repopulated by Jewish immigrants and demobilized soldiers. It was subsequently renamed multiple times, first as Migdal Gaza, Migdal Gad and Migdal Ashkelon, until in 1953, the coastal neighbourhood of Afridar was incorporated, and the name \"Ashkelon\" was adopted for the combined town. By 1961, Ashkelon was ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. In 2023 the population of Ashkelon was 161,744, making it the third-largest city in Israel's Southern District.\nEtymology.\nThe name Ashkelon is probably western Semitic, and might be connected to the triliteral root ('to weigh', from a Semitic root , akin to Hebrew () or Arabic (), 'weight', perhaps attesting to its importance as a center for mercantile activities. Its name appeared in Phoenician and Punic as () and (). Majdal (Arabic) and Migdal (Hebrew) mean 'tower'.\nHistory.\nCanaanites to Mamluks.\nThe archaeological site of Ascalon, today known as Tel Ashkelon, was the oldest and largest seaport in Canaan, part of Philistia, the pentapolis (a grouping of five cities) of the Philistines, north of Gaza City and south of Jaffa.\nThe site was an important city during Roman, Byzantine and pre-Crusades Muslim rule, and particularly during the period of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, due to its location near the coast and between the Crusader states and Egypt. The Battle of Ascalon was the last action of the First Crusade. In 1270, the Mamluk sultan Baybars ordered the fortifications and harbour at the site to be destroyed. As a result, the city was abandoned by its inhabitants and fell into disuse.\nOttoman Empire.\nThe Palestinian village of Al-Jura (El-Jurah) stood northeast of and immediately adjacent to Tel Ashkelon and is documented in Ottoman tax registers. El-Jurah was depopulated during the 1948 war.\nThe Arab village of Majdal was mentioned by historians and tourists at the end of the 15th century. In 1596, Ottoman records showed Majdal to be a large village of 559 Muslim households, making it the 7th-most-populous locality in Palestine after Safad, Jerusalem, Gaza, Nablus, Hebron and Kafr Kanna.\nAn official Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that \"Medschdel\" had a total of 420 houses and a population of 1175, though the population count included men only.\nBritish Mandate.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, \"Majdal\" had a population of 5,064; 33 Christians and 5,031 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 6,226 (6,166 Muslims and 41 Christians) with 172 in the suburbs (167 Muslims, 4 Christians, and one Jew).\nIn the 1945 statistics Majdal had a population of 9,910; ninety Christians and 9,820 Muslims, with a total (urban and rural) of 43,680 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. 2,050 dunams were public land; all the rest was owned by Arabs. of the dunams, 2,337 were used for citrus and bananas, 2,886 were plantations and irrigable land, 35,442 for cereals, while 1,346 were built-up land.\nMajdal was known for the majdalawi weaving industry. The town had around 500 looms in 1909. In 1920 a British Government report estimated that there were 550 cotton looms in the town with an annual output worth 30\u201340 million francs. But the industry suffered from imports from Europe and by 1927 only 119 weaving establishments remained. The three major fabrics produced were \"malak\" (silk), 'ikhdari' (bands of red and green) and 'jiljileh' (dark red bands). These were used for festival dresses throughout Southern Palestine. Many other fabrics were produced, some with poetic names such as \"ji'nneh u nar\" (\"heaven and hell\"), \"nasheq rohoh\" (\"breath of the soul\") and \"abu mitayn\" (\"father of two hundred\").\nIn addition to agriculture, residents practiced animal husbandry which formed was an important source of income for the town. In 1943, they owned 354 heads of cattle, 168 sheep over a year old, 170 goats over a year old, 65 camels, 17 horses, 39 mules, 447 donkeys, 2966 fowls, and 808 pigeons.\nIsrael.\n20th century.\nMajdal was occupied by the Egyptian army in the early stages of the 1948 war, along with the rest of the Gaza region that had been allocated to the Arab State in the United Nations plan. Over the next few months, the town was subjected to Israeli air-raids and shelling. All but about 1,000 of the town's residents were forced to leave by the time it was captured by Israeli forces as a sequel to Operation Yoav on 4 November 1948. General Yigal Allon ordered the expulsion of the remaining Palestinians but the local commanders did not do so and the Arab population soon recovered to more than 2,500 due mostly to refugees slipping back and also due to the transfer of Palestinians from nearby villages. Most of them were elderly, women, or children. During the next year or so, the Palestinians were held in a confined area surrounded by barbed wire, which became commonly known as the \"ghetto\". Moshe Dayan and Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion were in favor of expulsion, while Mapam and the Israeli labor union Histadrut objected. The government offered the Palestinians positive inducements to leave, including a favorable currency exchange, but also caused panic through night-time raids. The first group was deported to the Gaza Strip by truck on 17 August 1950 after an expulsion order had been served. The deportation was approved by Ben-Gurion and Dayan over the objections of Pinhas Lavon, secretary-general of the Histadrut, who envisioned the town as a productive example of equal opportunity. By October 1950, twenty Palestinian families remained, most of whom later moved to Lydda or Gaza. According to Israeli records, in total 2,333 Palestinians were transferred to the Gaza Strip, 60 to Jordan, 302 to other towns in Israel, and a small number remained in Ashkelon. Lavon argued that this operation dissipated \"the last shred of trust the Arabs had in Israel, the sincerity of the State's declarations on democracy and civil equality, and the last remnant of confidence the Arab workers had in the Histadrut.\" Acting on an Egyptian complaint, the Egyptian-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission ruled that the Palestinians transferred from Majdal should be returned to Israel, but this was not done.\nMajdal was granted to Israel in the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Re-population of the recently vacated Arab dwellings by Jews had been official policy since at least December 1948, but the process began slowly. The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional urban center of 20,000 people. From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilized soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. These early immigrants were mostly from Yemen, North Africa, and Europe.\nIn 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from South Africa, and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted local council status in 1953.\nIn 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. This grew to 43,000 in 1972 and 53,000 in 1983. In 2005, the population was more than 106,000.\nIn 1949 and 1950, three immigrant transit camps (ma'abarot) were established alongside Majdal (renamed Migdal) for Jewish refugees from Arab countries, Romania and Poland. Northwest of Migdal and the immigrant camps, on the lands of the depopulated Palestinian village al-Jura, entrepreneur Zvi Segal, one of the signatories of Israel's Declaration of Independence, established the upscale Barnea neighborhood.\nA large tract of land south of Barnea was handed over to the trusteeship of the South African Zionist Federation, which established the neighborhood of Afridar. Plans for the city were drawn up in South Africa according to the garden city model. Migdal was surrounded by a broad ring of orchards. Barnea developed slowly, but Afridar grew rapidly. The first homes, built in 1951, were inhabited by new Jewish immigrants from South Africa and South America, with some native-born Israelis. The first public housing project for residents of the transit camps, the Southern Hills Project (Hageva'ot Hadromiyot) or Zion Hill (Givat Zion), was built in 1952.\n21st century.\nUnder a plan signed in October 2015, seven new neighborhoods comprising 32,000 housing units, a new stretch of highway, and three new highway interchanges will be built, turning Ashkelon into the sixth-largest city in Israel.\nLandmarks.\nAshkelon National Park.\nThe ancient site of Ascalon is now administered as the Ashkelon National Park. The walls that encircled the city are still visible, as well as Canaanite earth ramparts. The park contains mainly Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader ruins. The largest dog cemetery in the ancient world was discovered in Ashkelon.\nA Roman burial tomb two kilometres north of Ashkelon National Park was discovered in 1937. There are two burial tombs, a painted Hellenistic cave and a Roman cave. The Hellenistic cave is decorated with paintings of nymphs, water scenes, mythological figures and animals.\nBathhouses.\nIn 1986 ruins of 4th- to 6th-century baths were found in Ashkelon. The bathhouses are believed to have been used for prostitution. The remains of nearly 100 mostly male infants were found in a sewer under the bathhouse, leading to conjectures that prostitutes had discarded their unwanted newborns there.\nReligious sites.\nThe remains of a 4th-century Byzantine church with marble slab flooring and glass mosaic walls can be seen in the Barnea Quarter. Remains of a synagogue from this period have also been found.\nMaqam al-Imam al-Husayn.\nAn 11th-century mosque, Maqam al-Imam al-Husayn, a site of pilgrimage for both Sunni and Shia Muslims, which had been built by the Fatimid Caliphate by Badr al-Jamali and where tradition held that the head of Mohammad's grandson Hussein ibn Ali was buried, was blown up by the Israel Defense Forces under instructions from Moshe Dayan as part of a broader programme to destroy mosques in July 1950. The area was subsequently redeveloped for a local Israeli hospital, Barzilai. After the site was re-identified on the hospital grounds, funds from Mohammed Burhanuddin, leader of a Shi'a Ismaili sect based in India, were used to construct a small marble prayer platform, which is visited by Shi'ite pilgrims from India and Pakistan.\nA domed structure housing the 13th-century tomb of Sheikh Awad sits atop a hill overlooking Ashkelon's northern beaches.\nMuseums.\nAshkelon Khan and Museum contains archaeological finds, among them a replica of Ashkelon's Canaanite silver calf, whose discovery was reported on the front page of \"The New York Times\".\nThe Outdoor Museum near the municipal cultural center displays two Roman burial coffins made of marble depicting battle and hunting scenes, and famous mythological scenes.\nMarina and water park.\nThe Ashkelon Marina, located between Delila and Bar Kochba beaches, offers a shipyard and repair services. Ashkeluna is a water-slide park on Ashkelon beach.\nPalestinians and Ashkelon.\nOrigins of Hamas.\nMost of the founding members of Hamas were born in Mandatory Palestine, outside of the Gaza Strip, or have parents who were. Many of them were from villages that were in the vicinity of present-day Ashkelon, including most of the party's leaders:\nPalestinian conflict with modern Ashkelon.\nOn 1\u20132 March 2008, rockets fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip (some of them Grad rockets) hit Ashkelon, wounding seven, and causing property damage. Mayor Roni Mahatzri stated that \"This is a state of war, I know no other definition for it. If it lasts a week or two, we can handle that, but we have no intention of allowing this to become part of our daily routine.\" In March 2008, 230 buildings and 30 cars were damaged by rocket fire on Ashkelon.\nOn 12 May 2008, a rocket fired from the northern Gazan city of Beit Lahiya hit a shopping mall in southern Ashkelon, causing significant structural damage. According to \"The Jerusalem Post\", four people were seriously injured and 87 were treated for shock. Fifteen people suffered minor to moderate injuries as a result of the collapsed structure. Southern District Police chief Uri Bar-Lev believed the Grad-model Katyusha rocket was manufactured in Iran.\nIn March 2009, a Qassam rocket hit a school, destroying classrooms and injuring two people.\nIn November 2014, the mayor, Itamar Shimoni, began a policy of discrimination against Arab workers, refusing to allow them to work on city projects to build bomb shelters for children. His discriminatory actions brought criticism from others, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat who likened the discrimination to the anti-Semitism experienced by Jews in Europe 70 years earlier.\nOn May 11, 2021, Hamas fired 137 rockets on Ashkelon killing 2 and injuring many others.\nOn October 10, 2023, during the Gaza war, Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Hamas, warned all citizens of Ashkelon to evacuate before 5:00 P.M. local time via a post to his Telegram channel. Once the deadline hit, Hamas launched a barrage of missiles towards Ashkelon.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the early years, the city was primarily inhabited by Mizrahi Jews, who moved to Israel after being expelled or migrating from Muslim lands. Today, Mizrahi Jews still constitute the majority of the population. In the early 1950s, many South African Jews settled in Ashkelon, establishing the Afridar neighbourhood. They were followed by an influx of immigrants from the United Kingdom. During the 1990s, the city received additional arrivals of Ethiopian Jews and Russian Jews.\nAshkelon today.\nEconomy.\nAshkelon is the northern terminus for the Trans-Israel pipeline, which brings petroleum products from Eilat to an oil terminal at the port. The Ashkelon seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant is the largest in the world. The project was developed as a BOT (build\u2013operate\u2013transfer) by a consortium of three international companies: Veolia water, IDE Technologies and Elran. In March 2006, it was voted \"Desalination Plant of the Year\" in the Global Water Awards.\nSince 1992, Israel Beer Breweries has been operating in Ashkelon, brewing Carlsberg and Tuborg beer for the Israeli market.\nCulture and sports.\nThe Ashkelon Sports Arena opened in 1999. The \"Jewish Eye\" is a Jewish world film festival that takes place annually in Ashkelon. The festival marked its seventh year in 2010. The Breeza Music Festival has been held yearly in and around Ashkelon's amphitheatre since 1992. Most of the musical performances are free. Israel Lacrosse operates substantial youth lacrosse programs in the city and recently hosted the Turkey men's national team in Israel's first home international in 2013.\nHealth care.\nAshkelon and environs is served by the Barzilai Medical Center, established in 1961. It was built in place of Hussein ibn Ali's 11th-century mosque, a center of Muslim pilgrimages, destroyed by the Israeli army in 1950. Situated from Gaza, the hospital has been the target of numerous Qassam rocket attacks, sometimes as many as 140 over one weekend. The hospital plays a vital role in treating wounded soldiers and terror victims. A rocket and missile-proof emergency room opened in February 2018.\nEducation.\nThe city has 19 elementary schools, and nine junior high and high schools. The Ashkelon Academic College opened in 1998, and now hosts thousands of students. Harvard University operates an archaeological summer school program in Ashkelon.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nAshkelon is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55387", "revid": "47179870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55387", "title": "Gaza City", "text": "City in Palestine\nGaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships\u2014from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.&lt;ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\"&gt;http://&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 06/21/11 08:13 AM ET\"&gt;http://&lt;/ref&gt; The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of 12 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Gaza\" first appears in the military records of Thutmose III of New Kingdom of Egypt in the 15th century BC, and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as and other variant spellings. In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as \"\u1e2a\u0101zat\". It is clear that the name originates from none of these languages, however.\nBased on the city's Hebrew name, , a common folk etymology insists the name stems from the Semitic root &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2-\u05d6-\u05d6\u200e \"\u02bbayin\"-\"zayin\"-\"zayin\", from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived, but this is unlikely. The &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u200e in the root &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2-\u05d6-\u05d6\u200e corresponds to a Proto-Semitic *\"\u02bb\" sound (compare Hebrew with Arabic , both meaning \"to be strong, powerful, mighty\"), while it is clear from city's name in Arabic (, ), Koine Greek (, ), and Egyptian () that the name of Gaza was likely originally pronounced with an initial *\"\u0121\" () sound, and thus cannot have been from the same &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2-\u05d6-\u05d6\u200e root as .\nHistorically, Muslims often referred to the city as \"\u0120azzat H\u0101\u0161im\" in honor of Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the great-grandfather of Muhammad who, according to Islamic tradition, is buried in the city.\nHistory.\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrep\u00f4t of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea.\nEarly Bronze.\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza. The site was inhabited until about 3000 BC. In about 2600 BC, the settlement was re-founded and this time inhabited by the Canaanites. Tell es-Sakan was abandoned again about 2300 BC.\nMiddle Bronze.\nAnother urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed.\nLate Bronze.\nDuring the reign of Thutmose III (r. 1479\u20131425 BC), the city became a stop on the King's Highway, a crucial trade route of the Levant, and was mentioned in the 14th-century Amarna letters as \"Azzatu\". Gaza later served as Egypt's administrative capital in Canaan. Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC.\nIron Age.\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\". Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.\nHellenistic period.\nAlexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before capturing it 332 BC; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive. Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a \"polis\" (or \"city-state\").\nUnder the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus I Nicator or one of his successors renamed Gaza as \"Seleucia\" to control the surrounding area against the Ptolemies. Greek culture consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenistic learning and philosophy. During the Third War of the Diadochi, Ptolemy I Soter defeated Demetrius I Poliorcetes in the Battle of Gaza in 312 BC. In 277 BC, following Ptolemy II's successful campaign against the Nabataeans, the Ptolemaic fortress of Gaza took control of the spice trade with Gerrha and South Arabia.\nGaza experienced another siege in 96 BC by the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus, who \"utterly overthrew\" the city, killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of Apollo.\nRoman period.\nJosephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus.\nRebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BC under the command of Pompey Magnus, Gaza then became a part of the Roman province of Judaea. It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed. It nevertheless remained an important city, even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War. Following this, and again at the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132\u2013136 CE), captives were sold into slavery in Gaza.\nThroughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians, and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint issued coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 AD, Emperor Hadrian personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing, and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium. The city was adorned with many pagan temples; the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local Tyche. Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 AD, including in the port of Maiuma.\nFirst evidence of a Bishop of Gaza is from early 4th century, when St. Sylvan served in that capacity.\nByzantine period.\nFollowing the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, Gaza remained under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire, which in turn became the Byzantine Empire. The city prospered and was an important center for southern Palestine. A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza. Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Porphyry of Gaza between 396 and 420. In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas. It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" The large Gaza synagogue existed in the 6th century, according to excavations.\nEarly Islamic period.\nIn c.\u2009638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred.\nThe arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first, some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city). It was later rebuilt by Sultan Baybars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century. A large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam, and Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i school, one of the four major schools of fiqh (law) in Sunni Islam. \nSecurity, which was well-maintained during the early Muslim rule, was a key factor in Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain viticulture, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported, primarily to Egypt.\nBecause it bordered the Negev, Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups. It was destroyed at the end of the Qays\u2013Yaman war (793\u2013796) between two powerful tribes of Arabia. However, by the 10th century, the city had been rebuilt by the Abbasid Caliphate; during Abbasid rule, the geographer al-Maqdisi described Gaza as \"a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert.\" In 978, the Fatimid Caliphate established an agreement with Alptakin, the Turkic ruler of Damascus, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt, while Alptakin controlled the region north of the city.\nCrusader and Ayyubid periods.\nThe Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149. He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications. Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla in 1193. Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest.\nMamluk period.\nFollowing Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area. In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, \"Mamlakat Ghazzah\" (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills. Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290. In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks. Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a \"city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.\" Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311 and 1320 and again in 1342. In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine. However, when Arab writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was \"large and populous, and has many mosques.\" The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths.\nThe Mamluks allowed Jews to return to the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller, Meshulam of Volterra, wrote of Gaza:It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses.\nOttoman period.\nIn 1516 Gaza\u2014at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade\u2014was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus. The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century. Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla.\nAccording to Theodore E. Dowling, writing in 1913, a Samaritan community existed in Gaza in 1584. They possessed a large synagogue and two bathhouses. \"One of them still bears the name \"the Bath of the Samaritans.\" It is believed the Samaritans were expelled from the city before the turn of the 16th century.\nDuring the rule of Husayn Pasha, strife between the settled population and the nearby Bedouin tribes was dramatically reduced, allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper. The Ridwan period is described as a golden age for Gaza, a time when it served as the virtual \"capital of Palestine.\" The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. After the death of Musa Pasha, Husayn's successor, Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans. The Ridwan period was Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule. After the family was removed from office, the city gradually declined.\nStarting in the early 19th century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered Gaza in 1832. American scholar Edward Robinson visited the city in 1838, describing it as a \"thickly populated\" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain. The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government, local Arab tribes, and the Bedouin of Wadi Arabah and Ma'an. The bazaars of Gaza were well-supplied and were noted by Robinson as \"far better\" than those of Jerusalem. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation. By the mid-19th century, Gaza's port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, but it retained its fishing fleet.\nThe bubonic plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city, lacking political and economic stability, went into a state of stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza.\nDuring the late Ottoman period, British ships docking in Gaza were loaded with barley, which was primarily intended for marketing in Scotland for whisky production. Due to the absence of a British consular agent, precise data on the financial value and quantities of the goods are unavailable.\nStages of conflict and occupation.\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.\nIn the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees from nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.\nIsraeli occupation and colonisation.\nGaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War following the defeat of the Egyptian Army. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and economic conditions in the city worsened.\nPalestinian control.\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory. (\"See\" Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004.) Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organisation Fatah. On 25 January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has \"de facto\" control of the city and Strip.\nIn March 2008, a coalition of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict.\nIn November 2012, after a week of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on 21 November. In the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed, according to UN OCHA. During the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis, the 13-story Hanadi Tower, which contained a political office of Hamas, was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.\nGaza War.\nIn 2023, the city was again targeted during the Gaza war. On 2 November, the siege of Gaza City started. As of January 2024, Israel\u2019s offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70\u201380% of all buildings in northern Gaza. Gaza was left largely deserted, with about only 300,000 people staying in the city. The remaining population was subjected to a humanitarian crisis and starvation brought on by the war.Seventy percent of the city was destroyed by airstrikes, and at least 64,964 people were killed in the Strip. Israel has been accused of committing a genocide of Palestinians in Gaza during the war, with South Africa initiating proceedings at the International Court of Justice against Israel. On 10 August 2025, five journalists were killed in Gaza city as a result of an Israeli air strike, including crew from Al-Jazeera Network.\nGeography.\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of above sea level. Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs. The beach and the port of Gaza are located west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills.\nThe municipal jurisdiction of the city today constitutes about . Gaza is southwest of Jerusalem, south of Tel Aviv, and north of Rafah. Surrounding localities include Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia to the north, and the village of Abu Middein, the refugee camp of Bureij, and the city of Deir al-Balah to the south.\nThe population of Gaza depends on groundwater as the only source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears a small amount of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.\nA prominent hill southeast of Gaza, known as Tell al-Muntar, has an elevation of above sea level. For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which Samson brought the city gates of the Philistines. The hill is crowned by a Muslim shrine (\"maqam\") dedicated to Ali al-Muntar. There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees, and the lintel of the doorway of the \"maqam\" has two medieval Arabic scriptures.\nOld City.\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about .\nThere were seven historic gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (Gate of Ascalon), Bab al-Darum (Gate of Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (Gate of the Sea), Bab Marnas (Gate of Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (Gate of the Town), Bab al-Khalil (Gate of Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (Gate of Tell al-Muntar).\nSome of the older buildings in Gaza's Old City use the \"ablaq\" style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the Gold (Qissariya) Market as well as the Great Mosque of Gaza (oldest mosque in Gaza) and the Sayed al-Hashim Mosque. In Zaytun lies the Saint Porphryrius Church, the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque, and Hamam as-Sammara (\"the Samaritan's Bathhouse.\")\nDistricts.\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (\"hayy\") outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, a new residential district, Rimal (currently divided into the districts of Northern Rimal and Southern Rimal), was constructed on the sand dunes west of the city center, and the district of Zeitoun was built along Gaza's southern and southwestern borders, while the Judeide (\"the New\") and Turukman neighborhoods of Shuja'iyya expanded into separate districts in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Judeide (also known Shuja'iyyat al-Akrad) was named after the Kurdish military units who settled there during the Mamluk era, while Turukman was named after the Turkmen military units who settled there.\nThe areas between Rimal and the Old City became the districts of Sabra and Daraj. In the northwest is the district of Nasser, built in the early 1950s and named in honor of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The district of Sheikh Radwan, developed in the 1970s, is to the north of the Old City and is named after Sheikh Radwan\u2014the tomb of whom is located within the district. Gaza has absorbed the village of al-Qubbah near the border with Israel, as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Shati along the coast, although the latter is not under the city's municipal jurisdiction. In the late 1990s, the PNA built the more affluent neighborhood of Tel al-Hawa along the southern edge of Rimal. Along the southern coast of the city is the neighborhood of Sheikh Ijlin.\nClimate.\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BSh\"), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot but humid summers. Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being . The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at . Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately .\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers. The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 \"jundiyan\" or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.\nIn 1838, there were roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, implying a population of about 15,000 or 16,000\u2014making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents (16,722 Muslims, 701 Christians, 54 Jews and three Metawilehs). The 1931 census lists 17,046 inhabitants (16,356 Muslims, 689 Christians, and one Jew) and another 4,597 in the suburbs (4,561 Muslims and 36 Christians).\nThe village statistics of 1938 list Gaza's population as 20,500 with 5,282 in nearby suburbs. The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 34,250 (33,160 Muslims, 1,010 Christians, and 80 Jews).\nAccording to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Gaza and the adjacent al-Shati camp had a population of 353,115, of which 50.9% were males and 49.1% females. Gaza had an overwhelmingly young population with more than half being 19 and under (60.8%). About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 and 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.\nA massive influx of Palestinian refugees swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. By 1967, the population had grown to about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 590,481 in 2017, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City has one of the highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km2 (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km2 \u2013 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km2 \u2013 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.\nReligion.\nThe population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam. During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers.\nGaza is home to a small Palestinian Christian minority of about 3,500 people. The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations. In 1906, there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.\nGaza's Jewish community was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. At the time of the 1929 Palestine riots, there were fifty families living in Gaza, most of whom fled after the riots. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had a population of 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.\nEconomy.\nThe major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.\nA report by human rights and development groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.\nGaza's food prices rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, households spent an average of 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According to a report by OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.\nFollowing a significant easing of the closure policy in 2010, the economy of Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels during the height of the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, and UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.\nPresence of hydrocarbon reserves around the region gives potential to Gaza, to develop as a leading industrial center. Many of the region\u2019s gas and oil fields are underneath Gaza. In 1999, natural gas reserves were discovered, offshore of the territory, known as Gaza Marine. It holds of natural gas, as a part of the Levant Basin, which itself holds of natural gas. The Levant Basin on the Mediterranean Sea, which includes coastal regions of Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, is estimated to have of oil. Gaza is the only coastal part of the State of Palestine. In 2000, exploration license were granted by the government to British Gas Group. However, the project was interrupted during the 2000\u20132005 uprisings, where supportive infrastructure, the seaport and airport was destroyed by Israel. In 2023, the work gain momentum again, until it was crashed in the ongoing war. A large number of people used to believe that, Gaza's oil and gas reserves is the reason for Israel's offensive on the territory, also described as a potential genocidal campaign.\nCulture.\nCultural centers and museums.\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.\nEstablished in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children's cultural center with the objectives of promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village.\nThe Gaza Theater, financed by contributions from Norway, opened in 2004. The theater does not receive much funding from the PNA, depending mostly on donations from foreign aid agencies. The A. M. Qattan Foundation, a Palestinian arts charity, runs several workshops in Gaza to develop young artistic talent and impart drama skills to teachers. The Gaza Theater Festival was inaugurated in 2005.\nThe Gaza Museum of Archaeology opened in the summer of 2008. The museum collection features thousands of items, including a statue of a full-breasted Aphrodite in a diaphanous gown, images of other ancient deities and oil lamps featuring menorahs.\nCuisine.\nGaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played a role in many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as \"saliq wa adas\" (\"chard and lentils\") and \"bisara\" (fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).\nSeafood is a key aspect of Gaza life and a local staple, Some well-known seafood dishes include \"zibdiyit gambari\", literally, \"shrimps in a clay pot\", and \"shatta\" which are crabs stuffed with red hot chili pepper dip, then baked in the oven. Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, chillies and cumin, and marinated with various spices. It is also a key ingredient in \"sayyadiya\", rice cooked with caramelized onions, a generous amount of whole garlic cloves, large chunks of well-marinated fried fish, and spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin. Many of the 1948-era refugees were \"fellahin\" (\"peasants\") who ate seasonal foods. \"Sumaghiyyeh\", popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round, is a mixture of sumac, tahina and water combined with chard, chunks of beef and chickpeas. The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds, chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls. \"Maftool\" is a wheat-based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup.\nMost Gaza restaurants are located in the Rimal district. Al-Andalus, which specializes in fish and seafood, is popular with tourists, as are al-Sammak and the upscale Roots Club. Atfaluna is a stylish restaurant near Gaza port run and staffed by deaf people with the goal of building a society that is more accepting of people with disabilities.\nThroughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans, hummus, roasted sweet potatoes, falafel, and kebabs. Coffee houses (\"qahwa\") serve Arabic coffee and tea. Gaza's well-known sweet shops, Saqqala and Arafat, sell common Arab sweet products and are located off Wehda Street. Alcohol is a rarity, found only in the United Nations Beach Club.\nCostumes and embroidery.\nGauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza \"thob\" was often woven at nearby Majdal. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. \"Thobs\" here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (\"muqass\"), combs (\"mushut\") and triangles (\"hijab\") often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.\nCirca 1990, Hamas and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the \"hijab\" (\"headscarf\") among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the \"hijab\" styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.\nSports.\nPalestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).\nGovernance.\nToday, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate. It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.\nThe first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza's first hospital, several new mosques and schools, the restoration of the Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.\nOn 24 July 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza the first city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian municipal elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won the majority of seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes between the two parties that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.\nNormally, Palestinian municipalities with populations over 20,000 and that serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members, including the mayor. The current municipal council of Gaza, however, consists of fourteen members, including the installed by Hamas mayor, Nizar Hijazi.\nEducation.\nAccording to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school). About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.\nIn 2006, there were 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 students were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed that there was a nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology or science labs, and extra curricular activities.\nUniversities.\nGaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University \u2013 Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992. Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006\u201307, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.\nPublic library.\nThe Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about , the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkirk, and the World Bank. The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.\nOn 27 November 2023, the Public Library was destroyed by Israeli airstrike.\nLandmarks.\nLandmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip. In 2023, at the beginning of the Gaza war, it was destroyed by the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.\nOther mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk-era Sayed al-Hashim Mosque that believed to house the tomb of the Islamic prophet Mohammed's great-grandfather, Hashim ibn Abd al-Manaf, in its dome. The building was damaged by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023, during the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip. There is also the nearby Kateb al-Welaya Mosque that dates back to 1334. In Shuja'iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque, which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque, which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.\nThe Unknown Soldier's Square, located in Rimal, is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War. In 1967, the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand, until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway.\nQasr al-Basha, originally a Mamluk-era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza, is located in the Old City and is today a girls' school. It was destroyed in the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2024.\nThe Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery, often referred to as the British War Cemetery, contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I; it sits northeast of the city center, in the Tuffah district, near Salah al-Din Road. The cemetery has been damaged by Israeli army in the early stages of the Gaza war in 2023.\nThe Church of Saint Porphyrius, a Greek Orthodox church, oldest active church in the city and the third oldest church in the world. On 19 October 2023, part of the church was damaged during an Israeli airstrike, killing at least 18 civilians of the 450 Christian and Muslim Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip that had been sheltering there.\nInfrastructure.\nWater supply and sanitation.\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system. About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit. The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20\u00a0million liters of raw sewage and 40\u00a0million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.\nAs a \"water-poor\" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.\nPower grid.\nIn 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza.\nSolid waste management.\nSolid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.\nFor instance, the scale of damage resulting from Operation Protective Edge was unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2\u00a0million tonnes of debris was generated. Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds. In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed Gaza City\u2019s main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.\nHealth care.\nAl-Shifa Hospital (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.\nThroughout the late 1950s, a new health administration, Bandar Gaza (\"Gaza Region\"), was established and headed by Haidar Abdel-Shafi. Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential curative care.\nThe Ahli Arab Hospital, founded in 1907 by the Church Missionary Society (CMS), was destroyed in World War I. It was rebuilt after the war by the CMS, and in 1955 became the Southern Baptist Hospital. In 1982, the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem took leadership and the original name was restored. Al-Quds Hospital, located in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and managed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, is the second largest hospital in Gaza.\nIn 2007, hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8\u201312 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89.3% in January 2007 to 64.3% in December 2007.\nIn 2010, a team of doctors from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.\nAl-Rantisi Hospital provides care for children.\nTransportation.\nThe Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south. The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north. The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.\nOmar Mukhtar Street is the main road in the city running north\u2013south, branching off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.\nThe Yasser Arafat International Airport near Rafah opened in 1998 south of Gaza. Its runways and facilities were damaged by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2001 and 2002, rendering the airport unusable. In 2010, the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials. The Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel is located roughly northeast of the city.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nGaza is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55395", "revid": "8789570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55395", "title": "History of operating systems", "text": "Aspect of computing history\nComputer operating systems (OSes) provide a set of functions needed and used by most application programs on a computer, and the links needed to control and synchronize computer hardware. On the first computers, with no operating system, every program needed the full hardware specification to run correctly and perform standard tasks, and its own drivers for peripheral devices like printers and punched paper card readers. The growing complexity of hardware and application programs eventually made operating systems a necessity for everyday use.\nBackground.\nEarly computers lacked any form of operating system. Instead, the user, also called the operator, had sole use of the machine for a scheduled period of time. The operator would arrive at the computer with program and data which needed to be loaded into the machine before the program could be run. Loading of program and data was accomplished in various ways including toggle switches, punched paper cards and magnetic or paper tape. Once loaded, the machine would be set to execute the single program until that program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a control panel using dials, toggle switches and panel lights, making it a very manual and error-prone process.\nSymbolic languages, assemblers, compilers were developed for programmers to translate symbolic program code into machine code that previously would have been hand-encoded. Later machines came with libraries of support code on punched cards or magnetic tape, which would be linked to the user's program to assist in operations such as input and output. This was the genesis of the modern-day operating system; however, machines still ran a single program or job at a time. At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a string from which tapes attached to corresponding job tickets were hung with stationery pegs.\nAs machines became more powerful the time to run programs diminished, and the time to hand off the equipment to the next user became large by comparison. Accounting for and paying for machine usage moved on from checking the wall clock to automatic logging by the computer. Run queues evolved from a literal queue of people at the door, to a heap of media on a jobs-waiting table, or batches of punched cards stacked one on top of the other in the reader, until the machine itself was able to select and sequence which magnetic tape drives processed which tapes. Where program developers had originally had access to run their own jobs on the machine, they were supplanted by dedicated machine operators who looked after the machine and were less and less concerned with implementing tasks manually. When commercially available computer centers were faced with the implications of data lost through tampering or operational errors, equipment vendors were put under pressure to enhance the runtime libraries to prevent misuse of system resources. Automated monitoring was needed not just for CPU usage but for counting pages printed, cards punched, cards read, disk storage used and for signaling when operator intervention was required by jobs such as changing magnetic tapes and paper forms. Security features were added to operating systems to record audit trails of which programs were accessing which files and to prevent access to a production payroll file by an engineering program, for example.\nAll these features were building up towards the repertoire of a fully capable operating system. Eventually the runtime libraries became an amalgamated program that was started before the first customer job and could read in the customer job, control its execution, record its usage, reassign hardware resources after the job ended, and immediately go on to process the next job. These resident background programs, capable of managing multi step processes, were often called monitors or monitor-programs before the term \"operating system\" established itself.\nAn underlying program offering basic hardware management, software scheduling and resource monitoring may seem a remote ancestor to the user-oriented OSes of the personal computing era. But there has been a shift in the meaning of OS. Just as early automobiles lacked speedometers, radios, and air conditioners which later became standard, more and more optional software features became standard in every OS package. This has led to the perception of an OS as a complete user system with an integrated graphical user interface, utilities, and some applications such as file managers, text editors, and configuration tools.\nThe true descendant of the early operating systems is what is now called the \"kernel\". In technical and development circles the old restricted sense of an OS persists because of the continued active development of embedded operating systems for all kinds of devices with a data-processing component, from hand-held gadgets up to industrial robots and real-time control systems, which do not run user applications at the front end. An embedded OS in a device today is not so far removed as one might think from its ancestor of the 1950s.\nThe broader categories of systems and application software are discussed in the computer software article.\nMainframes.\nThe first operating system used for real work was GM-NAA I/O, produced in 1956 by General Motors' Research division for its IBM 704. Most other early operating systems for IBM mainframes were also produced by customers.\nEarly operating systems were very diverse, with each vendor or customer producing one or more operating systems specific to their particular mainframe computer. Every operating system, even from the same vendor, could have radically different models of commands, operating procedures, and such facilities as debugging aids. Typically, each time the manufacturer brought out a new machine, there would be a new operating system, and most applications would have to be manually adjusted, recompiled, and retested.\nSystems on IBM hardware.\nBuilding on customer experience and requirements, IBM took on a more active role in developing operating systems for the 709, 1410, 7010, 7040, 7044, 7090 and 7094. IBM also collaborated with universities.\nThe state of affairs continued until the mid 1960s when IBM, already a leading hardware vendor, stopped work on existing systems and put all its effort into developing the System/360 series of machines, all of which used the \"same\" instruction and input/output architecture. IBM intended to develop a single operating system for the new hardware, the OS/360. The problems encountered in the development of the OS/360 are legendary, and are described by Fred Brooks in \"The Mythical Man-Month\"\u2014a book that has become a classic of software engineering. Because of performance differences across the hardware range and delays with software development, a whole family of operating systems was introduced instead of a single OS/360.\nIBM wound up releasing a series of stop-gaps followed by two longer-lived operating systems:\nIBM maintained full compatibility with the past, so that programs developed in the sixties can still run under z/VSE (if developed for DOS/360) or z/OS (if developed for MFT or MVT) with no change.\nIBM also developed TSS/360, a time-sharing system for the System/360 Model 67. Overcompensating for their perceived importance of developing a timeshare system, they set hundreds of developers to work on the project. Early releases of TSS were slow and unreliable; by the time TSS had acceptable performance and reliability, IBM wanted its TSS users to migrate to OS/360 and OS/VS2; while IBM offered a TSS/370 PRPQ, they dropped it after 3 releases.\nSeveral operating systems for the IBM S/360 and S/370 architectures were developed by third parties, including the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) and MUSIC/SP.\nOther mainframe operating systems.\nControl Data Corporation developed the SCOPE operating systems in the 1960s, for batch processing and later developed the MACE operating system for time sharing, which was the basis for the later Kronos. In cooperation with the University of Minnesota, the Kronos and later the NOS operating systems were developed during the 1970s, which supported simultaneous batch and time sharing use. Like many commercial time sharing systems, its interface was an extension of the DTSS time sharing system, one of the pioneering efforts in timesharing and programming languages.\nIn the late 1970s, Control Data and the University of Illinois developed the PLATO system, which used plasma panel displays and long-distance time sharing networks. PLATO was remarkably innovative for its time; the shared memory model of PLATO's TUTOR programming language allowed applications such as real-time chat and multi-user graphical games.\nFor the UNIVAC 1107, UNIVAC, the first commercial computer manufacturer, produced the EXEC I operating system, and Computer Sciences Corporation developed the EXEC II operating system and delivered it to UNIVAC. EXEC II was ported to the UNIVAC 1108. Later, UNIVAC developed the EXEC 8 operating system for the 1108; it was the basis for operating systems for later members of the family. Like all early mainframe systems, EXEC I and EXEC II were a batch-oriented system that managed magnetic drums, disks, card readers and line printers; EXEC 8 supported both batch processing and on-line transaction processing. In the 1970s, UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic (RTB) system to support large-scale time sharing, also patterned after the Dartmouth BASIC system.\nBurroughs Corporation introduced the B5000 in 1961 with the MCP (Master Control Program) operating system. The B5000 was a stack machine designed to exclusively support high-level languages, with no software, not even at the lowest level of the operating system, being written directly in machine language or assembly language; the MCP was the first OS to be written entirely in a high-level language - ESPOL, a dialect of ALGOL 60 - although ESPOL had specialized statements for each \"syllable\" in the B5000 instruction set. MCP also introduced many other ground-breaking innovations, such as being one of the first commercial implementations of virtual memory. The rewrite of MCP for the B6500 is now marketed as the Unisys ClearPath/MCP.\nGE introduced the GE-600 series with the General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor (GECOS) operating system in 1962. After Honeywell acquired GE's computer business, it was renamed to General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS). Honeywell expanded the use of the GCOS name to cover all its operating systems in the 1970s, though many of its computers had nothing in common with the earlier GE 600 series and their operating systems were not derived from the original GECOS.\nProject MAC at MIT, working with GE and Bell Labs, developed Multics, which introduced the concept of ringed security privilege levels.\nDigital Equipment Corporation developed TOPS-10 for its PDP-10 line of 36-bit computers in 1967. Before the widespread use of Unix, TOPS-10 was a particularly popular system in universities, and in the early ARPANET community. Bolt, Beranek, and Newman developed TENEX for a modified PDP-10 that supported demand paging; this was another popular system in the research and ARPANET communities, and was later developed by DEC into TOPS-20.\nScientific Data Systems/Xerox Data Systems developed several operating systems for the Sigma series of computers, such as the Basic Control Monitor (BCM), Batch Processing Monitor (BPM), and Basic Time-Sharing Monitor (BTM). Later, BPM and BTM were succeeded by the Universal Time-Sharing System (UTS); it was designed to provide multi-programming services for online (interactive) user programs in addition to batch-mode production jobs, It was succeeded by the CP-V operating system, which combined UTS with the heavily batch-oriented Xerox Operating System.\nMinicomputers.\nDigital Equipment Corporation created several operating systems for its 16-bit PDP-11 machines, including the simple RT-11 system, the time-sharing RSTS operating systems, and the RSX-11 family of real-time operating systems, as well as the VMS system for the 32-bit VAX machines.\nSeveral competitors of Digital Equipment Corporation such as Data General, Hewlett-Packard, and Computer Automation created their own operating systems. One such, \"MAX III\", was developed for Modular Computer Systems Modcomp II and Modcomp III computers. It was characterised by its target market being the industrial control market. The Fortran libraries included one that enabled access to measurement and control devices.\nIBM's key innovation in operating systems in this class (which they call \"mid-range\"), was their \"CPF\" for the System/38. This had capability-based addressing, used a machine interface architecture to isolate the application software and most of the operating system from hardware dependencies (including even such details as address size and register size) and included an integrated RDBMS. The succeeding OS/400 (now known as IBM i) for the IBM AS/400 and later IBM Power Systems has no files, only objects of different types and these objects persist in very large, flat virtual memory, called a single-level store.\nThe Unix operating system was developed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s, originally for the PDP-7, and later for the PDP-11. Because it was essentially free in early editions, easily obtainable, and easily modified, it achieved wide acceptance. It also became a requirement within the Bell systems operating companies. Since it was written in the C language, when that language was ported to a new machine architecture, Unix was also able to be ported. This portability permitted it to become the choice for a second generation of minicomputers and the first generation of workstations, and its use became widespread. Unix exemplified the idea of an operating system that was conceptually the same across various hardware platforms. Because of its utility, it inspired many and later became one of the roots of the free software movement and open-source software. Numerous operating systems were based upon it including Minix, GNU/Linux, and the Berkeley Software Distribution. Apple's macOS is also based on Unix via NeXTSTEP and FreeBSD.\nThe Pick operating system was another operating system available on a wide variety of hardware brands. Commercially released in 1973 its core was a BASIC-like language called Data/BASIC and a SQL-style database manipulation language called ENGLISH. Licensed to a large variety of manufacturers and vendors, by the early 1980s observers saw the Pick operating system as a strong competitor to Unix.\nMicrocomputers.\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, a new class of small computers came onto the marketplace. Featuring 8-bit processors, typically the MOS Technology 6502, Intel 8080, Motorola 6800 or the Zilog Z80, along with rudimentary input and output interfaces and as much RAM as practical, these systems started out as kit-based hobbyist computers but soon evolved into an essential business tool.\nHome computers.\nWhile many eight-bit home computers of the 1980s, such as the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum series and others could load a third-party disk-loading operating system, such as CP/M or GEOS, they were generally used without one. Their built-in operating systems were designed in an era when floppy disk drives were very expensive and not expected to be used by most users, so the standard storage device on most was a tape drive using standard compact cassettes. Most, if not all, of these computers shipped with a built-in BASIC interpreter on ROM, which also served as a crude command-line interface, allowing the user to load a separate disk operating system to perform file management commands and load and save to disk. The most popular home computer, the Commodore 64, was a notable exception, as its DOS was on ROM in the disk drive hardware, and the drive was addressed identically to printers, modems, and other external devices.\nFurthermore, those systems shipped with minimal amounts of computer memory\u20144-8 kilobytes was standard on early home computers\u2014as well as 8-bit processors without specialized support circuitry like an MMU or even a dedicated real-time clock. On this hardware, a complex operating system's overhead supporting multiple tasks and users would likely compromise the performance of the machine without really being needed. As those systems were largely sold complete, with a fixed hardware configuration, there was also no need for an operating system to provide drivers for a wide range of hardware to abstract away differences.\nVideo games and even the available spreadsheet, database and word processors for home computers were mostly self-contained programs that took over the machine completely. Although integrated software existed for these computers, they usually lacked features compared to their standalone equivalents, largely due to memory limitations. Data exchange was mostly performed through standard formats like ASCII text or CSV, or through specialized file conversion programs.\nOperating systems in video games and consoles.\nSince virtually all video game consoles and arcade cabinets designed and built after 1980 were true digital machines based on microprocessors (unlike the earlier \"Pong\" clones and derivatives), some of them carried a minimal form of BIOS or built-in game, such as the ColecoVision, the Sega Master System and the SNK Neo Geo.\nModern-day game consoles and videogames, starting with the PC-Engine, all have a minimal BIOS that also provides some interactive utilities such as memory card management, audio or video CD playback, copy protection and sometimes carry libraries for developers to use etc. Few of these cases, however, would qualify as a true operating system.\nThe most notable exceptions are probably the Dreamcast game console which includes a minimal BIOS, like the PlayStation, but can load the Windows CE operating system from the game disk allowing easily porting of games from the PC world, and the Xbox game console, which is little more than a disguised Intel-based PC running a secret, modified version of Microsoft Windows in the background. Furthermore, there are Linux versions that will run on a Dreamcast and later game consoles as well.\nLong before that, Sony had released a kind of development kit called the Net Yaroze for its first PlayStation platform, which provided a series of programming and developing tools to be used with a normal PC and a specially modified \"Black PlayStation\" that could be interfaced with a PC and download programs from it. These operations require in general a functional OS on both platforms involved.\nIn general, it can be said that videogame consoles and arcade coin-operated machines used at most a built-in BIOS during the 1970s, 1980s and most of the 1990s, while from the PlayStation era and beyond they started getting more and more sophisticated, to the point of requiring a generic or custom-built OS for aiding in development and expandability.\nPersonal computer era.\nThe development of microprocessors made inexpensive computing available for the small business and hobbyist, which in turn led to the widespread use of interchangeable hardware components using a common interconnection (such as the S-100, SS-50, Apple II, ISA, and PCI buses), and an increasing need for \"standard\" operating systems to control them. The most important of the early OSes on these machines was Digital Research's CP/M-80 for the 8080 / 8085 / Z80 CPUs. It was based on several Digital Equipment Corporation operating systems, mostly for the PDP-11 architecture. Microsoft's first operating system, MDOS/MIDAS, was designed along many of the PDP-11 features, but for microprocessor based systems. MS-DOS, or PC DOS when supplied by IBM, was designed to be similar to CP/M-80. Each of these machines had a small boot program in ROM which loaded the OS itself from disk. The BIOS on the IBM-PC class machines was an extension of this idea and has accreted more features and functions in the 20 years since the first IBM-PC was introduced in 1981.\nThe decreasing cost of display equipment and processors made it practical to provide graphical user interfaces for many operating systems, such as the generic X Window System that is provided with many Unix systems, or other graphical systems such as Apple's classic Mac OS and macOS, the Radio Shack Color Computer's OS-9 Level II/Multi-Vue, Commodore's AmigaOS, Atari TOS, IBM's OS/2, and Microsoft Windows. The original GUI was developed on the Xerox Alto computer system at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970s and commercialized by many vendors throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\nSince the late 1990s, there have been three operating systems in widespread use on personal computers: Apple Inc.'s macOS, the open source Linux, and Microsoft Windows. Since 2005 and the Mac transition to Intel processors, all have been developed mainly on the x86 platform, although macOS retained PowerPC support until 2009 and Linux remains ported to a multitude of architectures including ones such as 68k, PA-RISC, and DEC Alpha, which have been long superseded and out of production, and SPARC and MIPS, which are used in servers or embedded systems but no longer for desktop computers. Other operating systems such as AmigaOS and OS/2 remain in use, if at all, mainly by retrocomputing enthusiasts or for specialized embedded applications.\nMobile operating systems.\nIn the early 1990s, Psion released the Psion Series 3 PDA, a small mobile computing device. It supported user-written applications running on an operating system called EPOC. Later versions of EPOC became Symbian, an operating system used for mobile phones from Nokia, Ericsson, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, Samsung and phones developed for NTT Docomo by Sharp, Fujitsu &amp; Mitsubishi. Symbian was the world's most widely used smartphone operating system until 2010 with a peak market share of 74% in 2006. In 1996, Palm Computing released the Pilot 1000 and Pilot 5000, running Palm OS. Microsoft Windows CE was the base for Pocket PC 2000, renamed Windows Mobile in 2003, which at its peak in 2007 was the most common operating system for smartphones in the U.S.\nIn 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone and its operating system, known as simply iPhone OS (until the release of iOS 4), which, like Mac OS X, is based on the Unix-like Darwin. In addition to these underpinnings, it also introduced a powerful and innovative graphic user interface that was later also used on the tablet computer iPad. A year later, Android, with its own graphical user interface, was introduced, based on a modified Linux kernel, and Microsoft re-entered the mobile operating system market with Windows Phone in 2010, which was replaced by Windows 10 Mobile in 2015.\nIn addition to these, a wide range of other mobile operating systems are contending in this area.\nRise of virtualization.\nOperating systems originally ran directly on the hardware itself and provided services to applications, but with virtualization, the operating system itself runs under the control of a hypervisor, instead of being in direct control of the hardware.\nOn mainframes IBM introduced the notion of a virtual machine in 1968 with CP/CMS on the IBM System/360 Model 67, and extended this later in 1972 with Virtual Machine Facility/370 (VM/370) on System/370.\nOn x86-based personal computers, VMware popularized this technology with their 1999 product, VMware Workstation, and their 2001 VMware GSX Server and VMware ESX Server products. Later, a wide range of products from others, including Xen, KVM and Hyper-V meant that by 2010 it was reported that more than 80 percent of enterprises had a virtualization program or project in place, and that 25 percent of all server workloads would be in a virtual machine.\nOver time, the line between virtual machines, monitors, and operating systems was blurred:\nIn many ways, virtual machine software today plays the role formerly held by the operating system, including managing the hardware resources (processor, memory, I/O devices), applying scheduling policies, or allowing system administrators to manage the system.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The interplanetary collision that created the Moon occurred early in this eon. The Hadean eon was succeeded by the Archean eon, with the Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesized to have occurred at the Hadean-Archean boundary.\nHadean rocks are very rare, largely consisting of granular zircons from one locality (Jack Hills) in Western Australia. Hadean geophysical models remain controversial among geologists: plate tectonics and the growth of cratons into continents may have started in the Hadean, but there is still uncertainty.\nEarth in the early Hadean had a very thick hydride-rich atmosphere whose composition likely resembled the solar nebula and the gas giants, with mostly water vapor, methane and ammonia. As the Earth's surface cooled, vaporized atmospheric water condensed into liquid water and eventually a superocean covering nearly all of the planet was formed, turning Earth into an ocean planet. Volcanic outgassing and asteroid bombardments further altered the Hadean atmosphere eventually into the nitrogen- and carbon dioxide-rich, weakly reducing Paleoarchean atmosphere.\nEtymology.\nThe eon's name \"Hadean\" comes from Hades, the Greek god of the underworld (whose name is also used to describe the underworld itself), referring to the hellish conditions then prevailing on early Earth: the planet had just been formed from recent accretion, and its surface was still molten with superheated lava due to that, the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements, and frequent impact events with other Solar System bodies.\nThe term was coined by American geologist Preston Cloud, originally to label the period before the earliest known rocks on Earth. W.B. Harland later coined an almost synonymous term, the Priscoan period, from \"priscus\", a Latin word for 'ancient'. Other, older texts refer to the eon as the Pre-Archean.\nRock dating.\nPrior to the 1980s and the discovery of Hadean lithic fragments, scientific narratives of the early Earth explanations were almost entirely in the hands of geodynamic modelers.\nIn the last decades of the 20th century, geologists identified a few Hadean rocks from western Greenland, northwestern Canada, and Western Australia. In 2015, traces of carbon minerals interpreted as \"remains of biotic life\" were found in 4.1-billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.\nThe oldest dated zircon crystals, enclosed in a metamorphosed sandstone conglomerate in the Jack Hills of the Narryer Gneiss terrane of Western Australia, date to 4.404 \u00b1 0.008 Ga. This zircon is a slight outlier, with the oldest consistently dated zircon falling closer to 4.35 Ga\u2014around 200 million years after the hypothesized time of Earth's formation.\nIn many other areas, xenocryst (or relict) Hadean zircons enclosed in older rocks indicate that younger rocks have formed on older terranes and have incorporated some of the older material. One example occurs in the Guiana shield from the Iwokrama Formation of southern Guyana where zircon cores have been dated at 4.22 Ga.\nAtmosphere.\nA sizable quantity of water would have been in the material that formed Earth. Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when the planet was less massive during its formation. Photodissociation by short-wave ultraviolet in sunlight could split surface water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen, the former of which would readily react to form compounds in the then-reducing atmosphere, while the latter (along with the similarly light helium) would be expected to continually leave the atmosphere (as it does to the present day) due to atmospheric escape.\nPart of the ancient planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the impact that created the Moon, which should have caused the melting of one or two large regions of Earth. Earth's present composition suggests that there was not complete remelting as it is difficult to completely melt and mix huge rock masses. However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact. The material would have condensed within 2,000 years. The initial magma ocean solidified within 5 million years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy CO2 atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor. The initial heavy atmosphere had a surface temperature of and an atmospheric pressure of above 27 standard atmospheres.\nOceans.\nStudies of zircons have found that liquid water may have existed between 4.0 and 4.4 Ga, very soon after the formation of Earth. Liquid water oceans existed despite the high surface temperature, because at an atmospheric pressure of 27 atmospheres, water remains liquid.\nThe most likely source of the water in the Hadean ocean was outgassing from the Earth's mantle. Bombardment origin of a substantial amount of water is unlikely, due to the incompatibility of isotope fractions between the Earth and comets.\nAsteroid impacts during the Hadean and into the Archean would have periodically disrupted the ocean. The geological record from 3.2 Ga contains evidence of multiple impacts of objects up to in diameter. Each such impact would have boiled off up to of a global ocean, and temporarily raised the atmospheric temperature to . However, the frequency of meteorite impacts is still under study: the Earth may have gone through long periods when liquid oceans and life were possible.\nThe liquid water would absorb the carbon dioxide in the early atmosphere; this would not be enough by itself to substantially reduce the amount of CO2.\nPlate tectonics.\nA 2008 study of zircons found that Australian Hadean rock contains minerals pointing to the existence of plate tectonics as early as 4 Ga (approximately 600 million years after Earth's formation). However, some geologists suggest that the zircons could have been formed by meteorite impacts. The direct evidence of Hadean geology from zircons is limited, because the zircons are largely gathered in one locality in Australia. Geophysical models are underconstrained, but can paint a general picture of the state of Earth in the Hadean.\nMantle convection in the Hadean was likely vigorous, due to lower viscosity. The lower viscosity was due to the high levels of radiogenic heat and the fact that water in the mantle had not yet fully outgassed. Whether the vigorous convection led to plate tectonics in the Hadean or was confined under a rigid lid is still a matter of debate. The presence of Hadean oceans is thought to have triggered plate tectonics.\nSubduction due to plate tectonics would have removed carbonate from the early oceans, contributing to the removal of the CO2-rich early atmosphere. Removal of this early atmosphere is evidence of Hadean plate tectonics.\nIf plate tectonics occurred in the Hadean, it would have formed continental crust. Different models predict different amounts of continental crust during the Hadean. The work of Dhiume \"et al.\" predicts that by the end of the Hadean, the continental crust had only 25% of today's area. The models of Korenaga, \"et al.\" predict that the continental crust grew to present-day volume sometime between 4.2 and 4.0 Ga.\nContinents.\nThe amount of exposed land in the Hadean is only loosely dependent on the amount of continental crust: it also depends on the ocean level. In models where plate tectonics started in the Archean, Earth has a global ocean in the Hadean. The high heat of the mantle may have made it difficult to support high elevations in the Hadean. If continents did form in the Hadean, their growth competed with outgassing of water from the mantle. Continents may have appeared in the mid-Hadean, and then disappeared under a thick ocean by the end of the Hadean. The limited amount of land has implications for the origin of life.\nPossible life.\nAbundant Hadean-like geothermal microenvironments were shown by Salditt \"et al.\" to have the potential to support the synthesis and replication of RNA and thus possibly the evolution of a primitive life form. Porous rock systems comprising heated air-water interfaces were shown to allow ribozyme-catalyzed RNA replication of sense and antisense strands followed by subsequent strand dissociation, thus enabling combined synthesis, release and folding of active ribozymes. \nA study published in 2024 inferred the last common ancestor of all current life to have emerged during the Hadean, between 4.09 and 4.33 Ga.\nAlthough the early part of the Late Heavy Bombardment happened during the Hadean, the impacts were frequent only on a cosmic scale, with thousands or even millions of years between each event. As Earth already had oceans, life would have been possible, but vulnerable to extinction events caused by those impacts. The risk would not be on the frequency, but on the size of the impactor, and remains on the Moon suggest impactors bigger than the Chicxulub impactor that caused the extinction of dinosaurs. An impactor big enough may erase all life on the planet, although some models suggest that microscopic life may still survive if underground or in the oceanic depths.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Modern descriptive linguistics is based on a structural approach to language, as exemplified in the work of Leonard Bloomfield and others. This type of linguistics utilizes different methods in order to describe a language such as basic data collection, and different types of elicitation methods.\nDescriptive versus prescriptive linguistics.\nLinguistic description, as used in academic and professional linguistics, is often contrasted with linguistic prescription, which is found especially in general education, language arts instruction, and the publishing industry.\nAs English-linguist Larry Andrews describes it, descriptive grammar is the linguistic approach which studies what a language is like, as opposed to prescriptive, which declares what a language should be like. In other words, descriptive grammarians focus analysis on how all kinds of people in all sorts of environments, usually in more casual, everyday settings, communicate, whereas prescriptive grammarians focus on the grammatical rules and structures predetermined by linguistic registers and figures of power. Andrews also believes that, although most linguists would be descriptive grammarians, most public school teachers tend to be prescriptive. \nWebster's Third New International Dictionary was the subject of controversy over its use of linguistic description. It included words, pronunciations, and meanings that previous dictionaries would omit. It also labeled words such as ain't as \"nonstandard,\" while older, prescriptive dictionaries may use terms such as \"improper,\" \"incorrect,\" or even \"illiterate.\" This descriptive approach, while common in sociolinguistics, was seen as overly permissive by many who felt dictionaries ought to approach language prescriptively.\nHistory of the discipline.\nThe earliest known descriptive linguistic work took place in a Sanskrit community in northern India; the most well-known scholar of that linguistic tradition was P\u0101\u1e47ini, whose works are commonly dated to around the \u00a0BCE. Philological traditions later arose around the description of Greek, Latin, Chinese, Tamil, Hebrew, and Arabic. The description of modern European languages did not begin before the Renaissance \u2013 e.g. Spanish in 1492, French in 1532, English in 1586; the same period saw the first grammatical descriptions of Nahuatl (1547) or Quechua (1560) in the New World, followed by numerous others.\nEven though more and more languages were discovered, the full diversity of language was not yet fully recognized. For centuries, language descriptions tended to use grammatical categories that existed for languages considered to be more prestigious, like Latin.\nLinguistic description as a discipline really took off at the end of the 19th century, with the Structuralist revolution (from Ferdinand de Saussure to Leonard Bloomfield), and the notion that every language forms a unique symbolic system, different from other languages, worthy of being described \u201cin its own terms\u201d.\nMethods.\nThe first critical step of language description is to collect data. To do this, a researcher does fieldwork in a speech community of their choice, and they record samples from different speakers. The data they collect often comes from different kind of speech genres that include narratives, daily conversations, poetry, songs and many others. While speech that comes naturally is preferred, researchers use elicitation, by asking speakers for translations, grammar rules, pronunciation, or by testing sentences using substitution frames. Substitution frames are pre-made sentences put together by the researcher that are like fill in the blanks. They do this with nouns and verbs to see how the structure of the sentence might change or how the noun and verb might change in structure.\nThere are different types of elicitation used in the fieldwork for linguistic description. These include schedule controlled elicitation, and analysis controlled elicitation, each with their own sub branches. Schedule controlled elicitation is when the researcher has a questionnaire of material to elicit to individuals and asks the questions in a certain order according to a schedule. These types of schedules and questionnaires usually focus on language families, and are typically flexible and are able to be changed if need be. The other type of elicitation is analysis controlled elicitation which is elicitation that is not under a schedule. The analysis of the language here in fact controls the elicitation. There are many sub types of analysis controlled elicitation, such as target language interrogation elicitation, stimulus driven elicitation, and many other types of elicitation. Target language interrogation elicitation is when the researcher asks individuals questions in the target language, and the researcher records all the different answers from all the individuals and compares them. Stimulus driven elicitation is when a researcher provides pictures, objects or video clips to the language speakers and asks them to describe the items presented to them. These types of elicitation help the researcher build a vocabulary, and basic grammatical structures.\nThis process is long and tedious and spans over several years. This long process ends with a corpus, which is a body of reference materials, that can be used to test hypothesis regarding the language in question.\nChallenges.\nAlmost all linguistic theory has its origin in practical problems of descriptive linguistics. Phonology (and its theoretical developments, such as the phoneme) deals with the function and interpretation of sound in language. Syntax has developed to describe how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. Lexicology collects words as well as their derivations and transformations: it has not given rise to much generalized theory.\nLinguistics description might aim to achieve one or more of the following goals:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They can be up to several hundred meters in thickness and extend laterally for several hundred kilometers. Almost all of these formations are of Precambrian age and are thought to record the oxygenation of the Earth's oceans. Some of the Earth's oldest rock formations, which formed about https://\u00a0million years ago (Ma), are associated with banded iron formations.\nBanded iron formations are thought to have formed in sea water as the result of oxygen production by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. The oxygen combined with dissolved iron in Earth's oceans to form insoluble iron oxides, which precipitated out, forming a thin layer on the ocean floor. Each band is similar to a varve, resulting from cyclic variations in oxygen production.\nBanded iron formations were first discovered in northern Michigan in 1844. Banded iron formations account for more than 60% of global iron reserves and provide most of the iron ore presently mined . Most formations can be found in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, and the United States.\nDescription.\nA typical banded iron formation consists of repeated, thin layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides, either magnetite (Fe3O4) or hematite (Fe2O3), alternating with bands of iron-poor chert, often red in color, of similar thickness. A single banded iron formation can be up to several hundred meters in thickness and extend laterally for several hundred kilometers.\nBanded iron formation is more precisely defined as chemically precipitated sedimentary rock containing greater than 15% iron. However, most BIFs have a higher content of iron, typically around 30% by mass, so that roughly half the rock is iron oxides and the other half is silica. The iron in BIFs is divided roughly equally between the more oxidized ferric form, Fe(III), and the more reduced ferrous form, Fe(II), so that the ratio Fe(III)/Fe(II+III) typically varies from 0.3 to 0.6. This indicates a predominance of magnetite, in which the ratio is 0.67, over hematite, for which the ratio is 1. In addition to the iron oxides (hematite and magnetite), the iron sediment may contain the iron-rich carbonates siderite and ankerite, or the iron-rich silicates minnesotaite and greenalite. Most BIFs are chemically simple, containing little but iron oxides, silica, and minor carbonate, though some contain significant calcium and magnesium, up to 9% and 6.7% as oxides respectively.\nWhen used in the singular, the term banded iron formation refers to the sedimentary lithology just described. The plural form, banded iron formations, is used informally to refer to stratigraphic units that consist primarily of banded iron formation.\nA well-preserved banded iron formation typically consists of \"macrobands\" several meters thick that are separated by thin shale beds. The macrobands in turn are composed of characteristic alternating layers of chert and iron oxides, called \"mesobands\", that are several millimeters to a few centimeters thick. Many of the chert mesobands contain \"microbands\" of iron oxides that are less than a millimeter thick, while the iron mesobands are relatively featureless. BIFs tend to be extremely hard, tough, and dense, making them highly resistant to erosion, and they show fine details of stratification over great distances, suggesting they were deposited in a very low-energy environment; that is, in relatively deep water, undisturbed by wave motion or currents. BIFs only rarely interfinger with other rock types, tending to form sharply bounded discrete units that never grade laterally into other rock types.\nBanded iron formations of the Great Lakes region and the Frere Formation of western Australia are somewhat different in character and are sometimes described as \"granular iron formations\" or \"GIFs\". Their iron sediments are granular to oolitic in character, forming discrete grains about a millimeter in diameter, and they lack microbanding in their chert mesobands. They also show more irregular mesobanding, with indications of ripples and other sedimentary structures, and their mesobands cannot be traced out any great distance. Though they form well-defined, discrete units, these are commonly interbedded with coarse to medium-grained epiclastic sediments (sediments formed by weathering of rock). These features suggest a higher energy depositional environment, in shallower water disturbed by wave motions. However, they otherwise resemble other banded iron formations.\nThe great majority of banded iron formations are Archean or Paleoproterozoic in age. However, a small number of BIFs are Neoproterozoic in age, and are frequently, if not universally, associated with glacial deposits, often containing glacial dropstones. They also tend to show a higher level of oxidation, with hematite prevailing over magnetite, and they typically contain a small amount of phosphate, about 1% by mass. Mesobanding is often poor to nonexistent and soft-sediment deformation structures are common. This suggests very rapid deposition. However, like the granular iron formations of the Great Lakes, the Neoproterozoic occurrences are widely described as banded iron formations.\nBanded iron formations are distinct from most Phanerozoic ironstones. Ironstones are relatively rare and are thought to have been deposited in marine anoxic events, in which the depositional basin became depleted in free oxygen. They are composed of iron silicates and oxides without appreciable chert but with significant phosphorus content, which is lacking in BIFs.\nNo classification scheme for banded iron formations has gained complete acceptance. In 1954, Harold Lloyd James advocated a classification based on four lithological facies (oxide, carbonate, silicate, and sulfide) assumed to represent different depths of deposition, but this speculative model did not hold up. In 1980, Gordon A. Gross advocated a twofold division of BIFs into an Algoma type and a Lake Superior type, based on the character of the depositional basin. Algoma BIFs are found in relatively small basins in association with greywackes and other volcanic rocks and are assumed to be associated with volcanic centers. Lake Superior BIFs are found in larger basins in association with black shales, quartzites, and dolomites, with relatively minor tuffs or other volcanic rocks, and are assumed to have formed on a continental shelf. This classification has been more widely accepted, but the failure to appreciate that it is strictly based on the characteristics of the depositional basin and not the lithology of the BIF itself has led to confusion, and some geologists have advocated for its abandonment. However, the classification into Algoma versus Lake Superior types continues to be used.\nOccurrence.\nBanded iron formations are almost exclusively Precambrian in age, with most deposits dating to the late Archean (2800\u20132500 Ma) with a secondary peak of deposition in the Orosirian period of the Paleoproterozoic (1850 Ma). Minor amounts were deposited in the early Archean and in the Neoproterozoic (750 Ma). The youngest known banded iron formation is an Early Cambrian formation in western China. Because the processes by which BIFs are formed appear to be restricted to early geologic time, and may reflect unique conditions of the Precambrian world, they have been intensively studied by geologists.\nBanded iron formations are found worldwide, in every continental shield of every continent. The oldest BIFs are associated with greenstone belts and include the BIFs of the Isua Greenstone Belt, the oldest known, which have an estimated age of 3700 to 3800 Ma. The Temagami banded iron deposits formed over a 50-million-year period, from 2736 to 2687 Ma, and reached a thickness of . Other examples of early Archean BIFs are found in the Abitibi greenstone belts, the greenstone belts of the Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons, the Baltic shield, and the cratons of the Amazon, north China, and south and west Africa.\nThe most extensive banded iron formations belong to what A.F. Trendall calls the Great Gondwana BIFs. These are late Archean in age and are not associated with greenstone belts. They are relatively undeformed and form extensive topographic plateaus, such as the Hamersley Range. The banded iron formations here were deposited from 2470 to 2450 Ma and are the thickest and most extensive in the world, with a maximum thickness in excess of . Similar BIFs are found in the Caraj\u00e1s Formation of the Amazon craton, the Cau\u00ea Itabirite of the S\u00e3o Francisco craton, the Kuruman Iron Formation and Penge Iron Formation of South Africa, and the Mulaingiri Formation of India.\nPaleoproterozoic banded iron formations are found in the Iron Range and other parts of the Canadian Shield. The Iron Range is a group of four major deposits: the Mesabi Range, the Vermilion Range, the Gunflint Range, and the Cuyuna Range. All are part of the Animikie Group and were deposited between 2500 and 1800 Ma. These BIFs are predominantly granular iron formations.\nNeoproterozoic banded iron formations include the Urucum in Brazil, Rapitan in the Yukon, and the Damara Belt in southern Africa. They are relatively limited in size, with horizontal extents not more than a few tens of kilometers and thicknesses not more than about . These are widely thought to have been deposited under unusual anoxic oceanic conditions associated with the \"Snowball Earth.\"\nOrigins.\nBanded iron formation provided some of the first evidence for the timing of the Great Oxidation Event, 2,400\u00a0Ma. With his 1968 paper on the early atmosphere and oceans of the Earth, Preston Cloud established the general framework that has been widely, if not universally, accepted for understanding the deposition of BIFs.\nCloud postulated that banded iron formations were a consequence of anoxic, iron-rich waters from the deep ocean welling up into a photic zone inhabited by cyanobacteria that had evolved the capacity to carry out oxygen-producing photosynthesis, but which had not yet evolved enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase) for living in an oxygenated environment. Such organisms would have been protected from their own oxygen waste through its rapid removal via the reservoir of reduced ferrous iron, Fe(II), in the early ocean. The oxygen released by photosynthesis oxidized the Fe(II) to ferric iron, Fe(III), which precipitated out of the sea water as insoluble iron oxides that settled to the ocean floor.\nCloud suggested that banding resulted from fluctuations in the population of cyanobacteria due to free radical damage by oxygen. This also explained the relatively limited extent of early Archean deposits. The great peak in BIF deposition at the end of the Archean was thought to be the result of the evolution of mechanisms for living with oxygen. This ended self-poisoning and produced a population explosion in the cyanobacteria that rapidly depleted the remaining supply of reduced iron and ended most BIF deposition. Oxygen then began to accumulate in the atmosphere.\nSome details of Cloud's original model were abandoned. For example, improved dating of Precambrian strata has shown that the late Archean peak of BIF deposition was spread out over tens of millions of years, rather than taking place in a very short interval of time following the evolution of oxygen-coping mechanisms. However, his general concepts continue to shape thinking about the origins of banded iron formations. In particular, the concept of the upwelling of deep ocean water, rich in reduced iron, into an oxygenated surface layer poor in iron remains a key element of most theories of deposition.\nThe few formations deposited after 1,800\u00a0Ma may point to intermittent low levels of free atmospheric oxygen, while the small peak at https://\u00a0million years ago may be associated with the hypothetical Snowball Earth.\nFormation processes.\nThe microbands within chert layers are most likely varves produced by annual variations in oxygen production. Diurnal microbanding would require a very high rate of deposition of 2 meters per year or 5\u00a0km/Ma. Estimates of deposition rate based on various models of deposition and sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) estimates of the age of associated tuff beds suggest a deposition rate in typical BIFs of 19 to 270 m/Ma, which are consistent either with annual varves or rhythmites produced by tidal cycles.\nPreston Cloud proposed that mesobanding was a result of self-poisoning by early cyanobacteria as the supply of reduced iron was periodically depleted. Mesobanding has also been interpreted as a secondary structure, not present in the sediments as originally laid down, but produced during compaction of the sediments. Another theory is that mesobands are primary structures resulting from pulses of activity along mid-ocean ridges that change the availability of reduced iron on time scales of decades. In the case of granular iron formations, the mesobands are attributed to winnowing of sediments in shallow water, in which wave action tended to segregate particles of different size and composition.\nFor banded iron formations to be deposited, several preconditions must be met.\nSource of reduced iron.\nThere must be an ample source of reduced iron that can circulate freely into the deposition basin. Plausible sources of iron include hydrothermal vents along mid-ocean ridges, windblown dust, rivers, glacial ice, and seepage from continental margins.\nThe importance of various sources of reduced iron has likely changed dramatically across geologic time. This is reflected in the division of BIFs into Algoma and Lake Superior-type deposits. Algoma-type BIFs formed primarily in the Archean. These older BIFs tend to show a positive europium anomaly consistent with a hydrothermal source of iron. By contrast, Lake Superior-type banded iron formations primarily formed during the Paleoproterozoic era, and lack the europium anomalies of the older Algoma-type BIFs, suggesting a much greater input of iron weathered from continents.\nAbsence of oxygen or hydrogen sulfide.\nThe absence of hydrogen sulfide in anoxic ocean water can be explained either by reduced sulfur flux into the deep ocean or a lack of dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR), the process by which microorganisms use sulfate in place of oxygen for respiration. The product of DSR is hydrogen sulfide, which readily precipitates iron out of solution as pyrite.\nThe requirement of an anoxic, but not euxinic, deep ocean for deposition of banded iron formation suggests two models to explain the end of BIF deposition 1.8 billion years ago. The \"Holland ocean\" model proposes that the deep ocean became sufficiently oxygenated at that time to end transport of reduced iron. Heinrich Holland argues that the absence of manganese deposits during the pause between Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic BIFs is evidence that the deep ocean had become at least slightly oxygenated. The \"Canfield ocean\" model proposes that, to the contrary, the deep ocean became euxinic and transport of reduced iron was blocked by precipitation as pyrite.\nBanded iron formations in northern Minnesota are overlain by a thick layer of ejecta from the Sudbury Basin impact. An asteroid (estimated at across) impacted into waters about deep 1.849 billion years ago, coincident with the pause in BIF deposition. Computer models suggest that the impact would have generated a tsunami at least high at the point of impact, and high about away. It has been suggested that the immense waves and large underwater landslides triggered by the impact caused the mixing of a previously stratified ocean, oxygenated the deep ocean, and ended BIF deposition shortly after the impact.\nOxidation.\nAlthough Cloud argued that microbial activity was a key process in the deposition of banded iron formation, the role of oxygenic versus anoxygenic photosynthesis continues to be debated, and nonbiogenic processes have also been proposed.\nOxygenic photosynthesis.\nCloud's original hypothesis was that ferrous iron was oxidized in a straightforward manner by molecular oxygen present in the water:\nThe oxygen comes from the photosynthetic activities of cyanobacteria. Oxidation of ferrous iron may have been hastened by aerobic iron-oxidizing bacteria, which can increase rates of oxidation by a factor of 50 under conditions of low oxygen.\nAnoxygenic photosynthesis.\nOxygenic photosynthesis is not the only biogenic mechanism for deposition of banded iron formations. Some geochemists have suggested that banded iron formations could form by direct oxidation of iron by microbial anoxygenic phototrophs. The concentrations of phosphorus and trace metals in BIFs are consistent with precipitation through the activities of iron-oxidizing bacteria.\nIron isotope ratios in the oldest banded iron formations (3700-3800 Ma), at Isua, Greenland, are best explained by assuming extremely low oxygen levels (&lt;0.001% of modern O2 levels in the photic zone) and anoxygenic photosynthetic oxidation of Fe(II):\nThis requires that dissimilatory iron reduction, the biological process in which microorganisms substitute Fe(III) for oxygen in respiration, was not yet widespread. By contrast, Lake Superior-type banded iron formations show iron isotope ratios that suggest that dissimilatory iron reduction expanded greatly during this period.\nAn alternate route is oxidation by anaerobic denitrifying bacteria. This requires that nitrogen fixation by microorganisms is also active.\nAbiogenic mechanisms.\nThe lack of organic carbon in banded iron formation argues against microbial control of BIF deposition. On the other hand, there is fossil evidence for abundant photosynthesizing cyanobacteria at the start of BIF deposition and of hydrocarbon markers in shales within banded iron formation of the Pilbara craton. The carbon that is present in banded iron formations is enriched in the light isotope, 12C, an indicator of a biological origin. If a substantial part of the original iron oxides was in the form of hematite, then any carbon in the sediments might have been oxidized by the decarbonization reaction:\nTrendall and J.G. Blockley proposed, but later rejected, the hypothesis that banded iron formation might be a peculiar kind of Precambrian evaporite. Other proposed abiogenic processes include radiolysis by the radioactive isotope of potassium, 40K, or annual turnover of basin water combined with upwelling of iron-rich water in a stratified ocean.\nAnother abiogenic mechanism is photooxidation of iron by sunlight. Laboratory experiments suggest that this could produce a sufficiently high deposition rate under likely conditions of pH and sunlight. However, if the iron came from a shallow hydrothermal source, other laboratory experiments suggest that precipitation of ferrous iron as carbonates or silicates could seriously compete with photooxidation.\nDiagenesis.\nRegardless of the precise mechanism of oxidation, the oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron likely caused the iron to precipitate out as a ferric hydroxide gel. Similarly, the silica component of the banded iron formations likely precipitated as a hydrous silica gel. The conversion of iron hydroxide and silica gels to banded iron formation is an example of diagenesis, the conversion of sediments into solid rock.\nThere is evidence that banded iron formations formed from sediments with nearly the same chemical composition as is found in the BIFs today. The BIFs of the Hamersley Range show great chemical homogeneity and lateral uniformity, with no indication of any precursor rock that might have been altered to the current composition. This suggests that, other than dehydration and decarbonization of the original ferric hydroxide and silica gels, diagenesis likely left the composition unaltered and consisted of crystallization of the original gels. Decarbonization may account for the lack of carbon and preponderance of magnetite in older banded iron formations. The relatively high content of hematite in Neoproterozoic BIFs suggests they were deposited very quickly and via a process that did not produce great quantities of biomass, so that little carbon was present to reduce hematite to magnetite.\nHowever, it is possible that BIF was altered from carbonate rock or from hydrothermal mud during late stages of diagenesis. A 2018 study found no evidence that magnetite in BIF formed by decarbonization, and suggests that it formed from thermal decomposition of siderite via the reaction\nThe iron may have originally precipitated as greenalite and other iron silicates. Macrobanding is then interpreted as a product of compaction of the original iron silicate mud. This produced siderite-rich bands that served as pathways for fluid flow and formation of magnetite.\nGreat Oxidation Event.\nThe peak of deposition of banded iron formations in the late Archean, and the end of deposition in the Orosirian, have been interpreted as markers for the Great Oxygenation Event. Prior to 2.45 billion years ago, the high degree of mass-independent fractionation of sulfur (MIF-S) indicates an extremely oxygen-poor atmosphere. The peak of banded iron formation deposition coincides with the disappearance of the MIF-S signal, which is interpreted as the permanent appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere between 2.41 and 2.35 billion years ago. This was accompanied by the development of a stratified ocean with a deep anoxic layer and a shallow oxidized layer. The end of deposition of BIF at 1.85 billion years ago is attributed to the oxidation of the deep ocean.\nSnowball Earth hypothesis.\nUntil 1992 it was assumed that the rare, later (younger) banded iron deposits represented unusual conditions where oxygen was depleted locally. Iron-rich waters would then form in isolation and subsequently come into contact with oxygenated water. The Snowball Earth hypothesis provided an alternative explanation for these younger deposits. In a Snowball Earth state the continents, and possibly seas at low latitudes, were subject to a severe ice age circa 750 to 580 Ma that nearly or totally depleted free oxygen. Dissolved iron then accumulated in the oxygen-poor oceans (possibly from seafloor hydrothermal vents). Following the thawing of the Earth, the seas became oxygenated once more causing the precipitation of the iron. Banded iron formations of this period are predominantly associated with the Sturtian glaciation.\nAn alternative mechanism for banded iron formations in the Snowball Earth era suggests the iron was deposited from metal-rich brines in the vicinity of hydrothermally active rift zones due to glacially-driven thermal overturn. The limited extent of these BIFs compared with the associated glacial deposits, their association with volcanic formations, and variation in thickness and facies favor this hypothesis. Such a mode of formation does not require a global anoxic ocean, but is consistent with either a Snowball Earth or Slushball Earth model.\nEconomic geology.\nBanded iron formations provide most of the iron ore presently mined. More than 60% of global iron reserves are in the form of banded iron formation, most of which can be found in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, and the United States.\nDifferent mining districts coined their own names for BIFs. The term \"banded iron formation\" was coined in the iron districts of Lake Superior, where the ore deposits of the Mesabi, Marquette, Cuyuna, Gogebic, and Menominee iron ranges were also variously known as \"jasper\", \"jaspilite\", \"iron-bearing formation\", or taconite. Banded iron formations were described as \"itabarite\" in Brazil, as \"ironstone\" in South Africa, and as \"BHQ\" (banded hematite quartzite) in India.\nBanded iron formation was first discovered in northern Michigan in 1844, and mining of these deposits prompted the earliest studies of BIFs, such as those of Charles R. Van Hise and Charles Kenneth Leith. Iron mining operations on the Mesabi and Cuyuna Ranges evolved into enormous open pit mines, where steam shovels and other industrial machines could remove massive amounts of ore. Initially the mines exploited large beds of hematite and goethite weathered out of the banded iron formations, and some of this \"natural ore\" had been extracted by 1980. By 1956, large-scale commercial production from the BIF itself began at the Peter Mitchell Mine near Babbitt, Minnesota. Production in Minnesota was of ore concentrate per year in 2016, which is about 75% of total U.S. production. Magnetite-rich banded iron formation, known locally as taconite, is ground to a powder, and the magnetite is separated with powerful magnets and pelletized for shipment and smelting.\nIron ore became a global commodity after the Second World War, and with the end of the embargo against exporting iron ore from Australia in 1960, the Hamersley Range became a major mining district. The banded iron formations here are the thickest and most extensive in the world, originally covering an area of and containing about of iron. The range contains 80 percent of all identified iron ore reserves in Australia. Over of iron ore is removed from the range every year.\nThe Itabarite banded iron formations of Brazil cover at least and are up to thick. These form the Quadrilatero Ferrifero or Iron Quadrangle, which resembles the Iron Range mines of United States in that the favored ore is hematite weathered out of the BIFs. Production from the Iron Quadrangle helps make Brazil the second largest producer of iron ore after Australia, with monthly exports averaging from December 2007 to May 2018.\nMining of ore from banded iron formations at Anshan in north China began in 1918. When Japan occupied Northeast China in 1931, these mills were turned into a Japanese-owned monopoly, and the city became a significant strategic industrial hub during the Second World War. Total production of processed iron in Manchuria reached in 1931\u20131932. By 1942, Anshan's Sh\u014dwa Steel Works total production capacity reached per annum, making it one of the major iron and steel centers in the world. Production was severely disrupted during the Soviet occupation of Manchuria in 1945 and the subsequent Chinese Civil War. However, from 1948 to 2001, the steel works produced 290 million tons of steel, of pig iron and of rolled steel. Annual production capacity as of 2006[ [update]] is of pig iron, of steel and of rolled steel. A quarter of China's total iron ore reserves, about , are located in Anshan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is typically older than the satyrs of the Dionysian retinue (\"thiasos\"), and sometimes considerably older, in which case he may be referred to as a Papposilenus. \"Silen\" and its plural \"sileni\" refer to the mythological figure as a type that is sometimes thought to be differentiated from a satyr by having the attributes of a horse rather than a goat, though usage of the two words is not consistent enough to permit a sharp distinction.\nSilenus presides over other daimons and is related to musical creativity, prophetic ecstasy, drunken joy, drunken dances and gestures.\nIn the decorative arts, a \"silene\" is a Silenus-like figure, often a \"mask\" (face) alone.\nEvolution.\nThe original Silenus resembled a folkloric man of the forest, with the ears of a horse and sometimes also the tail and legs of a horse. The later sileni were drunken followers of Dionysus, usually bald and fat with thick lips and squat noses, and having the legs of a human. Later still, the plural \"sileni\" went out of use and the only references were to one individual named Silenus, the teacher and faithful companion of the wine-god Dionysus.\nA notorious consumer of wine, he was usually drunk and had to be supported by satyrs or carried by a donkey. Silenus was described as the oldest, wisest and most drunken of the followers of Dionysus, and was said in Orphic hymns to be the young god's tutor. This puts him in a company of phallic or half-animal tutors of the gods, a group that includes Priapus, Hermaphroditus, Cedalion and Chiron, but also includes Pallas, the tutor of Athena.\nWhen intoxicated, Silenus was said to possess special knowledge and the power of prophecy. The Phrygian King Midas was eager to learn from Silenus and caught the old man by lacing with wine a fountain from which Silenus often drank. As Silenus fell asleep, the king's servants seized and took him to their master. An alternative story was that when lost and wandering in Phrygia, Silenus was rescued by peasants and taken to Midas, who treated him kindly. In return for Midas's hospitality Silenus told him some tales and the king, enchanted by Silenus's fictions, entertained him for five days and nights. Dionysus offered Midas a reward for his kindness toward Silenus, and Midas chose the power of turning everything he touched into gold. Another story was that Silenus had been captured by two shepherds, and regaled them with wondrous tales.\nIn Euripides's satyr play \"Cyclops\", Silenus is stranded with the satyrs in Sicily, where they have been enslaved by the Cyclopes. They are the comic elements of the story, a parody of Homer's \"Odyssey\" IX. Silenus refers to the satyrs as his children during the play.\nSilenus may have become a Latin term of abuse around 211 BC, when it is used in Plautus's \"Rudens\" to describe Labrax, a treacherous pimp or \"leno\", as \"...a pot-bellied old Silenus, bald head, beefy, bushy eyebrows, scowling, twister, god-forsaken criminal\". In his satire \"The Caesars\", the emperor Julian has Silenus sitting next to the gods to offer up his comments on the various rulers under examination, including Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Marcus Aurelius (whom he reveres as a fellow philosopher-king), and Constantine I.\nSilenus commonly figures in Roman bas-reliefs of the train of Dionysus, a subject for sarcophagi, embodying the transcendent promises of Dionysian cult.\nIn Book VI of Pausanias's \"Description of Greece\", his grave is said to be \"in the land of the Hebrews\".\nPapposilenus.\nPapposilenus is a representation of Silenus that emphasizes his old age, particularly as a stock character in satyr play or comedy. In vase painting, his hair is often white, and as in statuettes, Papposilenus has a pot belly, flabby breasts and shaggy thighs. In these depictions, it is often clear that the Papposilenus is an actor playing a part. His costuming includes a body stocking tufted with hair (\"mall\u014dtos chit\u014dn\") that seems to have come into use in the mid-5th century BC.\nWisdom.\nA theme in Greek philosophy and literature is the wisdom of Silenus, which posits an antinatalist philosophy:\nYou, most blessed and happiest among humans, may well consider those blessed and happiest who have departed this life before you, and thus you may consider it unlawful, indeed blasphemous, to speak anything ill or false of them, since they now have been transformed into a better and more refined nature. This thought is indeed so old that the one who first uttered it is no longer known; it has been passed down to us from eternity, and hence doubtless it is true. Moreover, you know what is so often said and passes for a trite expression. What is that, he asked? He answered: It is best not to be born at all; and next to that, it is better to die than to live; and this is confirmed even by divine testimony. Pertinently to this they say that Midas, after hunting, asked his captive Silenus somewhat urgently, what was the most desirable thing among humankind. At first he could offer no response, and was obstinately silent. At length, when Midas would not stop plaguing him, he erupted with these words, though very unwillingly: 'you, seed of an evil genius and precarious offspring of hard fortune, whose life is but for a day, why do you compel me to tell you those things of which it is better you should remain ignorant? For he lives with the least worry who knows not his misfortune; but for humans, the best for them is not to be born at all, not to partake of nature's excellence; not to be is best, for both sexes. This should be our choice, if choice we have; and the next to this is, when we are born, to die as soon as we can.' It is plain therefore, that he declared the condition of the dead to be better than that of the living.\n \u2013 Aristotle, \"Eudemus\" (354 BCE), surviving fragment quoted in Plutarch, \"Moralia. Consolatio ad Apollonium\", sec. xxvii (1st century CE) (S. H. transl.)\nThis passage is redolent of Theognis's \"Elegies\" (425\u2013428). Silenus's wisdom appears in the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer, who endorsed this famous dictum. Via Schopenhauer, Nietzsche discusses the \"wisdom of Silenus\" in \"The Birth of Tragedy\".\nBoth Socrates and Aesop were sometimes described as having a physical appearance like that of Silenus, with broad flat faces and fat bellies.\nClassical tradition.\nIn art.\nIn the Renaissance, a court dwarf posed for the Silenus-like figure astride a tortoise at the entrance to the Boboli Gardens, Florence. Rubens painted (1616\u201317), now conserved in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich \u2013 the subject was also treated by van Dyck and Ribera.\nDuring the late 19th century in Germany and Vienna, symbolism from ancient Greece was reinterpreted through a new Freudian prism. Around the same time, Vienna Secession artist Gustav Klimt uses the irreverent, chubby-faced Silenus as a motif in several works to represent \"buried instinctual forces\".\nIn literature.\nIn \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\", Rabelais referred to Silenus as the foster father of Bacchus. In 1884 Thomas Woolner published a long narrative poem about Silenus. In Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", Lord Henry Wooton turns praise of folly into a philosophy which mocks \"slow Silenus\" for being sober. In Brian Hooker's 1923 English translation of Edmond Rostand's \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", Cyrano disparagingly refers to the ham actor Montfleury as \"That Silenus who cannot hold his belly in his arms.\"\nProfessor Silenus is a character in Evelyn Waugh's first novel, \"Decline and Fall\". He features as the disaffected architect of King's Thursday and provides the novel with one of its primary motifs. In the prophetic style of the traditional Greek Silenus he informs the protagonist that life is\na great disc of polished wood that revolves quickly. At first you sit down and watch the others. They are all trying to sit in the wheel, and they keep getting flung off, and that makes them laugh, and you laugh too. It's great fun... Of course at the very centre there's a point completely at rest, if one could only find it... Lots of people just enjoy scrambling on and being whisked off and scrambling on again... But the whole point about the wheel is that you needn't get on it at all... People get hold of ideas about life, and that makes them think they've got to join in the game, even if they don't enjoy it. It doesn't suit everyone...\nSilenus is one of the two main characters in Tony Harrison's 1990 satyr play \"The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus\", partly based on Sophocles's play \"Ichneutae\" (5th century BC).\nScientific nomenclature.\nCarl Linnaeus used the feminine form \"Silene\" as the name of a genus of flowering plant.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the city's population of 67,047 made it the state's ninth-most populous city and the 25th-most populous municipality. The city is in eastern New York, near the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers. It is in the same metropolitan area as the state capital, Albany, which is about southeast.\nSchenectady was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, many of whom came from the Albany area. The name \"Schenectady\" is derived from the Mohawk word \"skahn\u00e9htati\", meaning \"beyond the pines\" and used for the area around Albany, New York. Residents of the new village developed farms on strip plots along the river.\nUnion College, the first nondenominational institution of higher education in the United States, and the second college established in the State of New York, was chartered in 1795.\nConnected to the west by the Mohawk River and Erie Canal, Schenectady developed rapidly in the 19th century as part of the Mohawk Valley trade, manufacturing, and transportation corridor. By 1824, more people worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade; like many New York cities, it had a cotton mill that processed cotton from the Deep South. In the 19th century, nationally influential companies and industries developed in Schenectady, including General Electric (GE) and American Locomotive Company, which were powers into the mid-20th century. Schenectady was part of emerging technologies, with GE collaborating in the production of nuclear-powered submarines and, in the 21st century, working on other forms of renewable energy.\nHistory.\nWhen first encountered by Europeans, the Mohawk Valley was the territory of the Mohawk nation, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, or \"Haudenosaunee.\" They had occupied territory in the region since at least 1100 AD. Starting in the early 1600s, the Mohawks moved their settlements closer to the river, and by 1629, they had also taken over territories on the Hudson River's west bank that were formerly held by the Algonquian-speaking Mahican people.\nIn the 1640s, the Mohawk had three major villages, all on the Mohawk River's south side. The easternmost one was Ossernenon, about 9 miles west of present-day Auriesville, New York. When Dutch settlers developed Fort Orange (present-day Albany, New York) in the Hudson Valley beginning in 1614, the Mohawk called their settlement \"skahn\u00e9htati\", also transliterated to \"Sche-negh-ta-da\", meaning \"beyond the pines\", referring to a large area of pine barrens between the Mohawk settlements and the Hudson River. About 3,200 acres of this unique ecosystem are now protected as the Albany Pine Bush. Eventually, the word entered the lexicon of the Dutch settlers. The settlers in Fort Orange used \"skahn\u00e9htati\" to refer to the new village at the Mohawk flats (see below), which became known as Schenectady (with a variety of spellings).\nIn 1661, Arendt van Corlaer (later Van Curler), a Dutch immigrant, bought a large piece of land on the Mohawk River's south side. The colonial government gave other colonists grants of land in this portion of the flat, fertile river valley, as part of New Netherland. The settlers recognized the Mohawk had cultivated these bottomlands for maize for centuries. Van Curler took the largest piece of land; the remainder was divided into 50-acre plots for the other first 14 proprietors, Alexander Lindsey Glen, Philip Hendrickse Brouwer, Simon Volkertse Veeder, Pieter Adrianne Van Wogglelum, Teunize Cornelise Swart, Bastia De Winter atty for Catalyn De Vos, Gerrit Bancker, William Teller, Pieter Jacobse Borsboom, Pieter Danielle Van Olinda, Jan Barentse Wemp(le), Jacques Cornelize Van Slyck, Marten Cornelize Van Esselstyn, and Harmen Albertse Vedder. As most early colonists were from the Fort Orange area, they may have anticipated working as fur traders, but the Beverwijck (later Albany) traders kept a monopoly of legal control. The settlers here turned to farming. Their 50-acre lots were unique for the colony and were \"laid out in strips along the Mohawk River,\" with the narrow edges fronting the river, as in French colonial style. They relied on rearing livestock and wheat. The proprietors and their descendants controlled all the land of the town for generations, essentially acting as government until after the Revolutionary War, when representative government was established.\nBeginning from the first decades of European colonization, Dutch colonists formed relationships with Mohawk women, though they did not usually result in marriage. Their children were raised within Mohawk communities, as the tribe had a matrilineal kinship system, and these multiracial offspring were considered to be born into the mother's clan. During the colonial era, the fur trade formed one of the important trading relationships between Indigenous groups and colonists. In response to labor shortages among Dutch colonists, enslaved Africans were imported to work on farmsteads in Schenectady.\nSome Euro-Indian descendants, such as Jacques Cornelissen Van Slyck and his sister Hilletie van Olinda, who were of Dutch, French, and Mohawk ancestry, became interpreters and intermarried with Dutch colonists. They also gained land in the Schenectady settlement. They were among the few \"m\u00e9tis\" who seemed to move from Mohawk to Dutch society, as they were described as \"former Indians\", although they did not always have an easy time of it. In 1661, Jacques inherited what became known as Van Slyck's Island from his brother Marten, who had been given it by the Mohawk. Van Slyck family descendants retained ownership through the 19th century.\nIn 1664, an English fleet conquered the colony of New Netherland and renamed it New York. They confirmed the monopoly on the fur trade by Albany, and issued orders to prohibit Schenectady from the trade through 1670 and later. Settlers purchased additional land from the Mohawk in 1670 and 1672. (Jacques and Hilletie Van Slyck each received portions of land in the Mohawk 1672 deed for Schenectady.) Twenty years later (1684) Governor Thomas Dongan granted letters patent for Schenectady to five additional trustees.\nOn February 8, 1690, during King William's War, French forces and their Indian allies, mostly Ojibwe and Algonquin warriors, attacked Schenectady by surprise, leaving 62 dead, 11 of them enslaved Africans. American history notes it as the Schenectady massacre. In total, 27 persons were taken captive, including five enslaved Africans; the raiders took their captives overland about 200 miles to Montreal and its associated Mohawk mission village of Kahnawake. Typically, the younger captives were adopted by Mohawk families to replace people who had died. Through the early 18th century in the raiding between Quebec and the northern British colonies, some captives were ransomed by their communities. Colonial governments got involved only for high-ranking officers or other officials. In 1748, during King George's War, the French and Indigenous attacked Schenectady again, killing 70 residents.\nIn 1765, Schenectady was incorporated as a borough. During the American Revolutionary War, the local militia unit, the 2nd Albany County Militia Regiment, fought in the Battle of Saratoga and against Loyalist troops. Most of the wars in the Mohawk Valley were fought further west on the frontier in the areas of the German Palatine settlement, which was west of Little Falls. Because of their close business and other relationships with the British, some settlers from the city were Loyalists and moved to Canada in the late stages of the revolution. The British crown granted them land in what became known as Upper Canada and later Ontario.\nAfter the revolution.\nAfter the Revolutionary War, the village residents reduced the power of the descendants of the early trustees and gained representative government. Long interested in supporting higher education and morals, the members of the city's three oldest churches\u2014the Dutch First Reformed Church, St. Georges Episcopal Church, and First Presbyterian Church\u2014formed a \"union\" and founded Union College in 1795 under a charter from the state. The school had started in 1785 as Schenectady Academy. This founding was part of the expansion of higher education in upstate New York in the postwar years.\nSchenectady was chartered as a city in 1798. In 1819, Schenectady suffered a fire that destroyed more than 170 buildings and most of its historic, distinctively Dutch-style architecture. The Erie Canal was dug along the Mohawk River in the 1820s. During this period, migrants poured into upstate and western New York from New England, but new immigrants also arrived from England and Europe. Many traveled west along the Mohawk, settling in the western part of the state, where they developed more agriculture on former Iroquois lands. A dairy industry developed in the central part of the state. New settlers were predominantly of English and Scotch-Irish descent.\nNew York had passed a law for gradual abolition of slavery in 1799, but in 1824, 102 enslaved individuals were still in Schenectady County, with nearly half residing in the city. That year, the city of Schenectady had a total population of 3939, which included 240 free Blacks, 47 enslaved, and 91 foreigners.\nIn the 19th century, after completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Schenectady became an important transportation, manufacturing, and trade center. By 1824, more of its population worked in manufacturing than agriculture or trade. Among the industries was a cotton mill, which processed cotton from the Deep South. It was one of many such mills in upstate New York whose products were part of the exports shipped out of New York City. The city and state had many economic ties to the South at the same time that some residents became active in the abolitionist movement.\nSchenectady benefited by increased traffic connecting the Hudson River to the Mohawk Valley and the Great Lakes to the west and New York City to the south. The Albany and Schenectady Turnpike (now State Street) was constructed in 1797 to connect Albany to settlements in the Mohawk Valley. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad started operations in 1831 as one of the first railway lines in the United States, connecting the city and Albany by a route through the pine barrens between them. Developers in Schenectady quickly founded the Utica and Schenectady Railroad, chartered in 1833; Schenectady and Susquehanna Railroad, chartered May 5, 1836; and Schenectady and Troy Railroad, chartered in 1836, making Schenectady \"the rail hub of America at the time\" and competing with the Erie Canal. Commodities from the Great Lakes areas and commercial products were shipped to the East and New York City through the Mohawk Valley and Schenectady.\nThe last enslaved individuals in Schenectady gained freedom in 1827, under the state's gradual abolition law. The law first gave freedom to children born to enslaved mothers, but they were indentured to the mother's master for a period into their early 20s. Union College established a school for Black children in 1805, but discontinued it two years later. Methodists helped educate the children for a time, but public schools did not accept them.\nIn the 1830s, the abolitionist movement grew in Schenectady. In 1836, Rev. Isaac Groot Duryee (also recorded as Duryea) co-founded the interracial Anti-Slavery Society at Union College and the Anti-Slavery Society of Schenectady in 1837. Freedom seekers were supported via the Underground Railroad route that ran through the area, passing to the west and north to Canada, which had abolished slavery.\nIn 1837, Duryee, together with others who were free people of color, co-founded the First Free Church of Schenectady (now the Duryee Memorial AME Zion Church). He also started a school for students of color. Abolitionist Theodore S. Wright, an African-American minister based in New York City, spoke at the church's dedication and praised the school.\nThrough the late 19th century, new industries were established in the Mohawk Valley and powered by the river. Industrial jobs attracted many new immigrants, first from Ireland, and later in the century from Italy and Poland. In 1887, Thomas Edison moved his Edison Machine Works to Schenectady. In 1892, Schenectady became the headquarters of General Electric. This business became a major industrial and economic force and helped establish the city and region as a national manufacturing center. GE became important nationally as a creative company, expanding into many different fields. American Locomotive Company also developed here, from a Schenectady company, and merging several smaller companies in 1901; it was second in the United States in the manufacture of steam locomotives before developing diesel technology.\n20th century to present.\nLike other industrial cities in the Mohawk Valley, in the early 20th century, Schenectady attracted many new immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, as they could fill many of the new industrial jobs. It also attracted African Americans as part of the Great Migration out of the rural South to northern cities for work. General Electric and American Locomotive Company (ALCO) were industrial powerhouses, influencing innovation in a variety of fields across the country.\nSchenectady is home to WGY, the second commercial radio station in the United States, (after WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts, named for Westinghouse). WGY was named for its owner, General Electric (the G), and the city of Schenectady (the Y). In 1928, General Electric produced the first regular television broadcasts in the United States, when the experimental station W2XB began regular broadcasts on Thursday and Friday afternoons. This television station is now WRGB; for many years, it was the Capital District's NBC affiliate. It has been the area's CBS affiliate since 1981.\nThe city reached its peak of population in 1930, around 95,000. The Great Depression caused a loss of jobs and population in its wake. In the period after World War II, some residents moved to newer housing in suburban locations outside the city. In addition, GE established some high-tech facilities in the neighboring town of Niskayuna, which contributed to continuing population growth in the county. In the latter part of the 20th century, Schenectady suffered from the massive industrial and corporate restructuring that affected much of the US, including in the railroads. It lost many jobs and population to other locations, including offshore. Since the late 20th century, it has been shaping a new economy, based in part on renewable energy. Its population increased from 2000 to 2010, from over 61,000 to over 66,000 - albeit still some 15,000 below its 1960 level.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which (1.27%) is covered by water.\nIt is part of the Capital District, the metropolitan area surrounding Albany, the New York's state capital. Along with Albany and Troy, it is one of the three principal population and industrial centers in the region.\nInterstate 890 runs through Schenectady, and the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) is nearby. Amtrak has a station in Schenectady. The nearest airport is Schenectady County Airport; the nearest commercial airport is Albany International Airport.\nZIP code 12345, which is used by the GE plant in Schenectady, has attracted media attention on account of its simplicity. Thousands of letters and Christmas lists addressed to Santa Claus are mailed to the ZIP code every year.\nSchenectady has a humid continental climate that is hot-summer (\"Dfa\") bordering upon warm-summer (\"Dfb\".) Average monthly temperatures range from in January to in July. These are estimates made by local amateur observers and are not official, as Schenectady does not have a weather station of its own (its \"official\" temperatures come from nearby Albany).\nEconomy.\nSchenectady was a manufacturing center known as \"the City that Lights and Hauls the World\"\u2014a reference to two prominent businesses in the city, the Edison Electric Company (now known as General Electric), and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO).\nGE retains its steam-turbine manufacturing facilities in Schenectady and its global research facility in nearby Niskayuna. Thousands of manufacturing jobs have been relocated from Schenectady to the Sun Belt and abroad. Corporate headquarters for GE Vernova are now in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nALCO produced steam locomotives for railroads for years. Later, it became renowned for its \"Superpower\" line of high-pressure locomotives, such as those for the Union Pacific Railroad in the 1930s and 1940s. During World War II, it converted to support the war, making tanks for the US Army. As diesel locomotives began to be manufactured, ALCO joined with GE to develop diesel locomotives to compete with GM's EMD division, but corporate restructuring to cope with the changing locomotive procurement environment led to ALCO's slow downward spiral. Its operations fizzled as it went through acquisitions and restructuring in the late 1960s. Its Schenectady plant closed in 1969.\nIn the late 20th century, due to industrial restructuring, the city lost many jobs and suffered difficult financial times, as did many former manufacturing cities in upstate New York. The loss of employment caused Schenectady's population to decline by nearly one-third from 1950 into the late 20th century. The early industries had left many sites contaminated with hazardous wastes. Such environmental brownfields have needed technical approaches for redevelopment.\nIn the 21st century, Schenectady began revitalization. GE established a renewable energy center that brought hundreds of employees to the area. The city is part of a metropolitan area with improving economic health, and a number of buildings have been renovated for new uses. Numerous small businesses, retail stores, and restaurants have developed on State Street downtown.\nPrice Chopper Supermarkets and the New York Lottery are based in Schenectady.\nIn December 2014, the state announced that the city was one of three sites selected for development of off-reservation casino gambling, under terms of a 2013 state constitutional amendment. The project would redevelop an ALCO brownfield site in the city along the waterfront, with hotels, housing, and a marina in addition to the casino.\nIn February 2017, the Rivers Casino and Resort opened with 66 table games and 1,150 slot machines on a 50,000-square-foot gambling floor with a steakhouse and a restaurant lounge. The $480 million (~$ in 2024) residential-retail project on 60 acres includes a marina, two hotels, condominiums, apartments, and retail and office space for technology firms.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe most reported ancestries in 2020 were:\nIn the census of 2010, 66,135 people, 26,265 (2000 data) households, and 14,051 (2000 data) families were residing in the city. The population density was . The racial makeup of the city was 59.38% (52.31% non-Hispanic - NH) White, 24.19% African American, 14.47% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 8.24% from other races, 5.74% from two or more races, 2.62% Asian American, 0.69% Native American, and 0.14% Pacific Islander. The Guyanese population in the area is growing. The top ancestries self-identified by people on the census are Italian (13.6%), Guyanese (12.3%), Irish (12.1%), Puerto Rican (10.1%), German (8.7%), English (6.0%), Polish (5.4%), and French (4.4%). These reflect historic and early 20th-century immigration, as well as that since the late 20th century.\nThe Schenectady City School District is very diverse; (71%- 2011)(80%\u20132013) of district students receive free or reduced lunch. The student population of the school district is majority minority: 35% Black (48% graduate), 32% White (71% graduate), 18% Hispanic (51% graduate), 15% Asian (68% graduate). As of 2016, the graduation rate for the high school was 56%.\nOf the 28,264 households in 2010, 31.2% had children under 18 living with them, 28.0% were married couples living together, 24.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.5% were not families. About 38.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.8% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.98. In the city, the age distribution was 26.3% under 18, 13.6% from 18 to 24, 30.7% from 25 to 44, 21.1% from 45 to 64, and 7.2% who were 65 or older. The median age was 32. For every 100 females, there were 92.5 males. For every 100 females 18 and over, there were 88.4 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city in 2000 was $29,378 (2010\u2013$37,436), and the median income for a family was $41,158. Males had a median income of $32,929 versus $26,856 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,076. About 20.2% of families and 25.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 41.5% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over. The 30,272 (2000 data) housing units at an average density of .\nReligion.\nThe largest religious body is the Catholic church, with 44,000 adherents, followed by Islam, with 6,000 followers. The third-largest religious body is the Reformed Church in America, with 3,600 members. The fourth is the United Methodist denomination, with 2,800 members.\nNotable congregations are the First Presbyterian Church (Schenectady, New York), which is affiliated with the PCA. First Reformed Church RCA, formed in the 17th century, is one of the oldest churches in the town. St George's Episcopal Church dates back to 1735; it shared facilities with the Presbyterians for more than 30 years.\nGovernment.\nSchenectady has a mayor-council government. The mayor is elected for a four-year term with no term limits. The Schenectady City Council has seven seats (councilors), who serve four-year terms and are elected alternately.\nTransportation.\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides regular service to Schenectady, with Schenectady Station at 322 Erie Boulevard. Trains include the \"Ethan Allen, Adirondack, Lake Shore Limited, Maple Leaf,\" and \"Empire Service\". Schenectady also has freight rail service from Canadian Pacific Railway and Norfolk Southern Railway.\nThe Capital District Transportation Authority provides bus service throughout Schenectady, along with connections to the surrounding cities of Albany, Saratoga Springs, and Troy.\nIn the early 20th century, Schenectady had an extensive streetcar system that provided both local and interurban passenger service. The Schenectady Railway Co. had local lines and interurban lines serving Albany, Ballston Spa, Saratoga Springs, and Troy. Also, a line ran from Gloversville, Johnstown, Amsterdam, and Scotia into downtown Schenectady operated by the Fonda, Johnstown, and Gloversville Railroad (FJ&amp;G). The nearly 200 leather and glove companies in the Gloversville region generated considerable traffic for the line. Sales representatives carrying product sample cases began their sales campaigns throughout the rest of the country by taking the interurban to reach Schenectady's New York Central Railroad station, where they connected to trains to New York City, Chicago, and points between.\nThe bright orange FJ&amp;G interurbans were scheduled to meet every daylight New York Central train that stopped at Schenectady. Through the 1900s and into the early 1930s, the line was quite prosperous. In 1932, the FJ&amp;G purchased five lightweight \"bullet cars\" (#125 through 129) from the J. G. Brill Company. These interurbans represented state-of-the-art design: the \"bullet\" description referred to the unusual front roof that was designed to slope down to the windshield in an aerodynamically sleek way. FJ&amp;G bought the cars believing that strong passenger business from a prosperous glove and leather industry would continue, as well as legacy tourism traffic to Lake Sacandaga north of Gloversville. Instead, roads were improved, automobiles became cheaper and were purchased more widely, tourists traveled greater distances by car, and the Great Depression decreased business overall.\nFJ&amp;G ridership continued to decline, and in 1938, the state condemned the line's bridge over the Mohawk River at Schenectady. The bridge had once carried cars, pedestrians, and the interurban, but ice flow damage in 1928 prompted the state to restrict its use to the interurban. When the state condemned the bridge for interurban use, the line abandoned passenger service, and the bullet cars were sold. Freight business had also been important to the FJ&amp;G, and it continued over the risky bridge into Schenectady a few more years.\nThe Mohawk River at Schenectady is crossed by the Western Gateway Bridge, originally built in 1923\u201325, and replaced in 1971. From 1874 to 1925 the Mohawk River had been crossed by a bridge running from the foot of Washington Ave., Schenectady to Washington Ave., Scotia, a steel bridge built upon the seven piers of a former wooden bridge, built in 1808, called the Burr Bridge.\nEducation.\nThe city is served by the Schenectady City School District, which operates 16 elementary schools, three middle schools, and the main high school, Schenectady High School. Brown School is a private, nonsectarian kindergarten-through-eighth grade school. Catholic schools are administered by the Diocese of Albany.\nWildwood School is a special education, all-ages school.\nSchenectady's tertiary educational institutions are Union College, a private liberal arts college, and Schenectady County Community College, a public community college.\nSports.\nSchenectady is currently home to the New York Phoenix of The Basketball League, which have played their home games at Armory Studios NY since 2025. The city formerly hosted the Schenectady Legends of the Independent Basketball Association from 2014 to 2017.\nIt was previously home to baseball teams including the Schenectady Electricians (1895\u20131909), Schenectady Mohawk Giants (1913\u20131914), and Schenectady Blue Jays (1946\u20131957).\nThe Schenectady Chiefs hockey team called the city home from 1981 to 1982.\nFrom 2003 to 2010, the city was home to the Albany BWP Highlanders soccer team.\nRepresentation in popular culture.\nDue to its early importance in national history and the economy, Schenectady figured in popular culture.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 158,061. The county seat is Schenectady. The name is from a Mohawk language word meaning \"on the other side of the pine lands,\" a term that originally applied to Albany. The county is part of the Capital District region of the state.\nSchenectady County is part of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is west of the confluence of the Mohawk with the Hudson River. It includes territory on the north and the south sides of the Mohawk River.\nHistory.\nThis area of the river valley was historically occupied by the Mohawk people, the easternmost of the Five Nations comprising the Iroquois Confederacy or \"Haudenosaunee\". They cultivated maize fields in the flats along the Mohawk River and had villages in the hills.\nEuropean settlement started in the present-day county by Dutch colonists in the 17th century; the village of Schenectady was founded in 1661. The fur traders in Albany kept a monopoly and prohibited settlers in Schenectady from the trade; those residents mostly became farmers. Other areas of the county were also developed for farming. The English enforced the Albany monopoly on the fur trade when they took over the New Netherland colony in 1664.\nThe English organized counties in the Province of New York in 1683; the area of the present-day Schenectady County was included in Albany County. Albany County contained an enormous area, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now within the state of Vermont.\nOn March 12, 1772, Albany County was divided to form two other counties. The area of Schenectady County was still within the reduced Albany.\nFrom 1772 to 1786 Albany County included, besides the present territory of Albany County, all of the present Columbia, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady counties, parts of the present Greene and Washington counties, and a piece of what is now southwestern Vermont.\nIn 1786 Albany County was reduced in size when Columbia County was organized; and again in 1791 by the splitting off of Rensselaer and Saratoga counties and the transfer of the Town of Cambridge to Washington County. It was further reduced in size in 1795 by the splitting off of a part that was combined with a portion of Otsego County to create Schoharie County. It was further reduced in size in 1800 by the splitting off of a part that was combined with a portion of Ulster County to create Greene County.\nIn 1809, Schenectady County was split from Albany County and has kept its current borders. The city of Schenectady was designated as the county seat and is the only city in the county. Major European immigration began in the mid-19th century, with the arrival of Irish refugees from the Great Famine. More immigrants were attracted to the city for its industrial jobs, including those from Italy and Poland. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city became an industrial powerhouse and center of innovation, the headquarters of General Electric and other national corporations.\nThe city of Schenectady reached its peak of population in 1930 but the county reached its peak in 1970, according to US Census data (see table below for county data.) These differences reflect different settlement patterns and the development of suburban housing outside the city limits. The city of Schenectady lost many jobs and population in the late 20th century due to industrial and railroad restructuring; some people stayed in the county working at alternative positions, including commuting to the capital of Albany.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.3%) is water.\nSchenectady County is located in east central New York State, northwest of Albany, an area usually considered \"Upstate\".\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 154,727 people, 60,684 households, and 39,918 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 68,032 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 79.77% White, 9.79% Black or African American, 0.23% Native American, 3.97% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.21% from other races, and 2.00% from two or more races. 6.17% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 24.3% were of Italian, 14.7% Irish, 8.7% German, 6.4% Polish, 4.0 Puerto Rican, 3.9% English ancestry according to Census 2010. 87.6% spoke English, 4.7% Spanish and 1.1% Italian as their first language.\nThere were 60,684 households, out of which 30.00% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.50% were married couples living together, 14.30% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.30% were non-families. 30.60% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.60% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.17.\nIn the county, the population was spread out, with 24.30% under the age of 18, 7.90% from 18 to 24, 28.10% from 25 to 44, 23.00% from 45 to 64, and 16.60% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 92.60 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.30 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $53,399 ($41,739-2000), and the median income for a family was $57,670. Males had a median income of $41,840 versus $29,339 for females. The per capita income for the county was $24,992. About 7.80% of families and 11.90% of the population were below the poverty line, including 17.70% of those under age 18 and 5.50% of those age 65 or over.\nGovernment and politics.\nVoters in Schenectady County have typically leaned Democratic since the mid-20th century. They have given small to moderate leads to Democrats since 1988 in presidential elections. The congressman Paul Tonko is a Democrat. Schenectady County is a statewide bellwether in presidential elections, as it has voted for the statewide presidential winner in every presidential election since 1980. This is the longest such streak of any county in the state.\nLegislative authority is vested in the County Legislature, which consists of 15 members representing 8 communities, separated into four districts. The current composition of the Legislature is as follows (10 Democrats, 2 Republicans, and 3 Conservatives who caucus with the Democrats):\nDistrict 1 - Schenectady:\nDistrict 2 - Schenectady:\nDistrict 3 - Glenville, Niskayuna, and Scotia:\nDistrict 4 - Duanesburg, Princetown, and Rotterdam:\nCounty government.\nSchenectady County was governed by an elected board of supervisors until 1966, after voters approved a new county charter under New York's home rule law.\nOn January 2, 1966, a board of representatives replaced the county supervisors. In 1987, a 15-member legislature replaced the board of representatives. The legislature hires a county manager to oversee day-to-day government operations.\nCounty services.\nThe county operates the Schenectady County Public Library (SCPL), which consists of a central library and eight branches.\nCommunities.\nLarger settlements.\n\u2020 - County seat\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Later, Sanskrit would be systematically analysed, and its rules described, by P\u0101\u1e47ini (fl. 6-4th century BCE), in the Indus Valley. Beginning around the 4th century BCE, Warring States period China also developed its own grammatical traditions. Aristotle laid the foundation of Western linguistics as part of the study of rhetoric in his \"Poetics\" c.\u2009335 BC. Traditions of Arabic grammar and Hebrew grammar developed during the Middle Ages in a religious context like P\u0101nini's Sanskrit grammar.\nModern approaches began to develop in the 18th century, eventually being regarded in the 19th century as belonging to the disciplines of psychology or biology, with such views establishing the foundation of mainstream Anglo-American linguistics, although in England philological approaches such as that of Henry Sweet tended to predominate.\nThis was contested in the early 20th century by Ferdinand de Saussure, who established linguistics as an autonomous discipline within social sciences. Following Saussure's concept, general linguistics consists of the study of language as a semiotic system, which includes the subfields of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Each of these subfields can be approached either synchronically or diachronicially.\nToday, linguistics encompasses a large number of scientific approaches and has developed still more subfields, including applied linguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, sociolinguistics, and computational linguistics.\nAntiquity.\nAcross cultures, the early history of linguistics is associated with a need to disambiguate discourse, especially for ritual texts or arguments. This often led to explorations of sound-meaning mappings, and the debate over conventional versus naturalistic origins for these symbols. Finally, this led to the processes by which larger structures are formed from units.\nBabylonia.\nThe earliest linguistic texts \u2013 written in cuneiform on clay tablets \u2013 date almost four thousand years before the present. In the early centuries of the second millennium BCE, in southern Mesopotamia, there arose a grammatical tradition that lasted more than 2,500 years. The linguistic texts from the earliest parts of the tradition were lists of nouns in Sumerian (a language isolate, that is, a language with no known genetic relatives), the language of religious and legal texts at the time. Sumerian was being replaced in everyday speech by a very different (and unrelated) language, Akkadian; it remained however as a language of prestige and continued to be used in religious and legal contexts. It therefore had to be taught as a foreign language, and to facilitate this, information about Sumerian was recorded in writing by Akkadian-speaking scribes.\nOver the centuries, the lists became standardised, and the Sumerian words were provided with Akkadian translations. Ultimately texts emerged that gave Akkadian equivalents for not just single words, but for entire paradigms of varying forms for words: one text, for instance, has 227 different forms of the verb \"\u011dar\" \"to place\".\nIndia.\nLinguistics in ancient India derives its impetus from the need to correctly recite and interpret the Vedic texts. Already in the oldest Indian text, the Rigveda, (\"speech\") is deified. By 1200 BCE, the oral performance of these texts becomes standardized, and treatises on ritual recitation suggest splitting up the Sanskrit compounds into words, stems, and phonetic units, providing an impetus for morphology and phonetics.\nSome of the earliest activities in the description of language have been attributed to the Indian grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini (6th century BCE), who wrote a rule-based description of the Sanskrit language in his \"A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b\".\nOver the next few centuries, clarity was reached in the organization of sound units, and the stop consonants were organized in a 5x5 square (c.\u2009800 BCE, Pratisakhyas), eventually leading to a systematic alphabet, Br\u0101hm\u012b, by the 3rd century BCE.\nIn semantics, the early Sanskrit grammarian \u015a\u0101ka\u1e6d\u0101yana (before c.\u2009500 BCE) proposes that verbs represent ontologically prior categories, and that all nouns are etymologically derived from actions. The etymologist Y\u0101ska (c. 5th century BCE) posits that meaning inheres in the sentence, and that word meanings are derived based on sentential usage. He also provides four categories of words\u2014nouns, verbs, pre-verbs, and particles/invariants\u2014and a test for nouns both concrete and abstract: words which can be indicated by the pronoun \"that\".\nP\u0101\u1e47ini (c. 6th century BCE) opposes the Y\u0101ska view that sentences are primary, and proposes a grammar for composing semantics from morphemic roots. Transcending the ritual text to consider living language, P\u0101\u1e47ini specifies a comprehensive set of about 4,000 aphoristic rules (\"sutras\") that:\nIn addition, the P\u0101\u1e47inian school also provides a list of 2000 verb roots which form the objects on which these rules are applied, a list of sounds (the so-called \"Shiva-sutras\"), and a list of 260 words not derivable by the rules.\nThe extremely succinct specification of these rules and their complex interactions led to considerable commentary and extrapolation over the following centuries. The phonological structure includes defining a notion of sound universals similar to the modern phoneme, the systematization of consonants based on oral cavity constriction, and vowels based on height and duration. However, it is the ambition of mapping these from morpheme to semantics that is truly remarkable in modern terms.\nGrammarians following P\u0101\u1e47ini include K\u0101ty\u0101yana (c. 3rd century BCE), who wrote aphorisms on P\u0101\u1e47ini (the \"Varttika\") and advanced mathematics; Pata\u00f1jali (2nd century BCE), known for his commentary on selected topics in P\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar (the \"Mahabhasya\") and on K\u0101ty\u0101yana's aphorisms, as well as, according to some, the author of the \"Yoga Sutras\", and \"Pingala\", with his mathematical approach to prosody. Several debates ranged over centuries, for example, on whether word-meaning mappings were conventional (\"Vaisheshika-Nyaya\") or eternal (\"K\u0101ty\u0101yana-Pata\u00f1jali-M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\").\nThe \"Nyaya Sutras\" specified three types of meaning: the individual (\"this cow\"), the type universal (\"cowhood\"), and the image (\"draw the cow\").\nThat the sound of a word also forms a class (sound-universal) was observed by Bhart\u1e5bhari (c. 500 CE), who also posits that language-universals are the units of thought, close to the nominalist or even the linguistic determinism position. Bhart\u1e5bhari also considers the sentence to be ontologically primary (word meanings are learned given their sentential use).\nOf the six canonical texts or \"Vedangas\" that formed the core syllabus in Brahminic education from the 1st century CE until the 18th century, four dealt with language:\nBhartrihari around 500 CE introduced a philosophy of meaning with his \"spho\u1e6da\" doctrine.\nP\u0101\u1e47ini's rule-based method of linguistic analysis and description has remained relatively unknown to Western linguistics until more recently. Franz Bopp used P\u0101\u1e47ini's work as a linguistic source for his 1807 Sanskrit grammar but disregarded his methodology. P\u0101\u1e47ini's system also differs from modern formal linguistics in that, since Sanskrit is a free word-order language, it did not provide syntactic rules. Formal linguistics, as first proposed by Louis Hjelmslev in 1943, is nonetheless based on the same concept that the expression of meaning is organised on different layers of linguistic form (including phonology and morphology).\nThe Pali Grammar of Kacchayana, dated to the early centuries CE, describes the language of the Buddhist canon.\nGreece.\nThe Greeks developed an alphabet using symbols from the Phoenicians, adding signs for vowels and for extra consonants appropriate to their idiom (see Robins, 1997). In the Phoenicians and in earlier Greek writing systems, such as Linear B, graphemes indicated syllables, that is sound combinations of a consonant and a vowel. The addition of vowels by the Greeks was a major breakthrough as it facilitated the writing of Greek by representing both vowels and consonants with distinct graphemes. As a result of the introduction of writing, poetry such as the Homeric poems became written and several editions were created and commented on, forming the basis of philology and criticism.\nAlong with written speech, the Greeks commenced studying grammatical and philosophical issues. A philosophical discussion about the nature and origins of language can be found as early as the works of Plato. A subject of concern was whether language was man-made, a social artifact, or supernatural in origin. Plato in his \"Cratylus\" presents the naturalistic view, that word meanings emerge from a natural process, independent of the language user. His arguments are partly based on examples of compounding, where the meaning of the whole is usually related to the constituents, although by the end he admits a small role for convention. The sophists and Socrates introduced dialectics as a new text genre. The Platonic dialogs contain definitions of the meters of the poems and tragedy, the form and the structure of those texts (see the \"Republic\" and \"Phaidros\", \"Ion\", etc.).\nAristotle supports the conventional origins of meaning. He defined the logic of speech and of the argument. Furthermore, Aristotle's works on rhetoric and poetics became of the utmost importance for the understanding of tragedy, poetry, public discussions etc. as text genres. Aristotle's work on logic interrelates with his special interest in language, and his work on this area was fundamentally important for the development of the study of language (\"logos\" in Greek means both \"language\" and \"logic reasoning\"). In \"Categories\", Aristotle defines what is meant by \"synonymous\" or univocal words, what is meant by \"homonymous\" or equivocal words, and what is meant by \"paronymous\" or denominative words. He divides forms of speech as being:\nNext, he distinguishes between a subject of predication, namely that of which anything is affirmed or denied, and a subject of inhesion. A thing is said to be inherent in a subject, when, though it is not a part of the subject, it cannot possibly exist without the subject, e.g., shape in a thing having a shape. The categories are not abstract platonic entities but are found in speech, these are substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action and affection. In \"de Interpretatione\", Aristotle analyzes categoric propositions, and draws a series of basic conclusions on the routine issues of classifying and defining basic linguistic forms, such as simple terms and propositions, nouns and verbs, negation, the quantity of simple propositions (primitive roots of the quantifiers in modern symbolic logic), investigations on the excluded middle (which to Aristotle isn't applicable to future tense propositions \u2014 the Problem of future contingents), and on modal propositions.\nThe Stoics made linguistics an important part of their system of the cosmos and the human. They played an important role in defining the linguistic sign-terms adopted later on by Ferdinand de Saussure like \"significant\" and \"signifi\u00e9\". The Stoics studied phonetics, grammar and etymology as separate levels of study. In phonetics and phonology the articulators were defined. The syllable became an important structure for the understanding of speech organization. One of the most important contributions of the Stoics in language study was the gradual definition of the terminology and theory echoed in modern linguistics.\nAlexandrian grammarians also studied speech sounds and prosody; they defined parts of speech with notions such as \"noun\", \"verb\", etc. There was also a discussion about the role of analogy in language, in this discussion the grammatici in Alexandria supported the view that language and especially morphology is based on analogy or paradigm, whereas the grammatic in schools in Asia Minor consider that language is not based on analogical bases but rather on exceptions.\nAlexandrians, like their predecessors, were very interested in meter and its role in poetry. The metrical \"feet\" in the Greek was based on the length of time taken to pronounce each syllable, with syllables categorized according to their weight as either \"long\" syllables or \"short\" syllables (also known as \"heavy\" and \"light\" syllables, respectively, to distinguish them from long and short vowels). The foot is often compared to a musical measure and the long and short syllables to whole notes and half notes. The basic unit in Greek and Latin prosody is a mora, which is defined as a single short syllable. A long syllable is equivalent to two moras. A long syllable contains either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a short vowel followed by two or more consonants.\nVarious rules of elision sometimes prevent a grammatical syllable from making a full syllable, and certain other lengthening and shortening rules (such as correption) can create long or short syllables in contexts where one would expect the opposite. The most important Classical meter as defined by the Alexandrian grammarians was the dactylic hexameter, the meter of Homeric poetry. This form uses verses of six feet. The first four feet are normally dactyls, but can be spondees. The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl. The sixth foot is either a spondee or a trochee. The initial syllable of either foot is called the ictus, the basic \"beat\" of the verse. There is usually a caesura after the ictus of the third foot.\nThe text \"T\u00e9khn\u0113 grammatik\u00e9\" (c. 100 BCE, Gk. \"gramma\" meant letter, and this title means \"Art of letters\"), possibly written by Dionysius Thrax (170 \u2013 90 BCE), is considered the earliest grammar book in the Greek tradition. It lists eight parts of speech and lays out the broad details of Greek morphology including the case structures. This text was intended as a pedagogic guide (as was Panini), and also covers punctuation and some aspects of prosody. Other grammars by Charisius (mainly a compilation of Thrax, as well as lost texts by Remmius Palaemon and others) and Diomedes (focusing more on prosody) were popular in Rome as pedagogic material for teaching Greek to native Latin-speakers.\nOne of the most prominent scholars of Alexandria and of the antiquity was Apollonius Dyscolus. Apollonius wrote more than thirty treatises on questions of syntax, semantics, morphology, prosody, orthography, dialectology, and more. Happily, four of these are preserved\u2014we still have a \"Syntax\" in four books, and three one-book monographs on pronouns, adverbs, and connectives, respectively.\nLexicography become an important domain of study as many grammarians compiled dictionaries, thesauri and lists of special words \"\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2\" that were old, or dialectical or special (such as medical words or botanic words) at that period. In the early medieval times we find more categories of dictionaries like the dictionary of Suida (considered the first encyclopedic dictionary), etymological dictionaries etc.\nAt that period, the Greek language functioned as a \"lingua franca\", a language spoken throughout the known world (for the Greeks and Romans) of that time and, as a result, modern linguistics struggles to overcome this. With the Greeks a tradition commenced in the study of language. The terminology invented by Greek and Latin grammarians in the ancient world and medieval period continue as a part of our everyday language. Think, for example, of notions such as the word, the syllable, the verb, the subject etc.\nRome.\nIn the 4th century, Aelius Donatus compiled the Latin grammar \"Ars Grammatica\" that was to be the defining school text through the Middle Ages. A smaller version, \"Ars Minor\", covered only the eight parts of speech; eventually when books came to be printed in the 15th century, this was one of the first books to be printed. Schoolboys subjected to all this education gave us the current meaning of \"grammar\" (attested in English since 1176).\nChina.\nSimilar to the Indian tradition, Chinese philology () emerged as an aid to understanding the Chinese classics c.\u2009the 3rd century\u00a0BCE, during the Western Han dynasty. Philology came to be divided into three branches: exegesis (), grammatology () and phonology (). The field reached its golden age in the 17th century, during the Qing dynasty. The \"Erya\" (c.\u20093rd century\u00a0BCE), comparable to the Indian \"Nighantu\", is regarded as the first linguistic work in China. \"Shuowen Jiezi\" (c.\u2009100\u00a0CE), the first Chinese dictionary, classifies Chinese characters by radicals, a practice that would be followed by most subsequent lexicographers. Two more pioneering works produced during the Han dynasty are \"Fangyan\", the first Chinese work concerning dialects, and \"Shiming\", devoted to etymology.\nAs in ancient Greece, early Chinese thinkers were concerned with the relationship between names and reality. Confucius (c.\u2009551\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009479\u00a0BCE) famously emphasized the moral commitment implicit in a name, (\"zhengming\") stating that the moral collapse of the pre-Qin was a result of the failure to rectify behaviour to meet the moral commitment inherent in names: \"Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son... If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.\" (\"Analects\" 12.11, 13.3).\nHowever, what is the reality implied by a name? The later Mohists or the group known as School of Names,\nconsider that a name ( may refer to three kinds of actuality (): type universals (horse), individual (John), and unrestricted (thing). They adopt a realist position on the name-reality connection\u00a0\u2013 universals arise because \"the world itself fixes the patterns of similarity and difference by which things should be divided into kinds\". The philosophical tradition features a well known conundrum \"a white horse is not a horse\" by Gongsun Longzi (4th century \u00a0BCE), which resembles those of the sophists; Gongsun questions if in copula statements (\"X is Y\"), are \"X\" and \"Y\" identical or is \"X\" a subclass of \"Y\".\nXunzi (c.\u2009310\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009after 238\u00a0BCE) revisits the principle of \"zhengming\", but instead of rectifying behaviour to suit the names, his emphasis is on rectifying language to correctly reflect reality. This is consistent with a more \"conventional\" view of word origins.\nThe study of phonology in China began late, and was influenced by the Indian tradition, after Buddhism had become popular in China. The rime dictionary is a type of dictionary arranged by tone and rime, in which the pronunciations of characters are indicated by \"fanqie\" spellings. Rime tables were later produced to aid the understanding of \"fanqie\".\nPhilological studies flourished during the Qing dynasty, with Duan Yucai and Wang Niansun as the towering figures. The last great philologist of the era was Zhang Binglin, who also helped lay the foundation of modern Chinese linguistics. The Western comparative method was brought into China by Bernard Karlgren, the first scholar to reconstruct Middle Chinese and Old Chinese with Latin alphabet (not IPA). Important modern Chinese linguists include Yuen Ren Chao, Luo Changpei, Li Fanggui and Wang Li.\nAncient commentators on the classics focused their attention on lexical content and the function of linking words rather than syntax; the first modern Chinese grammar was produced by Ma Jianzhong (late 19th century), based on a Western model.\nMiddle Ages.\nArabic grammar.\nOwing to the rapid expansion of Islam in the 8th century, many people learned Arabic as a lingua franca. For this reason, the earliest grammatical treatises on Arabic are often written by non-native speakers.\nThe earliest grammarian who is known to us is (died 735-736 CE, 117 AH). The efforts of three generations of grammarians culminated in the book of the Persian linguist (c. 760\u2013793).\nSibawayh made a detailed and professional description of Arabic in 760 in his monumental work, \"Al-kitab fi al-nahw\" (\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062d\u0648, \"The Book on Grammar\"). In his book he distinguished phonetics from phonology.\nEuropean vernaculars.\nThe Irish \"Sanas Cormaic\" 'Cormac's Glossary' (10th century) is Europe's first etymological and encyclopedic dictionary in any non-Classical language. The Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces, compiled over the course of several centuries \u2014 possibly starting as early as in the 8th century \u2014 is a treatise on that same language and the first instance of a philosophical defence of a spoken European vernacular over Latin.\nA milestone in the early history of Germanic linguistics, the First Grammatical Treatise (12th century) offers a wealth of information on Old Norse lexicon, grammar and phonology.\nIn the 13th century, the Modistae or \"speculative grammarians\" introduced the notion of universal grammar. In the treatise \"De vulgari eloquentia\" (\"On the Eloquence of Vernacular\"), dating to 1303-1305, the Italian poet Dante presented a theory of language and discussed the origin of languages after the confusion of tongues following the events of the Tower of Babel. By recognizing the instrinsically human nature of language, Dante first recognized that \u2014 like customs and traditions \u2014 languages are bound to evolve over time and to differentiate in space giving birth to dialects. He argued that the wave of human populations migrating westward to Europe after the confusion of tongues were already differentiated into three linguistic families: the Greek family, one that can be defined as Slavo-Germanic, and the one that is today known as Romance family. Each of these families independently underwent differentiation into several branching languages. The Romance family, in particular, appeared to Dante as split into three closely related languages, namely Old French (\"langue d'o\u00efl\"), Old Occitan (\"langue d'oc\") and Italian (\"lingua del s\u00ec\"). The writer then focused on the additional subdivision of Italian into 14 dialectal varieties, whence it could be possible to extract a noble and elevated vulgar language not inferior in dignity to Latin.\nThe Renaissance and Baroque period saw an intensified interest in linguistics, notably for the purpose of Bible translations by the Jesuits, and also related to philosophical speculation on philosophical languages and the origin of language.\nIn the 1600s, Joannes Goropius Becanus was the oldest representative of Dutch linguistics. He was the first person to publish a fragment of Gothic, mainly The lord's prayer. Franciscus Juniuns, Lambert ten Kate from Amsterdam and George Hickes from England are considered to be the founding fathers of Germanic linguistics.\nModern linguistics.\nModern linguistics did not begin until the late 18th century, and the Romantic or animist theses of Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Christoph Adelung remained influential well into the 19th century.\nIn the history of American linguistics, there were hundreds of Indigenous languages that were never recorded. Many of the languages were spoken, not written, and so they are now inaccessible. Under these circumstances, linguists such as Franz Boas tried to prescribe sound methodical principles for the analysis of unfamiliar languages. Boas was an influential linguist and was followed by Edward Sapir and Leonard Bloomfield.\nHistorical linguistics.\nDuring the 18th century conjectural history, based on a mix of linguistics and anthropology, on the topic of both the origin and progress of language and society was fashionable. These thinkers contributed to the construction of academic paradigms in which some languages were labelled \"primitive\" relative to the English language. Hugh Blair wrote that for Native Americans, certain motions and actions were found to convey meaning as much as what was said verbally. Around the same time, James Burnett authored a 6 volume treatise that delved more deeply into the matter of \"savage languages\". Other writers theorized that Native American languages were \"nothing but the natural and instinctive cries of the animal\" without grammatical structure. The thinkers within this paradigm connected themselves with the Greeks and Romans, viewed as the only civilized persons of the ancient world, a view articulated by Thomas Sheridan who compiled an important 18th century pronunciation dictionary: \"It was to the care taken in the cultivation of their languages, that Greece and Rome, owed that splendor, which eclipsed all the other nations of the world\".\nIn the 18th century James Burnett, Lord Monboddo analyzed numerous languages and deduced logical elements of the evolution of human languages. His thinking was interleaved with his precursive concepts of biological evolution. Some of his early concepts have been validated and are considered correct today. In his \"The Sanscrit Language\" (1786), Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit and Persian had resemblances to Classical Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Celtic languages. From this idea sprung the field of comparative linguistics and historical linguistics. Through the 19th century, European linguistics centered on the comparative history of the Indo-European languages, with a concern for finding their common roots and tracing their development.\nIn the 1820s, Wilhelm von Humboldt observed that human language was a rule-governed system, anticipating a theme that was to become central in the formal work on syntax and semantics of language in the 20th century. Of this observation he said that it allowed language to make \"infinite use of finite means\" (\"\u00dcber den Dualis\", 1827). Humboldt's work is associated with the movement of Romantic linguistics, which was inspired by \"Naturphilosophie\" and Romantic science. Other notable representatives of the movement include Friedrich Schlegel and Franz Bopp.\nIt was only in the late 19th century that the Neogrammarian approach of Karl Brugmann and others introduced a rigid notion of sound law.\nHistorical linguistics also led to the emergence of the semantics and some forms of pragmatics (Nerlich, 1992; Nerlich and Clarke, 1996).\nHistorical linguistics continues today and linguistics have succeeded in grouping approximately 5000 languages of the world into a number of common ancestors.\nStructuralism.\nIn Europe there was a development of structural linguistics, initiated by Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss professor of Indo-European and general linguistics, whose lectures on general linguistics, published posthumously by his students, set the direction of European linguistic analysis from the 1920s on; his approach has been widely adopted in other fields under the broad term \"Structuralism\".\nBy the 20th century, the attention shifted from language change to the structure, which is governed by rules and principles. This structure turned more into grammar and by the 1920s structural linguistic, was developing into sophisticated methods of grammatical analysis.\nDescriptive linguistics.\nDuring the second World War, North American linguists Leonard Bloomfield, William Mandeville Austin and several of his students and colleagues developed teaching materials for a variety of languages whose knowledge was needed for the war effort. This work led to an increasing prominence of the field of linguistics, which became a recognized discipline in most American universities only after the war.\nIn 1965, William Stokoe, Carl G. Croneberg, and Dorothy C. Casterline linguists from Gallaudet University published an analysis which proved that American Sign Language fits the criteria for a natural language.\nGenerative linguistics.\nGenerative linguistics focuses on modeling the subconscious rules governing language. It started with Noam Chomsky\u2019s Transformational Grammar and has evolved into various theories like Government and Binding and the Minimalist Program. Core principles include the distinction between competence and performance, the role of innate grammar (Universal Grammar), and the use of explicit, formal models to describe linguistic knowledge.\nOther subfields.\nFrom roughly 1980 onwards, pragmatic, functional, and cognitive approaches have steadily gained ground, both in the United States and in Europe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The usual terminology is thus not entirely clear and consistent.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the term \"general linguistics\" was more common (cf. Ferdinand de Saussure's famous \"Course in General Linguistics\"), which could be contrasted with \"language-particular linguistics\" (which is more often called descriptive linguistics).\nThe fields that are generally considered the core of theoretical linguistics are phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Although phonetics often guides phonology, it is often excluded from the purview of theoretical linguistics. \nMajor fields.\nMorphology.\nMorphology is the study of the internal structure of words. For example, in the sentences \"The dog runs\" and \"The dogs run\", the word forms \"runs\" and \"dogs\" have an affix \"-s\" added, distinguishing them from the base forms \"dog\" and \"run\". Adding this suffix to a nominal stem gives plural forms, and adding it to verbal stems restricts the subject to third-person singular. Some morphological theories operate with two distinct suffixes \"-s\", called allomorphs of the morphemes plural and third-person singular, respectively. Languages differ with respect to their morphological structure. Along one axis, analytic languages, with few or no affixes or other morphological processes, may be distinguished from synthetic languages, with many affixes. Along another axis, agglutinative languages, whose affixes express only one grammatical property and are added neatly one after another, may be distinguished from fusional languages, with non-concatenative morphological processes (infixation, umlaut, ablaut, etc.) and/or with less clear-cut affix boundaries.\nPhonetics.\nPhonetics is the study of speech sounds that concentrates on three main points:\nAccording to this definition, phonetics can also be called linguistic analysis of human speech at the surface level. That is one obvious difference from phonology, which concerns the structure and organisation of speech sounds in natural languages has a theoretical and abstract nature. One example can be made to illustrate the distinction:\nIn English, the suffix \"-s\" can represent , , or it can be silent (written \u00d8), depending on context.\nArticulatory phonetics.\nArticulatory phonetics is a subfield of phonetics. In studying articulation, phoneticians attempt to document how humans produce speech sounds (vowels and consonants). That is, articulatory phoneticians are interested in how the different structures of the vocal tract, called the articulators (tongue, lips, jaw, palate, teeth etc.), interact to create the specific sounds.\nAuditory phonetics.\nAuditory phonetics is a branch of phonetics that is concerned with the hearing, acquisition and comprehension of phonetic sounds of words of a language. As articulatory phonetics explores the methods of sound production, auditory phonetics explores the methods of reception: the ear to the brain and those processes.\nAcoustic phonetics.\nAcoustic phonetics is the subfield of phonetics that deals with acoustic aspects of speech sounds. Acoustic phonetics investigates properties like the mean-squared amplitude of a waveform, its duration, its fundamental frequency or other properties of its frequency spectrum and the relationship of those properties to other branches of phonetics (e.g. articulatory or auditory phonetics) and to abstract linguistic concepts, such as phones, phrases or utterances.\nPhonology.\nPhonology (sometimes called \"phonemics\" or \"phonematics\") is the study of how sounds are used in languages to convey meaning. Phonology includes topics such as stress and intonation.\nThe basic unit of analysis for phonology is called phoneme, a group of sounds which are not distinguished by the rules of the language in determining the meaning. In English, for example, and are different allophones that represent the single phoneme .\nSemantics.\nSemantics is the study of intension, the intrinsic meanings of words and phrases. Much work in the field of philosophy of language is concerned with the relation between meanings and the word, and this concern cross-cuts formal semantics in several ways. For example, both philosophers of language and semanticists make use of propositional, predicate and modal logics to express their ideas about word meaning.\nSyntax.\nSyntax is the study of language structure and phrasal hierarchies, depicted in parse tree format. It is concerned with the relationship between units at the level of words or morphology. Syntax seeks to exactly delineate all and only those sentences which make up a given language, using native speaker intuition. Syntax seeks to formally describe exactly how structural relations between elements (lexical items/words and operators) in a sentence contribute to its interpretation. Syntax uses principles of formal logic and Set Theory to formalize and accurately represent the hierarchical relationship between elements in a sentence. Abstract syntax trees are often used to illustrate the hierarchical structures that are posited. Thus, in active declarative sentences in English the subject is followed by the main verb which in turn is followed by the object (SVO). This order of elements is crucial to its correct interpretation and it is exactly this which syntacticians try to capture. They argue that there must be a formal computational component contained within the language faculty of normal speakers of a language and seek to describe it.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55424", "revid": "6032993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55424", "title": "Drive letter assignment", "text": "Alphabetical assignment to logical drives on computers (e.g., C:\\)\nIn computer data storage, drive letter assignment is the process of assigning alphabetical identifiers to volumes. Unlike the concept of UNIX mount points, where volumes are named and located arbitrarily in a single hierarchical namespace, drive letter assignment allows multiple highest-level namespaces. Drive letter assignment is thus a process of using letters to name the roots of the \"forest\" representing the file system; each volume holds an independent \"tree\" (or, for non-hierarchical file systems, an independent list of files).\nOrigin.\nThe concept of drive letters, as used today, presumably owes its origins to IBM's VM family of operating systems, dating back to CP/CMS in 1967 (and its research predecessor CP-40), by way of Digital Research's (DRI) CP/M. The concept evolved through several steps:\nThe important capability of hierarchical directories within each drive letter was initially absent from these systems. This was a major feature of UNIX and other similar operating systems, where hard disk drives held thousands (rather than tens or hundreds) of files. Increasing microcomputer storage capacities led to their introduction, eventually followed by long filenames. In file systems lacking such naming mechanisms, drive letter assignment proved a useful, simple organizing principle.\nOperating systems that use drive letter assignment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOrder of assignment.\nMS-DOS/PC\u00a0DOS since version 5.0, and later operating systems, assigns drive letters according to the following algorithm:\nMS-DOS/PC\u00a0DOS versions 4.0 and earlier assign letters to all of the floppy drives before considering hard drives, so a system with four floppy drives would call the first hard drive E:. Starting with DOS 5.0, the system ensures that drive C: is always a hard disk, even if the system has more than two physical floppy drives.\nWhile without deliberate remapping, the drive letter assignments are typically fixed until the next reboot, however, Zenith MS-DOS 3.21 will update the drive letter assignments when resetting a drive. This may cause drive letters to change without reboot if the partitioning of the harddisk was changed.\nMS-DOS on the Apricot PC assigns letters to hard drives, starting with A:, before considering floppy drives. A system with two of each drive would call the hard drives A: and B:, and the floppies C: and D:.\nOn the Japanese PC-98, if the system is booted from floppy disk, the dedicated version of MS-DOS assigns letters to all floppy drives before considering hard drives; it does the opposite if it is booted from a hard drive, that is, if the OS was installed on the hard drive, MS-DOS would assign this drive as drive \"A:\" and a potentially existing floppy as drive \"B:\". The Japanese version of the Windows 95 SETUP program supports a special option /AT to enforce that Windows will be on drive C:.\nSome versions of DOS do not assign the drive letter, beginning with C:, to the first active primary partition recognized upon the first physical hard disk, but on the first primary partition recognized of the first hard disk, even if it is not set active.\nIf there is more than one extended partition in a partition table, only the logical drives in the first recognized extended partition type are processed.\nSome late versions of the DR-DOS IBMBIO.COM provide a preboot config structure, holding bit flags to select (beside others) between various drive letter assignment strategies. These strategies can be preselected by a user or OEM or be changed by a boot loader on the fly when launching DR-DOS. Under these issues, the boot drive can be different from A: or C: as well.\nThe drive letter order can depend on whether a given disk is managed by a boot-time driver or by a dynamically loaded driver. For example, if the second or third hard disk is of SCSI type and, on DOS, requires drivers loaded through the CONFIG.SYS file (e.g. the controller card does not offer on-board BIOS or using this BIOS is not practical), then the first SCSI primary partition will appear after all the IDE partitions on DOS. Therefore, DOS and for example OS/2 could have different drive letters, as OS/2 loads the SCSI driver earlier. A solution was not to use primary partitions on such hard disks.\nIn Windows NT and OS/2, the operating system uses the aforementioned algorithm to automatically assign letters to floppy disk drives, optical disc drives, the boot disk, and other recognized volumes that are not otherwise created by an administrator within the operating system. Volumes that are created within the operating system are manually specified, and some of the automatic drive letters can be changed. Unrecognized volumes are not assigned letters, and are usually left untouched by the operating system.\nA common problem that occurs with the drive letter assignment is that the letter assigned to a network drive can interfere with the letter of a local volume (like a newly installed CD/DVD drive or a USB stick). For example, if the last local drive is drive D: and a network drive would have been assigned as E:, then a newly attached USB mass storage device would also be assigned drive E: causing loss of connectivity with either the network share or the USB device. Users with administrative privileges can assign drive letters manually to overcome this problem.\nAnother condition that can cause problems on Windows XP is when there are network drives defined, but in an error condition (as they would be on a laptop operating outside the network). Even when the unconnected network drive is not the next available drive letter, Windows XP may be unable to map a drive and this error may also prevent the mounting of the USB device.\nCommon assignments.\nApplying the scheme discussed above on a fairly modern Windows-based system typically results in the following drive letter assignments:\nCase-specific drive letters:\nWhen there is no second physical floppy drive, drive B: can be used as a \"virtual\" floppy drive mapped onto the physical drive A:, whereby the user would be prompted to switch floppies every time a read or write was required to whichever was the least recently used of A: or B:. This allows for much of the functionality of two floppy drives on a computer that has only one. This concept of multiple drive letters sharing a single physical device (optionally with different \"views\" of it) is not limited to the first floppy drive, but can be utilized for other drives as well by setting up additional block devices for them with the standard DOS DRIVER.SYS in CONFIG.SYS.\nNetwork drives are often assigned letters towards the end of the alphabet. This is often done to differentiate them from local drives: by using letters towards the end, it reduces the risk of an assignment conflict. It is especially true when the assignment is done automatically across a network (usually by a logon script).\nIn most DOS systems, it is not possible to have more than 26 mounted drives. Atari GEMDOS supports 16 drive letters A: to P: only. The PalmDOS PCMCIA driver stack supports drive letters 0:, 1:, 2:, ... to address PCMCIA drive slots.\nSome Novell network drivers for DOS support up to 32 drive letters under compatible DOS versions. In addition, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, and DR-DOS 7.02 genuinely support a CONFIG.SYS codice_5 directive in order to allocate up to 32 drive letters, named A: to Z:, [:, \\:, ]:, ^:, _: and `:. (DR-DOS 7.02-7.07 also supports codice_6 and codice_7 directives in order to relocate drive structures into upper memory.) Some DOS application programs do not expect drive letters beyond Z: and will not work with them, therefore it is recommended to use them for special purposes or search drives.\nJP Software's 4DOS command line processor supports drive letters beyond Z: in general, but since some of the letters clash with syntactical extensions of this command line processor, they need to be escaped in order to use them as drive letters.\nWindows 9x (MS-DOS 7.0/MS-DOS 7.1) added support for codice_5 and codice_9 as well.\nIf access to more filesystems than Z: is required under Windows NT, Volume Mount Points must be used. However, it is possible to mount non-letter drives, such as 1:, 2:, or !: using the command line codice_10 utility in Windows XP or later (i.e. codice_11), but it is not officially supported and may break programs that assume that all drives are letters A: to Z:.\nASSIGN, JOIN and SUBST in DOS and Windows.\nDrive letters are not the only way of accessing different volumes. DOS offers a JOIN command that allows access to an assigned volume through an arbitrary directory, similar to the Unix \"mount\" command. It also offers a SUBST command which allows the assignment of a drive letter to a directory. One or both of these commands were removed in later systems like OS/2 or Windows NT, but starting with Windows 2000, both are again supported: The SUBST command exists as before, while JOIN's functionality is subsumed in LINKD (part of the Windows Resource Kit). In Windows Vista, the new command MKLINK can be used for this purpose. Also, Windows 2000 and later support mount points, accessible from the Control Panel.\nMany operating systems originating from Digital Research provide means to implicitly assign substitute drives, called \"floating drives\" in DRI terminology, by using the CD/CHDIR command in the following syntax:\n CD N:=C:\\SUBDIR\nDOS Plus supports this for drive letters N:, O:, and P:. This feature is also present in Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager 7, and REAL/32, however, these systems extend the concept to all unused drive letters from A: to Z:, except for the reserved drive letter L:. DR DOS 3.31 - 6.0 (up to the 1992-11 updates with BDOS 6.7 only) also supports this including drive letter L:. This feature is not available under DR DOS 6.0 (1992 upgrade), PalmDOS 1.0, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher. Floating drives are implemented in the BDOS kernel, not in the command line shell, thus they can be used and assigned also from within applications when they use the \"change directory\" system call. However, most DOS applications are not aware of this extension and will consequently discard such directory paths as invalid. JP Software's command line interpreter 4DOS supports floating drives on operating systems also supporting it.\nIn a similar feature, Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32 will dynamically assign a drive letter L: to the load path of a loaded application, thereby allowing applications to refer to files residing in their load directory under a standardized drive letter instead of under an absolute path. This load drive feature makes it easier to move software installations on and across disks without having to adapt paths to overlays, configuration files or user data stored in the load directory or subsequent directories.\nIn some versions of DR-DOS, the load path contained in the appendage to the environment passed to drivers can be shortened to that of a temporary substitute drive (e.g. codice_12) through the codice_13/codice_14 option codice_15 (for codice_16 instead of, say, codice_17). This can be used to minimize a driver's effective memory footprint, if the executable is located in a deep subdirectory and the resident driver happens to not need its load path after installation any more.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Partially raised by his brother, the scholar Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac, Champollion was a child prodigy in philology, giving his first public paper on the decipherment of Demotic in his late teens. As a young man he was renowned in scientific circles, and read Coptic, Ancient Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Arabic.\nDuring the early 19th century, French culture experienced a period of 'Egyptomania', brought on by Napoleon's discoveries in Egypt during his campaign there (1798\u20131801), which also brought to light the trilingual Rosetta Stone. Scholars debated the age of Egyptian civilization and the function and nature of the hieroglyphic script, which language if any it recorded, and the degree to which the signs were phonetic (representing speech sounds) or ideographic (recording semantic concepts directly). Many thought that the script was used only for sacred and ritual functions, and that as such it was unlikely to be decipherable since it was tied to esoteric and philosophical ideas, and did not record historical information. The significance of Champollion's decipherment was that he showed these assumptions to be wrong, and made it possible to begin to retrieve many kinds of information recorded by the ancient Egyptians.\nChampollion lived in a period of political turmoil in France, which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic Wars, he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy, helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.\nIn 1820, Champollion embarked in earnest on the project of the decipherment of hieroglyphic script, soon overshadowing the achievements of British polymath Thomas Young, who had made the first advances in decipherment before 1819. In 1822, Champollion published his first breakthrough in the decipherment of the Rosetta hieroglyphs, showing that the Egyptian writing system was a combination of phonetic and ideographic signs \u2013 the first such script discovered. In 1824, he published a \"Pr\u00e9cis\" in which he detailed a decipherment of the hieroglyphic script demonstrating the values of its phonetic and ideographic signs. In 1829, he travelled to Egypt where he was able to read many hieroglyphic texts that had never before been studied and brought home a large body of new drawings of hieroglyphic inscriptions. Home again, he was given a professorship in Egyptology but lectured only a few times before his health, ruined by the hardships of the Egyptian journey, forced him to give up teaching. He died in Paris in 1832, 41 years old. His grammar of Ancient Egyptian was published posthumously under the supervision of his brother.\nDuring his life as well as long after his death, intense discussions over the merits of his decipherment were carried out among Egyptologists. Some faulted him for not having given sufficient credit to the early discoveries of Young, accusing him of plagiarism, and others long disputed the accuracy of his decipherments. However, subsequent findings and confirmations of his readings by scholars building on his results gradually led to the general acceptance of his work. Although some still argue that he should have acknowledged the contributions of Young, his decipherment is now universally accepted and has been the basis for all further developments in the field. Consequently, he is regarded as the \"Founder and Father of Egyptology\".\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion was born on 23 December 1790, the last of seven children (two of whom had died earlier). He was raised in humble circumstances; his father Jacques Champollion was a book trader from Valjouffrey near Grenoble who had settled in the small town of Figeac in the Department of Lot. His father was a notorious drunk, and his mother, Jeanne-Fran\u00e7oise Gualieu, seems to have been largely an absent figure in the life of young Champollion, who was mostly raised by his older brother Jacques-Joseph. One biographer, Andrew Robinson, even speculated that Champollion was not in fact the son of Jacques Champollion's wife but the result of an extramarital affair.\nTowards the end of March 1801, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois left Figeac for Grenoble, which he reached on 27 March, and where Jacques-Joseph lived in a two-room flat on the rue Neuve. Jacques-Joseph was then working as an assistant in the import-export company Chatel, Champollion and Rif, yet taught his brother to read, and supported his education. His brother also may have been part of the source of Champollion's interest in Egypt, since as a young man he wanted to join Napoleon's Egyptian expedition, and often regretted not being able to go.\nOften known as the younger brother of better known Jacques-Joseph, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois was often called Champollion \"le Jeune\" (the young). Later when his brother became the more famous of the two, Jacques added the town of his birth as a second surname and hence is often referred to as Champollion-Figeac, in contrast to his brother Champollion. Although studious and largely self-educated, Jacques did not have Jean-Fran\u00e7ois' genius for language; however, he was talented at earning a living and supported Jean-Fran\u00e7ois for most of his life.\nGiven the difficulty of the task of educating his brother while earning a living, Jacques-Joseph decided to send his younger brother to the well-regarded school of the Abb\u00e9 Dussert in November 1802, where Champollion stayed until the summer of 1804. During this period, his gift for languages first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Ethiopic, Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. It was while a student here that he took up an interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged in this direction by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.\nAt the age of 11, he came to the attention of the prefect of Grenoble, Joseph Fourier, who had accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on the Egyptian expedition that had discovered the Rosetta Stone. An accomplished scholar in addition to a well-known mathematical physicist, Fourier had been entrusted by Napoleon with the publication of the results of the expedition in the monumental series of publications titled \"Description de l'\u00c9gypte\". One biographer has stated that Fourier invited the 11-year-old Champollion to his home and showed him his collection of Ancient Egyptian artefacts and documents. Champollion was enthralled, and upon seeing the hieroglyphs and hearing that they were unintelligible, he declared that he would be the one to succeed in reading them. Whether or not the report of this visit is true, Fourier did go on to become one of Champollion's most important allies and supporters and surely had an important role in instilling his interest in Ancient Egypt.\nFrom a young age, Champollion showed great interest in the Coptic language, rightly believing it to be the last stage of development of the ancient Egyptian language, and the key to deciphering the hieroglyphs. He frequented a Coptic priest living in Paris, called Youhanna Chiftichi, who taught him to read and speak Coptic fluently. In a letter written to his brother, Champollion wrote of Chiftichi stating:\n\"I am going to visit a Coptic priest at Saint-Roch, rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, who celebrates Mass [...] who will instruct me in Coptic names, and the pronunciation of Coptic letters. I am devoting myself entirely to the Coptic language, for I want to know the Egyptian language as well as my own native French. My great work on the Egyptian papyri will be based on this [ancient] tongue.\"\n\"My Coptic language is going well, I am very happy. Imagine my pleasure in speaking the language of my dear Amenhotep III, Seti, Ramses and Thutmose! [...] I will meet with a Coptic priest named Chiftichi at the Saint-Roch Church to learn more about Coptic names and letter pronunciation.\"\nFrom 1804, Champollion studied at a \"lyc\u00e9e\" in Grenoble but hated its strict curriculum, which only allowed him to study oriental languages one day per week, and he begged his brother to move him to a different school. Nonetheless, at the \"lyc\u00e9e\" he took up the study of Coptic, which would become his main linguistic interest for years to come and prove crucial in his approach to decipherment of the hieroglyphs. He had a chance to practice his Coptic when he met Dom Rapha\u00ebl de Monachis, a former Egyptian Christian monk of Syrian origin and Arabic translator to Napoleon, who visited Grenoble in 1805. Champollion became obsessed with the Coptic language as predecessor of the ancient Egyptian language that he wrote to his brother saying:\n\"I dream in Coptic. I do nothing but that, I dream only in Coptic, in Egyptian [...] I am so Coptic, that for fun, I translate into Coptic everything that comes into my head. I speak Coptic all alone to myself, since no one else can understand me. This is the real way for me to put my pure Egyptian into my head.\"\nBy 1806, Jacques-Joseph was making preparations to bring his younger brother to Paris to study at the University. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois had by then already developed a strong interest in Ancient Egypt, as he wrote in a letter to his parents dated January 1806:\n\"I want to make a profound and continuous study of this ancient nation. The enthusiasm brought me by the study of their monuments, their power and knowledge filling me with admiration, all of this will grow further as I acquire new notions. Of all the people that I prefer, I shall say that none is as important to my heart as the Egyptians.\"\nTo continue his studies, Champollion wanted to go to Paris, Grenoble offering few possibilities for such specialized subjects as ancient languages. His brother thus stayed in Paris from August to September that same year, so as to seek his admission in a specialized school. Around this time, he learned Classical Chinese, Avestan, Middle Persian, and the Persian language. Before leaving however Champollion presented, on 1 September 1807, his \"Essay on the Geographical Description of Egypt before the Conquest of Cambyses\" before the Academy of Grenoble whose members were so impressed that they admitted him to the Academy six months later.\nFrom 1807 to 1809, Champollion studied in Paris, under Silvestre de Sacy, the first Frenchman to attempt to read the Rosetta stone, and with orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langl\u00e8s, and with Rapha\u00ebl de Monachis who was now in Paris. Here he perfected his Arabic and Persian, in addition to the languages that he had already acquired. He was so immersed in his studies that he took up the habit of dressing in Arab clothing and calling himself \"Al Seghir\", the Arab translation of \"le jeune\". He divided his time between the College of France, the Special School of Oriental Languages, the National Library where his brother was a librarian and the Commission of Egypt, the institution in charge of publishing the findings of the Egyptian expedition. In 1808, he first began studying the Rosetta stone, working from a copy made by the Abb\u00e9 de Tersan. Working independently he was able to confirm some of the readings of the demotic previously made by Johan David \u00c5kerblad in 1802, finally identifying the Coptic equivalents of fifteen demotic signs present on the Rosetta stone.\nIn 1810, he returned to Grenoble to take up a seat as joint professor of Ancient History at the newly reopened Grenoble University. His salary as an assistant professor at Grenoble was fixed at 750 francs, a quarter of the salary received by full professors.\nNever well off and struggling to make ends meet, he also suffered since youth from chronically bad health, including gout and tinnitus. His health first began to deteriorate during his time in Paris, where the dank climate and unsanitary environment did not agree with him.\nPolitical trouble during the Napoleonic Wars.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, Champollion was a young bachelor and thus liable to compulsory military service, which would have put him in great danger due to the extremely high mortality of soldiers in Napoleon's armies. Through the assistance of his brother and the prefect of Grenoble Joseph Fourier, who was also an Egyptologist, he successfully avoided the draft by arguing that his work on deciphering the Egyptian script was too important to interrupt. First sceptical of the Napoleonic regime, after the fall of Napoleon in 1813 and the institution of the royalist regime under Louis XVIII, Champollion came to consider the Napoleonic state the lesser of two evils. Anonymously he composed and circulated songs ridiculing and criticizing the royal regime \u2013 songs that became highly popular among the people of Grenoble. In 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from his exile on Elba and landed with an army at the C\u00f4te d'Azur and marched directly on Grenoble where he was received as a liberator. Here he met with Champollion, whose many requests for exemption from the draft he remembered, and he asked him how his important work was progressing. Champollion replied, that he had just finished his Coptic grammar and dictionary. Napoleon requested that he send the manuscripts to Paris for publication. His brother Jacques joined the Napoleonic cause, putting both of the brothers in danger at the end of the Hundred Days when Napoleon was finally defeated, Grenoble being the last city to resist the royalist advances. In spite of the risk to themselves, having been put under Royalist surveillance, the Champollion brothers nonetheless aided the Napoleonic general Drouet d'Erlon who had been sentenced to death for his participation in the Battle of Waterloo, giving him shelter and helping him escape to Munich. The brothers were condemned to internal exile in Figeac, Champollion was removed from his university post in Grenoble and the faculty closed.\nUnder the new Royalist regime, the Champollion brothers invested much of their time and efforts in establishing Lancaster schools, in an effort to provide the general population with education. This was considered a revolutionary undertaking by the Ultra-royalists, who did not believe that education should be made accessible for the lower classes. In 1821, Champollion even led an uprising, in which he and a band of Grenobleans stormed the citadel and hoisted the tricolore instead of the Bourbon Royalist flag. He was charged with treason and went into hiding but was eventually pardoned.\nFamily life.\nIn 1807, Champollion first declared his love for Pauline Berriat, sister of Jacques-Joseph's wife Zo\u00e9. His love was not reciprocated, so Champollion instead had an affair with a married woman named Louise Deschamps that lasted until around 1809. In 1811, Louise remarried; in 1813, Pauline died.\nIt was around this time that Champollion met Rosine Blanc (1794\u20131871), whom he married in 1818, after four years of engagement. They had one daughter, Zora\u00efde Ch\u00e9ronnet-Champollion (1824\u20131889). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first, her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation, he eventually agreed. Originally, Jacques-Joseph was opposed to his brother's marriage, too, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister-in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away for months or even years at a time, as he was travelling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt, while his family remained in Zo\u00e9 and Jacques-Joseph's property in Vif, near Grenoble. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honour, and the two exchanged letters over the period 1826\u20131829 revealing the poor state of Champollion's marriage, yet an affair never developed.\nDeciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphs.\nThe Egyptian hieroglyphs had been well-known to scholars of the ancient world for centuries, but few had made any attempts to understand them. Many based their speculations about the script in the writings of Horapollon who considered the symbols to be ideographic, not representing any specific spoken language. Athanasius Kircher for example had stated that the hieroglyphs were symbols that \"cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures\", meaning that the script was in essence impossible to ever decipher. Others considered that the use of hieroglyphs in Egyptian society was limited to the religious sphere and that they represented esoteric concepts within a universe of religious meaning that was now lost. But Kircher had been the first to suggest that modern Coptic was a degenerate form of the language found in the Egyptian demotic script, and he had correctly suggested the phonetic value of one hieroglyph \u2013 that of \"mu\", the Coptic word for water. With the onset of Egyptomania in France in the early 19th century, scholars began approaching the question of the hieroglyphs with renewed interest, but still without a basic idea about whether the script was phonetic or ideographic, and whether the texts represented profane topics or sacred mysticism. This early work was mostly speculative, with no methodology for how to corroborate suggested readings. The first methodological advances were Joseph de Guignes' discovery that cartouches identified the names of rulers, and George Zo\u00ebga's compilation of a catalogue of hieroglyphs, and the discovery that the direction of reading depended on the direction in which the glyphs were facing.\nEarly studies.\nChampollion's interest in Egyptian history and the hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of 16, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which he argued that the language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming able to read the texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.\nAlready in 1806, he wrote to his brother about his decision to become the one to decipher the Egyptian script:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I want to make a profound and continuous study of this antique nation. The enthusiasm that brought me the study of their monuments, their power and knowledge filling me with admiration, all of this will grow further as I will acquire new notions. Of all the people that I prefer, I shall say that none is as important to my heart as the Egyptians.\"\u2014\u200a\nIn 1808, Champollion received a scare when French archaeologist Alexandre Lenoir published the first of his four volumes on \"Nouvelles Explications des Hieroglyphes\", making the young scholar fear that his budding work had already been surpassed. But he was relieved to find that Lenoir still operated under the assumption that the hieroglyphs were mystic symbols and not a literary system expressing language. This experience made him even more determined to be the first to decipher the language and he began dedicating himself even more to the study of Coptic, writing in 1809 to his brother: \"I give myself up entirely to Coptic\u00a0... I wish to know Egyptian like my French, because on that language will be based my great work on the Egyptian papyri.\" That same year, he was appointed to his first academic post, in history and politics at the University of Grenoble.\nIn 1811, Champollion was embroiled in controversy, as \u00c9tienne Marc Quatrem\u00e8re, like Champollion a student of Silvestre de Sacy, published his \"M\u00e9moires g\u00e9ographiques et historiques sur l'\u00c9gypte\u00a0... sur quelques contr\u00e9es voisines\". Champollion saw himself forced to publish as a stand-alone paper the \"Introduction\" to his work in progress \"L'Egypte sous les pharaons ou recherches sur la g\u00e9ographie, la langue, les \u00e9critures et l'histoire de l'Egypte avant l'invasion de Cambyse\" (1814). Because of the similarities in the topic matter, and the fact that Champollion's work was published after Quatrem\u00e8re's, allegations arose that Champollion had plagiarized the work of Quatrem\u00e8re. Even Silvestre de Sacy, the mentor of both authors, considered the possibility, to Champollion's great chagrin.\nRivalry with Thomas Young.\nBritish polymath Thomas Young was one of the first to attempt decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, basing his own work on the investigations of Swedish diplomat Johan David \u00c5kerblad. Young and Champollion first became aware of each other's work in 1814 when Champollion wrote to the Royal Society of which Young was the secretary, requesting better transcriptions of the Rosetta stone, to Young's irritation, arrogantly implying that he would be able to quickly decipher the script if he only had better copies. Young had at that time spent several months working unsuccessfully on the Rosetta text using \u00c5kerblad's decipherments. In 1815, Young replied in the negative, arguing that the French transcriptions were equally good as the British ones, and added: \"I do not doubt that the collective efforts of savants, such as M. \u00c5kerblad and yourself, Monsieur, who have so much deepened the study of the Coptic language, might have already succeeded in giving a more perfect translation than my own, which is drawn almost entirely from a very laborious comparison of its different parts and with the Greek translation.\" This was the first Champollion had heard of Young's research, and realizing that he also had a competitor in London was not to Champollion's liking.\nIn his work on the Rosetta stone, Young proceeded mathematically without identifying the language of the text. For example, comparing the number of times a word appeared in the Greek text with the Egyptian text, he was able to point out which glyphs spelt the word \"king\", but he was unable to read the word. Using \u00c5kerblad's decipherment of the demotic letters \"p\" and \"t\", he realized that there were phonetic elements in the writing of the name Ptolemy. He correctly read the signs for \"p\", \"t\", \"m\", \"i\", and \"s\", but rejected several other signs as \"inessential\" and misread others, due to the lack of a systematic approach. Young called the Demotic script \"\"enchorial\", and resented Champollion's term \"demotic\" considering it bad form that he had invented a new name for it instead of using Young's. Young corresponded with Sacy, now no longer Champollion's mentor but his rival, who advised Young not to share his work with Champollion and described Champollion as a charlatan. Consequently, for several years Young kept key texts from Champollion and shared little of his data and notes.\nWhen Champollion submitted his Coptic grammar and dictionary for publication in 1815, it was blocked by Silvestre de Sacy, who in addition to his personal animosity and envy towards Champollion also resented his Napoleonic affinities. During his exile in Figeac, Champollion spent his time revising the grammar and doing local archaeological work, being for a time cut off from being able to continue his research.\nIn 1817, Champollion read a review of his \"\u00c9gypte sous les pharaons\"\", published by an anonymous Englishman, which was largely favourable and encouraged Champollion to return to his former research. Champollion's biographers have suggested that the review was written by Young, who often published anonymously, but Robinson, who wrote biographies of both Young and Champollion, considers it unlikely since Young elsewhere had been highly critical of that particular work. Soon Champollion returned to Grenoble to seek employment again at the university, which was in the process of reopening the faculty of Philosophy and Letters. He succeeded, obtaining a chair in history and geography, and used his time to visit the Egyptian collections in Italian museums. Nonetheless, most of his time in the following years was consumed by his teaching work.\nMeanwhile, Young kept working on the Rosetta stone, and in 1819, he published a major article on \"Egypt\" in the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" claiming that he had discovered the principle behind the script. He had correctly identified only a small number of phonetic values for glyphs but also made some eighty approximations of correspondences between Hieroglyphic and demotic. Young had also correctly identified several logographs, and the grammatical principle of pluralization, distinguishing correctly between the singular, dual and plural forms of nouns. Young nonetheless considered the hieroglyphic, linear or cursive hieroglyphs (which he called hieratic) and a third script that he called epistolographic or enchorial, to belong to different historical periods and to represent different evolutionary stages of the script with increasing phoneticism. He failed to distinguish between hieratic and demotic, considering them a single script. Young was also able to identify correctly the hieroglyphic form of the name of Ptolemy V, whose name had been identified by \u00c5kerblad in the demotic script only. Nonetheless, he assigned the correct phonetic values to only some of the signs in the name, incorrectly dismissing one glyph, the one for \"o\", as unnecessary, and assigning partially correct values to the signs for \"m\", \"l\", and \"s\". He also read the name of Berenice, but he managed to correctly identify only the letter \"n\". Young was furthermore convinced that only in the late period had some foreign names been written entirely in phonetic signs, whereas he believed that native Egyptian names and all texts from the earlier period were written in ideographic signs. Several scholars have suggested that Young's true contribution to Egyptology was his decipherment of the Demotic script, in which he made the first major advances, correctly identifying it as being composed of both ideographic and phonetic signs. Nevertheless, for some reason Young never considered that the same might be the case with the hieroglyphs.\nLater, the British Egyptologist Sir Peter Le Page Renouf summed up Young's method: \"He worked mechanically, like the schoolboy who finding in a translation that \"Arma virumque\" means 'Arms and the man,' reads \"Arma\" 'arms,' \"virum\" 'and' , \"que\" 'the man.' He is sometimes right, but very much oftener wrong, and no one is able to distinguish between his right and his wrong results until the right method has been discovered.\" Nonetheless, at the time it was clear that Young's work superseded everything Champollion had by then published on the script.\nBreakthrough.\nAlthough dismissive of Young's work even before he had read it, Champollion obtained a copy of the Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest to the study of the hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, \"De l'\u00e9criture hi\u00e9ratique des anciens \u00c9gyptiens\", in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition, Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.\nThese errors were finally corrected later that year when Champollion correctly identified the hieratic script as being based on the hieroglyphic script, but used exclusively on papyrus, whereas the hieroglyphic script was used on stone, and demotic used by the people. Previously, it had been questioned whether the three scripts even represented the same language; and hieroglyphic had been considered a purely ideographic script, whereas hieratic and demotic were considered alphabetic. Young, in 1815, had been the first to suggest that the demotic was not alphabetic, but rather a mixture of \"imitations of hieroglyphics\" and \"alphabetic\" signs. Champollion, in contrast, correctly considered the scripts to coincide almost entirely, being in essence different formal versions of the same script.\nIn the same year, he identified the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being written in a mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being a much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.\nNames of rulers.\nUsing the fact that it was known that the names of rulers appeared in cartouches, he focused on reading the names of rulers as Young had initially tried. Champollion managed to isolate a number of sound values for signs, by comparing the Greek and Hieroglyphic versions of the names of Ptolemy and Cleopatra \u2013 correcting Young's readings in several instances.\nIn 1822 Champollion received transcriptions of the text on the recently discovered Philae obelisk, which enabled him to double-check his readings of the names Ptolemy and Cleopatra from the Rosetta stone. The name \"Cleopatra\" had already been identified on the Philae obelisk by William John Bankes, who scribbled the identification in the margin of the plate though without any actual reading of the individual glyphs. Young and others would later use the fact that the Cleopatra cartouche had been identified by Bankes to claim that Champollion had plagiarized his work. It remains unknown whether Champollion saw Bankes' margin note identifying the cartouche or whether he identified it by himself. All in all, using this method he managed to determine the phonetic value of 12 signs (A, AI, E, K, L, M, O, P, R, S, and T). By applying these to the decipherment of further sounds he soon read dozens of other names.\nAstronomer Jean-Baptiste Biot published a proposed decipherment of the controversial Dendera zodiac, arguing that the small stars following certain signs referred to constellations. Champollion published a response in the \"Revue encyclop\u00e9dique\", demonstrating that they were in fact grammatical signs, which he called \"signs of the type\", today called \"determinatives\". Young had identified the first determinative \"divine female\", but Champollion now identified several others. He presented the progress before the academy where it was well received, and even his former mentor-turned-archenemy, de Sacy, praised it warmly, leading to a reconciliation between the two.\nThe main breakthrough in his decipherment was when he was also able to read the verb \"MIS\" related to birth, by comparing the Coptic verb for birth with the phonetic signs \"MS\" and the appearance of references to birthday celebrations in the Greek text. It was on 14 September 1822, while comparing his readings to a set of new texts from Abu Simbel, that he made the realization. Running down the street to find his brother, he yelled \"Je tiens mon affaire!\" (I've got it!) but collapsed from the excitement. Champollion subsequently spent the short period from 14 to 22 September writing up his results.\nWhile the name Thutmose had also been identified (but not read) by Young, who realized that the first syllable was spelt with a depiction of an ibis representing Thoth, Champollion was able to read the phonetic spelling of the second part of the word and check it against the mentioning of births in the Rosetta stone. This finally confirmed to Champollion that the ancient texts as well as the recent ones used the same writing system and that it was a system that mixed logographic and phonetic principles.\nLetter to Dacier.\nA week later on 27 September 1822, he published some of his findings in his \"Lettre \u00e0 M. Dacier\", addressed to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris \"Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres\". The handwritten letter was originally addressed to De Sacy, but Champollion crossed out the letter of his mentor turned adversary, substituting the name of Dacier, who had faithfully supported his efforts. Champollion read the letter before the assembled \"Acad\u00e9mie\". All his main rivals and supporters were present at the reading, including Young who happened to be visiting Paris. This was the first meeting between the two. The presentation did not go into details regarding the script and in fact, was surprisingly cautious in its suggestions. Although he must have been already certain of this, Champollion merely suggested that the script was already phonetic from the earliest available texts, which would mean that the Egyptians had developed writing independently of the other civilizations around the Mediterranean. The paper also still contained confusions regarding the relative role of ideographic and phonetic signs, still arguing that also hieratic and demotic were primarily ideographic.\nScholars have speculated that there had simply not been sufficient time between his breakthrough and collapse to fully incorporate the discovery into his thinking. But the paper presented many new phonetic readings of names of rulers, demonstrating clearly that he had made a major advance in deciphering the phonetic script. And it finally settled the question of the dating of the Dendera zodiac, by reading the cartouche that had been erroneously read as \"Arsino\u00eb\" by Young, in its correct reading \"autocrator\" (Emperor in Greek).\nHe was congratulated by the amazed audience including de Sacy and Young. Young and Champollion became acquainted over the next days, Champollion sharing many of his notes with Young and inviting him to visit at his house, and the two parted on friendly terms.\nReactions to the decipherment.\nAt first, Young was appreciative of Champollion's success, writing in a letter to his friend that \"If he [Champollion] did borrow an English key, the lock was so dreadfully rusty that no common arm would have had strength enough to turn it.\u00a0... .You will easily believe that were I ever so much the victim of the bad passions, I should feel nothing but exultation at Mr. Champollion's success: my life seems indeed to be lengthened by the accession of a junior coadjutor in my researches, and of a person too, who is so much more versed in the different dialects of the Egyptian language than myself.\"\nNonetheless, the relationship between them quickly deteriorated, as Young began to feel that he was being denied due credit for his own \"first steps\" in the decipherment. Also, because of the tense political climate between England and France in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, there was little inclination to accept Champollion's decipherments as valid among the English. When Young later read the published copy of the \"lettre\" he was offended that he himself was mentioned only twice, and one of those times being harshly critiqued for his failure in deciphering the name \"Berenice\". Young was further disheartened because Champollion at no point recognized his work as having provided the platform from which decipherment had finally been reached. He grew increasingly angry with Champollion and shared his feelings with his friends who encouraged him to rebut with a new publication. When by a stroke of luck a Greek translation of a well-known demotic papyrus came into his possession later that year, he did not share that important finding with Champollion. In an anonymous review of the \"lettre\", Young attributed the discovery of the hieratic as a form of hieroglyphs to de Sacy and described Champollion's decipherments merely as an extension of \u00c5kerblad and Young's work. Champollion recognized that Young was the author, and sent him a rebuttal of the review while maintaining the charade of the anonymous review. Furthermore, Young, in his 1823 \"An Account of Some Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphical Literature and Egyptian Antiquities, including the author's original alphabet, as extended by Mr. Champollion\", he complained that \"however Mr Champollion may have arrived at his conclusions, I admit them, with the greatest pleasure and gratitude, not by any means as superseding my system, but as fully confirming and extending it.\"(p.\u00a0146).\nIn France, Champollion's success also produced enemies. Edm\u00e9-Francois Jomard was chief among them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements behind his back, pointing out that Champollion had never been to Egypt and suggesting that really his \"lettre\" represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of many priests of the Catholic Church who had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than their accepted chronology, according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.\n\"Pr\u00e9cis\".\nYoung's claims that the new decipherments were merely a corroboration of his own method, meant that Champollion would have to publish more of his data to make clear the degree to which his own progress built on a systematicity that was not found in Young's work. He realized that he would have to make it apparent to all that his was a total system of decipherment, whereas Young had merely deciphered a few words. Over the next year, he published a series of booklets about the Egyptian gods, including some decipherments of their names.\nBuilding on his progress, Champollion now began to study other texts in addition to the Rosetta stone, studying a series of much older inscriptions from Abu Simbel. During 1822, he succeeded in identifying the names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in these ancient texts. With the help of a new acquaintance, the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the \"Pr\u00e9cis du syst\u00e8me hi\u00e9roglyphique des anciens \u00c9gyptiens\" dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the Egyptian grammatical system.\nIn the \"Pr\u00e9cis\", Champollion referred to Young's 1819 claim of having deciphered the script when he wrote that:\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"A real discovery would have been to have really read the hieroglyphic name, that is, to have fixed the proper value to each of the characters it is composed of, and in such a manner, that these values were applicable everywhere that these characters appear\u2014\u200a\nThis task was exactly what Champollion set out to accomplish in the Pr\u00e9cis, and the entire framing of the argument was as a rebuttal to \"M. le docteur Young\" and the translation in his 1819 article, which Champollion brushed off as \"a conjectural translation\".\nIn the introduction, Champollion described his argument in points:\nChampollion never admitted any debt to Young's work, although in 1828, a year before his death, Young was appointed to the French Academy of Sciences, with Champollion's support.\nThe \"Pr\u00e9cis\", which comprised more than 450 ancient Egyptian words and hieroglyphics groupings, cemented Champollion as having the main claim to the decipherment of the hieroglyphs. In 1825, his former teacher and enemy Silvestre de Sacy reviewed his work positively stating that it was already well \"beyond the need for confirmation\". In the same year, Henry Salt put Champollion's decipherment to the test, successfully using it to read further inscriptions. He published a corroboration of Champollion's system, in which he also criticized Champollion for not acknowledging his dependence on Young's work.\nWith his work on the \"Pr\u00e9cis\", Champollion realized that in order to advance further he needed more texts, and transcriptions of better quality. This caused him to spend the next years visiting collections and monuments in Italy, where he realized that many of the transcriptions from which he had been working had been inaccurate \u2013 hindering the decipherment; he made a point of making his own copies of as many texts as possible. During his time in Italy, he met the Pope, who congratulated him on having done a \"great service to the Church\", by which he was referring to the counterarguments he had provided against the challengers to the Biblical chronology. Champollion was ambivalent, but the Pope's support helped him in his efforts to secure funds for an expedition.\nContribution to the decipherment of cuneiform.\nThe deciphering of the cuneiform script started with the first efforts at understanding Old Persian cuneiform in 1802, when Friedrich M\u00fcnter realized that recurring groups of characters in Old Persian inscriptions must be the Old Persian word for \"king\" (, now known to be pronounced \"x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya\"). Georg Friedrich Grotefend extended this work by realizing a king's name is often followed by \"great king, king of kings\" and the name of the king's father. Through deductions, Grotefend was able to figure out the cuneiform characters that are part of Darius, Darius's father Hystaspes, and Darius's son Xerxes. Grotefend's contribution to Old Persian is unique in that he did not have comparisons between Old Persian and known languages, as opposed to the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the Rosetta Stone. All his decipherments were done by comparing the texts with known history. Grotefend presented his deductions in 1802, but they were dismissed by the Academic community.\nIt was only in 1823 that Grotefend's discovery was confirmed, when Champollion, who had just deciphered hieroglyphs, had the idea of trying to decrypt the quadrilingual hieroglyph-cuneiform inscription on a famous alabaster vase in the Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles, the Caylus vase. The Egyptian inscription on the vase turned out to be in the name of King Xerxes I, and the orientalist Antoine-Jean Saint-Martin, who accompanied Champollion, was able to confirm that the corresponding words in the cuneiform script (, \"X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161\u0101 : X\u0160 : vazraka\", \"Xerxes : The Great King\") were indeed the words that Grotefend had identified as meaning \"king\" and \"Xerxes\" through guesswork. This was the first time the hypotheses of Grotefend could be vindicated. In effect, the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs was decisive in confirming the first steps of the decipherment of the cuneiform script.\nMore advances were made in Grotefend's work and by 1847, most of the symbols were correctly identified. The decipherment of the Old Persian Cuneiform script was at the beginning of the decipherment of all the other cuneiform scripts, as various multi-lingual inscriptions between the various cuneiform scripts were obtained from archaeological discoveries. The decipherment of Old Persian, the first cuneiform script to be deciphered, was then notably instrumental to the decipherment of Elamite and Babylonian thanks to the trilingual Behistun inscription, which ultimately led to the decipherment of Akkadian (predecessor of Babylonian) and then Sumerian, through the discovery of ancient Akkadian-Sumerian dictionaries.\nConfirmation of the antiquity of phonetical hieroglyphs.\nChampollion had been confronted to the doubts of various scholars regarding the existence of phonetical hieroglyphs before the time of the Greeks and the Romans in Egypt, especially since Champollion had only proved his phonetic system on the basis of the names of Greek and Roman rulers found in hieroglyphs on Egyptian monuments. Until his decipherment of the Caylus vase, he had not found any foreign names earlier than Alexander the Great that were transliterated through alphabetic hieroglyphs, which led to suspicions that they were invented at the time of the Greeks and Romans, and fostered doubts whether phonetical hieroglyphs could be applied to decipher the names of ancient Egyptian Pharaohs. For the first time, here was a foreign name (\"Xerxes the Great\") transcribed phonetically with Egyptian hieroglyphs, already 150 years before Alexander the Great, thereby essentially proving Champollion's thesis. In his \"Pr\u00e9cis du syst\u00e8me hi\u00e9roglyphique\" published in 1824, Champollion wrote of this discovery: \"It has thus been proved that Egyptian hieroglyphs included phonetic signs, at least since 460 BC\".\nCurator of the Egyptian Antiquities in the Louvre.\nAfter his groundbreaking discoveries in 1822, Champollion made the acquaintance of Pierre Louis Jean Casimir Duc de Blacas, an antiquary who became his patron and managed to gain him the favour of the king. Thanks to this, in 1824, he travelled to Turin to inspect a collection of Egyptian materials assembled by Bernardino Drovetti, which King Charles X had purchased, cataloguing it. In Turin and Rome, he realized the necessity of seeing Egyptian monuments first-hand and began to make plans for an expedition to Egypt while collaborating with Tuscan scholars and the Archduke Leopold. In 1824, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.\nFollowing his successes and after several months of negotiations and talks by Jacques-Joseph while he was still in Italy, Champollion was finally appointed curator of the Egyptian collections of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in a decree of Charles X dated to 15 May 1826. The two Champollion brothers organised the Egyptian collection in four rooms on the first floor of the south side of the Cour Carr\u00e9e. The visitors entered this section of the Louvre via a first room devoted to the funerary world of the Egyptians, the second room presented artefacts relating to civilian life in Ancient Egypt, while the third and fourth rooms were devoted to more artefacts pertaining to mortuary activities and divinities. To accompany these extensive works, Champollion organised the Egyptian collection methodologically into well-defined series and pushed his work to the point of choosing the appearance of the stands and pedestals.\nChampollion's work in the Louvre, as well as his and his brother's efforts to acquire a larger collection of Egyptian artefacts, had a profound impact on the Louvre museum itself, the nature of which changed the Louvre from a place dedicated to the fine-arts \u2013 to a museum in the modern sense of the term, with important galleries devoted to the history of various civilisations.\nFranco-Tuscan Expedition.\nIn 1827, Ippolito Rosellini, who had first met Champollion during his 1826 stay in Florence, went to Paris for a year in order to improve his knowledge of the method of Champollion's system of decipherment. The two philologists decided to organize an expedition to Egypt to confirm the validity of the discovery. Headed by Champollion and assisted by Rosellini, his first disciple and great friend, the mission was known as the Franco-Tuscan Expedition and was made possible by the support of the grand-duke of Tuscany, Leopold II, and Charles X. Champollion and his second-in-command Rossellini were joined on the expedition by Charles Lenormant, representing the French government, and a team of eleven Frenchmen including the Egyptologist and artist Nestor L'Hote and Italians including the artist Giuseppe Angelelli.\nIn preparation for the expedition, Champollion wrote the French Consul General Bernardino Drovetti for advice on how to secure permission from the Egyptian Khedive and Ottoman Viceroy Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Drovetti had initiated his own business of exporting plundered Egyptian antiques and did not want Champollion meddling in his affairs. He sent a letter discouraging the expedition stating that the political situation was too unstable for the expedition to be advisable. The letter reached Jacques Joseph Champollion a few weeks before the expedition was scheduled to leave, but he conveniently delayed in sending it on to his brother until after the expedition had left.\nOn 21 July 1828, the expedition boarded the ship \"Egl\u00e9\" at Toulon and set sail for Egypt and on 18 August they arrived in Alexandria. Here, Champollion met with Drovetti, who continued to warn about the political situation but assured Champollion that the Pasha would give his permission for the expedition to proceed. Champollion, Rosselini and Lenormant met with the Pasha on 24 August, and he immediately gave his permission. However, after more than a week of waiting for the permissions, Champollion suspected that Drovetti was working against him and took a complaint to the French consulate. The complaint worked and soon the pasha provided the expedition with a large riverboat. The expedition bought a small boat for five persons. Champollion named them the \"Isis\" and the \"Athyr\" after Egyptian goddesses. On 19 September, they arrived in Cairo, where they stayed until 1 October when they left for the desert sites of Memphis, Saqqara and Giza.\nWhile examining texts in the tombs at Saqqara in October, Champollion realized that the hieroglyphic word for \"hour\" included the hieroglyph representing a star, which served no phonetic function in the word. He wrote in his journal that the star-glyph was \"the \"determinative\" of all divisions of time\". Champollion probably coined this term, replacing his phrase \"signs of the type\", while in Egypt, as it had not appeared in the 1828 edition of the \"Pr\u00e9cis\". Champollion also saw the sphinx and lamented that the inscription on its chest was covered by more sand than they would be able to remove in a week. Arriving in Dendera on 16 November, Champollion was excited to see the Zodiac that he had deciphered in Paris. Here, he realized that the glyph that he had deciphered as \"autocrator\" and which convinced him that the inscription was of recent date was in fact not found on the monument itself \u2013 it had seemingly been invented by Jomard's copyist. Champollion nonetheless realized that the late date was still correct, based on other evidence. After a day at Dendera, the expedition continued on to Thebes.\nChampollion was particularly captured by the array of important monuments and inscriptions at Thebes and decided to spend as much time there as possible on the way back north. South of Thebes, the \"Isis\" sprang a leak and nearly sank. Having lost many provisions and spent several days repairing the boat they continued south to Aswan where the boats had to be left, since they could not make it across the first Cataract. They travelled by small boats and camelback to Elephantine and Philae. At Philae, Champollion spent several days recovering from an attack of gout brought on by the hard trip, and he also received letters from his wife and brother, both sent many months earlier. Champollion attributed their delay to Drovetti's ill will. They arrived at Abu Simbel on 26 November, the site had been visited by Bankes and Belzoni in 1815 and 1817 respectively, but the sand that they had cleared from the entrance had now returned. On 1 January 1829, they reached Wadi Halfa and returned north. That day, Champollion composed a letter to M. Dacier stating: \"I am proud now, having followed the course of the Nile from its mouth to the second cataract, to have the right to announce to you that there is nothing to modify in our 'Letter on the Alphabet of the Hieroglyphs.' Our Alphabet is good.\"\nEven though Champollion was appalled by the rampant looting of ancient artefacts and destruction of monuments, the expedition also contributed to the destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05\u00a0m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha, he recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artefacts.\nOn the way back, they stayed again at Thebes from March to September, making many new drawings and paintings of the monuments there. Here, at the Valley of the Kings the expedition moved into the tomb of Ramesses IV (of the 20th Dynasty). They also located the tomb of Ramesses the Great, but it was badly looted. It was here that Champollion first received news of Young's campaign to vindicate himself as the decipherer of the hieroglyphs and to discredit Champollion's decipherments. He received this news only a few days after Young's death in London.\nIn late September 1829, the expedition arrived back in Cairo, where they bought 10,000 francs worth of antiquities, a budget extended to them by minister Rochefoucauld. Arriving in Alexandria, they were notified that the French boat that would take them back was delayed, and they had to stay two months until 6 December. On their return to Alexandria, the Khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha, offered the two obelisks standing at the entrance of Luxor Temple to France in 1829, but only one was transported to Paris, where it now stands on the Place de la Concorde. Champollion and the Pasha spoke often and on the Pasha's request, Champollion wrote an outline of the history of Egypt. Here, Champollion had no choice but to challenge the short Biblical chronology arguing that Egyptian civilization had its origins at least 6000 years before Islam. The two also spoke about social reforms, Champollion championing the education of the lower classes \u2013 a point on which the two did not agree.\nReturning to Marseille on the C\u00f4te d'Azur, the members of the expedition had to spend a month in quarantine on the ship before being able to continue on towards Paris. The expedition led to a posthumously published extensive \"Monuments de l'\u00c9gypte et de la Nubie\" (1845).\nDeath.\nAfter his return from the second expedition to Egypt, Champollion was appointed to the chair of Egyptian history and archaeology at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, a chair that had been specially created for him by a decree of Louis Philippe I dated to 12 March 1831.\nChampollion gave only three lectures before his illness forced him to give up teaching.\nExhausted by his labours during and after his scientific expedition to Egypt, Champollion died of an apoplectic attack (stroke) in Paris on 4 March 1832 at the age of 41. His body was buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. On his tomb is a simple obelisk erected by his wife, and a stone slab stating: \"Ici repose Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, n\u00e9 \u00e0 Figeac dept. du Lot le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1790, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Paris le 4 mars 1832\" (Here rests Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, born at Figeac, Department of the Lot, on 23 December 1790, died at Paris on 4 March 1832).\nCertain portions of Champollion's works were edited by Jacques and published posthumously. His \"Grammar and Dictionary of Ancient Egyptian\" had been left almost finished and was published posthumously in 1838. Before his death, he had told his brother: \"Hold it carefully, I hope that it will be my calling card for posterity.\" It contained his entire theory and method, including classifications of signs and their decipherments, and also a grammar including how to decline nouns and conjugate verbs. But it was marred by the still tentative nature of many readings, and Champollion's conviction that the hieroglyphs could be read directly in Coptic, whereas in fact, they represented a much older stage of the language, which differs in many ways from Coptic.\nJacques's son, Aim\u00e9-Louis (1812\u20131894), wrote a biography of the two brothers, and he and his sister Zo\u00eb Champollion were both interviewed by Hermine Hartleben, whose major biography of Champollion was published in 1906.\nChampollion's decipherment remained controversial even after his death. The brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt famously championed his decipherment, as did Silvestre de Sacy, but others, such as Gustav Seyffarth, Julius Klaproth and Edm\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois Jomard sided with Young and refused to consider Champollion to be more than a talented imitator of Young even after the posthumous publication of his grammar. In England, Sir George Lewis still maintained 40 years after the decipherment, that since the Egyptian language was extinct, it was \"a priori\" impossible to decipher the hieroglyphs. In a reply to Lewis's scathing critique, Reginald Poole, an Egyptologist, defended Champollion's method, describing it as \"the method of interpreting Hieroglyphics originated by Dr. Young and developed by Champollion.\" Also Sir Peter Le Page Renouf defended Champollion's method, although he was less deferential to Young.\nBuilding on Champollion's grammar, his student Karl Richard Lepsius continued to develop the decipherment, realizing in contrast to Champollion that vowels were not written. Lepsius became the most important champion of Champollion's work. In 1866, the Decree of Canopus, discovered by Lepsius, was successfully deciphered using Champollion's method, cementing his reputation as the true decipherer of the hieroglyphs.\nLegacy.\nChampollion's most immediate legacy is in the field of Egyptology, of which he is now widely considered as the founder and father, with his decipherment the result of his genius combined with hard work.\nFigeac honours him with La place des \u00c9critures, a monumental reproduction of the Rosetta Stone by American artist Joseph Kosuth (pictured to the right). And a museum devoted to Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion was created in his birthplace at Figeac in Lot. It was inaugurated on 19 December 1986 in the presence of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Jean Leclant, Permanent Secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions and Letters. After two years of building work and extension, the museum re-opened in 2007. Besides Champollion's life and discoveries, the museum also recounts the history of writing. The whole fa\u00e7ade is covered in pictograms, from the original ideograms of the whole world.\nIn Vif near Grenoble, The Champollion Museum is located at the former abode of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois's brother.\nChampollion has also been portrayed in many films and documentaries: For example, he was portrayed by Elliot Cowan in the 2005 BBC docudrama \"Egypt\". His life and process of the decipherment of hieroglyphics were narrated by Fran\u00e7oise Fabian and Jean-Hugues Anglade in the 2000 Arte documentary film \"\". In David Baldacci's thriller involving the CIA, \"Simple Genius\", the character named \"Champ Pollion\" was derived from Champollion.\nIn Cairo, a street carries his name, leading to the Tahrir Square where the Egyptian Museum is located.\nAlso named after him is the Champollion crater, a lunar crater on the far side of the Moon.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55435", "revid": "1153284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55435", "title": "Wuthering Heights", "text": "1847 novel by Emily Bront\u00eb\nWuthering Heights is the only novel by the English author Emily Bront\u00eb, initially published in 1847 under her pen name \"Ellis Bell\". It concerns two landowning families living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with the Earnshaws' ethnically uncertain foster son, Heathcliff. The novel, influenced by Romanticism and Gothic fiction, is considered a classic of English literature.\n\"Wuthering Heights\" was accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along with Anne Bront\u00eb's \"Agnes Grey\" before the success of their sister Charlotte Bront\u00eb's novel \"Jane Eyre\", but they were published later. The first American edition was published in April 1848 by Harper &amp; Brothers of New York. After Emily's death, Charlotte edited a second edition of \"Wuthering Heights\", which was published in 1850.\nThough contemporaneous reviews were polarised, \"Wuthering Heights\" has come to be considered one of the greatest novels written in English. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, including domestic abuse, and for its challenges to Victorian morality, religion, and the class system. It has inspired an array of adaptations across several types of media.\nPlot.\nOpening.\nIn 1801, Mr Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire, pays a visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, at his remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There he meets a reserved young woman (later identified as Cathy Linton), Joseph, a cantankerous servant, and Hareton, an uneducated young man who speaks like a servant. Everyone is sullen and inhospitable. Snowed in for the night, Lockwood reads diary entries of the former inhabitant of his room, Catherine Earnshaw, and has a nightmare in which a ghostly Catherine begs to enter through the window. Awakened by Lockwood's fearful yells, Heathcliff is troubled.\nLockwood later returns to Thrushcross Grange in heavy snow, falls ill from the cold and becomes bedridden. While he recovers, Lockwood's housekeeper, Ellen \"Nelly\" Dean, tells him the story of the strange family.\nNelly's tale.\nThirty years earlier, in 1771, the Earnshaws live at Wuthering Heights with their two children, Hindley and Catherine, and a servant\u2014Nelly herself. Returning from a trip to Liverpool, Earnshaw brings home an orphan whom he names Heathcliff. Heathcliff's origins are unclear but he is described as \"like a gipsy\" and, possibly, a Lascar or an American or Spanish castaway. Earnshaw treats the boy as his favourite. His own children he neglects, especially after his wife dies. Hindley beats Heathcliff, who gradually becomes close friends with Catherine.\nHindley departs for university, returning as the new master of Wuthering Heights on the death of his father three years later. He and his new wife Frances force Heathcliff to live as one of their servants and subject him to much verbal and emotional abuse.\nEdgar Linton and his sister Isabella live nearby at Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff and Catherine spy on them out of curiosity. When Catherine is attacked by their dog, the Lintons take her in, but send Heathcliff home. The Lintons visit, and Hindley and Edgar make fun of Heathcliff; a fight ensues. Heathcliff is then made to live in the manor's unheated, dusty attic and swears that he will one day have his revenge.\nFrances dies after giving birth to a son, Hareton. Two years later, Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar. She confesses to Nelly that she loves Heathcliff, and will try to help him, but feels she cannot marry him because of his low social status. Nelly warns her against associating with a man like Heathcliff. Heathcliff overhears part of the conversation and, misunderstanding Catherine's heart, flees the household. Distraught, Catherine falls ill.\nThree years after his departure, with Edgar and Catherine now wed and expecting children, Heathcliff unexpectedly returns, now a wealthy gentleman. He encourages Isabella's infatuation with him as a means of revenge on Catherine. Enraged by Heathcliff's constant presence at Thrushcross Grange, Edgar banishes him. Catherine responds by locking herself in her room and refusing food; she never fully recovers. At Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff exploits Hindley's gambling addiction and compels him to mortgage the estate to cover his losses. Heathcliff elopes with Isabella, but the relationship fails and they soon return.\nWhen Heathcliff discovers that Catherine is dying, he visits her in secret. She dies shortly after giving birth to a daughter, Cathy, and Heathcliff rages, calling on her ghost to haunt him for as long as he lives. Isabella, bitter over Heathcliff's devotion to a dead woman, flees south where she gives birth to Heathcliff's son, a sickly boy named Linton. Hindley dies six months later of alcoholism, and Heathcliff then takes possession of Wuthering Heights as its new master.\nTwelve years later, after Isabella's death, the still-sickly Linton is brought back to live with his uncle Edgar at the Grange, but Heathcliff insists that his son must instead live with him. Cathy and Linton (respectively at the Grange and Wuthering Heights) gradually develop a relationship. Heathcliff schemes to ensure that they marry in order to ensure his claim to Thrushcross Grange, and on Edgar's death demands that the couple move in with him. He becomes increasingly wild and reveals that on the night Catherine died he dug up her grave, and ever since has been plagued by her ghost. When Linton unexpectedly dies, Cathy has no option but to remain at Wuthering Heights.\nHaving reached the present day, Nelly's tale concludes.\nEnding.\nLockwood grows tired of the moors and moves away. Eight months later he returns for a visit, and Nelly, now the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, tells him what has happened since he left.\nHeathcliff gave up his opposition to Cathy and Hareton's union. He declined physically and started seeing visions of the dead Catherine; he avoided the young couple, saying that he could not bear to see Catherine's eyes, which they both shared, looking at him. He eventually stopped eating, and some days later was found dead in Catherine's old room.\nCathy has been teaching the still-uneducated Hareton to read. They plan to marry and move to the Grange, accompanied by Nelly, with Joseph being left to take care of Wuthering Heights. Nelly reports that the locals have seen the ghosts of Catherine and Heathcliff wandering abroad together. Lockwood seeks out the graves of Catherine, Edgar, and Heathcliff, and is convinced that all three are finally at peace.\nPublication history.\n1847 edition.\nThe original text as published by Thomas Cautley Newby in 1847 is available online in two parts. The novel was first published together with Anne Bront\u00eb's \"Agnes Grey\" in a three-volume format: \"Wuthering Heights\" filled the first two volumes and \"Agnes Grey\" made up the third.\n1850 edition.\nIn 1850 Charlotte Bront\u00eb edited the original text for the second edition of \"Wuthering Heights\" and also provided it with her foreword. She addressed the faulty punctuation and orthography but also diluted Joseph's thick Yorkshire dialect. Writing to her publisher, W. S. Williams, she said that &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It seems to me advisable to modify the orthography of the old servant Joseph's speeches; for though, as it stands, it exactly renders the Yorkshire dialect to a Yorkshire ear, yet I am sure Southerns must find it unintelligible; and thus one of the most graphic characters in the book is lost on them. Irene Wiltshire, in an essay on dialect and speech, examines some of the changes Charlotte made.\nCritical response.\nContemporary reviews.\nEarly reviews of \"Wuthering Heights\" were mixed. Most critics recognised the power and imagination of the novel, but were baffled by the storyline, and objected to the savagery and selfishness of the characters. In 1847, when the background of an author was given great importance in literary criticism, many critics were intrigued by the authorship of the Bell novels.\nThe \"Atlas\" review called it a \"strange, inartistic story\", but commented that every chapter seems to contain a \"sort of rugged power.\"\n\"Graham's Lady Magazine\" wrote: \"How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery. It is a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors\".\n\"\" wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Respecting a book so original as this, and written with so much power of imagination, it is natural that there should be many opinions. Indeed, its power is so predominant that it is not easy after a hasty reading to analyze one's impressions so as to speak of its merits and demerits with confidence. We have been taken and carried through a new region, a melancholy waste, with here and there patches of beauty; have been brought in contact with fierce passions, with extremes of love and hate, and with sorrow that none but those who have suffered can understand.\"\n\"Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper\" wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Wuthering Heights\" is a strange sort of book,\u2014baffling all regular criticism; yet, it is impossible to begin and not finish it; and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about. In \"Wuthering Heights\" the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love\u00a0\u2013 even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself.\n\"The Examiner\" wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The Literary World\" wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the whole story not a single trait of character is elicited which can command our admiration, not one of the fine feelings of our nature seems to have formed a part in the composition of its principal actors. In spite of the disgusting coarsness of much of the dialogue, and the improbabilities of much of the plot, we are spellbound.\nThe English poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti admired the book, writing in 1854 that it was \"the first novel I've read for an age, and the best (as regards power and sound style) for two ages, except \"Sidonia\"\", but, in the same letter, he also referred to it as \"a fiend of a book\u00a0\u2013 an incredible monster\u00a0 ... The action is laid in hell,\u00a0\u2013 only it seems places and people have English names there\".\nRossetti's friend, the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne was another early admirer of the novel, and in conclusion for an essay on Emily Bront\u00eb, published in \"The Athenaeum\" in 1883, writes: \"As was the author's life, so is her book in all things: troubled and taintless, with little of rest in it, and nothing of reproach. It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts; it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose.\"\nTwentieth century.\nUntil late in the 19th century \"\"Jane Eyre\" was regarded as the best of the Bront\u00eb sisters' novels\". This view began to change in the 1880s with the publication of A. Mary F. Robinson's biography of Emily in 1883.\nModernist novelist Virginia Woolf affirmed the greatness of \"Wuthering Heights\" in 1925:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Wuthering Heights\" is a more difficult book to understand than \"Jane Eyre\", because Emily was a greater poet than Charlotte... She looked out upon a world cleft into gigantic disorder and felt within her the power to unite it in a book. That gigantic ambition is to be felt throughout the novel... It is this suggestion of power underlying the apparitions of human nature and lifting them up into the presence of greatness that gives the book its huge stature among other novels.\nSimilarly, Woolf's contemporary John Cowper Powys referred in 1916 to Emily Bront\u00eb's \"tremendous vision\".\nIn 1926 Charles Percy Sanger's work on the chronology of \"Wuthering Heights\" \"affirmed Emily's literary craft and meticulous planning of the novel and disproved Charlotte's presentation of her sister as an unconscious artist who 'did not know what she had done'.\" However, for a later critic, Albert J. Guerard, \"it is a splendid, imperfect novel which Bront\u00eb loses control over occasionally\".\nStill, in 1934, Lord David Cecil, writing in \"Early Victorian Novelists\", commented \"that Emily Bront\u00eb was not properly appreciated; even her admirers saw her as an 'unequal genius',\" and in 1948 F. R. Leavis excluded \"Wuthering Heights\" from the great tradition of the English novel because it was \"a 'kind of sport'\u2014an anomaly with 'some influence of an essentially undetectable kind.'\"\nThe novelist Daphne du Maurier argued the status of \"Wuthering Heights\" as a \"supreme romantic novel\" in 1971:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is more savagery, more brutality, in the pages of \"Wuthering Heights\" than in any novel of the nineteenth century, and, for good measure, more beauty too, more poetry, and, what is more unusual, a complete lack of sexual emotion. ... Emily Bront\u00eb, striding over the Yorkshire moors with her dog, did not conjure from her imagination any cozy tale of happy lovers to console women readers sitting snugly within doors.\nTwenty-first century.\nWriting in \"The Guardian\" in 2003 writer and editor Robert McCrum placed \"Wuthering Heights\" in his list of 100 greatest novels of all time. And in 2015 he placed it in his list of 100 best novels written in English. He said that &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Wuthering Heights\" releases extraordinary new energies in the novel, renews its potential, and almost reinvents the genre. The scope and drift of its imagination, its passionate exploration of a fatal yet regenerative love affair, and its brilliant manipulation of time and space put it in a league of its own.\nWriting for BBC Culture in 2015 author and book reviewer Jane Ciabattari polled 82 book critics from outside the UK and presented \"Wuthering Heights\" as number 7 in the resulting list of 100 greatest British novels.\nIn 2018 Penguin presented a list of 100 must-read classic books and placed \"Wuthering Heights\" at number 71, saying: \"Widely considered a staple of Gothic fiction and the English literary canon, this book has gone on to inspire many generations of writers\u00a0\u2013 and will continue to do so\".\nWriting in \"The Independent\" journalist and author Ceri Radford and news presenter, journalist, and TV producer Chris Harvey included \"Wuthering Heights\" in a list of the 40 best books to read during lockdown. Harvey said that \"It's impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Bront\u00eb's vision of nature blazes with poetry\".\nSetting.\nNovelist John Cowper Powys notes the importance of the setting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLikewise Virginia Woolf suggests the importance of the Yorkshire landscape of Haworth to the poetic vision of both Emily and Charlotte Bront\u00eb:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Who] if they choose to write in prose, [were] intolerant of its restrictions. Hence it is that both Emily and Charlotte are always invoking the help of nature. They both feel the need of some more powerful symbol of the vast and slumbering passions in human nature than words or actions can convey. They seized those aspects of the earth which were most akin to what they themselves felt or imputed to their characters, and so their storms, their moors, their lovely spaces of summer weather are not ornaments applied to decorate a dull page or display the writer's powers of observation\u2014they carry on the emotion and light up the meaning of the book.\nWuthering Heights is an old house high on the Pennine moorland of West Yorkshire. The first description is provided by Lockwood, the new tenant of the nearby Thrushcross Grange:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling, \"wuthering\" being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed. One may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house, and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.\nLord David Cecil in \"Early Victorian Novelists\" (1934) drew attention to the contrast between the two main settings in \"Wuthering Heights\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We have Wuthering Heights, the land of storm; high on the barren moorland, naked to the shock of the elements, the natural home of the Earnshaw family, fiery, untamed children of the storm. On the other hand, sheltered in the leafy valley below, stands Thrushcross Grange, the appropriate home of the children of calm, the gentle, passive, timid Lintons.\nWalter Allen, in \"The English Novel\" (1954), likewise \"spoke of the two houses in the novel as symbolising 'two opposed principles which... ultimately compose a harmony'\". However, David Daiches, \"in the 1965 Penguin English Library edition referred to Cecil's interpretation as being 'persuasively argued' though not fully acceptable\". The entry on \"Wuthering Heights\" in the 2002 \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\", states that \"the ending of the novel points to a union of 'the two contrasting worlds and moral orders represented by the Heights and the Grange'\".\nInspiration for locations.\nThere is no evidence that either Thrushcross Grange or Wuthering Heights is based on an actual building, but various locations have been speculated as inspirations. Top Withens, a ruined farmhouse in an isolated area near the Haworth Parsonage, was suggested as the model for Wuthering Heights by Ellen Nussey, a friend of Charlotte Bront\u00eb. However, its structure does not match that of the farmhouse described in the novel. High Sunderland Hall, near Law Hill, Halifax where Emily worked briefly as a governess in 1838, now demolished, has also been suggested as a model for Wuthering Heights. However, it is too grand for a farmhouse.\nPonden Hall is famous for reputedly being the inspiration for Thrushcross Grange, since Bront\u00eb was a frequent visitor. However, it does not match the description given in the novel and is closer in size and appearance to the farmhouse of Wuthering Heights. The Bront\u00eb biographer Winifred Gerin believed that Ponden Hall was the original of Wildfell Hall, the old mansion in Anne Bront\u00eb's \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\". Helen Smart, while noting that Thrushcross Grange has \"traditionally been associated with... Ponden Hall, Stanbury, near Haworth\", sees Shibden Hall, Northowram, in Halifax parish, as more likely, referring to Hilda Marsden's article \"The Scenic Background of Wuthering Heights\".\nPoint of view.\nMost of the novel is the story told by housekeeper Nelly Dean to Lockwood, though the novel uses several narrators (in fact, five or six) to place the story in perspective, or in a variety of perspectives. Emily Bront\u00eb uses this frame story technique to narrate most of the story. Thus, for example, Lockwood, the first narrator of the story, tells the story of Nelly, who herself tells the story of another character. The use of a character like Nelly Dean is a literary device, a well-known convention taken from the Gothic novel, the function of which is to portray the events in a more mysterious and exciting manner.\nThus, the point of view comes from:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCritics have questioned the reliability of the two main narrators. The author has been described as sarcastic toward Lockwood, who fancies himself a world-weary romantic but comes across as an effete snob, and there are subtler hints that Nelly's perspective is influenced by her own biases.\nThe narrative in addition includes an excerpt from Catherine Earnshaw's old diary, and short sections narrated by Heathcliff, Isabella, and another servant.\nInfluences.\nBront\u00eb possessed an exceptional education of classical culture for a woman of the time. She was familiar with Greek tragedies and was a good Latinist. In addition she was especially influenced by the poets John Milton and William Shakespeare. There are echoes of and allusions to Shakespeare's tragedies, \"King Lear\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Macbeth\" and \"Hamlet\" in \"Wuthering Heights\".\nAnother major source of information for the Bront\u00ebs was the periodicals that their father read, the \"Leeds Intelligencer\" and \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\". \"Blackwood's Magazine\" provided knowledge of world affairs and was a source of material for the Bront\u00ebs' early writing. Emily Bront\u00eb was probably aware of the debate on evolution. This debate had been launched in 1844 by Robert Chambers. It raised questions of divine providence and the violence which underlies the universe and relationships between living things.\nRomanticism was also a major influence, which included the Gothic novel, the novels of Walter Scott and the poetry of Byron. The Bront\u00ebs' fiction is seen by some feminist critics as prime examples of Female Gothic. It explores the domestic entrapment and subjection of women to patriarchal authority, and the attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Emily Bront\u00eb's Cathy Earnshaw and Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre are both examples of female protagonists in such a role.\nAccording to Juliet Barker, Walter Scott's novel \"Rob Roy\" (1817) had a significant influence on \"Wuthering Heights\", which, though \"regarded as the archetypal Yorkshire novel... owed as much, if not more, to Walter Scott's Border country\". \"Rob Roy\" is set \"in the wilds of Northumberland, among the uncouth and quarrelsome squirearchical Osbaldistones\", while Cathy Earnshaw \"has strong similarities with Diana Vernon, who is equally out of place among her boorish relations\".\nFrom 1833 Charlotte and Branwell's Angrian tales began to feature Byronic heroes. Such heroes had a strong sexual magnetism and passionate spirit, and demonstrated arrogance and black-heartedness. The Bront\u00ebs had discovered Byron in an article in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" from August 1825. Byron had died the previous year. Byron became synonymous with the prohibited and audacious.\nRomance tradition.\nEmily Bront\u00eb wrote in the romance tradition of the novel. Walter Scott defined this as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\". Scott distinguished the \"romance\" from the \"novel\", where (as he saw it) \"events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society\". Scott describes romance as a \"kindred term\" to novel. However, romances such as \"Wuthering Heights\" and Scott's own historical romances and Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" are often referred to as novels. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: \"a novel is , , , \". This sort of romance is different from the genre fiction love romance or romance novel, with its \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending\". Emily Bront\u00eb's approach to the novel form was influenced by the gothic novel.\nGothic novel.\nHorace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto\" (1764) is usually considered the first gothic novel. Walpole's declared aim was to combine elements of the medieval romance, which he deemed too fanciful, and the modern novel, which he considered to be too confined to strict realism.\nMore recently Ellen Moers, in \"Literary Women\", developed a feminist theory that connects female writers such as Emily Bront\u00eb with gothic fiction. Catherine Earnshaw has been identified by some critics as a type of gothic demon because she \"shape-shifts\" in order to marry Edgar Linton, assuming a domesticity that is contrary to her true nature. It has also been suggested that Catherine's relationship with Heathcliff conforms to the \"dynamics of the Gothic romance, in that the woman falls prey to the more or less demonic instincts of her lover, suffers from the violence of his feelings, and at the end is entangled by his thwarted passion\". See also the discussion of the daemonic below, under \"Religion\".\nAt one point in the novel Heathcliff is thought a vampire. It has been suggested that both he and Catherine are in fact meant to be seen as vampire-like personalities.\nBront\u00eb is credited by Syndy McMillen Conger for liberating traditional gothic plot forms, which had become \"overly rigid,\" and for bringing to the gothic tradition an \"aesthetic respectability\". Conger further notes that Catherine Earnshaw is a departure from traditional gothic heroines, who were usually caught between a \"dark seducer\" and a \"fair lover\" in an external conflict, whereas Catherine differs in that she is \"not simply placed between two lovers; she feels divided between two lovers.\"\nThemes.\nMorality.\nSome early Victorian reviewers complained about how \"Wuthering Heights\" dealt with violence and immorality. One called it \"a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors\".\nBront\u00eb was supposedly unaware of \"the limits on polite expression\" expected of Victorian novelists. Her characters use vulgar language, \"cursing and swearing\". Though the daughter of a curate, Bront\u00eb shows little respect for religion in the novel; the only strongly religious character in \"Wuthering Heights\" is Joseph, who is usually seen as satirizing \"the joyless version of Methodism that the Bront\u00eb children were exposed to through their Aunt Branwell\". A major influence on how Bront\u00eb depicts amoral characters was the stories her father Patrick Bront\u00eb told, about \"the doings\" of people around Haworth that his parishioners told him, \"stories which 'made one shiver and shrink from hearing' (Charlotte's friend Ellen Nussey reported)\", which were \"full of grim humour\" and violence, stories Emily Bront\u00eb took \"as a truth\".\nShortly after Emily Bront\u00eb's death G.H. Lewes wrote in \"Leader Magazine\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Curious enough is to read \"Wuthering Heights\" and \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\", and remember that the writers were two retiring, solitary, consumptive girls! Books, coarse even for men, coarse in language and coarse in conception, the coarseness apparently of violence and uncultivated men \u2013 turn out to be the productions of two girls living almost alone, filling their loneliness with quiet studies, and writing their books from a sense of duty, hating the pictures they drew, yet drawing them with austere conscientiousness! There is matter here for the moralist or critic to speculate on.\nReligion.\nEmily Bront\u00eb attended church regularly and came from a religious family. Emily \"never as far as we know, wrote anything which overtly criticised conventional religion. But she also has the reputation of being a rebel and iconoclast, driven by a spirit more pagan than orthodox Christian.\" Derek Traversi, for example, sees in \"Wuthering Heights\" \"a thirst for religious experience, 'which is not Christian'. It is this spirit, which moves Catherine to exclaim, 'surely you and everybody have a notion that there is, or should be, an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation if I were entirely contained here?'\" (Ch. IX).\nThomas John Winnifrith, author of \"The Brontes and Their Background: Romance and Reality\" (Macmillan, 1977), argues that the allusions to Heaven and Hell are more than metaphors, and have a religious significance, because \"for Heathcliff, the loss of Catherine is literally Hell... 'existence after losing her would be Hell' (Ch. xiv, p. 117).\" Likewise, in the final scene between them, Heathcliff writhes \"in the torments of Hell (XV)\".\nDaemonic.\nThe eminent German Lutheran theologian and philosopher Rudolph Otto, author of \"The Idea of the Holy\", saw in \"Wuthering Heights\" \"a supreme example of 'the daemonic' in literature\". Otto links the \"daemonic\" with \"a genuine religious experience\". Lisa Wang argues that in both \"Wuthering Heights\", and in her poetry, Emily Bront\u00eb concentrates on \"the non-conceptual\", or what Rudolf Otto has called 'the non-rational' aspect of religion... the primal nature of religious experience over and above its doctrinal formulations\". This corresponds with the dictionary meaning: \"of or relating to an inner or attendant spirit, esp. as a source of creative inspiration or genius\". This meaning was important to the Romantic movement.\nHowever, the word \"daemon\" can also mean \"a demon or devil\", and that is equally relevant to Heathcliff, whom Peter McInerney describes as \"a Satanic Don Juan\". Heathcliff is also \"dark-skinned\", \"as dark almost as if it came from the devil\". Likewise Charlotte Bront\u00eb described him \"'a man's shape animated by demon life \u2013 a Ghoul \u2013 an Afreet'\". In Arabian mythology an \"afreet\", or ifrit, is a powerful jinn or demon. However, John Bowen believes that \"this is too simple a view\", because the novel presents an alternative explanation of Heathcliff's cruel and sadistic behaviour; that is, that he has suffered terribly: \"is an orphan;... is brutalised by Hindley;... relegated to the status of a servant; Catherine marries Edgar\".\nLove.\nOne 2007 British poll presented \"Wuthering Heights\" as the greatest love story of all time. However, \"some of the novel's admirers consider it not a love story at all but an exploration of evil and abuse\". Helen Small sees \"Wuthering Heights\" as being both \"one of the greatest love stories in the English language\" and at the same time one of the \"most brutal revenge narratives\". Some critics suggest that reading \"Wuthering Heights\" as a love story not only \"romanticizes abusive men and toxic relationships but goes against Bront\u00eb's clear intent\". Moreover, while a \"passionate, doomed, death-transcending relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw Linton forms the core of the novel\", \"Wuthering Heights\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... consistently subverts the romantic narrative. Our first encounter with Heathcliff shows him to be a nasty bully. Later, Bront\u00eb puts in Heathcliff's mouth an explicit warning not to turn him into a Byronic hero: After... Isabella elop[es] with him, he sneers that she did so \"under a delusion... picturing in me a hero of romance\".\n\"I am Heathcliff\" is a frequently quoted phrase from the novel, and \"the idea of... perfect unity between the self and the other is age-old\", so that Catherine says that she loves Heathcliff \"because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same\" (Chapter IX). Likewise Lord David Cecil suggests that \"the deepest attachments are based on characters' similarity or affinity\", However Simone de Beauvoir, in her famous feminist work \"The Second Sex\" (1949), suggests that when Catherine says \"I am Heathcliff\": \"her own world collapse(s) in contingence, for she really lives in his.\" Beauvoir sees this as \"the fatal mirage of the ideal of romantic love... transcendence... in the superior male who is perceived as free\".\nDespite all the passion between Catherine and Heathcliff, critics have from early on drawn attention to the absence of sex. In 1850 the poet and critic Sydney Dobell suggests that \"we dare not doubt [Catherine's] purity\", and the Victorian poet Swinburne concurs, referring to their \"passionate and ardent chastity\". More recently Terry Eagleton suggests their relationship is sexless, \"because the two, unknown to themselves, are half-siblings, with an unconscious fear of incest\".\nChildhood.\nChildhood is a central theme of \"Wuthering Heights\". Emily Bront\u00eb \"understands that 'The Child is 'Father of the Man' (Wordsworth, 'My heart leaps up', 1. 7)\". Wordsworth, following philosophers of education, such as Rousseau, explored ideas about the way childhood shaped personality. One outcome of this was the German , or \"novel of education\", such as Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" (1847), Eliot's \"The Mill on the Floss\" (1860), and Dickens's \"Great Expectations\" (1861). Bronte's characters \"are heavily influenced by their childhood experiences\", though she is less optimistic than her contemporaries that suffering can lead to \"change and renewal\".\nClass and money.\nLockwood arrives at Thrushcross Grange in 1801, a time when, according to Q.D. Leavis, \"the old rough farming culture, based on a naturally patriarchal family life, was to be challenged, tamed and routed by social and cultural changes\". At this date the Industrial Revolution was well under way, and was by 1847 a dominant force in much of England, and especially in West Yorkshire. This caused a disruption in \"the traditional relationship of social classes\" with an expanding upwardly mobile middle-class, which created \"a new standard for defining a gentleman\", and challenged the traditional criteria of breeding and family and the more recent criterion of character.\nMarxist critic Arnold Kettle sees \"Wuthering Heights\" \"as a symbolic representation of the class system of 19th-century England\", with its concerns \"with property-ownership, the attraction of social comforts\", marriage, education, religion, and social status. Driven by a pathological hatred Heathcliff uses against his enemies \"their own weapons of money and arranged marriages\", as well as \"the classic methods of the ruling class, expropriation and property deals\".\nLater, another Marxist, Terry Eagleton, in \"Myths of Power: A Marxist Study of the Bront\u00ebs\" (London: McMillan, 1975), further explores the power relationships between \"the landed gentry and aristocracy, the traditional power-holders, and the capitalist, industrial middle classes\". Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire was especially affected by changes to society and its class structure \"because of the concentration of large estates and industrial centers\" there.\nRace.\nThere has been debate about Heathcliff's race or ethnicity. In the novel Heathcliff is first described as a \"dark-skinned gipsy\" in appearance with \"black eyes\", as well as later being said to be \"as white as the wall behind him\" and \"pale...with an\nexpression of mortal hate.\". Mr Linton, the Earnshaws' neighbour, suggests that he might be \"a little Lascar (a 19th-century term for Indian sailors;), or an American or Spanish castaway\". Mr Earnshaw calls him \"as dark almost as if it came from the devil\", and Nelly Dean speculates fancifully regarding his origins thus: \"Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen?\" Novelist Caryl Phillips suggests that Heathcliff may have been an escaped slave, noting the similarities between the way Heathcliff is treated and the way slaves were treated at the time: he is referred to as \"it\", his name \"served him\" as both his \"Christian and surname\", and Mr Earnshaw is referred to as \"his owner\". Maja-Lisa von Sneidern states that \"Heathcliff's racial otherness cannot be a matter of dispute; Bront\u00eb makes that explicit\", further noting that \"by 1804 Liverpool merchants were responsible for more than eighty-four percent of the British transatlantic slave trade.\" Michael Stewart sees Heathcliff's race as \"ambiguous\" and argues that Emily Bront\u00eb \"deliberately gives us this missing hole in the narrative\".\nStorm and calm.\nVarious critics have explored the various contrast between Thrushcross Grange and the Wuthering Heights farmhouse and their inhabitants. Lord David Cecil argued for \"cosmic forces as the central impetus and controlling force in the novel\" and suggested that there is a unifying structure underlying \"Wuthering Heights\": \"two spiritual principles: the principle of the storm... and the principle of calm\", which he further argued were not, \"in spite of their apparent opposition\", in conflict. Dorothy Van Ghent, however, refers to \"a tension between two kinds of reality\" in the novel: \"civilized manners\" and \"natural energies\".\nAdaptations.\nFilm and TV.\nThe earliest known film adaptation of \"Wuthering Heights\" was filmed in England in 1920 and was directed by A. V. Bramble. It is unknown if any prints still exist. The most famous is 1939's \"Wuthering Heights\", starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon and directed by William Wyler. This acclaimed adaptation, like many others, eliminated the second generation's story (young Cathy, Linton and Hareton) and is rather inaccurate as a literary adaptation. It won the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film and was nominated for the 1939 Academy Award for Best Picture.\nNigel Kneale's script was produced for BBC Television twice, first in 1953, starring Richard Todd as Heathcliff and Yvonne Mitchell as Cathy. Broadcast live, no recordings of the production are known to exist. The second adaptation using Kneale's script was in 1962, starring Claire Bloom as Catherine and Keith Michell as Heathcliff. This production does exist with the BFI, but has been withheld from public viewing. Kneale's script was also adapted for Australian television in 1959 during a time when original drama productions in the country were rare. Broadcast live from Sydney, the performance was telerecorded, although it is unknown if this kinescope still exists.\nIn 1958, an adaptation aired on CBS television as part of the series \"DuPont Show of the Month\" starring Rosemary Harris as Cathy and Richard Burton as Heathcliff. The BBC produced a four-part television dramatisation in 1967 starring Ian McShane and Angela Scoular.\n\"Les Hauts de Hurlevent\" is a French mini-series in six 26-minute episodes, in black and white, created and directed by Jean-Paul Carr\u00e8re based on the novel, and broadcast between 1964 and 1968 on the first ORTF channel.\nThe 1970 film with Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff is the first colour version of the novel. It has gained acceptance over the years although it was initially poorly received. The character of Hindley is portrayed much more sympathetically, and his story-arc is altered. It also subtly suggests that Heathcliff may be Cathy's illegitimate half-brother.\nIn 1978, the BBC produced a five-part TV serialisation of the book starring Ken Hutchinson, Kay Adshead and John Duttine, with music by Carl Davis; it is considered one of the most faithful adaptations of Emily Bront\u00eb's story.\nThere is also a 1985 French film adaptation, \"Hurlevent\" by Jacques Rivette, and a 1988 Japanese film adaptation by Yoshishige Yoshida.\nThe 1992 film \"Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights\" starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche is notable for including the oft-omitted second generation story of the children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff.\nMore recent film or TV adaptations include ITV's 2009 two-part drama series starring Tom Hardy, Charlotte Riley, Sarah Lancashire, and Andrew Lincoln, and the 2011 film starring Kaya Scodelario and James Howson and directed by Andrea Arnold.\nAdaptations that place the story in a new setting include the 1954 adaptation, retitled \"Abismos de pasi\u00f3n,\" directed by Spanish filmmaker Luis Bu\u00f1uel and set in Catholic Mexico, with Heathcliff and Cathy renamed Alejandro and Catalina. In Bu\u00f1uel's version Heathcliff/Alejandro claims to have become rich by making a deal with Satan. The \"New York Times\" reviewed a re-release of this film as \"an almost magical example of how an artist of genius can take someone else's classic work and shape it to fit his own temperament without really violating it,\" noting that the film was thoroughly Spanish and Catholic in its tone while still highly faithful to Bront\u00eb. Yoshishige Yoshida's 1988 adaptation also has a transposed setting, this time to medieval Japan. In Yoshida's version, the Heathcliff character, Onimaru, is raised in a nearby community of priests who worship a local fire god. Filipino director Carlos Siguion-Reyna made a film adaptation titled \"Hihintayin Kita sa Langit\" (1991). The screenplay was written by Raquel Villavicencio and produced by Armida Siguion-Reyna. It starred Richard Gomez as Gabriel (Heathcliff) and Dawn Zulueta as Carmina (Catherine). It became a Filipino film classic.\nIn 2003, MTV produced a poorly reviewed version set in a modern California high school.\nWuthering High, a 2015 TV Movie shown on Lifetime, is set in Malibu, California.\nThe 1966 Hindi film \"Dil Diya Dard Liya\" is based upon the novel. The film is directed by Abdul Rashid Kardar and Dilip Kumar. The film stars Dilip Kumar, Waheeda Rehman, Pran, Rehman, Shyama and Johnny Walker. The music is by Naushad. Although it did not fare as well as other movies of Dilip Kumar, it was well received by critics.\nThe 2000 Hindi film Dhadkan is also based upon this novel. Directed by Dharmesh Darshan and produced by Ratan Jain, it stars Akshay Kumar, Shilpa Shetty, Sunil Shetty and Mahima Chaudhry.\nIn 2022, Emma Mackey starred in a biopic of Emily Bront\u00eb in \"Emily\". The film charts the life of Bront\u00eb and the inspiration she gained for writing Wuthering Heights living in the Yorkshire countryside.\nIn July 2024, it was announced that Emerald Fennell was set to direct and write a new film adaptation of the novel for Warner Bros. starring Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff. The film is set to be released in theatres on 13 February 2026.\nTheatre.\nThe novel has been adapted as operas composed by Bernard Herrmann, Carlisle Floyd, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chaslin (most cover only the first half of the book) and a musical by Bernard J. Taylor.\nIn 2021, Emma Rice directed a theatrical version that was shown online and at the Bristol Old Vic. This production was then put on at the National Theatre in 2022.\nWorks inspired by \"Wuthering Heights\".\nLiterature.\nMizumura Minae's \"A True Novel\" () (2002) is inspired by \"Wuthering Heights\" and might be called an adaptation of the story in a post-World War II Japanese setting.\nIn Jane Urquhart's \"Changing Heaven\", the novel \"Wuthering Heights\", as well as the ghost of Emily Bront\u00eb, feature as prominent roles in the narrative.\nMichael Stewart's 2018 novel 'Ill Will' is a first-person narrative of Heathcliff's missing years from 1780 \nIn her 2019 novel, \"The West Indian\", Valerie Browne Lester imagines an origin story for Heathcliff in 1760s Jamaica.\nK-Ming Chang's 2021 chapbook \"Bone House\" was released by Bull City Press as part of their \"Inch\" series. The collection functions as a queer Taiwanese-American retelling of \"Wuthering Heights\", in which an unnamed narrator moves into a butcher's mansion \"with a life of its own.\"\nCanadian author Hilary Scharper's ecogothic novel \"Perdita\" (2013) was deeply influenced by \"Wuthering Heights,\" namely in terms of the narrative role of powerful, cruel and desolate landscapes.\nThe poem \"Wuthering\" (2017) by Tanya Grae uses \"Wuthering Heights\" as an allegory.\nMaryse Cond\u00e9's \"Windward Heights\" () (1995) is a reworking of \"Wuthering Heights\" set in Cuba and Guadeloupe at the turn of the 20th century, which Cond\u00e9 stated she intended as an homage to Bront\u00eb.\nIn 2011, a graphic novel version was published by Classical Comics. It was adapted by Scottish writer Sean Michael Wilson and hand painted by comic book veteran artist John M. Burns. This version, which stays close to the original novel, was shortlisted for the Stan Lee Excelsior Awards.\nMusic.\nKate Bush's 1978 song \"Wuthering Heights\" is most likely the best-known creative work inspired by Bront\u00eb's story that is not properly an \"adaptation\". Bush wrote the song when she was 18 and chose it as the lead single from her debut album. It was primarily inspired by her viewing of the 1967 BBC adaptation. The song is sung from Catherine's point of view as she pleads at Heathcliff's window to be admitted. It uses quotations from Catherine, both in the chorus (\"Let me in! I'm so cold!\") and the verses, with Catherine admitting she had \"bad dreams in the night\". Critic Sheila Whiteley wrote that the ethereal quality of the vocal resonates with Cathy's dementia, and that Bush's high register has both \"childlike qualities in its purity of tone\" and an \"underlying eroticism in its sinuous erotic contours\". Singer Pat Benatar covered the song in 1980 on her \"Crimes of Passion\" album. Brazilian heavy metal band Angra released a version of Bush's song on its debut album \"Angels Cry\" in 1993. A 2018 cover of Bush's \"Wuthering Heights\" by Jimmy Urine adds electropunk elements.\n\"Wind &amp; Wuthering\" (1976) by English rock band Genesis alludes to the Bront\u00eb novel not only in the album's title but also in the titles of two of its tracks, \"Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...\" and \"...In That Quiet Earth\". Both titles refer to the closing lines of the novel.\nSongwriter Jim Steinman said that he wrote the 1989 song \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" \"while under the influence of \"Wuthering Heights\"\". He said that the song was \"about being enslaved and obsessed by love\" and compared it to \"Heathcliff digging up Cathy's corpse and dancing with it in the cold moonlight\".\nThe 2008 song \"Cath...\" by indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie was inspired by \"Wuthering Heights\".\nWuthering Heights is also the name of a Danish-Swedish power metal band.\nIn 2024 an indie band \"Mili\" released a single \"Through Patches of Violet\". The song features some themes that Wuthering Heights carries, mainly \u2013 poorly communicated love. Two voices, sung by Cassie Wei, are Heathcliff and Catherine. Originally made for a game \"Limbus Company\", which features Wuthering Heights's other characters and story elements.\nIn November 2025, Charli XCX announced her album \"Wuthering Heights\", born out of her work on Fennell's film adaptation, to be released on 13 February 2026, coinciding with the release of the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55438", "revid": "2200081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55438", "title": "Jane Eyre", "text": "1847 novel by Charlotte Bront\u00eb\nJane Eyre ( ; originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by the English writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb. It was published under her pen name \"Currer Bell\" on 19\u00a0October 1847 by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. of London. The first American edition was published in January 1848 by Harper &amp; Brothers of New York. \"Jane Eyre\" is a bildungsroman that follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.\nThe novel revolutionised prose fiction, being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its protagonist through an intimate first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Bront\u00eb has been called the \"first historian of the private consciousness\" and the literary ancestor of writers such as Marcel Proust and James Joyce.\nThe book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and it is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism. \"Jane Eyre\", along with Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\", is one of the most famous romance novels. It is considered one of the greatest novels in the English language, and in 2003 was ranked as the tenth best-loved book in Britain by the BBC in The Big Read poll.\nPlot.\n\"Jane Eyre\" is divided into 38 chapters. It was originally published in three volumes in the 19th century, consisting of chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.\nThe second edition was dedicated to William Makepeace Thackeray.\nThe novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of George III (1760\u20131820). It has five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections it provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.\nThe five stages of Jane's life are as follows:\nGateshead Hall.\nJane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane was orphaned several years earlier when her parents died of typhus. Jane's uncle, Mr Reed, was the only one in the Reed family who was kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her and treats her as a burden. Mrs Reed also discourages her three children from associating with Jane. As a result Jane becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane lives an unhappy childhood.\nOne day, as punishment for defending herself against the bullying of her 14-year-old cousin John, the Reeds' only son, Jane is locked in the \"red room\" in which her late uncle had died; there she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the \"ambiguous relationship between parents and children\" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel. She is subsequently attended to by the kindly apothecary, Mr Lloyd, to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs Reed happily supports.\nMrs Reed then enlists the aid of the harsh Mr Brocklehurst, the director of Lowood Institution, a charity school for girls, to enroll Jane. Mrs Reed cautions Mr Brocklehurst that Jane has a \"tendency to deceit\", which he interprets as Jane being a liar. Before Jane leaves, however, she confronts Mrs Reed and declares that she'll never call her \"aunt\" again. Jane also tells Mrs Reed and her daughters, Georgiana and Eliza, that they are the ones who are deceitful, and that she will tell everyone at Lowood how cruelly the Reeds treated her. Mrs Reed is hurt badly by these words but has neither the courage nor the tenacity to show it.\nLowood Institution.\nAt Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh. She attempts to fit in and befriends an older girl, Helen Burns. During a class session her new friend is criticised for her poor stance and dirty nails and receives a lashing as a result. Later Jane tells Helen that she could not have borne such public humiliation, but Helen philosophically tells her that it would be her duty to do so. Jane then tells Helen how badly she has been treated by Mrs Reed, but Helen tells her that she would be far happier if she did not bear grudges.\nIn due course Mr Brocklehurst visits the school. While Jane is trying to make herself look inconspicuous, she accidentally drops her slate, thereby drawing attention to herself. She is then forced to stand on a stool and is branded a sinner and a liar. Later Miss Temple, the caring superintendent, facilitates Jane's self-defence and publicly clears her of any wrongdoing. Helen and Miss Temple are Jane's two main role models who positively guide her development despite the harsh treatment she has received from many others.\nThe 80 pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals and thin clothing. Many students fall ill when a typhus epidemic strikes; Helen dies of consumption in Jane's arms. When Mr Brocklehurst's maltreatment of the pupils is discovered, several benefactors erect a new building and install a sympathetic management committee to moderate Mr Brocklehurst's harsh rule. Conditions at the school then improve dramatically.\nThornfield Hall.\nAfter six years as a pupil and two as a teacher at Lowood, Jane decides to leave in pursuit of a new life, growing bored with her life at Lowood. Her friend and confidante, Miss Temple, also leaves after getting married. Jane advertises her services as a governess in a newspaper. The housekeeper at Thornfield Hall, Alice Fairfax, replies to Jane's advertisement. Jane takes the position, teaching Ad\u00e8le Varens, a young French girl.\nOne night, while Jane is carrying a letter to the post from Thornfield, a horseman and dog pass her. The horse slips on ice and throws the rider. Despite the rider's surliness, Jane helps him get back onto his horse. Later, back at Thornfield, she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. Ad\u00e8le was left in his care when her mother, a famous dancer, abandoned her. It is not immediately apparent whether Ad\u00e8le is Rochester's daughter.\nAt Jane's first meeting with Mr Rochester he teases her, accusing her of bewitching his horse to make him fall. Jane stands up to his initially arrogant manner. Despite his strange behaviour, Mr Rochester and Jane soon come to enjoy each other's company and they spend many evenings together.\nOdd things start to happen at the house, such as a strange laugh being heard, a mysterious fire in Mr Rochester's room (from which Jane saves Rochester by rousing him and throwing water on him) and an attack on a house-guest named Mr Mason.\nAfter Jane saves Mr Rochester from the fire, he thanks her tenderly and emotionally, and that night Jane feels strange emotions of her own towards him. The next day, however, he leaves unexpectedly for a distant party and several days later returns with the whole party, including the beautiful and talented Blanche Ingram. Just as she realises that she is in love with Mr Rochester, Jane sees that he and Blanche favour each other and starts to feel jealous, particularly because she also sees that Blanche is snobbish and heartless.\nJane then receives word that Mrs Reed has suffered a stroke and is calling for her. Jane returns to Gateshead Hall and remains there for a month to tend to her dying aunt. Mrs Reed confesses to Jane that she wronged her, bringing forth a letter from Jane's paternal uncle, Mr John Eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir. Mrs Reed admits to telling Mr Eyre that Jane had died of fever at Lowood. Soon afterward Mrs Reed dies, and Jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to Thornfield.\nBack at Thornfield Jane broods over Mr Rochester's rumoured impending marriage to Blanche Ingram. However one midsummer evening Rochester baits Jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married and how she will soon forget him. The normally self-controlled Jane reveals her feelings for him. To her surprise, Rochester reciprocates, having courted Blanche only to make Jane jealous, and proposes marriage. Jane is at first sceptical of his sincerity, before accepting his proposal. She then writes to her Uncle John, telling him of her happy news.\nAs she prepares for her wedding Jane's forebodings arise when a strange woman sneaks into her room one night and rips Jane's wedding veil in two. As with the previous mysterious events, Mr Rochester attributes the incident to Grace Poole, one of his servants. During the wedding ceremony, however, Mr Mason and a lawyer declare that Mr Rochester cannot marry because he is already married to Mr Mason's sister, Bertha. Mr Rochester admits this is true but explains that his father tricked him into the marriage for her money. Once they were united he discovered that she was rapidly descending into congenital madness, and so he eventually locked her away in Thornfield, hiring Grace Poole as a nurse to look after her. When Grace gets drunk, Rochester's wife escapes and causes the strange happenings at Thornfield.\nIt turns out that Jane's uncle, Mr John Eyre, is a friend of Mr Mason's and was visited by him soon after Mr Eyre received Jane's letter about her impending marriage. After the marriage ceremony is broken off, Mr Rochester asks Jane to go with him to the south of France and live with him as husband and wife, even though they cannot be married. Jane is tempted but realises that she will lose herself and her integrity if she allows her passion for a married man to consume her and she must stay true to her Christian values and beliefs. Refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for Rochester, Jane leaves Thornfield Hall at dawn before anyone else is up.\nMoor House.\nJane travels as far from Thornfield Hall as she can using the little money she had previously saved. She accidentally leaves her bundle of possessions on the coach and is forced to sleep on the moor. She unsuccessfully attempts to trade her handkerchief and gloves for food. Exhausted and starving, she eventually makes her way to the home of Diana and Mary Rivers but is turned away by the housekeeper. She collapses on the doorstep, preparing for her death. Clergyman St John Rivers, Diana and Mary's brother, rescues her. After Jane regains her health, St John finds her a teaching position at a nearby village school. Jane becomes good friends with the sisters, but St John remains aloof.\nThe sisters leave for governess jobs, and St John becomes slightly closer to Jane. St John learns Jane's true identity and astounds her by telling her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died and left her his entire fortune of 20,000 pounds (equivalent to US $2.24 million in 2022). When Jane questions him further, St John reveals that John Eyre is also his and his sisters' uncle. They had once hoped for a share of the inheritance but were left virtually nothing. Jane, overjoyed by finding that she has living and friendly family members, insists on sharing the money equally with her cousins, and Diana and Mary come back to live at Moor House.\nProposals.\nThinking that the pious and conscientious Jane will make a suitable missionary's wife, St John asks her to marry him and to go with him to India, not out of love, but out of duty. Jane initially accepts going to India but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting they travel as brother and sister. As Jane's resolve against marriage to St John begins to weaken, she seems to hear Mr Rochester's voice calling her name. Jane then returns to Thornfield Hall to see if Rochester is all right, only to find blackened ruins. She learns that Rochester sent Mrs Fairfax into retirement and Ad\u00e8le to school a few months following her departure. Shortly afterwards, his wife set the house on fire and died after jumping from the roof. While saving the servants and attempting to rescue his wife, Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight.\nJane reunites with Rochester, and he is overjoyed at her return, but fears that she will be repulsed by his condition. \"Am I hideous, Jane?\", he asks. \"Very, sir; you always were, you know\", she replies. Now a humbled man, Rochester vows to live a purer life, and reveals that he has intensely pined for Jane ever since she left. He had even called out her name in despair one night, the very call that she heard from Moor House, and heard her reply from miles away, signifying the connection between them. Jane asserts herself as a financially independent woman and assures him of her love, declaring that she will never leave him. Rochester proposes again, and they are married. The narrator breaks the fourth wall and in a famous metafictional manner directly addresses the reader: \"Reader, I married him.\" They live blissfully together in an old house in the woods called Ferndean Manor. The couple stay in touch with Ad\u00e8le as she grows up, as well as Diana and Mary, who each gain loving husbands of their own. St John moves to India to accomplish his missionary goals, but is implied to have fallen gravely ill there. Rochester regains sight in one eye two years after his and Jane's marriage, enabling him to see their newborn son.\nMajor characters.\nIn order of first line of dialogue:\nContext.\nThe early sequences, in which Jane is sent to Lowood, a harsh boarding school, are derived from the author's own experiences. Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, near Tunstall, Lancashire. Mr Brocklehurst is based on Rev. William Carus Wilson (1791\u20131859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed's decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte's brother Branwell, who became an opium and alcohol addict in the years preceding his death. Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became a governess. These facts were revealed to the public in \"The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\" (1857) by Charlotte's friend and fellow novelist Elizabeth Gaskell.\nThe Gothic manor of Thornfield Hall was probably inspired by North Lees Hall, near Hathersage in the Peak District in Derbyshire. This was visited by Charlotte Bront\u00eb and her friend Ellen Nussey in the summer of 1845, and is described by the latter in a letter dated 22 July 1845. It was the residence of the Eyre family, and its first owner, Agnes Ashurst, was reputedly confined as a lunatic in a padded second floor room. It has been suggested that the Wycoller Hall in Lancashire, close to Haworth, provided the setting for Ferndean Manor to which Mr Rochester retreats after the fire at Thornfield: there are similarities between the owner of Ferndean\u2014Mr Rochester's father\u2014and Henry Cunliffe, who inherited Wycoller in the 1770s and lived there until his death in 1818; one of Cunliffe's relatives was named Elizabeth Eyre (n\u00e9e Cunliffe). The sequence in which Mr Rochester's wife sets fire to the bed curtains was prepared in an August 1830 homemade publication of Bront\u00eb's \"The Young Men's Magazine, Number 2\". Charlotte Bront\u00eb began composing \"Jane Eyre\" in Manchester, and she likely envisioned Manchester Cathedral churchyard as the burial place for Jane's parents and Manchester as the birthplace of Jane herself.\nAdaptations and influence.\nThe novel has been adapted into a number of other forms, including theatre, film, television, and at least three full-length operas. The novel has also been the subject of a number of significant rewritings and related interpretations, notably Jean Rhys's seminal 1966 novel \"Wide Sargasso Sea\".\nA famous line in the book is at the beginning of Chapter 38: \"Reader, I married him.\" Many authors have used a variation of this line in their work. For example, Liane Moriarty discussed and used the line in her 2018 novel \"Nine Perfect Strangers\".\nThe book \"Reader, I Married Him: Stories inspired by Jane Eyre\", a 2016 anthology of short stories, edited by Tracy Chevalier, was also inspired by this line. It was commissioned to mark the 200th anniversary of Bront\u00eb's birth, and is published by The Borough Press, an imprint of HarperCollins.\nThai novel \"Ruk Diow Kong Jenjira\" was adapted by Nida in 1993. In 1996, it was made into a television drama on Channel 3 starred by Willie McIntosh and Sirilak Pongchoke.\nThe novel \"The French Dancer's Bastard\", by Emma Tennant, reimagines the back story of Ad\u00e8le, exploring whether she was Rochester's love child and what her relationship with Jane Eyre is.\nThe most recent film adaptation, \"Jane Eyre\", was released in 2011, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, and starred Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester. The film, actors, and costume design team were nominated and won various awards from 2011 to 2012.\nReception.\nContemporary reviews.\n\"Jane Eyre\"'s initial reception contrasts starkly to its reputation today. In 1848, Elizabeth Rigby (later Elizabeth Eastlake), reviewing \"Jane Eyre\" in \"The Quarterly Review\", found it \"pre-eminently an anti-Christian composition,\" declaring: \"We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine abroad, and fostered Chartism and rebellion at home, is the same which has also written \"Jane Eyre.\"\"\nAn anonymous review in \"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction\" writes of \"the extraordinary daring of the writer of \"Jane Eyre\"\"; however, the review is mostly critical, summarising: \"There is not a single natural character throughout the work. Everybody moves on stilts\u2014the opinions are bad\u2014the notions absurd. Religion is stabbed in the dark\u2014our social distinctions attempted to be levelled, and all absurdly moral notions done away with.\"\nThere were some who felt more positive about the novel contemporaneously. George Henry Lewes said, \"It reads like a page out of one's own life; and so do many other pages in the book.\" Another critic from the \"Atlas\" wrote, \"It is full of youthful vigour, of freshness and originality, of nervous diction and concentrated interest ...It is a book to make the pulses gallop and the heart beat, and to fill the eyes with tears.\"\nA review in \"The Era\" praised the novel, calling it \"an extraordinary book\", observing that \"there is much to ponder over, rejoice over, and weep over, in its ably-written pages. Much of the heart laid bare, and the mind explored; much of greatness in affliction, and littleness in the ascendant; much of trial and temptation, of fortitude and resignation, of sound sense and Christianity\u2014but no tameness.\"\n\"The People's Journal\" compliments the novel's vigour, stating that \"the reader never tires, never sleeps: the swell and tide of an affluent existence, an irresistible energy, bears him onward, from first to last. It is impossible to deny that the author possesses native power in an uncommon degree\u2014showing itself now in rapid headlong recital, now in stern, fierce, daring dashes in portraiture\u2014anon in subtle, startling mental anatomy\u2014here in a grand illusion, there in an original metaphor\u2014again in a wild gush of genuine poetry.\"\nAmerican publication \"The Nineteenth Century\" defended the novel against accusations of immorality, describing it as \"a work which has produced a decided sensation in this country and in England... \"Jane Eyre\" has made its mark upon the age, and even palsied the talons of mercenary criticism. Yes, critics hired to abuse or panegyrize, at so much per line, have felt a throb of human feeling pervade their veins, at the perusal of \"Jane Eyre\". This is extraordinary\u2014almost preternatural\u2014smacking strongly of the miraculous\u2014and yet it is true... We have seen \"Jane Eyre\" put down, as a work of gross immorality, and its author described as the very incarnation of sensualism. To any one, who has read the work, this may look ridiculous, and yet it is true.\"\n\"The Indicator\", concerning speculation regarding the gender of the author, wrote, \"We doubt not it will soon cease to be a secret; but on one assertion we are willing to risk our critical reputation\u2014and that is, that no woman wrote it. This was our decided conviction at the first perusal, and a somewhat careful study of the work has strengthened it. No woman in all the annals of feminine celebrity ever wrote such a style, terse yet eloquent, and filled with energy bordering sometimes almost on rudeness: no woman ever conceived such masculine characters as those portrayed here.\"\nTwentieth century.\nLiterary critic Jerome Beaty believed the close first-person perspective leaves the reader \"too uncritically accepting of her worldview\", and often leads reading and conversation about the novel towards supporting Jane, regardless of how irregular her ideas or perspectives are.\nIn 2003, the novel was ranked number 10 in the BBC's survey The Big Read, a survey to find British people's favourite novel.\nGenres.\nRomance.\nBefore the Victorian era, Jane Austen wrote literary fiction that influenced later popular fiction, as did the work of the Bront\u00eb sisters produced in the 1840s. Bront\u00eb's love romance incorporates elements of both the gothic novel and Elizabethan drama, and \"demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form.\"\nGothic.\nThe Gothic genre uses a combination of supernatural features, intense emotions, and a blend of reality and fantasy to create a dark, mysterious atmosphere and experience for characters and readers. Jane Eyre is a homodiegetic narrator, which allows her to exist both as a character and narrator in the story world, and her narration establishes an emotional connection and response for the reader. This intentional, narrative technique works in tandem with Gothic features and conventions. Jane and the reader are unaware of the cause behind the \"demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep\" or \"a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall,\" though the reason comes from Bertha Mason. The element of the unknown works in conjunction to the possibility of the supernatural. The intensity of emotions and reactions to Gothic conventions can solely exist in the protagonist's imagination. Instances that a protagonist interprets to be their imagination turns into reality. Jane's experience in the red room represents an aspect of Gothic conventions as Jane feels fear towards being punished in the red room because she believes and imagines that her dead uncle haunts the room.\nThe Gothic genre uses the Gothic double: a literary motif, which is described as the protagonist having a double, alter ego, or doppelg\u00e4nger interpreted between Jane Eyre and Bertha Mason, where Bertha represents the other side of Jane and vice versa. The commonly used Gothic literary device, foreshadowing, creates an environment filled with tension, ominousity, and dread. After Jane agrees to marry Rochester, a horse-chestnut tree in an orchard is struck by lightning, splitting the tree in half. The lightning strike is ominous and foreshadows Jane and Rochester's separation.\nThe Gothic Genre in tandem with Murphy's the \"New Woman Gothic\" establishes an opportunity to go against the Romantic's concept that the antagonist is usually a villainous father. The Gothic genre allows there to be a complex consideration of who or what hinders Jane's happiness. The barriers Jane experiences, whether related to social class, societal and cultural norms, Bertha Mason, or Rochester, have antagonistic elements.\nBildungsroman.\nThe Bildungsroman representation in \"Jane Eyre\" uses romantic elements that emphasise the journey of one pursuing the discovery of one's identity and knowledge. Jane Eyre desires the thrill and action that comes from being an active individual in society, and she refuses to allow the concept of gender and class to hinder her.\nBildungsroman was primarily viewed through male life progression, but feminist scholars have worked to counteract the male norm of bildungsroman by including female development. Experiences that deem a female narrative to be bildungsroman would be the female protagonist discovering how to manage living in a restrictive society. The novel's setting is the English society of the early 19th century, and with that time setting come specific restrictions women encountered during that time, such as the law of coverture, the lack of rights, and the restricted expectations placed on women. Jane Eyre does not specifically and directly deal with the restrictions of, for example coverture, but her character lives in a society where coverture exists, which inadvertently impacts social and cultural norms and expectations. Progression in the bildungsroman does not necessarily occur in a linear direction. Many narratives that employ bildungsroman do so through the protagonist's development of maturity, which is represented through the protagonist's experiences from childhood to adulthood; this progression is in conjunction with the novel's narrative technique set as an autobiography. Temporally, the beginning of the novel begins with Jane at age ten and ends with Jane at age thirty, but Jane's development of maturity goes beyond her age. For example, Jane's emotional intelligence grows through her friendship with Helen Burns as Jane experiences and processes the loss of her friendship with Helen.\nMany times, the 19th-century female bildungsroman can be interpreted as the heroine's growth of self and education in the context of prospective marriage, especially when, in the context of 19th-century womanhood, a wife experiences new knowledge in the private sphere of her role. Jane develops knowledge and experience regarding a romantic journey before her almost marriage to Mr. Rochester; a physical, spiritual, and financial knowledge during her time with St. John; and lastly, with her marriage with Mr. Rochester at the end of the novel. Jane's search for excitement and understanding of life goes beyond her romantic journey. In the text, Jane's childhood beliefs about religion, as seen in her interactions with Mr. Brocklehurt, shift considerably in comparison to her friendship with Helen in Lowood as a child and in her marital and missionary rejection of St. John as an adult woman.\nThemes.\nRace.\nThroughout the novel there are frequent themes relating to ideas of ethnicity (specifically that of Bertha), which are a reflection of the society that the novel is set within. Mr Rochester claims to have been forced to take on a \"mad\" Creole wife, a woman who grew up in the West Indies, and who is thought to be of mixed-race descent. In the analysis of several scholars, Bertha plays the role of the racialised \"other\" through the shared belief that she chose to follow in the footsteps of her parents. Her apparent mental instability casts her as someone who is incapable of restraining herself, almost forced to submit to the different vices she is a victim of. Many writers of the period believed that one could develop mental instability or mental illnesses simply based on their race.\nThis means that those who were born of ethnicities associated with a darker complexion, or those who were not fully of European descent, were believed to be more mentally unstable than their white European counterparts were. According to American scholar Susan Meyer, in writing \"Jane Eyre\", Bront\u00eb was responding to the \"seemingly inevitable\" analogy in 19th-century European texts which \"[compared] white women with blacks in order to degrade both groups and assert the need for white male control\". Bertha serves as an example of both the multiracial population and of a 'clean' European, as she is seemingly able to pass as a white woman for the most part, but also is hinted towards being of an 'impure' race since she does not come from a purely white or European lineage. The title that she is given by others of being a Creole woman leaves her a stranger where she is not black but is also not considered to be white enough to fit into higher society.\nUnlike Bertha, Jane Eyre is thought of as being sound of mind before the reader is able to fully understand the character, simply because she is described as having a complexion that is pale and she has grown up in a European society rather than in an \"animalistic\" setting like Bertha. Jane is favoured heavily from the start of her interactions with Rochester, simply because like Rochester himself, she is deemed to be of a superior ethnic group than that of his first wife. While she still experiences some forms of repression throughout her life (the events of the Lowood Institution) none of them are as heavily taxing on her as that which is experienced by Bertha. Both women go through acts of suppression on behalf of the men in their lives, yet Jane is looked at with favour because of her supposed \"beauty\" that can be found in the colour of her skin. While both are characterised as falling outside of the normal feminine standards of this time, Jane is thought of as superior to Bertha because she demands respect and is able to use her talents as a governess, whereas Bertha is seen as a creature to be confined in the attic away from \"polite\" society.\nScholars have also noted the novel's overt references and allusions to slavery, arguably its North American iteration.\n\"Wide Sargasso Sea\".\nJean Rhys intended her critically acclaimed novel \"Wide Sargasso Sea\" as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic. The book won the notable WH Smith Literary Award in 1967. Rhys explores themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as \"The Madwoman in the Attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in \"Jane Eyre\".\nFeminism.\nThe idea of the equality of men and women emerged more strongly in the Victorian period in Britain, after works by earlier writers, such as Mary Wollstonecraft. R. B. Martin described \"Jane Eyre\" as the first major feminist novel, \"although there is not a hint in the book of any desire for political, legal, educational, or even intellectual equality between the sexes.\" This is illustrated in chapter 23, when Jane responds to Rochester's callous and indirect proposal:\nDo you think I am an automaton? a machine without feelings?...Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong\u2014I have as much soul as you,\u2014and full as much heart...I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;\u2014it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,\u2014as we are.\nThe novel \"acted as a catalyst\" to feminist criticism with the publication by S. Gilbert and S. Gubar's \"The Madwoman in the Attic\" (1979), the title of which alludes to Rochester's wife. The Bront\u00ebs' fictions were cited by feminist critic Ellen Moers as prime examples of Female Gothic, exploring woman's entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority, and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Both \"Wuthering Heights\" and \"Jane Eyre\" explore this theme.\nSocial class.\nThroughout the novel, Jane undergoes various social class transitions, in response to her life's varying situations. As a child, she mixes with middle class people through the Reed family, though Jane is not at the same level of social class as the rest of the Reed family. While at Lowood, she experiences the life of children whose guardians can afford the school fees of \"fifteen pounds per year\" but nonetheless are \"charity children\" \"because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching\", living in poor conditions, and later working there as an adult as a teacher on a salary of fifteen pounds. She has an opportunity to be a private governess, and in so doing double her salary, but her governess position makes her aware of her ambiguous social position as a governess to a child with a wealthy guardian. After Jane leaves Thornfield Hall, she is stripped of her class identity as she travels across the moors and arrives at Moor House. But Jane receives an inheritance which she shares with her new-found family, and this offers a different form of independence.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1905, she became the second female Nobel laureate (after Marie Curie in 1903), the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the first Austrian and Czech laureate.\nEarly life.\nBertha Kinsk\u00fd was born on 9 June 1843 at Kinsk\u00fd Palace in the Obecn\u00ed dv\u016fr district of Prague. Her parents were the Austrian Lieutenant general () Franz Michael de Paula Josef Graf Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1769\u20131843), who died at the age of 75 before Bertha was born, and Sophie Wilhelmine von K\u00f6rner (1815\u20131884), who was more than 45 years younger than her husband.\nHer father was a member of the ancient and illustrious House of Kinsky via descent from Count Wilhelm Kinsky (1574\u20131634), being the younger son of Count Franz Ferdinand Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1738\u20131806) and Princess Maria Christina Anna von und zu Liechtenstein (1741\u20131819), youngest but one daughter of Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein. Bertha's mother came from a family that belonged to an untitled nobility of significantly lower status. She was the daughter of Joseph von K\u00f6rner, a captain of the cavalry in the Habsburg Imperial Army, and a distant relative of the poet Theodor K\u00f6rner. Through her mother, Bertha was also related to Theodor K\u00f6rner, Edler von Siegringen, namesake and great-nephew of the poet, who later served as the 4th President of Austria.\nBertha faced exclusion from the Austrian high nobility due to her \"mixed\" descent; for instance, only those with an unblemished aristocratic pedigree going back to their great-great-grandparents were eligible for presentation at the imperial court. She was additionally disadvantaged because her father, as a third son, had no great estates or other financial resources to bequeath. Bertha was baptised at Prague's Church of Our Lady of the Snows \u2013 not a traditional choice for the aristocracy.\nSoon after Bertha's birth, her mother moved to live in Brno near Bertha's guardian, Landgrave Friedrich Michael zu F\u00fcrstenberg-Taikowitz (1793\u20131866). Bertha's older brother, Count Arthur Franz Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1827\u20131906), was sent to a military school at the age of six and subsequently had little contact with the family. In 1855, Bertha's maternal aunt Charlotte (Lotte) B\u00fcschel, \"n\u00e9e\" von K\u00f6rner (also a widow), and her daughter Elvira joined the household. Elviras father had been a private scholar and her official guardian, after the death of her father, became Count Johann Carl August von Huyn (1812-1889). She was of a similar age as Bertha and interested in intellectual pursuits, introducing her cousin to literature and philosophy. In addition to such studies, Bertha gained proficiency in French, Italian and English as an adolescent under the supervision of a succession of private tutors. She also became an accomplished amateur pianist and singer.\nBertha's mother and aunt, regarding themselves as clairvoyant, went to gamble at Wiesbaden in the summer of 1856, hoping to return with a fortune. Their losses proved so heavy that they were forced to move to Vienna. During this trip, Bertha received a marriage proposal from Prince Philipp zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1836\u20131858), third son of Prince August Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, Minister of State of the Duchy of Nassau and Franziska (1802\u20131878), which was declined due to Bertha's young age. The family once again returned to Wiesbaden in 1859. The second trip proved similarly unsuccessful, and they had to relocate to a small property in Klosterneuburg. Shortly afterwards, Bertha wrote her first published work, the novella \"Erdentr\u00e4ume im Monde\", which appeared in \"Die Deutsche Frau\". Continuing poor financial circumstances led Bertha to a brief engagement to the wealthy Gustav, Baron Heine von Geldern, 31 years her senior and a member of the banking family Heine, whom she came to find unattractive and finally rejected. Her memoirs record her disgusted response to the older man's attempt to kiss her.\nIn 1864, the family spent the summer at Bad Homburg, a fashionable gambling destination among the aristocracy of the era. Bertha befriended the Georgian aristocrat Ekaterine Dadiani, Princess of Mingrelia and met Tsar Alexander II, to whom she was very distantly related. Seeking a career as an opera singer as an alternative to marrying into money, she undertook an intensive course of lessons, working on her voice for over four hours a day. Despite tuition from the eminent Gilbert Duprez in Paris in 1867 and from Pauline Viardot in Baden-Baden in 1868, she never secured a professional engagement. She suffered from stage fright and was unable to project well in performance. In the summer of 1872, she became engaged to Prince Adolf zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein (1839\u20131872), son of (1801\u20131874) and Countess Amalie Luise von Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda (1802\u20131887). However, Prince Adolf died at sea that October while travelling to America to escape his debts.\nTutor in the Suttner household, life in Georgia.\nIn 1866 both Landgrave F\u00fcrstenberg (Bertha's guardian) and Elvira died, and Bertha (now at age 23, above the typical age of marriage) felt increasingly constrained by her mother's eccentricity and the family's poor financial circumstances. \nIn 1873, she found employment as a tutor at the house of Karl Gundaccar Freiherr von Suttner (1819\u20131898) and his wife, Karola Knolz (b. 1822). They had seven children, including four girls (all then aged 15 to 20). The Suttner family House of Suttner lived in the Innere Stadt of Vienna three seasons of the year, and spent the summer at Castle Harmannsdorf in Lower Austria, at that time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \nBertha became companion to the four girls and had an affectionate relationship with her four young students, who nicknamed her \"Boulotte\" (fatty) due to her size, a name she would later adopt as a literary pseudonym in the form \"B. Oulot\".\nShe soon fell in love with the youngest son of Karl, seven years her junior, Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner (1850\u20131902). They were engaged but unable to marry due to his parents' disapproval. In 1876, with the encouragement of her employers, she answered a newspaper advertisement which led to her briefly becoming secretary and housekeeper to Alfred Nobel in Paris. In the few weeks of her employment, she and Nobel developed a friendship, and Nobel may have made romantic overtures. However, she remained committed to Arthur and returned shortly to Vienna to marry him in secrecy, in the church of St. Aegyd in Gumpendorf. As a consequence Arthur von Suttner was desinherited by his family and lost the title of Freiherr.\nThe newlywed couple eloped to Mingrelia in western Georgia, Russian Empire, near the Black Sea, where she hoped to make use of her connection to the former ruling House of Dadiani and Ekaterine, who had once invited her to visit. On their arrival, they were entertained by Prince Niko. The couple settled in Kutaisi, where they found work teaching languages and music to the children of the local aristocracy. However, they experienced considerable hardship despite their social connections, living in a simple three-roomed wooden house. Their situation worsened in 1877 on the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War, although Arthur worked as a reporter on the conflict for the \"Neue Freie Presse\". Suttner also wrote frequently for the Austrian press in this period and worked on her early novels, including \"Es L\u00f6wos\", a romanticised account of her life with Arthur. In the aftermath of the war, Arthur attempted to set up a timber business, but it was unsuccessful.\nArthur and Bertha von Suttner.\nArthur and Bertha von Suttner were largely socially isolated in Georgia; their poverty restricted their engagement with high society, and neither ever became fluent speakers of Mingrelian or Georgian. To support themselves, both began writing as a career. While Arthur's writing during this period is dominated by local themes, Suttner's was not similarly influenced by Georgian culture.\nIn August 1882, Ekaterine Dadiani died. Soon afterwards, the couple decided to leave Mingrelia and move to Tbilisi. There, Arthur took whatever work he could (in accounting, construction and wallpaper design), while Suttner largely concentrated on her writing. She became a correspondent of the German writer and philosopher Michael Georg Conrad, she eventually contributed an article to the 1885 edition of his publication \"Die Gesellschaft\". The piece, entitled \"Truth and Lies\", is a polemic in favour of the naturalism of \u00c9mile Zola. Her first significant political work, \"Inventarium einer Seele\" (\"Inventory of the Soul\"), was published in Leipzig in 1883. In this work, Suttner takes a pro-disarmament, progressive stance, arguing for the inevitability of world peace due to technological advancement; a possibility also considered by her friend Nobel due to the increasingly deterrent effect of more powerful weapons.\nIn 1884, Suttner's mother died, leaving the couple with further debts. Arthur had befriended a Georgian journalist in Tbilisi only known as \"M\" and the couple agreed to collaborate with him on a translation of the Georgian epic \"The Knight in the Panther Skin\". Suttner was to improve M.'s literal translation of the Georgian to French, and Arthur to translate the French to German. This method proved arduous, and they worked only for few hours each day. Arthur published several articles on the work in the Georgian press, and Mih\u00e1ly Zichy prepared some illustrations for the publication, but M. failed to make the expected payment, and after the Bulgarian Crisis began in 1885 the couple felt increasingly unsafe in Georgian society, which was becoming more hostile to Austrians due to Russian influence. They finally reconciled with Arthur's family and in May 1885 could return to Austria, where the couple lived at Harmannsdorf Castle in Lower Austria.\nBertha found refuge in her marriage with Arthur, of which she remarked that \"the third field of my feelings and moods lay within our married happiness. In this was my peculiarly inalienable home, my refuge for all possible conditions of life, [\u2026] and so the leaves of my diary are full not only of political domestic records of all kinds, but also of memoranda of our gay little jokes, our confidential enjoyable walks, our uplifting reading, our hours of music together, and our evening games of chess. To us personally nothing could happen. We had each other \u2013 that was everything.\"\nPeace activism.\nAfter their return to Austria, Suttner continued her journalism and concentrated on peace and war issues, corresponding with the French philosopher Ernest Renan and influenced by the International Arbitration and Peace Association founded by Hodgson Pratt in 1880.\nIn 1889, Suttner became a leading figure in the peace movement with the publication of her pacifist novel, \"Die Waffen nieder!\" (\"Lay Down Your Arms!\"), which made her one of the leading figures of the Austrian peace movement. The book was published in 37 editions and translated into 15 languages. She witnessed the foundation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and called for the establishment of the Austrian \"Gesellschaft der Friedensfreunde\" pacifist organisation in an 1891 \"Neue Freie Presse\" editorial. Suttner became chairwoman and also founded the German Peace Society the next year. She became known internationally as the editor of the international pacifist journal \"Die Waffen nieder!\", named after her book, from 1892 to 1899. In 1897, she presented Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria with a list of signatures urging the establishment of an International Court of Justice and took part in the First Hague Convention in 1899 with the help of Theodor Herzl, who paid for her trip as a correspondent of the Zionist newspaper, \"Die Welt\".\nUpon her husband's death in 1902, Suttner had to sell Harmannsdorf Castle and moved back to Vienna. In 1904 she addressed the International Congress of Women in Berlin and for seven months travelled around the United States, attending a universal peace congress in Boston and meeting President Theodore Roosevelt.\nThough her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that Von Suttner was a major influence on his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will. Bertha von Suttner was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on 10 December 1905. The presentation took place on 18 April 1906 in Kristiania, what is now Oslo, Norway.\nIn 1907, Von Suttner was the only woman to attend the Second Hague Peace Conference, which mainly pertained to the law of war. Von Suttner was actually highly critical of the 1907 conference and warned of a war to come. When she accepted her Nobel Peace prize a year earlier, she had said: \"(\u2026) whether our Europe will become a showpiece of ruins and failure, or whether we can avoid this danger and so enter sooner the coming era of secure peace and law in which a civilisation of unimagined glory will develop. The many aspects of this question are what the second Hague Conference should be discussing rather than the proposed topics concerning the laws and practices of war at sea, the bombardment of ports, towns, and villages, the laying of mines, and so on. The contents of this agenda demonstrate that, although the supporters of the existing structure of society, which accepts war, come to a peace conference prepared to modify the nature of war, they are basically trying to keep the present system intact\".\nAround this time, she also crossed paths with Anna Bernhardine Eckstein, another German champion of world peace, who influenced the agenda of the Second Hague Peace Conference. A year later she attended the International Peace Congress in London, where she first met Caroline Playne, an English anti-war activist who would later write the first biography of Suttner.\nIn the run-up to World War I, Suttner continued to campaign against international armament. In 1911 she became a member of the advisory council of the Carnegie Peace Foundation. In the last months of her life, while suffering from cancer, she helped organise the next Peace Conference, intended to take place in September 1914. However, the conference never took place, as she died of cancer on 21 June 1914, and seven days later the heir to her nation's throne, Franz Ferdinand was killed, triggering World War I.\nSuttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of Immanuel Kant, Henry Thomas Buckle, Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin and Leo Tolstoy (Tolstoy praised \"Die Waffen nieder!\") conceiving peace as a natural state impaired by the human aberrances of war and militarism. As a result, she argued that a right to peace could be demanded under international law and was necessary in the context of an evolutionary Darwinist conception of history. Suttner was a respected journalist, with one historian describing her as \"a most perceptive and adept political commentator\".\nWriting.\nTo promote her writing career and ideals, she used her connections in aristocracy and friendships with wealthy individuals, such as Alfred Nobel, to gain access to international heads of state, and also to gain popularity for her writing. To increase the financial success of her writing, she used a male pseudonym early in her career. In addition, Suttner often worked as a journalist to publicise her message or promote her own books, events, and causes.\nAs Tolstoy noted and others have since agreed, there is a strong similarity between Suttner and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Both Beecher Stowe and Suttner \"were neither simply writers of popular entertainment nor authors of tendentious propaganda... [They] used entertainment for idealistic purposes.\" For Suttner, peace and acceptance of all individuals and all peoples was the greatest ideal and theme.\nSuttner also wrote about other issues and ideals. Two common issues in her work, apart from pacifism, are religion and gender equality.\nReligion.\nThere are two main issues with religion that Suttner often wrote about. She had a disdain for the spectacle and pomp of some religious practices. In a scene in \"Lay Down Your Arms\" she highlighted the odd theatricality of some religious practices. In the scene, the emperor and empress are washing the feet of normal citizens to show they are as humble as Jesus, but they invite everyone to witness their show of humility and enter the hall in a dramatic fashion. The protagonist Martha remarks that it was \"indeed a sham washing.\"\nAnother issue prominent in much of her writing is the idea that war is righteously for God, and leaders often use religion as a pretext for war. Suttner criticised this reasoning on the grounds that it placed the state as the important entity to God rather than the individual, thereby making dying in battle more glorious than other forms of death or surviving a war. Much of \"Lay Down Your Arms\" discusses this topic.\nThis type of religious thinking also leads to segregation and fighting based on religious differences, which Bertha and Arthur von Suttner refused to accept. As a devout Christian, Arthur founded the League Against Anti-Semitism in response to the pogroms in Eastern Europe and the growing antisemitism across Europe. The Suttner family called for acceptance of all people and all faiths, with Suttner writing in her memoirs that \"religion was neighbourly love, not neighbourly hatred. Any kind of hatred, against other nations or against other creeds, detracted from the humaneness of humanity.\"\nGender equality.\nSuttner is often considered a leader in the women's liberation movement.\nVon Suttner broke through sex barriers by her work as a writer and activist. She was an outspoken leader in a society in which women were to be seen, not be heard. But she did not actively participate in the movements for women's suffrage, for instance, which she explained due to a lack of time. She instead focused on reaching out to other women in the international peace movement, though she kept close contact to the women's suffrage movement. As a sign of joint solidarity, for instance, Von Suttner was a prominent participant of the 1904 \"International Women's Conference\" (\"Internationale Frauen-Kongress\") in Berlin. Von Suttner knew, though, that conflict can only be avoided if both men and women together struggle for peace, which required an absolute belief in sex equality. \"The tasks involved in mankind's continuing ennoblement are such that they can only be fulfilled through fair and equal cooperation between the sexes\", she wrote.\nIn \"Lay Down Your Arms\", the protagonist Martha often clashes with her father on this issue. Martha does not want her son to play with toy soldiers and be indoctrinated to the masculine ideas of war. Martha's father attempts to put Martha back in the female sexed box by suggesting that the son will not need to ask for approval from a woman, and also states that Martha should marry again because women her age should not be alone.\nThis was not simply because she insisted that women are equal to men, but that she was able to tease out how sexism affects both men and women. Like Martha being placed in a female structured sex box, the character of Tilling is also placed in the male stereotyped box and affected by that. The character even discusses it, saying, \"we men have to repress the instinct of self-preservation. Soldiers have also to repress the compassion, the sympathy for the gigantic trouble which invades both friend and foe; for next to cowardice, what is most disgraceful to us is all sentimentality, all that is emotional.\"\nLegacy.\nSuttner's work proved very influential for those involved in the peace movement.\nShe has also been commemorated on several coins and stamps:\nIn 2025, the European Central Bank announced two themes for a future redesign of Euro banknotes: \"European culture\" and \"Rivers and birds\". They also announced that von Suttner had been selected to appear on the obverse of 200 euro banknotes if the \"European culture\" theme is selected.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nBiographic information\nDigital editions\nOther links"}

His films are noted for the distinct influence of Renaissance and Baroque painting, and Mannerist painting in particular. Common traits in his films are the scenic composition and illumination and the contrasts of costume and nudity, nature and architecture, furniture and people, sexual pleasure and painful death.\nEarly life.\nGreenaway was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales, to a teacher mother and a builder's merchant father. Greenaway's family had relocated to Wales prior to his birth to escape the Blitz. They returned to the London area at the end of World War II and settled in Woodford, then part of Essex. He attended Churchfields Junior School and later Forest School in nearby Walthamstow.\nAt an early age Greenaway decided on becoming a painter. He became interested in European cinema, focusing first on the films of Ingmar Bergman, and then on the French \"Nouvelle Vague\" filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and, most especially, Alain Resnais. Greenaway has said that Resnais's \"Last Year in Marienbad\" (1961) had been the most important influence upon his own filmmaking (and he himself established a close working relationship with that film's cinematographer Sacha Vierny). He now lives in Amsterdam.\nCareer.\n1962\u20131999.\nIn 1962, Greenaway began studies at Walthamstow College of Art, where a fellow student was musician Ian Dury (later cast in \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover\"). Greenaway trained as a muralist for three years; he made his first film, \"Death of Sentiment\", a churchyard furniture essay filmed in four large London cemeteries. In 1965, he joined the Central Office of Information (COI), where he went on to work for fifteen years as a film editor and director. In that time he made a series of experimental films, starting with \"Train\" (1966), footage of the last steam trains at Waterloo station (situated behind the COI), edited to a \"musique concr\u00e8te\" composition. \"Tree\" (1966) is a homage to the embattled tree growing in concrete outside the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank in London. In the late 1970s, he made \"Vertical Features Remake\" and \"A Walk Through H\". The former is an examination of various arithmetical editing structures, and the latter is a journey through the maps of a fictitious country.\nIn 1980, Greenaway delivered \"The Falls\" (his first feature-length film) \u2013 a mammoth, fantastical, absurdist encyclopaedia of flight-associated material all relating to ninety-two victims of what is referred to as the Violent Unknown Event (VUE). In the 1980s his cinema flowered in his best-known films, \"The Draughtsman's Contract\" (1982), \"A Zed &amp; Two Noughts\" (1985), \"The Belly of an Architect\" (1987), \"Drowning by Numbers\" (1988), and his most successful film, \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover\" (1989). Greenaway's most familiar musical collaborator during this period is composer Michael Nyman, who has scored several films.\nIn 1989, Greenaway collaborated with artist Tom Phillips on a television serial \"A TV Dante\", dramatising the first few cantos of Dante's \"Inferno\". In the 1990s he presented \"Prospero's Books\" (1991), the controversial \"The Baby of M\u00e2con\" (1993), \"The Pillow Book\" (1996), and \"8\u00bd Women\" (1999).\nIn the early 1990s Greenaway wrote ten opera libretti known as the \"Death of a Composer\" series, dealing with the commonalities of the deaths of ten composers from Anton Webern to John Lennon; however, the other composers are fictitious, and one is a character from \"The Falls\". In 1995, Louis Andriessen completed the sixth libretto, \"Rosa \u2013 A Horse Drama\". He is currently professor of cinema studies at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.\n2000\u2013present.\nGreenaway presented the ambitious \"The Tulse Luper Suitcases\", a multimedia project that resulted in three films, a website, two books, a touring exhibition, and a shorter feature which reworked the material of the first three films.\nHe also contributed to \"Visions of Europe\", a short film collection by different European Union directors; his British entry is \"The European Showerbath\". \"Nightwatching\" and \"Rembrandt's J'Accuse\" are two films on Rembrandt, released respectively in 2007 and 2008. \"Nightwatching\" is the first feature in the series \"Dutch Masters\", with the second project titled as \"Goltzius and the Pelican Company\".\nOn 17 June 2005, Greenaway appeared for his first VJ performance during an art club evening in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with music by DJ Serge Dodwell (aka Radar), as a backdrop, 'VJ' Greenaway used for his set a special system consisting of a large plasma screen with laser controlled touchscreen to project the ninety-two \"Tulse Luper\" stories on the twelve screens of \"Club 11\", mixing the images live. This was later reprised at the Optronica festival, London.\nOn 12 October 2007, he created the multimedia installation \"Peopling the Palaces at Venaria Reale\" at the Royal Palace of Venaria, which animated the Palace with 100 videoprojectors.\nGreenaway was interviewed for Clive Meyer's \"Critical Cinema: Beyond the Theory of Practice\" (2011), and voiced strong criticisms of film theory as distinct from discussions of other media: \"Are you sufficiently happy with cinema as a thinking medium if you are only talking to one person?\"\nOn 3 May 2016, he received a Honoris Causa doctorate from the University of San Mart\u00edn, Argentina.\n\"Nine Classical Paintings Revisited\".\nIn 2006, Greenaway began a series of digital video installations, \"Nine Classical Paintings Revisited\", with his exploration of Rembrandt's \"Night Watch\" in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. On 30 June 2008, after much negotiation, Greenaway staged a one-night performance 'remixing' da Vinci's \"The Last Supper\" in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan to a select audience of dignitaries. The performance consisted of superimposing digital imagery and projections onto the painting with music from the composer Marco Robino.\nGreenaway exhibited his digital exploration of \"The Wedding at Cana\" by Paolo Veronese as part of the 2009 Venice Biennial. An arts writer for \"The New York Times\" called it \"possibly the best unmanned art history lecture you'll ever experience,\" while acknowledging that some viewers might respond to it as \"mediocre art, Disneyfied kitsch or a flamboyant denigration of site-specific video installation.\" The 50-minute presentation, set to a soundtrack, incorporates closeup images of faces from the painting along with animated diagrams revealing compositional relations among the figures. These images are projected onto and around the replica of the painting that now stands at the original site, within the Palladian architecture of the Benedictine refectory on San Giorgio Maggiore. The soundtrack features music and imagined dialogue scripted by Greenaway for the 126 \"wedding guests, servants, onlookers and wedding crashers\" depicted in the painting, consisting of small talk and banal chatter that culminates in reaction to the miraculous transformation of water to wine, according to the Gospels the first miracle performed by Jesus. Picasso's \"Guernica\", Seurat's \"Grande Jatte\", works by Jackson Pollock and Claude Monet, Vel\u00e1zquez's \"Las Meninas\" and Michelangelo's \"The Last Judgment\" are possible series subjects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The repertoire of glyphs is based and derived on the uncial Greek alphabet, augmented by letters borrowed from the Egyptian Demotic. It was the first alphabetic script used for the Egyptian language. There are several Coptic alphabets, as the script varies greatly among the various dialects and eras of the Coptic language.\nHistory.\nThe Coptic script has a long history going back to the Ptolemaic Kingdom, when the Greek alphabet was used to transcribe Demotic texts, with the aim of recording the correct pronunciation of Demotic. As early as the sixth century BC and as late as the second century AD, an entire series of pre-Christian religious texts were written in what scholars term Old Coptic, Egyptian language texts written in the Greek alphabet.\nIn contrast to Old Coptic, seven additional Coptic letters were derived from Demotic, and many of these (though not all) are used in \u201ctrue\u201d form of Coptic writing. Coptic texts are associated with Christianity, Gnosticism, and Manichaeism.\nWith the spread of early Christianity in Egypt, knowledge of Egyptian hieroglyphs was lost by the late third century, as well as Demotic script slightly later, making way for a writing system more closely associated with the Coptic Orthodox Church. By the fourth century, the Coptic script was \"standardized\", particularly for the Sahidic dialect. (There are a number of differences between the alphabets as used in the various dialects in Coptic).\nCoptic is not generally used today except by the members of the Coptic Orthodox Church to write their religious texts. All the Gnostic codices found at Nag Hammadi used the Coptic script.\nThe most common Coptic dialect written today as a liturgical language for the Coptic Orthodox and Coptic Catholic Churches is the Bohairic dialect.\nThe Old Nubian alphabet\u2014used to write Old Nubian, a Nilo-Saharan language\u2014is an uncial variant of the Coptic script, with additional characters borrowed from the Greek and Meroitic scripts.\nForm.\nThe Coptic script was the first Egyptian writing system to indicate vowels, making Coptic documents invaluable for the interpretation of earlier Egyptian texts. Some Egyptian syllables had sonorants but no vowels; in Sahidic, these were written in Coptic with a line above the entire syllable. Various scribal schools made limited use of diacritics: some used an apostrophe as a word divider and to mark clitics, a function of determinatives in logographic Egyptian; others used diereses over \u2c93 and \u2ca9 to show that these started a new syllable, others a circumflex over any vowel for the same purpose.\nThe Coptic script's glyphs are largely based on the Greek alphabet, another help in interpreting older Egyptian texts, with 24 letters of Greek origin; 6 or 7 more were retained from Demotic, depending on the dialect (6 in Sahidic, another each in Bohairic and Akhmimic). In addition to the alphabetic letters, the letter \u03ef stood for the syllable or .\nAs the Coptic script is simply a typeface of the Greek alphabet, with a few added letters, it can be used to write Greek without any transliteration schemes. Latin equivalents would include the Icelandic alphabet (which likewise has added letters), or the Fraktur alphabet (which has distinctive forms). While initially unified with the Greek alphabet by Unicode, a proposal was later accepted to separate it, with the proposal noting that Coptic is never written using modern Greek letter-forms (unlike German, which may be written with Fraktur or Roman Antiqua letter-forms), and that the Coptic letter-forms have closer mutual legibility with the Greek-based letters incorporated into the separately encoded Cyrillic alphabet than with the forms used in modern Greek. Because Coptic lowercases are usually small-caps forms of the capitals, a Greek would have little trouble reading Coptic letters, but Copts would struggle more with many of the Greek letters.\nLetters.\nThese are the letters that are used for writing the Coptic language. Coptic did not originally have case distinctions\u2014they are a modern convention, as is the case with other classical languages like Latin.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLetters derived from Demotic.\nOld Coptic had a large number of Demotic Egyptian characters, including some logograms. This was reduced to seven such characters, used for sounds not covered by the Greek alphabet (plus their modern lowercase forms):\nNumerals.\nCoptic numerals are an alphabetic numeral system in which numbers are indicated with letters of the alphabet, such as \u2cab for 500.\nThe numerical value of the letters is based on Greek numerals. Sometimes numerical use is distinguished from text with a continuous overline above the letters, as with Greek and Cyrillic numerals.\nUnicode.\nIn Unicode, most Coptic letters formerly shared codepoints with similar Greek letters, but a disunification was accepted for version 4.1, which appeared in 2005. The new Coptic block is U+2C80 to U+2CFF. Most fonts contained in mainstream operating systems use a distinctive Byzantine style for this block. The Greek block includes seven Coptic letters (U+03E2\u2013U+03EF highlighted below) derived from Demotic, and these need to be included in any complete implementation of Coptic.\nDiacritics and punctuation.\nThese are also included in the Unicode specification.\nCombining diacritics.\nThese are codepoints applied after that of the character they modify.\nMacrons and overlines.\nCoptic uses to indicate syllabic consonants, for example \u2c9b\u0304.\nCoptic abbreviations use to draw a continuous line across the remaining letters of an abbreviated word. It extends from the left edge of the first letter to the right edge of the last letter. For example, \u2ca1\u0305\u2c9b\u0305\u2c81\u0305, a common abbreviation for \u2ca1\u2c9b\u2c89\u2ca9\u2c99\u2c81 'spirit'.\nA different kind of overline uses , , and to distinguish the spelling of certain common words or to highlight proper names of divinities and heroes.\nFor this the line begins in the middle of the first letter and continues to the middle of the last letter. A few examples: \u2ca3\ufe24\u2c99\ufe25, \u03e5\ufe24\u2c9b\ufe26\u2ca7\ufe25, \u2ca1\ufe24\u03e9\ufe26\u2ca3\ufe26\u2c83\ufe25.\nSometimes numerical use of letters is indicated with a continuous line above them using as in \u2c81\u0375\u2cb1\u0305\u2ca1\u0305\u2c8f\u0305 for 1,888 (where \"\u2c81\u0375\" is 1,000 and \"\u2cb1\u0305\u2ca1\u0305\u2c8f\u0305\" is 888). Multiples of 1,000 can be indicated by a continuous double line above using as in \u2c81\u033f for 1,000.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55457", "revid": "299039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55457", "title": "10th millennium BC", "text": "Millennium between 10,000 BC and 9001 BC\nThe 10th millennium BC spanned the years 10,000 BC to 9001 BC (c. 12\u00a0ka to c. 11\u00a0ka). It marks the beginning of the transition from the Palaeolithic to the Neolithic via the interim Mesolithic (Northern Europe and Western Europe) and Epipaleolithic (Levant and Near East) periods, which together form the first part of the Holocene epoch that is generally believed to have begun c. 9700 BC (c. 11.7\u00a0ka) and is the current geological epoch. It is impossible to precisely date events that happened around the time of this millennium, and all dates mentioned here are estimates mostly based on geological analysis, anthropological analysis, and radiometric dating.\nHolocene epoch.\nThe main characteristic of the Holocene has been the worldwide abundance of \"Homo sapiens sapiens\" (humankind). The epoch began in the wake of the W\u00fcrm glaciation, generally known as the Last Ice Age, which began 109\u00a0ka and ended 14\u00a0ka, when \"Homo sapiens sapiens\" was in the Palaeolithic (Old Stone) Age. Following the Late Glacial Interstadial from 14\u00a0ka to 12.9\u00a0ka, during which global temperatures rose significantly, the Younger Dryas began. This was a temporary reversal of climatic warming to glacial conditions in the Northern Hemisphere and coincided with the end of the Upper Palaeolithic. The Younger Dryas ceased c. 9700 BC, marking the cutover from Pleistocene to Holocene.\nIn the geologic time scale, there are three (tentatively four) stratigraphic stages of the Holocene beginning c. 9700 BC with the \"Greenlandian\" (to c. 6236 BC). The starting point for the Greenlandian is the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) sample from the North Greenland Ice Core Project, which has been correlated with the Younger Dryas. The Greenlandian was succeeded by the \"Northgrippian\" (to c. 2250 BC) and the \"Meghalayan\". All three stages were officially ratified by the International Commission on Stratigraphy in July 2018. It has been proposed that the Meghalayan should be terminated c. 1950 and succeeded by a new stage provisionally called \"Anthropocene\".\nIn the Holocene's first millennium, the Palaeolithic began to be superseded by the Neolithic (New Stone) Age which lasted about 6,000 years, depending on location. The gradual transition period is sometimes termed Mesolithic (northern and western Europe) or Epipalaeolithic (Levant and Near East). The glaciers retreated as the world climate became warmer and that inspired an agricultural revolution, though at first, the dog was probably the only domesticated animal. This was accompanied by a social revolution in that humans gained from agriculture the impetus to settle. Settlement is the key precursor to civilisation, which cannot be achieved by a nomadic lifestyle.\nThe world population, c. 10,000 BC, is believed to have been more or less stable. It has been estimated that there were some five million people at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, growing to forty million by 5000 BC and 100 million by 1600 BC, which is an average growth rate of 0.027% p.a. from the Neolithic to the Middle Bronze Age. Around 10,000 BC, most people lived in hunter-gatherer communities scattered across all continents except Antarctica and Zealandia. As the W\u00fcrm/Wisconsin ended, settlement of northern regions was again possible.\nBeginnings of agriculture.\nAgriculture developed in different parts of the world at different times. In many places, people learned how to cultivate without outside help; elsewhere, as in western Europe, the skills were imported. A decrease in human height accompanied the rise of agriculture near the start of the Holocene period (10,000 BC) and was later correlated with urban population density.\nThe Natufian culture prevailed in the Levant through the 10th millennium and was unusual in that it supported a sedentary or semi-sedentary population even before the introduction of agriculture. An early example is 'Ain Mallaha, which may have been the first village in which people were wholly sedentary. The Natufian people are believed to have founded another early settlement on the site of Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) where there is evidence of building between 9600 BC and 8200 BC. Dates for the Natufian are indeterminate and range broadly from c. 13,050 BC to c. 7550 BC. It is possible that the early cultivation of figs began in the Jordan River valley sometime after the middle of the 10th millennium. Besides the fig trees, the people may have begun cultivation of wild plants such as barley and pistachio; and they possibly began herding goats, pigs and cattle.\nAgriculture began to be developed by the various communities of the Fertile Crescent, which included the Levant, but it would not be widely practised for another 2,000 years by which time Neolithic culture was becoming well established in many parts of the Near East. Among the earliest cultivated plants were forms of millet and rice grown in the Middle East, possibly in this millennium but more likely after 9000 BC. By about 9500 BC, people in south-eastern Anatolia were harvesting wild grasses and grains. The earliest evidence of sheep herding has been found in northern Iraq, dated before 9000 BC.\nPottery.\nPrehistoric chronology is almost entirely reliant upon the dating of material objects of which pottery is by far the most widespread and the most resistant to decay. All locations and generations developed their own shapes, sizes and styles of pottery, including methods and styles of decoration, but there was consistency among stratified deposits and even shards can be classified by time and place. Pottery is believed to have been discovered independently in various places, beginning with China c. 18,000 BC, and was probably created accidentally by fires lit on clay soil. The main discovery of pottery dated to the 10th millennium has been at Bosumpra Cave (early tenth-millennium cal. BC) on the Kwahu Plateau in southeastern Ghana and Ounjougou (c.9400 BC) in Central Mali, providing evidence of an independent invention of pottery in Sub-Saharan Africa in different climatic zones.\nThe first chronological pottery system was the Early, Middle and Late Minoan framework devised in the early 20th century by Sir Arthur Evans for his findings at Knossos. This covered the Bronze Age in twelve phases from c. 2800 BC to c. 1050 BC and the principle was later extended to mainland Greece (Helladic) and the Aegean islands (Cycladic). Dame Kathleen Kenyon was the principal archaeologist at Tell es-Sultan (ancient Jericho) and she discovered that there was no pottery there. The potter's wheel had not yet been invented and, where pottery as such was made, it was still hand-built, often by means of coiling, and pit fired.\nKenyon discovered vessels such as bowls, cups, and plates at Jericho which were made from stone. She reasonably surmised that others made from wood or vegetable fibres would have long since decayed. Using Evans' system as a benchmark, Kenyon divided the Near East Neolithic into phases called Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), from c. 10,000 BC to c. 8800 BC; Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), from c. 8800 BC to c. 6500 BC; and then Pottery Neolithic (PN), which had varied start-points from c. 6500 BC until the beginnings of the Bronze Age towards the end of the 4th millennium. In the 10th millennium, the Natufian culture co-existed with the PPNA which prevailed in the Levantine and upper Mesopotamian areas of the Fertile Crescent.\nOther cultural developments.\nAfrica.\nIn North Africa, Saharan rock art engravings in what is known as the Bubalus (Large Wild Fauna) period have been dated to between 10,000 BC and 7000 BC. Wall paintings found in Ethiopia and Eritrea depict human activity; some of the older paintings are thought to date back to around 10,000 BC. In Prehistoric Egypt, a culture of hunter-gatherers replaced a grain grinding culture in 10,000 BC. The Abu Madi tel mounds in the Sinai Peninsula have been dated c. 9660 to c. 9180 BC.\nAmericas.\nThe Clovis culture was widely distributed throughout North America. The people were hunter-gatherers and the culture's duration is believed to have been from c.9050 BC to c.8800 BC. There is evidence of increasing use of Clovis point tool technology for hunting.\nElsewhere in North America, the Petroglyphs at Winnemucca Lake, in what is today northwest Nevada, were carved by this time, possibly as early as 12.8\u00a0ka or as late as 10\u00a0ka.\nEurasia.\nThe sites at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, which is home to megalithic structures, Hallan \u00c7emi Tepesi, both in south-eastern Anatolia, and at Tell Qaramel, in north-west Syria, may have been occupied during this millennium. It was found out that gastronomy first emerged in G\u00f6bekli Tepe in this millennium. This most important discovery shedding light on the beginning of gastronomy in Anatolia consists of religious places in which feasts were held in this millennium that were found in the archaeological excavations conducted in G\u00f6bekli Tepe in Urfa province which is called the zero point of time. As a result of the investigations carried out in G\u00f6bekli Tepe which is dated to this millennium, it was determined that the people created cult structures and had a culture for religious purposes during the early Neolithic period and that they held feasts in which they offered foods while performing these cultures. The Sassi di Matera in southern Italy is believed to have been the site of human settlement since the Paleolithic period in this millennium, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in history. At the Hasankeyf Mound in Turkey, Europe, almost all archaeological data date to this millennium. In Great Britain, which was not then an island, the Star Carr site in North Yorkshire is believed to have been inhabited by Maglemosian peoples for about 800 years from c. 9335 BC to c. 8525 BC.\nThe Bhimbetka rock shelters, which feature prehistoric cave paintings, earliest being dated to 10,000 BCE, corresponds to the Indian Mesolithic. These sites would have been home to a nomadic/hunting society existing in this region.\nEnvironmental changes.\nIn the southern hemisphere, rising sea levels had gradually formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from mainland Australia. This process is believed to have been complete by about the beginning of the 10th millennium. Bass Strait had been a plain populated by indigenous people who are thought to have first arrived around 40,000 years ago.\nThe Wisconsin glaciation had sheeted much of North America and, as it retreated, its meltwaters created an immense proglacial lake now known as Lake Agassiz. Sometime after 10,000 BC, the retreating glaciers created the rock formation on Cannon Mountain in present-day New Hampshire that was known as the Old Man of the Mountain until its collapse in 2003.\nChronological method.\nThe ongoing Quaternary System/Period represents the last 2.58 million years since the end of the Neogene and is officially divided into the Pleistocene and Holocene Series/Epochs. The Holocene has been assigned an age of 11,700 calendar years before 2000 CE which means it began c. 9700 BC in the 10th millennium. It is preceded in the geological time scale by the Late Pleistocene sub-epoch, also known as the Tarantian Stage/Age, which awaits formal ratification by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and tentatively spans the time from c. 126,000 BC to c. 9700 BC. Preceding the Late Pleistocene is the Middle Pleistocene sub-epoch, or Chibanian Stage/Age, which also awaits ratification and tentatively spans the time from c. 773,000 BC to c. 126,000 BC. The Early Pleistocene from c. 2,580,000 BC until c. 773,000 is sub-divided into two Stages/Ages which have been officially defined: the Gelasian (until c. 1,800,000 BC) and the Calabrian.\nThe Holocene calendar, devised by Cesare Emiliani in 1993, places its epoch at 10,000 BC (with the year 2025 being rendered as 12025 HE). The Human Era calendar attempts to simplify the calculation of time spans across the BC-CE divide by designating a more universally relevant epoch date: the start of human settlements (instead of the birth of Jesus Christ). CE dates can be converted by adding 10,000 years; converting BC dates requires subtraction from 10,001 (since the Gregorian calendar lacks a year zero).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On 19 June 1282, she died giving birth to her first child, Gwenllian.\nThe infant was captured by English forces the following year, after her father, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, was killed in December 1282. At Edward I's orders, she was kept in the remote Sempringham Priory in Lincolnshire, where she remained until her death in 1337.\nGwenllian's status was acknowledged at least once by the English Crown. When writing to the pope, attempting to secure more money for Sempringham Priory, the king stated that \"...herein is kept the Princess of Wales, whom we have to maintain\". The title \"Princess of Wales\" as used here did not have its usual accepted meaning.\nMargaret Hanmer and Catrin, daughter of Glynd\u0175r.\nMargaret Hanmer, sometimes known as Marred ferch Dafydd (her Welsh name), was the wife of Owain Glynd\u0175r. Some modern historians have accorded her the title \"Princess of Wales\".\nCatrin was one of the children of Owain Glynd\u0175r and Margaret Hanmer. In November 1402, she married Edmund Mortimer, the second son of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March and through his mother, a great-grandson of Edward III of England.\nEdmund Mortimer died during the siege of Harlech Castle in 1409, of unknown causes. Catrin was subsequently captured alongside her three daughters, and they were taken to the Tower of London, along with Catrin's mother and one of her sisters. The deaths and burials of Catrin and her daughters are recorded, but the causes of their deaths remain unknown. They were laid to rest at St Swithin's Church in London.\nSpouse of the British (formerly English) heir apparent.\nJoan of Kent married Prince of Wales, her cousin Edward the Black Prince, in early 1361; their marriage lacked needed dispensation and was annulled in the same year, but afterwards the pair was granted necessary documents by the Pope, and married again, making Joan the Princess of Wales for the second time.\nCecily Neville, wife of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, is omitted from this list. While her husband was briefly given various titles, including Prince of Wales, by an Act of Parliament as part of his arrangement to succeed Henry VI, he is not generally recognised as such and is not mentioned in any published summary of the topic.\nAlthough not granted the title in her own right, the future Mary I was, during her youth, invested by her father, Henry VIII, with many of the rights and properties traditionally given to the Prince of Wales, including the use of the official seal of Wales for correspondence. For most of her childhood, Mary was her father's only legitimate child, and for this reason, she was often referred to as the Prince(ss) of Wales, although Henry never formally created her as such. For example, contemporary scholar Juan Luis Vives dedicated his \"Satellitium Animi\" to \"Domin\u00e6 Mari\u00e6 Cambri\u00e6 Principi, Henrici Octavi Angli\u00e6 Regis Fili\u00e6\" (\"Lady Mary, Prince of Wales, Daughter of Henry VIII, King of England\").\nWelsh politicians suggested that George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II), be granted the title on her 18th birthday, but he rejected the idea because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the title of the heir apparent.\nCamilla, Charles III's second wife, was the Princess of Wales from 2005 to 2022, but did not use the title due to its popular association with her husband's first wife, Diana. Camilla chose to be known as \"Duchess of Cornwall\" instead, which is traditionally a subsidiary title.\nOn 9 September 2022, a day after his accession to the throne, Charles III bestowed the title of \"Prince of Wales\" upon his elder son, William, making his wife, Catherine, the Princess of Wales.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It covers , of which are a protected area.\nIt is named after Do\u00f1a Ana de Silva y Mendoza, wife of the 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia.\nThe park is an area of marshes, shallow streams, and sand dunes in Las Marismas, the delta where the Guadalquivir River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It was established as a nature reserve in 1969 when the World Wildlife Fund joined with the Spanish government and purchased a section of marshes to protect it. The eco-system has been under constant threat by the draining of the marshes, the use of river water to boost agricultural production by irrigating land along the coast, water pollution by upriver mining, and the expansion of tourist facilities.\nDo\u00f1ana National Park has a biodiversity that is unique in Europe, although there are some similarities to the Parc Naturel R\u00e9gional de Camargue of the Camargue river delta in France, with which Do\u00f1ana Park is twinned. The park features a great variety of ecosystems and shelters wildlife, including thousands of European and African migratory birds, fallow deer, Spanish red deer, wild boars, European badgers, Egyptian mongooses, and endangered species such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the Iberian lynx.\nThe Do\u00f1ana nature reserve includes both the Do\u00f1ana National Park, established in 1969, and the Natural Park, created in 1989 and expanded in 1997, creating a buffer zone of protection under the management of the regional government. The two parks, national and natural, have since been classified as a single natural landscape. Due to its strategic location between the continents of Europe and Africa and its proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar, Do\u00f1ana's large expanse of salt marsh is a breeding ground as well as a transit point for thousands of European and African birds (aquatic and terrestrial), and hosts many species of migratory waterfowl during the winter, typically up to 200,000 individuals. Over 300 different species of birds may be sighted there annually. Considered the largest nature reserve in Europe, several different scientific institutions have monitoring stations within its boundaries to ensure appropriate development of adjacent lands and conservation of the threatened species that inhabit it. The area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994; in 2006, the park recorded 376,287 visitors.\nGeology and geomorphology.\nThe geological profile of Do\u00f1ana National Park reflects the development over several hundred thousand years of a deep aquifer and geomorphological features that have enhanced the biodiversity of the wildlife habitats presently found there. After the end of the last glacial period, the area was covered by freshwater and brackish marshes, ponds and sand dunes, with some marine intrusions caused by high-energy events such as tsunamis and large storms. A period of comparatively rapid rise in global sea level during the first part of the Flandrian interglacial was associated with the melting of the paleoglaciers, and reached its maximum level 6,500\u20137,000 years ago. At this time, Do\u00f1ana National Park and the surrounding areas were flooded, and a lagoon, later called \"Lacus Ligustinus\" by the Romans, was formed. The pace of infilling of the lagoon has increased over the last 6,000 years, along with accelerated growth of sandspits and the creation of new inland marshes and wetlands. The extensive marshes of Do\u00f1ana National Park now have a flat topography, with some inland depressions occupied by temporary or permanent wetlands, locally called 'lucios'. The whole area is protected by the Do\u00f1ana spit, a wide sandy littoral barrier with mobile dune systems growing toward the southeast.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nAlthough the topography of Do\u00f1ana is a relatively new land feature as measured on the geological time scale, remains of Neolithic tools have been found in the area. Various ancient civilizations may have had a presence there as long as 2,800 years ago, including the Phoenicians, the Phocaean Greeks and the Tartessians, but archaeological remains attesting to such have not been found. In 1923, the German archaeologist Adolf Schulten, accompanied by Adolf Lammerer and George Bonsor, searched for the location of the ancient Tartessian capital in Almonte, where the Do\u00f1ana dunes are, but found nothing of interest. These excavations were carried out at Cerro del Trigo and funded by the Duke of Tarifa and Denia, then owner of Do\u00f1ana. Nevertheless, in 1978 Schulten found the stele of Villamanrique at the nearby town of Villamanrique de la Condesa. Surveys were made in 2007 in the Hinojos salt marsh, or \"Marisma de Hinojos\", of Huelva province, in an effort to discover traces of the mythical city Atlantis. Noteworthy finds included the remains of Roman settlements, dating from the 2nd through the 5th centuries AD, which had been primarily engaged in fishing and fish salting or the preparation of garum. The Guadalquivir Marshes (\"Las Marismas del Guadalquivir\"), an area of marshy lowlands near the left bank of the mouth of the Guadalquivir, was then a large inland lake known as the \"Lacus Ligustinus\" in Latin. The lake slowly infilled with deposited sediment, gradually giving way to the current marshes.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn 1262, after conquering the vassal kingdom of Niebla, King Alfonso X established a \"Real Cazadero\" (royal hunting preserve) in the Las Rocinas forest, between the Rio Tinto and the Guadalquivir, partly due to the abundance of deer there, as well as the small sanctuary of Santa Olalla, since disappeared, on the \"Arroyo de la Rocina\".\nIn 1297, his son Sancho IV granted Guzm\u00e1n el Bueno the Lordship of Sanl\u00facar, consisting of the territory located behind Arenas Gordas on the left bank of the Guadalquivir estuary, and which remained in the hands of the House of Medina-Sidonia for over six centuries. The noble house was established in 1369, when Henry II of Castile granted the fourth Lord of Sanl\u00facar the County of Niebla. In 1493 the Catholic Monarchs donated part of the land of the present village of El Roc\u00edo to the royal secretary, whose son later sold it to the town of Almonte. Previously, new breeding stock had been introduced among the local populations of wild boar and deer, while wolf hunting was encouraged for the benefit of cattle and horse ranching.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the region of Niebla, specifically at Las Rocinas, the land is flat, covered by thickets, and wild boars are always to be found there... ...one may not traverse this ground in the winter, which is generally very wet, except during a drought, nor in summer because it is then so dry and miserably uncomfortable. ~Alfonso XI in his \"Libro de la Monter\u00eda\" (The Book of Hunting), written between 1342 and 1348\nEarly modern.\nNearly a century later, Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n y Sotomayor, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia and commander of the Spanish Armada, bought back part of the land. His wife, Ana de Silva y Mendoza, daughter of the Princess of Eboli, moved to a country retreat there called \"Coto de Do\u00f1a Ana\" (Do\u00f1a Ana Game Preserve), which was the origin of the current name \"Do\u00f1ana\"; the house was renovated years later as a palace. Reference to the use of Coto Donana as a hunting lodge is made in the first verses of the \"La F\u00e1bula de Polifemo y Galatea\" (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea), which the lyric poet Luis de G\u00f3ngora dedicated to the Count of Niebla, and in which he requests that the nobles suspend their hunting exploits to hear his verses. In 1624, King Philip IV stayed at the estate for several days as a guest of the 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia, and joined in some large hunts. He brought with him a great variety of comestibles, which included such luxuries as snow from the mountains for the frequent banquets he held in honor of the duke. In 1797 Francisco Goya stayed in the palace as a guest of his patrons, the 15th Duke of Medina-Sidonia and his wife, the 13th Duchess of Alba. Here Goya created his \"\u00c1lbum A\", a collection of drawings, and apparently painted his famous portraits, \"La Maja Vestida\" (\"The Clothed Maja\") and \"La Maja Desnuda\" (\"The Naked Maja\"), rumored to portray the duchess.\nLate modern, creation of the National Park.\nAfter 1854, with the publishing of a discussion of the area in a treatise called \"Avifauna de Do\u00f1ana: Cat\u00e1logo de las aves observadas en algunas provincias andaluzas\" (\"Avifauna of Do\u00f1ana: Catalogue of the birds observed in some Andalusian provinces\"), by Antonio Machado y Nunez, the public began to appreciate its ecological value for the many different species of wildlife found there. Consequently, it was visited by British naturalists and hunters including Abel Chapman and Walter J. Buck, both of whom wrote books that alerted a wider audience in Europe to the strategic importance of Do\u00f1ana for migratory birds traveling to Africa. Later, when Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Caro (1865-1915) became the 19th Duke of Medina Sidonia, he inherited large debts and to pay them was forced to sell off various assets, including the Coto de Do\u00f1ana, which he sold for 750,000 pesetas, finally detaching it from the noble house.\nWhen the sherry baron William Garvey bought Do\u00f1ana from the Duke in 1901, the estate was abandoned and in a state of ruin. Garvey restored the palace to its former splendor, and upon his death it passed to his brother Joseph and his niece Maria Medina y Garvey, who was married to the Duke of Tarifa, a forest engineer. In 1934 it passed to the sister of the Duchess of Tarifa, Blanca Medina and Garvey, who was married to the Marquis of Borghetto. In 1942, the Marquis sold it to a company formed by Salvador Noguera, Manuel Gonzalez and the Marquis of M\u00e9rito. Fifty years later the park was consolidated as a natural area.\nConservation.\nThe Spanish businessman Mauricio Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon y D\u00edez, Marquis of Bonanza, whose family owned a large estate in Do\u00f1ana, became interested in its ecosystems and their birdlife, and invited ornithologists from all over Europe to visit. In 1952, the Spanish ornithologists Jos\u00e9 Antonio Valverde and Francisco Bernis visited the property, with Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon serving as their guide. Valverde and the Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon family saw that the wetlands, with their richly diverse wildlife, were threatened by the Spanish government's proposals to drain them for farming and the planting of eucalyptus trees. Mauricio, together with his father, asked Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator Francisco Franco into abandoning the plans. The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio's father Manuel. By November 1953 Bernis had finished a report on the status of the Do\u00f1ana which showed that the area had exceptional ecological value. The group sought and obtained international support for their goals. The efforts of Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger, but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted.\nValverde led the first organised scientific expedition to the Donana in 1957, joined by the British naturalists Guy Mountfort, Roger Tory Peterson, and Sir Julian Huxley. A group of European conservation experts \u2013 including Guy Mountfort, Max Nicholson and Luc Hoffmann \u2013then demonstrated the crucial importance of the area as a stopover for birds migrating between the European and African continents. In 1959, the Gonzalez family sold part of their land in Do\u00f1ana for development of the Matalasca\u00f1as resort. This alarmed European conservationists, leading various institutions and anonymous donors to offer to buy part of the property. Valverde, Hoffman, and Nicholson, in partnership with the British Nature Conservancy, formed an association that organised an international drive for funds to expand the park. The campaign raised two million Swiss Francs to buy 7,000 hectares of land for annexation to that already donated by Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon. Finally, in 1963 the Spanish government and WWF bought part of the territory and created the first Do\u00f1ana preserve, and in 1964 they established the Do\u00f1ana Biological Station and the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas - CSIC) to study the biodiversity of Do\u00f1ana and other Spanish ecosystems.\nIn 1969, the WWF again joined forces with the Spanish government to purchase another section of the Guadalquivir Delta marshes and establish the Do\u00f1ana National Park.\nThat same year the Do\u00f1ana National Park was created by decree, part of whose territory was owned by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad) and part still in private hands. Ten years later the protected area was expanded and the so-called \"Preparque Do\u00f1ana\" was created. In 1980, UNESCO recognised the Do\u00f1ana National Park as a Biosphere Reserve of 77,260 hectares. The Core Zone consists of 50,720 hectares in the National Park of Do\u00f1ana. The buffer zone is 54,250 hectares in the Natural Park of Do\u00f1ana. The altitude ranges from sea level to 40 meters above sea level. Unesco considers Do\u00f1ana of world significance, based on the variety of its ecosystems and the wide number of species they harbor. In 1982 it was included in the list of wetlands of the Ramsar Convention, and in 1989 the Regional Government of Andalusia converted the Preparque into the Do\u00f1ana Natural Park. In 1994 it was listed by Unesco as a World Heritage Site, enabling the establishment of programs to preserve and manage the area. Historically, these vital wetlands have been constantly threatened by schemes to increase local agricultural output and tourism. WWF still supports the Do\u00f1ana, and is fighting proposals to drain the marshes and syphon off water for irrigation of agricultural land along the coast and expansion of tourist facilities.\nIn 1998, the Aznalc\u00f3llar Disaster occurred when a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine owned by Boliden-Apirsa (formerly Andaluza de Piritas, S.A.), the Spanish subsidiary of Boliden, releasing a flood of toxic sludge that entered the River Guadiamar, the main water source for the park. In 2000, after this major environmental catastrophe, the Spanish Ministry of Environment promoted the \"Do\u00f1ana 2005\" program, aimed at regenerating the marshes. In 2006 the responsibilities of maintaining the park were transferred to the Government of Andalusia by the Royal Decree of 9 June; the functions and services of the Nature Conservation administration thus transferred to the Andalusian state were widened, and Do\u00f1ana National Park and the Natural Park became the \"Natural area of Do\u00f1ana\", a single territory divided into areas with different levels of environmental protection. In 2008 this park was twinned with the Regional Natural Park Camargue in France, with which it shares anthropological and ethnographic aspects.\nDuring his tenure, the Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez began using Do\u00f1ana as a vacation retreat, setting a precedent for his successors. In 2010, 9200 hectares of land on the coastline were expropriated by the former Ministry of the Environment for protection. In July 2012, Unesco approved the extension of the Biosphere Reserve of Do\u00f1ana from 77,260 hectares to over 255,000 hectares and enabled compliance with the guidelines of the Man and Biosphere Program. This created a transition zone where the socio-economic interests of the various municipalities in the Do\u00f1ana region are represented. In 2019, the police closed tens of illegal wells operated largely by fruit farmers around the park which had for many years been draining water away from the park's water table. In the same year, the EU commission decided to take Spain to the European Court of Justice (EJC) for violating EU conservation rules. The court ruled in favor of the EU commission, stating that Spain has not fulfilled its obligations concerning the prevention of illegal water extraction as well as failed to take necessary measures to stop significant modifications of the park's landscape.\nIn 2023 the Junta de Andalucia sought to approve some of the illegal strawberry cultivation taking place near the park, but was blocked by the central government. The Junta reached an agreement with the national government whereby there would be more support for dryland farming. It also made an effort to mitigate damage to the national park by the acquisition of 7,000 ha of an estate called Veta la Palma. This property includes lagoons which had been used for a failed fishing farming enterprise within the natural park and which at the time of purchase were seen as a potential extension to the national park.\nIn January 2024 the bird count was the lowest on record, reflecting low water levels in the National Park. In 2025 there was more rainfall, increasing the area of the park under water. However, UNESCO was still concerned about the aquifer and there was still a threat of the national park being placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger.\nClimate.\nDo\u00f1ana Park has a mild, typically Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and relatively wet winters resulting from variations in the polar front and the subtropical ridge of high pressure. The rainy seasons are intermediate, occurring in spring and in autumn; autumn especially can produce torrential rains caused by the accumulation during the summer of heat in nearby large bodies of water, and the arrival of polar air masses. In winter, however, thermal anticyclones may occur locally. Temperatures are mild throughout the year, with maximum temperatures varying about 17\u00a0\u00b0C from winter to summer. The most significant feature of the climate is the three to five months of dry weather in the summer, when it is dominated by the subtropical anticyclone.\nFlora.\nThere are many species of flora in the park: trees, including pines, flowers such as roses, and shrubs. Of special interest are the species \"Vulpia fontquerana\", \"Tursica linaria\", \"Juniperus macrocarpa\" (maritime juniper), \"Micropyropsis tuberosa\", \"Hydrocharis morsus-ranae\" or \"Thorella verticillatinundata\", many of them endangered. Non-native species such as eucalyptus, \"Acacia longifolia\", \"Gomphocarpus fruticosus\", \"Nicotiana glauca\" or \"Carpobrotus edulis\" (cat's claw) are removed by the park service.\nOther notable species in the park, of the more than 875 indigenous to the Do\u00f1ana ecosystems are: oleander, oak, the sea wallflower, sweet saltwort, the prickly tumbleweed, marram grass, heather, camarina, lavender, sea holly, reed, carnation, bulrush, common fern, sage-leaved rock rose, rushes, labi\u00e9rnago (\"Phillyrea angustifolia\"), sea spurge, mastic, sedge, palm, pine, Scotch broom, rosemary, juniper, gorse, thyme, spurge and blackberries.\nFlora of the transdunes.\nThe ecosystem of the mobile dunes, also known as transdunes, which are formed by the prevailing south-west wind, is almost nonexistent elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula. The harshness of this ecosystem is evident in the adaptations made by some plant species to its special conditions: the dunes of sand and soil are inconsistent. The gradual burial of vegetation, especially of trees that emerge then die, killed by the slow movement of sand, is one of the most well-known phenomena in the beach area of the park.\nFauna.\nAnimals recorded within the park include 20 species of freshwater fish, 10 species of amphibians, 13 species of reptiles, 37 species of mammals and 360 non-marine bird species, of which 127 have bred in the park.\nFish.\nNative fish such as eel inhabit Do\u00f1ana as well as introduced species such as carp, and the gambusia, or pike, which is considered an invasive threat to local ecosystems. Also, you could find the sturgeon in the past because nowadays is extinct.\nReptiles.\nReptiles found in Do\u00f1ana Park include the European pond turtle, Spanish pond turtle, spur-thighed tortoise, Iberian worm lizard, Bedriaga's skink, western three-toed skink, common wall gecko, spiny-footed lizard, ocellated lizard, Carbonell's wall lizard, Andalusian wall lizard, \"Psammodromus manuelae\", Spanish psammodromus, horseshoe whip snake, ladder snake, southern smooth snake, Montpellier snake, false smooth snake, viperine snake, grass snake, Lataste's viper, loggerhead turtle and leatherback turtle.\nBirds.\nOver 300 species of bird have been recorded in the area, including range-restricted species such as Spanish imperial eagle, marbled teal, white-headed duck and red-knobbed coot. Wetland species include glossy ibis, western swamphen, ferruginous duck, Eurasian spoonbill, red-crested pochard, little and cattle egret, night and squacco heron and greater flamingo, whilst the surrounding areas can have hoopoe, Eurasian thick-knee, Spanish sparrow, Mediterranean short-toed lark and pin-tailed sandgrouse. The site also attracts many summer migrants, which can include purple heron, gull-billed tern, greater short-toed lark, short-toed eagle, European roller, western olivaceous warbler, Savi's warbler, little bittern, booted eagle, whiskered tern and rufous scrub robin.\nMammals.\n38 mammal species have been recorded, including twelve species of bat, red deer, European rabbit, European hedgehog, common genet, wildcat, wild boar, Iberian lynx, garden dormouse, Egyptian mongoose, greater white-toothed shrew, Eurasian otter, wood mouse, European polecat, red fox, European badger, Mediterranean pine vole, southwestern water vole and black rat.\nIberian lynx.\nThe Iberian lynx, whose habitat is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula, is the most endangered of the big cats. Precipitous drops in population counts led to its being declared a protected species in 1966. The only extant colonies of the Iberian lynx are in the Natural Parks of Sierra de Andujar and Cardena, Montoro, and Do\u00f1ana with its surroundings; the other mainland colonies of former times are considered extinct. In Portugal recovery efforts to preserve its remaining habitat have resulted in the creation of the Sierra Malcata Natural Reserve.\nThe Acebuche Breeding Centre in Do\u00f1ana has developed a captive breeding program which has achieved the survival of eleven individuals born in the centre, and of over thirty captured in the park, whose survival was otherwise doubtful. These conservation efforts are threatened by a high mortality rate among the cats and recurring violations of laws prohibiting cars from entering the park or driving on its roads, although, as some agencies have reported, the causes of death are not always clear. The precarious survival situation of this animal has become an emblematic symbol of the park for the general public.\nHorses.\nIn Do\u00f1ana there are two indigenous breeds of horse: the Marisme\u00f1o and the Retuertas; the latter is one of the oldest European breeds, dating to perhaps 1000 BC, and the only one living in the wild and isolated from other populations.\nCamels.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, a herd of feral dromedaries roamed the area. They may have been introduced during the Moorish Conquest of Spain in the 8th century, or they may have escaped from a herd introduced from the Canary Islands in 1829 by the Marquis de Molina as beasts of burden. By the 1950s, there were only eight individuals left, and these were threatened by poachers. By the early 1960s, there were only three, but more were released into the wild after being used in the filming of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" in 1962.\nEnvironmental issues.\nAfter the Aznalc\u00f3llar Dam disaster of 1998, public awareness of the environmental risks to which the countryside is exposed has increased. Various impact studies and environmental groups have warned repeatedly of problems that threaten the region's flora, fauna, water and soil. While the pressure of urbanization and its various demands on local ecosystems has been a concern throughout the years, this is not the only associated risk factor. UNESCO has reviewed the nomination of the park for inclusion in its \"List of World Heritage in Danger\" several times, but has yet to add it.\nImpact of infrastructure.\nThere have been a number of problems related to infrastructure near the park. A project to build an oil pipeline between Extremadura and the port of Huelva has been criticized by environmental groups, who allege it would significantly increase tanker traffic in the area with an associated risk of oil spills. Frequent dredging of the Guadalquivir to allow passage of ships to the port of Seville has been observed to cause serious disturbances in the biodynamics of the estuary. Adena, the \"Associaci\u00f3n de defensa de la naturaleza\" (Association for the defence of nature), the Spanish branch of WWF, has linked the passage of these boats with the introduction of new animals to the local ecosystems, which occurs when they discharge ballast water containing exotic species.\nThe Port of Huelva, a few kilometers from the Natural Park, is one of its major environmental threats. Francisco Bella, PSOE senator and former mayor of the town of Almonte Huelva, considers it absurd that the pipeline project has been approved while the national government and the regional government of Andalusia invest in renewable energy. As mayor of Almonte, he noted the difficulties of implementing policies that promote employment near the park: (translation) \"...we know almost everything about the ant and the lynx, but need to know how employment evolves in Do\u00f1ana.\" In line with Bella's position regarding the aqueduct, Gin\u00e9s Morata, a biologist and former president of the \"Consejo de Participaci\u00f3n de Do\u00f1ana\" (Participation Council of Do\u00f1ana), says that the project, which involves the passage of hundreds of oil tankers per year that would unload their cargoes near Do\u00f1ana, would lead to an increased possibility of oil spills.\nOverexploitation of water resources.\nAnother environmental problem is water withdrawals for irrigation, many of them illegal, which have doubled since the late 1980s to maintain water-intensive crops such as cotton, rice and more recently strawberries. The latter are grown in greenhouses, with an estimated area under plastic of between 4,500 and 6,000 hectares in the Do\u00f1ana area, producing over 90% of the Spanish strawberry crop. The boring of illegal wells to draw irrigation water from underground aquifers has apparently proliferated, while the water demands of nearby residential complexes and inappropriate usage of the water resources of nearby rivers may also affect the hydrology of the park. Other potential risks include salinization resulting from climate change; the intrusion of salt water from the Atlantic would endanger several animal species. On the other hand, desertification could also occur; recently a transfer from the Chanza-Piedras water system was approved by the \"Diputaci\u00f3n de Huelva\" (Provincial Council of Huelva) to alleviate this eventuality.\nImpact of agriculture.\nIn 2007, the World Wildlife Fund warned that strawberry farms surrounding the park, where 95% of Spanish strawberries were produced, threatened to cause catastrophic damage to the park by depleting the surrounding groundwater, notably where illegal boreholes were involved, as well as creating considerable pesticide pollution and plastic waste which was accumulating in local creeks; AFP further reported that WWF was calling for a boycott of Spanish strawberries, but this is contradicted by the remarks of a WWF Spain spokesperson, and it is uncharacteristic of WWF to call for blanket boycotts.\nAznalc\u00f3llar disaster.\nOn 25\u00a0April 1998, a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine operated by the mining company, Boliden-Apirsa, near Aznalc\u00f3llar, Seville Province, releasing 4\u20135\u00a0million cubic metres of mine tailings. The acidic tailings, which contained dangerous levels of several heavy metals, quickly reached the nearby River Agrio, and then its tributary the River Guadiamar, travelling about 40\u00a0kilometres along these waterways before they could be stopped and advancing as far as the prepark. The cleanup operation took three years, at an estimated cost of \u20ac240\u00a0million. Although the spill was slowed by levees and diverted by way of the Guadalquivir to the sea, the vulnerability of Do\u00f1ana's ecosystems to such environmental catastrophes was evident.\nTo ensure sustainable development both in the countryside and in the surrounding provinces, as well as to counteract future environmental threats, an International Commission of Experts met in 1992 to propose solutions, and produced the \"Plan de Desarrollo Sostenible de Do\u00f1ana y su Entorno\" (Plan for Sustainable Development of Do\u00f1ana and its Surroundings), briefly described as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A plan of action, implemented through the Do\u00f1ana Operational Programme and funded by the regional government of Andalusia and the Spanish State, as well as the Feder Funds, ESF and EAGGF, to revitalise both the regional infrastructure and social fabric through a new economic model of development compatible with preserving the biodiversity of such an extraordinarily important natural heritage as Do\u00f1ana.\nThis effectively became the mission statement of the Do\u00f1ana 21 Foundation, created in 1997 as a partnership between the Governing Council of the Andalusian Regional Government and the El Monte, San Fernando and Unicaja savings banks. The plan established among its objectives the promotion of actions beneficial to the natural environment, seeking the cooperation of national and European governmental bodies, and the various organizations with an interest in the park, economic or otherwise, for sustainable development of the area (e. g., by encouraging the organic farming of rice). Since then, representatives from Council agencies, businesses, trade unions and conservation organizations such as WWF have joined the foundation and collaborated in meeting its goals.\nPipeline.\nIn 2013 the construction of a pipeline in the vicinity of the park was authorized by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment.\nPilgrimage of El Roc\u00edo and ecological issues.\nThe municipality of Almonte, and therefore the park, is situated in an area in which public manifestations of religious fervor have been frequent throughout the centuries. The deities of nature and water were worshiped by the ancient Iberians, as in the goddess cult of Cybele. The cult rituals, similar in many ways to current Rocieras celebrations, were quickly adapted by the early Christians of these lands to be assimilated in their liturgy. They built a small basilica here, now defunct, but it was mainly after the reconquest of the area in 1262 that the Marian devotions were institutionalized. About 1270\u20131284, Alfonso X reconstructed the Chapel of St. Mary of Rocinas, and in 1337 Alfonso XI made the first recorded mention of the Marian cult in the area:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...e se\u00f1aladamente son los mejores sotos de correr cabo de una Iglesia que dicen de Santa Mar\u00eda de las Rocinas.(... and in particular it is said that the best groves proceed from the church of St. Mary of Rocinas.)\u00a0~Alfonso XI, 1337\nThe image of the Virgin at the Hermitage of El Roc\u00edo dates probably from the 13th century, although the current iconography representing the Virgin as a lady of the royal court was adopted in the late 16th century, according to the fashion of the time. The popularity of the cult of the \"Virgen del Roc\u00edo\" in modern times has raised concerns about the annual pilgrimage's effect on the natural environment of the park.\nThe park is used by pilgrims on their way to the Romer\u00eda de El Roc\u00edo. As this event attracts a million pilgrims annually, it has a significant negative impact on the park's eco-system. The overcrowding of pilgrims around certain dates is evident not only in the village of El Roc\u00edo where the shrine is located, but also in places within and outside the park such as the Piara del Acebuchal, the Ajol\u00ed Bridge, Boca del Lobo and the Moguer road. This has been a publicity windfall for the park, but requires stepped-up park resources for fire prevention and general monitoring, and also has had a significant negative environmental impact (e.g., increased danger of wildfires, off-road SUVs damaging sensitive ground, etc.) denounced by environmentalists.\nWildfires are a recurrent issue for the park - see Do\u00f1ana fire in 2017.\nDo\u00f1ana Biological Station.\nDo\u00f1ana Biological Station (\"Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana\") is a centre dedicated to the study of terrestrial ecology. It was created jointly in 1964 by the Spanish government and the World Wildlife Federation to support scientific research on local ecosystems; in the course of this research the status of other national and international ecosystems is also investigated. The EBD, as an administrative and scientific management agency under the aegis of the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas \u2013 CSIC), operates a research centre in Seville, the Do\u00f1ana Biological Reserve in Almonte, and a Field Station in the Natural Park of Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas in the province of Ja\u00e9n. After the World Wildlife Fund was created in 1961, one of its first actions was to acquire 6,794 hectares of the Do\u00f1ana estate 'Las Nuevas' in 1963, which it then turned over to the CSIC. The CSIC declared the area to be a \"Reserva Biol\u00f3gica\" (Biological Reserve) and in 1964 built the \"Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana\". WWF bought another section of Do\u00f1ana in 1968 totaling 3,214 hectares and later called the \"Reserva Biol\u00f3gica de Guadiamar\" (Guadiamar Biological Reserve).\nSaca de las Yeguas.\nAnother important activity of longstanding association with the park is \"La Saca de las Yeguas\" (\"The Gathering of the Mares\"), a livestock event from Almonte pertaining to the indigenous wild horses of the salt marshes of Do\u00f1ana. On 26 June, after the Feast of St. John the Baptist is celebrated, mares and new foals among the \"marisme\u00f1os\" are gathered in a traditional roundup.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These restrictions may be only imposed during peak travel times or may apply at all times. There are different types of lanes: temporary or permanent lanes with concrete barriers, two-directional or reversible lanes, and exclusive, concurrent, or contraflow lanes working in peak periods.\nThe normal minimum occupancy level is two or three occupants. Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low-emission and other green vehicles, and/or single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll. HOV lanes are normally introduced to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.\nHistory.\nUnited States.\nThe introduction of HOV lanes in the United States progressed slowly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Major growth occurred from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. The first freeway HOV lane in the United States was implemented in the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway in Northern Virginia, between Washington, DC, and the Capital Beltway, and was opened in 1969 as a bus-only lane. The busway was opened in December 1973 to carpools with four or more occupants, becoming the first instance in which buses and carpools officially shared a HOV lane over a considerable distance.\nIn 2005, the two lanes of this HOV 3+ facility carried during the morning peak hour (6:30 am to 9:30 am) a total of 31,700 people in 8,600 vehicles (3.7 persons/veh), while the three or four general-purpose lanes carried 23,500 people in 21,300 vehicles (1.1 persons/veh). Average travel time in the HOV facility was 29 minutes, and 64 minutes in the general traffic lanes. As of 2012, the I-95/I-395 HOV facility is long, extends from Washington, D.C., to Dumfries, Virginia, and has two reversible lanes separated from the regular lanes by barriers, with access through elevated on- and off-ramps. Three or more people in a vehicle (HOV 3+) are required to travel on the facility during rush hours on weekdays.\nThe second freeway HOV facility, which opened in 1970, was the contraflow bus lane on the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix in Hudson County, New Jersey. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Lincoln Tunnel XBL is the country's HOV facility with the highest number of peak hour persons among HOV facilities with utilization data available, with 23,500 persons in the morning peak, and 62,000 passengers during the four-hour morning peak.\nThe first permanent HOV facility in California was the bypass lane at the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge toll plaza, opened to the public in April 1970. The El Monte Busway (I-10 / San Bernardino Freeway) in Los Angeles was initially only available for buses when it opened in 1973. Three-person carpools were allowed to use the bus lane for three months in 1974 due to a strike by bus operators, and then permanently at a 3+ HOV from 1976. It is one of the most efficient HOV facilities in North America and was converted into a high-occupancy toll lane operation in 2013 to allow low-occupancy vehicles to bid for excess capacity on the lane in the Metro ExpressLanes project.\nBeginning in the 1970s, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration recognized the advantages of exclusive bus lanes and encouraged their funding. In the 1970s the FHWA began to allow state highway agencies to spend federal funds on HOV lanes. As a result of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo, interest in ridesharing picked up, and states began experimenting with HOV lanes. In order to reduce crude oil consumption, the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act mandated maximum speed limits of on public highways and became the first instance when the U.S. federal government provided funding for ridesharing and states were allowed to spend their highway funds on rideshare demonstration projects. The 1978 Surface Transportation Assistance Act made funding for rideshare initiatives permanent.\nAlso during the early 1970s, ridesharing was recommended for the first time as a tool to mitigate air quality problems. The 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) substantial authority to regulate air quality attainment. A final control plan for the Los Angeles Basin was issued in 1973, and one of its main provisions was a two-phase conversion of of freeway and arterial roadway lanes to bus/carpool lanes and the development of a regional computerized carpool matching system. However, it took until 1985 before any HOV project was constructed in Los Angeles County, and by 1993 there were only of HOV lanes countywide.\nA significant policy shift took place in October 1990, when a memorandum from the FHWA administrator stated that \"FHWA strongly supports the objective of HOV preferential facilities and encourages the proper application of HOV technology.\"\" Regional administrators were directed to promote HOV lanes and related facilities. Also in the early 1990s, two laws reinforced the U.S. commitment to HOV lane construction. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included HOV lanes as one of the transportation control measures that could be included in state implementation plans to attain federal air quality standards. The 1990 amendments also deny the administrator of the EPA the authority to block FHWA from funding 24-hour HOV lanes as part of the sanctions for a state's failure to comply with the Clean Air Act, if the secretary of transportation wishes to approve the FHWA funds.\nOn the other hand, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 encouraged the construction of HOV lanes, which were made eligible for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds in regions not attaining federal air quality standards. CMAQ funds may be spent on new HOV lane construction, even if the HOV designation holds only at peak travel times or in the peak direction. ISTEA also provided that under the Interstate Maintenance Program, only HOV projects would receive the 90% federal matching ratio formerly available for the addition of general purpose lanes. ISTEA, in addition, permitted state authorities to define a high occupancy vehicle as having a minimum of two occupants (HOV 2+).\nAs of 2009, California was the state with the most HOV facilities in the country, with 88, followed by Minnesota with 83 facilities, Washington with 41, Texas with 35, and Virginia with 21. By 2006, HOV lanes in California were operating at two-thirds of their capacity, and these HOV facilities carried on average 2,518 persons per hour during peak hours, substantially more people than the congested general-traffic lanes.\nAs of October 2016, the longest continuous HOV facility in the U.S. is on I-15 in Utah, extending approximately from Layton to Spanish Fork with a single HOV lane in each direction for a total of of HOV lanes. While the Utah facility is the longest, the I-495 Capital Beltway in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area extends but has two HOV lanes in each direction for a total of of HOV lanes.\nOn October 24, 2023, Michigan opened its first-ever HOV lanes on a portion of I-75 in Oakland County from South Boulevard in Bloomfield Township to 12 Mile Road in Madison Heights as part of a freeway modernization project. One lane in both directions is restricted to HOV use from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, while all other drivers regardless of the number of occupants in their vehicle can freely use the lanes outside of those hours. \nCanada.\nThe first HOV facilities in Canada were opened in Greater Vancouver and Toronto in the early 1990s, followed shortly by facilities in Ottawa, Gatineau, Montreal, and later Calgary. As of 2010 there were about of highway HOV lanes in 11 locations in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and over of arterial HOV lanes in 24 locations in Greater Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Gatineau. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) in 2006 estimated that commuters in Toronto using the HOV facilities on Highways 403 and 404 were saving 14\u201317 minutes per trip compared to their travel time before the HOV lanes opened. The MTO also estimated that almost 40% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 eastbound in the morning peak hour, compared to 14% in 2003, and 37% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 westbound in the afternoon peak hour, compared to 22% in 2003. The average rush hour speed on the HOV lanes is , compared to in general-traffic lanes on Highway 403.\nTemporary HOV lanes were added to selections of 400-series highways in the Greater Toronto Area for the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games.\nEurope.\nAs of 2012, there are a few HOV lanes in operation in Europe. The main reason for this is that, in general, European cities have better public transport services and fewer high-capacity multi-lane urban motorways than do the U.S. and Canada. However, at around 1.3 persons per vehicle, average car occupancy is relatively low in most European cities. The emphasis in Europe has been on providing bus lanes and on-street bus priority measures.\nThe first HOV lane in Europe was opened in the Netherlands in October 1993 and operated until August 1994. Its facility was a barrier-separated HOV 3+ on the A1 near Amsterdam. The facility did not attract enough users to overcome public criticism and was converted to a reversible lane open to general traffic after the judge in a legal test case ruled that Dutch traffic law lacked the concept of a car pool and thus that the principle of equality was violated.\nSpain was the next European country to introduce HOV lanes (), when median reversible Bus-VAO lanes were opened in Madrid's A-6 in 1995. This facility is Europe's oldest HOV facility that is still in operation.\nThe first HOV facility in the United Kingdom opened in Leeds in 1998. The facility was implemented on A647 road near Leeds as an experimental scheme. The HOV facility was long and operated as a HOV 2+ lane until the early 2020s. By 2022, this had been converted into a full-time bus lane.\nA HOV 3+ facility opened in Linz, Austria, in 1999.\nThe first HOV lane in Norway was implemented in May 2001 as an HOV 3+ on Elgeseter Street, an undivided four-lane arterial road in Trondheim. This facility was followed by HOV lanes in Oslo and Kristiansand.\nNew Zealand and Australia.\nThe first HOV lane (known as a Transit Lane T2 or T3) in Australia opened in February 1992, located on the Eastern Freeway in Melbourne travelling inbound. In May 2005, T2 Transit lanes were opened on Hoddle Street in Melbourne. As of 2012, there were also T2 and T3 facilities in Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane.\nIn Auckland, New Zealand, there are several short HOV 2+ and 3+ lanes throughout the region, commonly known as T2 and T3 lanes. There is a T2 transit lane in Tamaki Drive, in a short stretch between Okahu Bay Reserve and downtown Auckland. There are also T2 priority lanes on Auckland's Northern, Southern, Northwestern, and Southwestern Motorways. These priority lanes are left-side on-ramp lanes heading towards the motorway, where vehicles with two or more people can bypass the ramp meter signal. Priority lanes can also be used by trucks, buses, and motorcycles, and the priority lanes can be used by carpoolers at any time. Eleven lanes were opened to electric vehicles in a one-year trial from September 2017. There are also several short T2 and T3 facilities in North Shore City operating during rush hours.\nIndonesia.\nIn Jakarta, HOV 3+ is known as \"Three in One\" (\"Tiga dalam satu\") and was first implemented by governor Sutiyoso. HOV 3+ is implemented on weekdays in existing roads of Sisingamangaraja Road (fast and slow lane), Jalan Jenderal Sudirman (fast and slow lane), Jalan M.H. Thamrin (fast and slow lane), Medan Merdeka Barat Road, Majapahit Road, and sections of Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto. The policy was originally implemented only between 7:00 am and 10:00 am. Since the introduction of Jakarta's bus rapid transit in December 2003, the policy was extended to 7:00 am \u2013 10:00 am and 4:00 pm \u2013 7:00 pm. In September 2004, the evening time was changed to 4:30 pm \u2013 7:00 pm. Car jockeys are paid by drivers to ride on vehicles, so that those vehicles would bypass the three in one restriction. On August 30, 2016, an odd\u2013even rationing (\"ganjil-genap\") system began to replace \"3-in-1\" rule, after a successful trial. Odd plate numbers can enter former \"3-in-1\" areas on odd days and even plate numbers on even ones.\nChina.\nIn Shenzhen, HOV 2+ has been implemented on Binhai Avenue since 25 April 2016. The policy was then extended to 7:30 am \u2013 9:30 am and 5:30 pm \u2013 9:30 pm.\nIn Chengdu, from January 23, 2017, HOV 2+ has been implemented on Kehua Road South, Kehua Road Middle, and Tianfu Avenue Section 1 and 2, during 7:00 am-9: 00 am and 5:00 pm-7: 00 pm.\nIn Dalian, an expressway (Northeast Expressway, or Dongbei Expressway) linking old town and new town had one lane in both outbound and inbound directions set to HOV 2+. Starting from September 20, 2017, commuters can opt to drive in HOV lane on Northeast Expressway during the morning peak hours of 06:30-08:30, and evening peak hours of 16:30-19:00. A fine of CNY100 (about USD15) will be enforced for first violators. For a second violation, the fine will double.\nDesign and operations.\nHOV lanes may be either a single traffic lane within the main roadway with distinctive markings or a separate roadway with one or more traffic lanes either parallel to the general lanes or grade-separated, above or below the general lanes. For example, Interstate 110 in California has four HOV lanes on an upper deck.\nHOV bypass lanes are intended to allow carpool traffic, buses and police to bypass areas of regular congestion in many places. An HOV lane may operate as a reversible lane, working in the direction of the dominant traffic flow in both the morning and the afternoon. All lanes of a section of the Interstate 66 in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., are treated as an HOV during the rush hour in the primary direction of flow.\nThe traffic speed differential between HOV and general-purpose lanes creates a potentially dangerous situation if the HOV lanes are not separated by a barrier. A Texas Transportation Institute study found that HOV lanes lacking barrier separations caused a 50% increase in injury crashes.\nVariants.\nBusiness access and transit lane.\nA business access and transit (BAT) lane is a type of HOV lane that allows for all traffic to enter the lane for a short distance in order to access other streets and business entrances.\nHigh-occupancy toll lane.\nBecause some HOV lanes were not utilized to their full capacity, users of low- or single-occupancy vehicles may be permitted to use an HOV lane if they pay a toll. This scheme is known as high-occupancy toll lane (or HOT lanes), and it has been introduced mainly in the United States. The first practical implementation was California's formerly private toll 91 Express Lanes, in Orange County, California, in 1995, followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 north of San Diego. According to the Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute, by 2012 there were 294 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes and 163 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes under construction in the United States.\nSolo drivers are permitted to use the HOV lanes upon payment of a fee that varies based on demand. Tolls change throughout the day according to real-time traffic conditions, which is intended to manage the number of cars in the lanes to maintain good journey times.\nProponents claim that all motorists benefit from HOT lanes, even those who choose not to use them. This argument applies only to projects that increase the total number of lanes. Proponents also claim that HOT lanes provide an incentive to use transit and ridesharing. There has been controversy over this concept, and HOT schemes have been called \"Lexus\" lanes, as critics see this new pricing scheme as a perk for the rich.\nHOT tolls are collected by staffed toll booths, automatic number plate recognition, or electronic toll collection systems. Some systems use RFID transmitters to monitor entry and exiting of the lane and charge drivers depending on demand. Typically, tolls increase as traffic density and congestion within the tolled lanes increase, a policy known as congestion pricing. The goal of this pricing scheme is to minimize traffic congestion within the lanes.\nQualifying vehicles.\nQualification for HOV status varies by scheme, but the following vehicles may be included:\nNew York City HOV lane codes prior to 2008 did not allow motorcycles leading to ticketing of motorcycle drivers and complaints from the American Motorcyclist Association, but have since been revised to comply with the federal regulations listed above.\nIn some jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada, taxicabs and airport limousines are allowed to use HOV lanes even when no passenger is present because that vehicle \"will be able return to duty faster after dropping off a fare or arrive sooner to pick up a fare, thereby moving more people to their destinations in fewer vehicles\".\nIn Virginia, the San Francisco Bay Area, Houston, and other HOV lane locations, commuters form sluglines where drivers pick up one or more passengers from a designated \"casual carpool\" or \"slug lines\" to drive on HOV lanes; the driver pulls over near the sluglines and shouts out their destination, and people in the line going to that destination enter the car on a first-come, first-served basis.\nCompliance, enforcement, and avoidance.\nFines are usually imposed on drivers of non-qualifying vehicles who use the lanes.\nFollowing the introduction of HOVs, some drivers placed inflatable dolls in the passenger seat, a practice that persists today, even though it is now illegal. Cameras that can distinguish between humans and mannequins or dolls were tested in the United Kingdom in 2005.\nIn the United States, law enforcement officials have documented a variety of methods used by drivers in attempts to circumvent HOV occupancy rules:\nIn early 2006, an Arizona woman asserted that she had been improperly ticketed for using the HOV lane because the unborn child she was carrying in her womb justified her use of the lane, while noting that Arizona traffic laws do not define what constitutes a person. However, a judge subsequently ruled that to qualify as an \"individual\" under Arizona traffic laws, the individual must occupy a \"separate and distinct\" space in a vehicle. Likewise, in California, in order to use HOV lanes, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle, and an unborn child does not count towards this requirement.\nIn 2009 and 2010 it was found that non-compliance rates on HOV lanes in Brisbane, Australia, were approaching 90%. Enhanced enforcement led to increased compliance, average bus journey times dropped by about 19%, and total person throughput increased by 12%.\nIn February 2010, a 61-year-old woman tried to pass off a life-sized mannequin as a passenger in order to use the HOV lane in New York State. A police officer on a routine HOV patrol became suspicious when he noticed that the so-called passenger was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. When the officer approached the vehicle, he discovered that the \"passenger\" was, in fact, a mannequin wearing lipstick, designer shades, a full-length wig, and a blue sweater. The driver was issued a traffic ticket for using the HOV lane without a human passenger, which carries a fine of $135 in 2010 and two points on a driver's license.\nIn January 2013, a motorist tried to claim that the Articles of Incorporation of his business, which had been placed unbuckled on the passenger\u2019s seat, constituted a person, citing the principle of corporate personhood and California's state Vehicle Code, which defines a person as \"natural persons and corporations\". This argument was rejected in traffic court, where the presiding judge commented, \"Common sense says carrying a sheaf of papers in the front seat does not relieve traffic congestion.\"\nIn March 2015, a motorist tried to use a cardboard cutout of actor Jonathan Goldsmith to access an HOV lane in Fife, Washington. The officer noted that other drivers had used sleeping bags in earlier attempts to access the HOV lane.\nIn July 2022, a pregnant woman in Texas argued that her fetus counted as a passenger for the purpose of using the HOV lane following the \"Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization\" decision and Texas law subsequently considering fetuses people.\nEffectiveness.\nAccording to 2009 data from the U.S. census, 76% drive to work alone and only 10% rideshare. For suburban commuters working in a city, the solo driving rate is 82%.\nSome underused HOV lanes in several states have been converted to high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT), which offer solo drivers access to HOV lanes after paying a toll.\nHOV lanes are also an effective way to manage traffic after natural disasters, as seen in New York City after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. At the time Mayor Bloomberg banned passenger cars with fewer than three occupants from entering Manhattan. The restriction affected all bridges and tunnels entering the city except the George Washington Bridge.\nCriticism.\nCritics have argued that HOV lanes are underused. It is unclear whether HOV lanes are sufficiently used to compensate for delays in the other mixed-use lanes.\nThe situations have caused social problems in Indonesia, where some people become \"car jockey\", people who make their living by offering drivers to fill their car in order to meet the occupancy limit. Reportedly, the situation caused people stay in unemployment for doing so, increased congestion, and let parents profit from their babies.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served as a United States senator, as the mayor of New York City, and as the sixth governor of New York. In the last capacity, he was largely responsible for the construction of the Erie Canal. Clinton was a major candidate for the American presidency in the election of 1812, challenging incumbent James Madison.\nA nephew of two-term U.S. vice president and New York governor George Clinton, DeWitt Clinton was his uncle's secretary before launching his own political career. As a Democratic-Republican, Clinton won election to the New York State Legislature in 1798 before briefly serving as a U.S. Senator. Returning to New York, Clinton served three terms as the appointed Mayor of New York City and the lieutenant governor of New York State. In the 1812 presidential election, Clinton won support from the Federalists as well as from a group of Democratic-Republicans who were dissatisfied with Madison. Though Madison won re-election, Clinton carried most of the Northeastern United States and fared significantly better than the previous two Federalist-supported tickets. After the presidential election, Clinton continued to be affiliated with the Democratic-Republican Party.\nClinton was governor of New York from 1817 to 1822 and from 1825 to 1828, and presided over the construction of the Erie Canal. Clinton believed that infrastructure improvements could transform American life, drive economic growth, and encourage political participation. He heavily influenced the development of infrastructure both in New York State and in the United States as a whole.\nEarly life.\nClinton was born on March 2, 1769, the second son born to Major-General James Clinton and his wife Mary De Witt (1737\u20131795), who was a descendant of the Dutch patrician De Witt family. He was born in Little Britain, New York, which today is a hamlet in the western part of New Windsor. He attended Kingston Academy and began his college studies at the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University) before transferring to King's College (which was renamed Columbia College while he was a student there; Clinton was in the first class to graduate under the school's new name.) He was the brother of U.S. Representative George Clinton Jr., the half-brother of U.S. Representative James G. Clinton, and the cousin of Simeon De Witt. He became the secretary to his uncle George Clinton, who was then governor of New York. Soon afterwards he became a member of the Democratic-Republican Party.\nPolitical career.\nEarly career.\nClinton was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1798, and of the New York State Senate (representing its Southern District) in 1798\u20131802 and 1806\u20131811 He was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1801.\nIn 1801, his uncle George Clinton appointed him to head the Council of Appointments, which held the power under the state constitution to appoint thousands of public positions, including sheriffs and the mayor of New York City. He would serve on the committee from 1801 to 1802 and again from 1806 to 1807. As chair of the council, Clinton controlled patronage throughout the state. Because the council was overwhelmingly Republican and loyal to the Clintons, DeWitt suddenly became the most powerful politician in the state. He used his power to deny supporters of Aaron Burr and members of the Tammany Society key roles.\nIn 1802, he used his authority as a director of the Manhattan Company, the leading Republican bank in the state, to force the withdrawal of Burr and his key supporter John Swartwout. Swartwout accused Clinton of destroying Burr to advance his own political career; in response, Clinton called Swartwout \"a liar, a scoundrel and a villain\". Swartwout challenged Clinton to a duel in New Jersey (where duelling was legal), in which Clinton wounded Swartwout.\nThe New York State legislature elected him to fill New York's U.S. Senate seat, which had been left vacant by the resignation of John Armstrong Jr.; he served in that capacity from February 9, 1802, to November 4, 1803. He resigned due to unhappiness with his living conditions in the newly built city of Washington, DC; next, he was appointed the mayor of New York City.\nMayor of New York City.\nHe served as mayor of New York from 1803 to 1807, 1808 to 1810, and 1811 to 1815. He organized the New-York Historical Society in 1804 and was its president, and he was a leader in launching the Erie Canal. He also helped to reorganize the American Academy of the Fine Arts in 1808 and served as its president between 1813 and 1817. He was a regent of the University of the State of New York from 1808 to 1825. Clinton was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814 and was its vice president from 1821 to 1828. In 1816, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nLieutenant Governor of New York.\nIn 1811, the death of John Broome left a vacancy in the office of lieutenant governor of New York. In a special election, Clinton defeated the Federalist Nicholas Fish and the Tammany Hall candidate Marinus Willett to become lieutenant governor until the end of the term in June 1813.\nPresidential campaign.\nClinton's uncle, George Clinton, had attempted to challenge James Madison for the presidency in 1808 but was chosen as the party's vice presidential nominee instead. In 1812, after George Clinton's death, the elder Clinton's supporters gravitated towards DeWitt Clinton. Clinton ran for president as a candidate both for the Federalist Party and for a small group of antiwar Democratic-Republicans. In the close election of 1812, Clinton was defeated by President Madison. Clinton received 89 electoral votes to Madison's 128. It was the strongest showing of any Federalist candidate for the U.S. presidency since 1800, and a change in the votes of one or two states would have given Clinton the victory.\nGovernor of New York.\nAfter the resignation of Daniel D. Tompkins, who had been elected vice president, he won a special gubernatorial election in which he was the only candidate; 1,479 votes were cast for Peter Buell Porter against Clinton's 43,310, because the Tammany organization, which fiercely hated Clinton, had printed ballots with Porter's name on them and distributed them among the Tammany followers in New York City. On July 1, 1817, Clinton took office as governor of New York. He was re-elected in 1820, defeating Vice President Tompkins in a narrow race\u2014DeWitt Clinton received 47,447 votes, as opposed to Tompkins's 45,900\u2014and served until December 31, 1822.\nDuring his second term, the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 shortened the gubernatorial term to two years and moved the beginning of the term from July 1 to January 1, which cut off the last six months of his three-year term. The gubernatorial election was also moved from April to November, but Clinton was not renominated by his party to run for re-election in November 1822. Even so, he kept his post as president of the Erie Canal Commission. In April 1824, most of his political opponents, the Bucktails, voted in the New York State legislature for his removal from the Canal Commission, which caused such a wave of indignation among the electorate that he was nominated for governor by the People's Party and was re-elected governor, defeating the official candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party, his fellow Canal Commissioner Samuel Young. He served another two terms until his sudden death in office.\nFreemasonry.\nClinton was a York Rite Freemason. He was initiated in the \"Holland\" Lodge No. 16 (now No 8), NY on September 3, 1790, and, in 1806, he was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New York. Clinton was essential in establishing the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar in the United States and served as its first, second, and third grand master from 1816 to 1828. He retained the title until his death in 1828.\nIn 1826, the William Morgan Affair occurred in Batavia. Morgan, who threatened to publish an expos\u00e9 of the rituals of Freemasonry, disappeared and was apparently kidnapped and supposedly murdered by Masons. Clinton issued three proclamations, each increasing the reward for information and conviction of the perpetrators until it reached $2,000. Clinton's proclamations had no effect, however, and the Masonic fraternity underwent a period of severe decline in many regions of the United States because of criticism set off by the scandal.\nThe Grand Lodge of New York has established the DeWitt Clinton Award, which recognizes distinguished or outstanding community service by non-Masonic organizations or individuals whose actions exemplify a shared concern for the well-being of Mankind and a belief in the worldwide brotherhood of Man.\nErie Canal.\nFrom 1810 to 1824, Clinton was a member of the Erie Canal Commission. He was among its first members, who were appointed in 1810 and planned and surveyed the route to be taken.\nAs governor, Clinton was largely responsible for the construction of the Erie Canal. He was persuaded by Canal proponent Jesse Hawley to support construction of a canal from the eastern shore of Lake Erie to the upper Hudson River. Many thought the project to be impracticable, and opponents mocked it as \"Clinton's Folly\" and \"DeWitt's Ditch\". But in 1817, he persuaded the legislature to appropriate $7 million ($168,315,263.16 in 2025 dollars) for its construction.\nWhen the canal was finished in 1825, Clinton opened it and traveled in the packet boat \"Seneca Chief\" along the canal to Buffalo. After riding from the mouth of Lake Erie to New York City, he emptied two casks of water from Lake Erie into New York Harbor to celebrate the first connection of waters from the East with waters from the West. The canal was an immense success, carrying huge numbers of passengers and a huge amount of freight traffic. The cost of moving freight between Buffalo and Albany fell from $100 to $10 per ton, and the state was able to quickly recoup the funds that it had spent on the project by collecting tolls along the canal. The completion of the canal brought about a significant shift in public opinion about Clinton: he was now hailed for having completed the canal.\nThat change in public opinion was reflected in the newspapers of the time. They had previously been filled with harsh criticisms of Clinton and the canal, but now celebrated his accomplishment. For example, an article in the \"New Hampshire Sentinel\" began: \"The efforts of Gov. Clinton to advance the best interest of the State over which he presides are very generally acknowledged both by his constituents and the public abroad. His exertions in favor of the great canal have identified his name with that noble enterprise, and he will be remembered while its benefits are experienced\" It ended, \"Yield credit to Clinton, and hail him by name\".\nPhilanthropy.\nTogether with financier Thomas Eddy, he was a director of New York's earliest savings bank established to serve laborers and the poor, The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York.\nPersonal life.\nClinton was married twice. On February 13, 1796, he married Maria Franklin, daughter of the prominent New York Quaker merchant Walter Franklin and descendant of John Bowne and Elizabeth Fones. With her, he had ten children, and four sons and three daughters had survived at the time of her death in 1818. Among his children with Franklin was George William Clinton, who served as mayor of Buffalo, New York from 1842 to 1843.\nOn May 8, 1819, Clinton married Catharine Jones, the daughter of a New York physician, Thomas Jones and his wife, Margaret (n\u00e9e Livingston) Jones (a daughter of Edward Livingston). Catharine's sister, Mary (n\u00e9e Jones) Gelston, was the wife of Deacon Maltby Gelston of Southampton, and the mother of David Gelston, Collector of the Port of New York. Catharine outlived her husband.\nIn 1813, Clinton became a hereditary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati in succession to his brother, Lieutenant Alexander Clinton, who was an original member of the society. In that same year, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.\nWhen Clinton died suddenly of heart failure in Albany on February 11, 1828, he left his family in poor financial condition. While he was a fine administrator in government, he had handled his own financial affairs rather poorly. As a result, the Clinton family was badly in debt and had no means of support after the governor's death. One creditor alone put in a claim for $6,000. Fearing that he might not get his money, the creditor obtained a judgment that resulted in a public sale of most of the Clinton family possessions. Enough money was realized from the sale of the property to satisfy the judgment, but nothing was left to help the Clinton family through the difficult years ahead. The governor received the grandest of state funerals, but when it was all over, the family had no place to bury him. His widow was completely without funds to purchase a suitable grave site. As a result, Clinton's remains were placed in the family vault of Dr. Samuel Stringer (1735\u20131817), an old friend and fellow Mason from Albany, in the old Swan Street Cemetery.\nSixteen years later, enough money was collected to provide a suitable burial. On June 21, 1844, a newspaper in Albany printed this small announcement: \"The remains of DeWitt Clinton, which had been deposited in the cemetery in Swan Street, were removed to New York for interment under a monument created by the family.\" Clinton was reinterred at the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.\nLegacy.\nClinton's accomplishments as a leader in civic and state affairs included improving the New York public school system, encouraging steam navigation, and modifying the laws governing criminals and debtors. The 1831 \"DeWitt Clinton\" locomotive was named in his honor. The community of Whitestone, New York was for several decades after his death known as Clintonville, but reverted to its traditional name; however, the governor is memorialized by Clintonville Street, a major local road.\nHis portrait appears on many tobacco tax stamps of the late 1800s to early 1900s.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55469", "revid": "48181213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55469", "title": "Catch-22", "text": "1961 novel by Joseph Heller\nCatch-22 is a satirical war novel by American author Joseph Heller. It was his debut novel. He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the 20th century, it uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot.\nThe novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of antihero Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea west of the Italian mainland, although it also includes episodes from basic training at Lowry Field in Colorado and Air Corps training at Santa Ana Army Air Base in California. The novel examines the absurdity of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home.\nThe book was made into a film adaptation in 1970, directed by Mike Nichols, and a miniseries in 2019, produced by George Clooney. In 1994, Heller published a sequel to the novel titled \"Closing Time\".\nSynopsis.\nThe main character, Yossarian, is introduced in the setting of a military hospital where he has retreated under the guise of a chronic liver condition to avoid flying further combat missions since he has grown disillusioned with the war effort and distrustful of his commanding officers. Throughout the novel, the commanding officers show extreme disregard for the lives of their troops and are all too willing to sacrifice their men to further their own ends. Especially, Colonel Cathcart volunteers his unit to fly dangerous missions and forces his men to fly more combat missions than any other unit, constantly raising the number of missions necessary to complete a tour of duty so that the men can never return home, because he wishes to be seen as brave by his superiors even though he has only ever flown a single combat mission. After flying forty-four combat missions, Yossarian has become traumatized by aerial combat and witnessing the deaths of his friends; he is terrified of being killed in action during each combat mission, but still succeeds in flying twenty-seven more missions over the course of the novel, totaling seventy-one by the end. As the novel progresses, Yossarian's moral character and courage emerge more clearly, in contrast to his seeming selfishness and cowardice when first introduced. He is shown to be an honest, loyal, and able flyer who has been pushed to desperation by the selfishness and cowardice of the authorities responsible for him, especially doctors and military leaders.\nThe development of the novel can be split into sections:\nFor most of the book, the reader is cushioned from directly experiencing the full horror of war, but the existence of these horrors is implied by the extreme trauma and fear that afflicts the airmen. In the final section, these events are laid bare. The horror begins with a pointless attack on an undefended Italian mountain village, with the succeeding chapters incorporating depictions of despair (Doc Daneeka and the chaplain), disappearance in combat (Orr and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) and death of most of Yossarian's friends (Nately, McWatt, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the horrors of Chapter 39, in particular Aarfy's rape and murder of the innocent young woman Michaela. In Chapter 41 the full details of the death of Snowden are finally revealed.\nNevertheless, the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning of Orr's miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian's pledge to follow him there.\nStyle.\nMany events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative's events are out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words, phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect.\nMuch of Heller's prose in \"Catch-22\" is circular and repetitive, exemplifying in its form the structure of a Catch-22. Circular reasoning is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels in paradox. For example: \"The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him,\" and \"The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with.\" This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book. This style is also recognizable regarding how exactly Clevinger's trial would be executed by Lieutenant Scheisskopf: \"As a member of the Action Board, Lieutenant Scheisskopf was one of the judges who would weigh the merits of the case against Clevinger as presented by the prosecutor. Lieutenant Scheisskopf was also the prosecutor. Clevinger had an officer defending him. The officer defending him was Lieutenant Scheisskopf.\"\nWhile a few characters are most prominent, especially Yossarian and the Chaplain, the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any \"minor characters\". There are no traditional heroes in the novel, reflecting the underlying commentary that war has no heroes, only victims.\nAlthough its nonchronological structure may at first seem random, \"Catch-22\" is highly structured. It is founded on a structure of free association; ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections. For example, Chapter 1, titled \"The Texan\", ends with \"everybody but the CID man, who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.\" Chapter 2, titled \"Clevinger\", begins with \"In a way, the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on.\" The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links.\nAs Heller utilizes an episodic structure for most of the novel, many chapters may appear to be a disjointed series of events with little or no connection with each other. However, individual chapters often deal with thematically unique ideas, such as Chapter 11 (\u201cCaptain Black\u201d) which parodies Red Scare-era McCarthyism, and Chapter 18 (\u201cThe Soldier Who Saw Everything Twice\u201d) which explores theological concepts of mortality.\nThemes.\nParadox.\nYossarian comes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that \"they\" are \"out to get him.\" The reason Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions, Colonel Cathcart increases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised. He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almost jaundice. In Yossarian's words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which \"side\" he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.\nTragedy and farce.\nMuch of the farce in the novel is fueled by intentional and unintentional miscommunication, occasionally leading to tragic consequences. For example, Cathcart's desire to become a general is thwarted by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen sabotaging his correspondence. Major Major's and Yossarian's mis-censoring of correspondence is blamed on the Chaplain, who is threatened with imprisonment as a result.\nTheodicy.\nYossarian questions the idea that God is all-powerful, all-good, and all knowing. The narrator seems to believe that God, if not evil, is incompetent. In chapter 18, Yossarian states that he \"believes in the God he doesn't believe in\", this version of God having created Hitler, the war, and all the failures of human life and society, as exemplified in the following passage:\"And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways\", Yossarian continued, hurtling over her objections. \"There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing or else He's forgotten all about us. That's the kind of God you people talk about \u2013 a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did he ever create pain? \u2026 Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! [to warn us of danger] Why couldn't He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person's forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn't He? \u2026 What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. \u2026\"Later Heller writes of Yossarian wandering through a war-torn Italian city (Chapter 39): \"Yossarian quickened his pace to get away, almost ran. The night was filled with horrors, and he thought he knew how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts, like a victim through a prison full of thieves. What a welcome sight a leper must have been. At the next corner a man was beating a small boy brutally in the midst of an immobile crowd of adult spectators who made no effort to intervene\u00a0...\"\nMilitary-industrial complex.\nWhile the military's enemies are Germans, none appear in the story as enemy combatants. This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel, who act as pilots employed by the squadron's mess officer, Milo Minderbinder, to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa. This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine, which seems to generate violence simply as another means to profit, quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints which creates a military\u2013industrial complex. Heller emphasizes the danger of profit-seeking by portraying Milo without \"evil intent\". Milo's actions are portrayed as the result of greed, not malice.\nCharacters.\nThe novel has over 50 named characters, many of whom have titular chapters dedicated to expanding on their personalities or motivations.\nInfluences.\nHeller wanted to be a writer from an early age. His experiences as a bombardier during World War II inspired \"Catch-22\"; Heller later said that he \"never had a bad officer\". In a 1977 essay on \"Catch-22\", Heller stated that the \"antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book\" were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller's criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and McCarthyism.\nThe influence of the 1950s on \"Catch-22\" is evident through Heller's extensive use of anachronism. Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms like loyalty oaths and computers (IBM machines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s. Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s:\nCzech writer Arno\u0161t Lustig recounts in his book \"3x18\" that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written \"Catch-22\" had he not first read \"The Good Soldier \u0160vejk\" by Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek.\nIn 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller's book had questionable similarities to Louis Falstein's 1950 novel, \"Face of a Hero\". Falstein never raised the issue between \"Catch-22\"'s publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by C\u00e9line, Waugh and Nabokov. Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different.\nConcept.\nA \"Catch-22\" is \"a problem for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule\". For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one cannot see to look for them \u2013 a Catch-22. The term \"Catch-22\" is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation.\nIn the book, Catch-22 is a military rule typifying bureaucratic operation and reasoning. The rule is not stated in a precise form, but the principal example in the book fits the definition above: If one is crazy, one does not have to fly missions; and one must be crazy to fly. But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy. As a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused. The narrator explains:\nThere was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5)\nOther forms of Catch-22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs' explanation of one of Catch-22's provisions: \"Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating.\" Another character explains: \"Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.\"\nYossarian comes to realize that Catch-22 does not actually exist, but because the powers that be claim it does, and the world believes it does, it nevertheless has potent effects. Indeed, because it does not exist, there is no way it can be repealed, undone, overthrown, or denounced. The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book's primary motifs.\nThe motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994's \"Closing Time\", Heller's sequel to \"Catch-22\". This darker, slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives of some of the major characters in \"Catch-22\", with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer.\nLiterary allusions.\n\"Catch-22\" contains allusions to many works of literature. Howard Jacobson, in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was \"positioned teasingly\u00a0... between literature and literature's opposites\u00a0\u2013 between Shakespeare and Rabelais and Dickens and Dostoevsky and Gogol and C\u00e9line and the Absurdists and of course Kafka on the one hand, and on the other vaudeville and slapstick and Bilko and Abbott and Costello and Tom and Jerry and the Goons (if Heller had ever heard of the Goons).\"\nOne critic argues that it is Kafka's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel: \"Like Kafka's heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare \u2013 in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly.\"\nHistorical context.\nThe idea for \"Catch-22\" was based on Joseph Heller's personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber crew felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. For this reason, the book contains references to post World War II phenomena like IBM computers and loyalty oaths. The war experience turned Heller into a \"tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being\".\nAfter publication in 1961, \"Catch-22\" became very popular among teenagers at the time. \"Catch-22\" seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of \"Catch-22\". The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. On October 26, 1986, professor and author John W. Aldridge wrote a piece in \"The New York Times\" celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing of \"Catch-22\". He commented that Heller's book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come:\nThe comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive.\nTitle.\nThe title refers to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation that embodies illogical and immoral reasoning. The idea being that if one pleads insanity to stop flying missions with a high mortality rate, one is in fact sane; however, one must be insane to keep flying those exact missions. The opening chapter of the novel was first published, in 1955, by \"New World Writing\" as \"Catch-18\", but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, asked him to change the title, to avert its confusion with Leon Uris's recently published \"Mila 18\". The implications in Judaism of the number 18 \u2013 which refers to \"chai\", meaning \"alive\", in Gematria \u2013 were relevant to Heller's somewhat greater emphasis on Jewish themes in early drafts of his novel. Heller's daughter Erica wrote that the Simon &amp; Schuster editor, Robert Gottlieb, was the person who came up with the number 22, and Gottlieb himself stated that he did in the documentary \".\"\nParallels among a number of character exchanges in the novel suggested the doubled-one title of \"Catch-11\", but the 1960 release of \"Ocean's Eleven\" eliminated that. \"Catch-17\" was rejected so as not to be confused with the World War II film \"Stalag 17\", as was \"Catch-14\", apparently because the publisher did not believe that 14 was a \"funny number\". Eventually, the title came to be \"Catch-22\", which, like 11, has a duplicated digit, with the 2 also referring to a number of \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\"-like events common in the novel.\nPublication and movie rights.\n\"Catch-22\" was sold to Simon &amp; Schuster, where it had been championed by editor Robert Gottlieb, who, along with Nina Bourne, edited and oversaw the marketing of the book. Gottlieb was a strong advocate for the book along with Peter Schwed and Justin Kaplan. Henry Simon, a vice president at Simon &amp; Schuster, found it repetitive and offensive. The editorial board decided to contract the book when Heller agreed to revisions; he signed for US$\u00a0in 1961.\nOfficially published on October 10, 1961, the hardcover sold for $5.95. The book was not a best-seller in hardcover in the United States. Though twelve thousand copies were sold by Thanksgiving, it never entered \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. It received good notices and was nominated for the National Book Award in March 1962, though Walker Percy's \"The Moviegoer\" won. \"Catch-22\" went through four printings in hardcover but sold well on only the East Coast. The book never established itself nationally until it was published in paperback for 75 cents.\nUpon publication in Great Britain, the book became the No. 1 best-seller. Don Fine of Dell Paperbacks bought the paperback reprint rights to \"Catch-22\" for $32,000. Between the paperback's release in September 1962 and April 1963, it sold 1.1\u00a0million copies.\nIn August 1962, Donadio brokered the sale of movie rights to Columbia Pictures for $100,000 plus $25,000 to write a treatment or a first draft of a screenplay.\nReception.\nThe initial reviews of the book ranged from very positive to very negative. There were positive reviews from \"The Nation\" (\"the best novel to come out in years\"), the \"New York Herald Tribune\" (\"A wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book\") and \"The New York Times\" (\"A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights\"). On the other hand, \"The New Yorker\" disliked it (\"doesn't even seem to be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper\", \"what remains is a debris of sour jokes\"), and a second review from the \"New York Times\" also disliked it (\"repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest\"). One commentator of \"Catch-22\" recognized that \"many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it\". The book eventually gained a cult following, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller later remarked that in 1962, after appearing on the \"Today\" show he went out drinking with the host at the time, John Chancellor, who handed him stickers that Chancellor had got privately printed reading \"YOSSARIAN LIVES\". Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them on the walls of the corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building.\nAlthough the novel won no awards upon release, it has remained in print and is seen as one of the most significant American novels of the 20th century. Scholar and fellow World War II veteran Hugh Nibley said it was the most accurate book he ever read about the military. As of 2016[ [update]] over ten million copies have been sold.\nAlthough he continued writing, including a sequel novel \"Closing Time\", Heller's later works were inevitably overshadowed by the success of \"Catch-22\". When asked by critics why he had never managed to write another novel as good as his first, Heller would retort with a smile, \"Who has?\"\nChallenges.\n\"Catch-22\" has landed on the list of the American Library Association's banned and challenged classics.\nIn 1972, the school board in Strongsville, Ohio, removed \"Catch-22\", as well as two books by Kurt Vonnegut, from school libraries and the curriculum. Five families sued the school board. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claim, stating that school boards had the right to control the curriculum. The decision was overturned on appeal in 1976. The court wrote, \"A library is a storehouse of knowledge. Here we are concerned with the right of students to receive information which they and their teachers desire them to have.\" In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court employed a similar rationale in its decision in \"Island Trees School District v. Pico\" on the removal of library books.\nBecause the book refers to some women as \"whores\", it was challenged at the Dallas, Texas, Independent School District (1974) and Snoqualmie, Washington (1979).\nSelected releases.\nThis list covers the first and most recent printed publications by the original publisher Simon &amp; Schuster as well as all other formats. Other print publishers include Dell, Corgi, Vintage, Black Swan, \u00c9ditions Grasset, and Wahlstr\u00f6m &amp; Widstrand.\nThe original manuscript is held by Brandeis University.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 93,584. Its county seat is Bath. Its name is in honor of Baron von Steuben, a Prussian general who fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War, though it is not pronounced the same (). The county is part of the Southern Tier region of the state.\nSteuben County comprises the Corning, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Elmira-Corning, NY Combined Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nOntario County was established in 1789 to govern lands the state of New York had acquired in the Phelps and Gorham Purchase; at the time it covered the entirety of Western New York. Steuben County, much larger than today, was split off from Ontario County on March 8, 1796. In 1823 a portion of Steuben County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to form Yates County. Steuben County was further reduced in size on April 17, 1854, when a portion was combined with portions of Chemung and Tompkins counties to form Schuyler County.\nIn its earliest years Steuben County was demographically and geographically linked to the Susquehanna River basin in Pennsylvania, leading to the port of Baltimore. The Canisteo River, navigable as far as Arkport, emptied into the Chemung River and it into the Susquehanna. There were no natural barriers, like the Cohoes Falls on the Mohawk, to impede transportation, and timber and other agricultural products were easily shipped downriver from what are today (2019) the towns of Addison, Canisteo, and Hornellsville. Prior to the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, followed by the railroads, communication with the Hudson Valley and New York City was difficult. Limited to horses, mules, and donkeys, it was far too expensive to be used to ship bulky agricultural products.\nIn 1892 a bill was introduced in the Legislature to split Steuben County, with Canisteo, Corning, and \"the south towns\" becoming Lincoln County. It did not pass.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.\nSteuben County is in the southwestern part of New York State, immediately north of the Pennsylvania border.

{"id": "55483", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55483", "title": "Robinson Crusoe", "text": "1719 novel by Daniel Defoe\nRobinson Crusoe ( ) is an English adventure novel by Daniel Defoe, first published on 25\u00a0April 1719. It is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre, and has been described as the first novel, or at least the first English novel \u2013 although these labels are disputed.\nWritten with a combination of epistolary, confessional, and didactic forms, the book follows the title character (born Robinson Kreutznaer) after he is cast away and spends 28 years on a remote tropical desert island near the coasts of Venezuela and Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers before being rescued. The story has been thought to be based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on a Pacific island called \"M\u00e1s a Tierra\" (now part of Chile) which was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966. Pedro Serrano is another real-life castaway whose story might have inspired the novel.\nThe first edition credited the work's protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and that the book was a non-fiction travelogue. Despite its simple narrative style, \"Robinson Crusoe\" was well received in the literary world.\nBefore the end of 1719, the book had already run through four editions, and it has gone on to become one of the most widely published books in history, spawning so many imitations, not only in literature but also in film, television, and radio, that its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade.\nPlot summary.\nRobinson Crusoe (the family name coming from the German name \"Kreutznaer\") sets sail from Kingston upon Hull, England, on a sea voyage in August\u00a01651, against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in law. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his desire for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster, as the ship is taken over by Sal\u00e9 pirates (the Sal\u00e9 Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by a Moor. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a captain of a Portuguese ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship is \"en route\" to Brazil. Crusoe sells Xury to the captain. With the captain's help, Crusoe procures a plantation in Brazil.\nYears later, Crusoe joins an expedition to purchase slaves from Africa but the ship gets blown off course in a storm about forty miles out to sea and runs aground on the sandbar of an island off the Venezuelan coast (which he calls the \"Island of Despair\") near the mouth of the Orinoco River on 30\u00a0September 1659.Chapter\u00a023 The crew lowers the jolly boat, but it gets swamped by a tidal wave, drowning the crew, but leaving Crusoe the sole human survivor. He observes the latitude as 9\u00a0degrees and 22\u00a0minutes north. He sees penguins and seals on this island. Aside from Crusoe, the captain's dog and two cats survive the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair, he fetches arms, tools and other supplies from the ship before the next storm breaks it apart. He builds a fenced-in habitat near a cave which he excavates. By making marks in a wooden cross, he creates a calendar post to keep track of his time on the island. Over the years, by using tools salvaged from the ship, and some which he makes himself, he hunts animals, grows barley and rice, dries grapes to make raisins, learns to make pottery and traps and raises goats. He also adopts a small parrot. He reads the Bible and becomes religious, thanking God for his fate in which nothing is missing but human society. He also builds two boats: a large dugout canoe that he intends to use to sail to the mainland, but ends up being too large and too far from water to launch, and a smaller boat that he uses to explore the coast of the island.\nMore years pass and Crusoe discovers cannibals, who occasionally visit the island to kill and eat prisoners. Alarmed at this, he conserves the ammunition he'd used for hunting (running low at that point) for defence and fortifies his home in case the cannibals discover his presence on the island. He plans to kill them for committing an abomination, but later realizes he has no right to do so, as the cannibals do not knowingly commit a crime. One day, Crusoe finds that a Spanish galleon has run aground on the island during a storm, but his hopes for rescue are dashed when he discovers that the crew abandoned the ship. Nevertheless, the abandoned galleon's untouched supplies of food and ammunition, along with the ship's dog, add to Crusoe's reserves. Every night, he dreams of obtaining one or two servants by freeing some prisoners; during the cannibals' next visit to the island, when a prisoner escapes, Crusoe helps him, naming his new companion \"Friday\" after the day of the week he appeared. Crusoe teaches Friday the English language and converts him to Christianity.\nCrusoe soon learns from Friday that the crew from the shipwrecked galleon he'd found had escaped to the mainland and are now living with Friday's tribe. Seeing renewed hope for rescue and with Friday's help, Crusoe builds another, but smaller, dugout canoe for a renewed plan to sail to the mainland. After more cannibals arrive to partake in a feast, Crusoe and Friday kill most of them and save two prisoners. One is Friday's father and the other is a Spaniard, who informs Crusoe about the other Spaniards shipwrecked on the mainland. A plan is devised wherein the Spaniard would return to the mainland with Friday's father and bring back the others, build a ship, and sail to a Spanish port.\nBefore the Spaniards return, an English ship appears; the sailors have staged a mutiny against their captain and intend to leave him and those still loyal to him on the island. Crusoe and the ship's captain strike a deal in which Crusoe helps the captain and the loyal sailors retake the ship. With their ringleader executed by the captain, the mutineers take up Crusoe's offer to remain on the island rather than being returned to England as prisoners to be hanged. Before embarking for England, Crusoe shows the mutineers how he survived on the island and states that the Spaniards will be coming.\nCrusoe leaves the island on 19\u00a0December 1686 and arrives in England on 11\u00a0June 1687. He learns that his family believed him dead; as a result, he was left nothing in his father's will. Crusoe departs for Lisbon to reclaim the profits of his estate in Brazil, which has granted him much wealth. In conclusion, he transports his wealth overland to England from Portugal to avoid travelling by sea. Friday accompanies him and, \"en route\", they endure one last adventure together as they fight off famished wolves while crossing the Pyrenees.\nSources and real-life castaways.\nThere were many stories of real-life castaways in Defoe's time. Most famously, Defoe's suspected inspiration for \"Robinson Crusoe\" is thought to be Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who spent four years on the uninhabited island of M\u00e1s a Tierra (renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966) in the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands off the Chilean coast. Selkirk was rescued in 1709 by Woodes Rogers during a British expedition that led to the publication of Selkirk's adventures in both \"A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World\" and \"A Cruising Voyage Around the World\" in 1712. According to Tim Severin, \"Daniel Defoe, a secretive man, neither confirmed nor denied that Selkirk was the model for the hero of his book. Apparently written in six months or less, \"Robinson Crusoe\" was a publishing phenomenon.\"\nAccording to Andrew Lambert, author of \"Crusoe's Island\", it is a \"false premise\" to suppose that Defoe's novel was inspired by the experiences of a single person such as Selkirk, because the story is \"a complex compound of all the other buccaneer survival stories.\" However, \"Robinson Crusoe\" is far from a copy of Rogers' account: Becky Little argues three events that distinguish the two stories:\n\"The economic and dynamic thrust of the book is completely alien to what the buccaneers are doing,\" Lambert says. \"The buccaneers just want to capture some loot and come home and drink it all, and Crusoe isn't doing that at all. He's an economic imperialist: He's creating a world of trade and profit.\"\nOther possible sources for the narrative include Ibn Tufail's \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\", and Spanish sixteenth-century sailor Pedro Serrano. Ibn\u00a0Tufail's \"Hayy ibn\u00a0Yaqdhan\" is a twelfth-century philosophical novel also set on a desert island, and translated from Arabic into Latin and English a number of times in the half-century preceding Defoe's novel.\nPedro Luis Serrano was a Spanish sailor who was marooned for seven or eight years on a small desert island after shipwrecking in the 1520s on a small island in the Caribbean off the coast of Nicaragua. He had no access to fresh water and lived off the blood and flesh of sea turtles and birds. He was quite a celebrity when he returned to Europe; before dying, he recorded the hardships suffered in documents that show the endless anguish and suffering, the product of absolute abandonment to his fate, now held in the General Archive of the Indies, in Seville. It is quite possible that Defoe heard his story in one of his visits to Spain before becoming a writer.\nYet another source for Defoe's novel may have been the Robert Knox account of his abduction by the King of Ceylon Rajasinha II of Kandy in 1659 in \"An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon\".\nSeverin (2002) unravels a much wider range of potential sources of inspiration, and concludes by identifying castaway surgeon Henry Pitman as the most likely:\nAn employee of the Duke of Monmouth, Pitman played a part in the Monmouth Rebellion. His short book about his desperate escape from a Caribbean penal colony, followed by his shipwrecking and subsequent desert island misadventures, was published by John Taylor of Paternoster Row, London, whose son William Taylor later published Defoe's novel.\nSeverin argues that since Pitman appears to have lived in the lodgings above the father's publishing house and that Defoe himself was a mercer in the area at the time, Defoe may have met Pitman in person and learned of his experiences first-hand, or possibly through submission of a draft. Severin also discusses another publicized case of a marooned man named only as Will, of the Miskito people of Central America, who may have led to the depiction of Friday.\nSecord (1963) analyses the composition of \"Robinson Crusoe\" and gives a list of possible sources of the story, rejecting the common theory that the story of Selkirk is Defoe's only source.\nReception and sequels.\nThe book was published on 25\u00a0April 1719. Before the end of the year, this first volume had run through four editions.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, no book in the history of Western literature had more editions, spin-offs, and translations (even into languages such as Inuktitut, Coptic, and Maltese) than \"Robinson Crusoe\", with more than 700\u00a0such alternative versions, including children's versions with pictures and no text.\nThe term \"Robinsonade\" was coined to describe the genre of stories similar to \"Robinson Crusoe\".\nDefoe went on to write a lesser-known sequel, \"The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" (1719). It was intended to be the last part of his stories, according to the original title page of the sequel's first edition, but a third book was published (1720), \"Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick World\".\nInterpretations of the novel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"He is the true prototype of the British colonist.\u00a0... The whole Anglo-Saxon spirit in Crusoe: the manly independence, the unconscious cruelty, the persistence, the slow yet efficient intelligence, the sexual apathy, the calculating taciturnity.\"\nIrish novelist James Joyce\nThe novel has been subject to numerous analyses and interpretations since its publication. In a sense, Crusoe attempts to replicate his society on the island. This is achieved through the use of European technology, agriculture and even a rudimentary political hierarchy. Several times in the novel Crusoe refers to himself as the \"king\" of the island, while the captain describes him as the \"governor\" to the mutineers. At the very end of the novel the island is referred to as a \"colony\". The idealized master-servant relationship Defoe depicts between Crusoe and Friday can also be seen in terms of cultural assimilation, with Crusoe representing the \"enlightened\" European while Friday is the \"savage\" who can only be redeemed from his cultural manners through assimilation into Crusoe's culture. Nonetheless, Defoe used Friday to criticize the Spanish colonization of the Americas.\nAccording to J.P. Hunter, Robinson is not a hero but an everyman. He begins as a wanderer, aimless on a sea he does not understand, and ends as a pilgrim, crossing a final mountain to enter the promised land. The book tells the story of how Robinson becomes closer to God, not through listening to sermons in a church but through spending time alone amongst nature with only a Bible to read.\nConversely, cultural critic and literary scholar Michael Gurnow views the novel from a Rousseauian perspective: The central character's movement from a primitive state to a more civilized one is interpreted as Crusoe's denial of humanity's state of nature.\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" is filled with religious aspects. Defoe was a Puritan moralist and normally worked in the guide tradition, writing books on how to be a good Puritan Christian, such as \"The New Family Instructor\" (1727) and \"Religious Courtship\" (1722). While \"Robinson Crusoe\" is far more than a guide, it shares many of the themes and theological and moral points of view.\n\"Crusoe\" may have been taken from Timothy Cruso, a classmate of Defoe's who had written guide books, including \"God the Guide of Youth\" (1695), before dying at an early age \u2013 just eight years before Defoe wrote \"Robinson Crusoe\". Cruso would have been remembered by contemporaries and the association with guide books is clear. It has even been speculated that \"God the Guide of Youth\" inspired \"Robinson Crusoe\" because of a number of passages in that work that are closely tied to the novel. A leitmotif of the novel is the Christian notion of providence, penitence, and redemption. Crusoe comes to repent of the follies of his youth. Defoe also foregrounds this theme by arranging highly significant events in the novel to occur on Crusoe's birthday. The denouement culminates not only in Crusoe's deliverance from the island, but his spiritual deliverance, his acceptance of Christian doctrine, and in his intuition of his own salvation.\nWhen confronted with the cannibals, Crusoe wrestles with the problem of cultural relativism. Despite his disgust, he feels unjustified in holding the natives morally responsible for a practice so deeply ingrained in their culture. Nevertheless, he retains his belief in an absolute standard of morality; he regards cannibalism as a \"national crime\" and forbids Friday from practising it.\nEconomics and civilization.\nIn classical, neoclassical and Austrian economics, Crusoe is regularly used to illustrate the theory of production and choice in the absence of trade, money, and prices. Crusoe must allocate effort between production and leisure and must choose between alternative production possibilities to meet his needs. The arrival of Friday is then used to illustrate the possibility of trade and the gains that result.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand.\nDefoe's \"Robinson Crusoe\", 1719\nThe work has been variously read as an allegory for the development of civilization; as a manifesto of economic individualism; and as an expression of European colonial desires. Significantly, it also shows the importance of repentance and illustrates the strength of Defoe's religious convictions. Critic M.E. Novak supports the connection between the religious and economic themes within \"Robinson Crusoe\", citing Defoe's religious ideology as the influence for his portrayal of Crusoe's economic ideals, and his support of the individual. Novak cites Ian Watt's extensive research which explores the impact that several Romantic Era novels had against economic individualism, and the reversal of those ideals that takes place within \"Robinson Crusoe\".\nIn Tess Lewis's review, \"The heroes we deserve\", of Ian Watt's article, she furthers Watt's argument with a development on Defoe's intention as an author, \"to use individualism to signify nonconformity in religion and the admirable qualities of self-reliance\".678 This further supports the belief that Defoe used aspects of spiritual autobiography to introduce the benefits of individualism to a not entirely convinced religious community. J. Paul Hunter has written extensively on the subject of \"Robinson Crusoe\" as apparent spiritual autobiography, tracing the influence of Defoe's Puritan ideology through Crusoe's narrative, and his acknowledgement of human imperfection in pursuit of meaningful spiritual engagements \u2013 the cycle of \"repentance [and] deliverance\".\nThis spiritual pattern and its episodic nature, as well as the re-discovery of earlier female novelists, have kept \"Robinson Crusoe\" from being classified as a novel, let alone the first novel written in English \u2013 despite the blurbs on some book covers. Early critics, such as Robert Louis Stevenson, admired it, saying that the footprint scene in \"Crusoe\" was one of the four greatest in English literature and most unforgettable; more prosaically, Wesley Vernon has seen the origins of forensic podiatry in this episode. It has inspired a new genre, the \"Robinsonade\", as works such as Johann David Wyss' \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" (1812) adapt its premise and has provoked modern postcolonial responses, including J. M. Coetzee's \"Foe\" (1986) and Michel Tournier's \"Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique\" (in English, \"Friday, or, The Other Island\") (1967). Two sequels followed: Defoe's \"The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" (1719) and his \"Serious Reflections of Robinson Crusoe\" (1720). Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" (1726) is in part a parody of Defoe's adventure novel.\nLegacy.\nInfluence on language.\nThe book proved to be so popular that the names of the two main protagonists, Crusoe and Friday, have entered the language. During World War II, people who decided to stay and hide in the ruins of the German-occupied city of Warsaw for a period of three winter months, from October to January 1945, when they were rescued by the Red Army, were later called Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw (\"Robinsonowie warszawscy\"). Robinson Crusoe usually referred to his servant as \"my man Friday\", from which the term \"Man Friday\" (or \"Girl Friday\") originated.\nInfluence on literature.\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" marked the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre. Its success led to many imitators; and castaway novels, written by Ambrose Evans, Penelope Aubin, and others, became quite popular in Europe in the 18th and early 19th\u00a0centuries. Most of these have fallen into obscurity, but some became established, including \"The Swiss Family Robinson\", which borrowed Crusoe's first name for its title.\nJonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\", published seven years after \"Robinson Crusoe\", may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability. In \"The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man\", Warren Montag argues that Swift was concerned about refuting the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe's novel seems to suggest. In \"Treasure Island\", author Robert Louis Stevenson parodies Crusoe with the character of Ben Gunn, a friendly castaway who was marooned for many years, has a wild appearance, dresses entirely in goat skin, and constantly talks about providence.\nWidely translated, the novel swiftly became influential beyond Britain. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau's treatise on education, \"Emile, or on Education\", the one book the protagonist is allowed to read before the age of twelve is \"Robinson Crusoe\". Rousseau wants Emile to identify with Crusoe so he can rely upon himself for all of his needs. In Rousseau's view, Emile needs to imitate Crusoe's experience, allowing necessity to determine what is to be learned and accomplished. This is one of the main themes of Rousseau's educational model. Two adaptations of \"Robinson Crusoe\", published in a single volume and translated into Icelandic from Danish, were among the first secular literature ever printed in Iceland.\nIn \"The Tale of Little Pig Robinson\", Beatrix Potter directs the reader to \"Robinson Crusoe\" for a detailed description of the island (the land of the Bong tree) to which her eponymous hero moves. In Wilkie Collins' most popular novel, \"The Moonstone\", one of the chief characters and narrators, Gabriel Betteredge, has faith in all that Robinson Crusoe says and uses the book for a sort of divination. He considers \"The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" the finest book ever written, reads it over and over again, and considers a man but poorly read if he had happened not to read the book.\nFrench novelist Michel Tournier published \"Friday, or, The Other Island\" (French \"Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique\") in 1967. His novel explores themes including civilization versus nature, the psychology of solitude, as well as death and sexuality in a retelling of Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe\" story. Tournier's Robinson chooses to remain on the island, rejecting civilization when offered the chance to escape 28\u00a0years after being shipwrecked. Likewise, in 1963, J. M. G. Le Cl\u00e9zio, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature, published the novel \"Le Proces-Verbal\". The book's epigraph is a quote from \"Robinson Crusoe\", and like Crusoe, the novel's protagonist Adam Pollo suffers long periods of loneliness.\n\"Crusoe in England\", a 183\u00a0line poem by Elizabeth Bishop, imagines Crusoe near the end of his life, recalling his time of exile with a mixture of bemusement and regret.\nJ. M. Coetzee's 1986 novel \"Foe\" recounts the tale of Robinson Crusoe from the perspective of a woman named Susan Barton.\nOther stories that share similar themes to \"Robinson Crusoe\" include William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\" (1954), J. G. Ballard's \"Concrete Island\" (1974), and Andy Weir's \"The Martian\" (2011).\nInverted Crusoeism.\nThe term \"inverted Crusoeism\" was coined by J. G. Ballard. The paradigm of Robinson Crusoe has been a recurring topic in Ballard's work. Whereas the original Robinson Crusoe became a castaway against his own will, Ballard's protagonists often choose to maroon themselves; hence inverted Crusoeism (e.g., Concrete Island). The concept provides a reason as to why people would deliberately maroon themselves on a remote island; in Ballard's work, becoming a castaway is as much a healing and empowering process as an entrapping one, enabling people to discover a more meaningful and vital existence.\nComic strip adaptations.\nThe story was also illustrated and published in comic book form by \"Classics Illustrated\" in 1943 and 1957. The much improved 1957 version was inked / penciled by Sam Citron, who is most well known for his contributions to the earlier issues of \"Superman\". British illustrator Reginald Ben Davis drew a female version of the story titled \"Jill Crusoe, Castaway\" (1950\u20131959).\nBob Mankoff, cartoon editor of \"The New Yorker\" attributes the genre of desert island cartoons, which began appearing in the publication in the 1930s, to the popularity of Robinson Crusoe.\nStage adaptations.\nA pantomime version of \"Robinson Crusoe\" was staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1796, with Joseph Grimaldi as Pierrot in the harlequinade. The piece was produced again in 1798, this time starring Grimaldi as Clown. In 1815, Grimaldi played Friday in another version of \"Robinson Crusoe\".\nJacques Offenbach wrote an op\u00e9ra comique called \"Robinson Cruso\u00e9\", which was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 23\u00a0November 1867. This was based on the British pantomime version rather than the novel itself. The libretto was by Eug\u00e8ne Cormon and Hector-Jonathan Cr\u00e9mieux.\nThere have been a number of other stage adaptations, including those by Isaac Pocock, Jim Helsinger and Steve Shaw and a musical by Victor Prince.\nFilm adaptations.\nThe first film adaptation was produced and directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s in 1902.\nThere is a 1927 silent film titled \"Robinson Crusoe\". The Soviet 3D film \"Robinson Crusoe\" was produced in 1947.\nOne of the first adaptations still available dates from 1932 titled \"Mr. Robinson Crusoe\". This film was produced by Douglas Fairbanks Sr and directed by Eddie Sutherland. Set in Tahiti, the film depicts Steve Drexel, the main character, trying to survive on a desert island for almost a year. This film was not very successful.\nLuis Bu\u00f1uel directed \"Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\" starring Dan O'Herlihy, released in 1954. Luis Bu\u00f1uel filmed an account which at first viewing appeared to be a rather simple straightforward telling of Robinson Crusoe. A big stand out with this film is that Bu\u00f1uel breaks the previous films' traditions of having Friday as a slave and Crusoe as the master. The two manage to become actually friends and they operate essentially as equals.\nIn 1966, Walt Disney later comedicized the novel with \"Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.\", featuring Dick Van Dyke. In this version, Friday became a beautiful woman, but named 'Wednesday' instead.\nVariations on the theme include the 1954 \"Miss Robin Crusoe\", with a female castaway, played by Amanda Blake, and a female Friday, and in 1965 we get the film adaptation \"Robinson Crusoe on Mars\", starring Paul Mantee, with an alien Friday portrayed by Victor Lundin and an added character played by Adam West. Byron Haskins manages to underscore Crusoe's removal and field of the red planet that we call mars. Our main character meets a Friday-esque character but makes no effort to try and understand his language. Like the book, in this film, Friday is trying to escape from cruel masters. This movie has lots of appeal to fans of adventures stories and the film has a distinctive visual style that adds to its character.\nIn 1968, American writer/director Ralph C. Bluemke made a family-friendly version of the story titled \"Robby\", in which the main characters were portrayed as children. It starred Warren Raum as Robby (Robinson Crusoe) and Ryp Siani as Friday (who were the director's first choices for the roles). Bluemke originally conceived the idea while working at a bank in 1960. Given the nature and location of the script, Bluemke knew from the beginning that the film would require a certain amount of nudity in order to give it a sense of realism and authenticity. At the time, he was under the impression that the nudity depicted in the film would be condoned as natural and innocent, given the backdrop of the story, and given that the actors involved were prepubescent boys. The film failed to secure a wide distribution deal, in part because prospective distributors were wary about the extensive nudity featured in the film. Undaunted, the producers raised enough capital to release the film themselves, acting as their own distributor. It had limited screenings on Broadway in New York City on August 14, 1968.\nPeter O'Toole and Richard Roundtree co-starred in a 1975 film \"Man Friday\" which sardonically portrayed Crusoe as incapable of seeing his dark-skinned companion as anything but an inferior creature, while Friday is more enlightened and sympathetic. In 1988, Aidan Quinn portrayed Robinson Crusoe in the film \"Crusoe\". A 1997 movie entitled \"Robinson Crusoe\" starred Pierce Brosnan and received limited commercial success. The 2000 film \"Cast Away\", with Tom Hanks as a FedEx employee stranded on an island for many years, also borrows much from the Robinson Crusoe story.\nIn 1981, Czechoslovakian director and animator Stanislav L\u00e1tal made a version of the story under the name \"Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, a Sailor from York\" combining traditional and stop-motion animation. The movie was coproduced by regional West Germany broadcaster S\u00fcdwestfunk Baden-Baden.\nAnimated adaptations.\nIn 1988, an animated cartoon for children called \"Classic Adventure Stories Robinson Crusoe\" was released. Crusoe's early sea travels are simplified, as his ship outruns the Sal\u00e9 Rovers pirates but then gets wrecked in a storm.\nAnd then in 1995 the BBC first aired the series \"Robinson Sucroe\" until 1998, with The Children's Channel and Pop repeating it.\nRadio adaptations.\n\"Daniel Defoe \u2013 Robinson Crusoe\" was adapted as a two-part play for BBC radio. Dramatised by Steve Chambers and directed by Marion Nancarrow, and starring Roy Marsden and Tom Bevan, it was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in May 1998. It was subsequently rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in February 2023.\nTV adaptations.\nIn 1964, a French film production crew made a 13-part serial of \"The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe\". It starred Robert Hoffmann. The black-and-white series was dubbed into English and German. In the UK, the BBC broadcast it on numerous occasions between 1965 and 1977.\nThe 2008\u20132009 \"Crusoe\" TV series was a 13-part show created by Stephen Gallagher.\nTwo 2000s reality television series, \"Expedition Robinson\" and \"Survivor\", have their contestants try to survive on an isolated location, usually an island. The concept is influenced by \"Robinson Crusoe\".\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "55490", "revid": "3096737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55490", "title": "Roald Dahl", "text": "British writer and poet (1916\u20131990)\nRoald Dahl (13 September 1916\u00a0\u2013 23 November 1990) was a British author of popular children's literature and short stories, a poet, screenwriter and a wartime fighter ace. His books have sold more than 300\u00a0million copies worldwide. He has been called \"one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century\".\nDahl was born in Wales to affluent Norwegian immigrant parents, and lived for most of his life in England. He served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He became a fighter pilot and subsequently an intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting wing commander. He rose to prominence as a writer in the 1940s with works for children and for adults, and he became one of the world's best-selling authors. His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008, \"The Times\" placed Dahl 16th on its list of \"The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945\". In 2021, \"Forbes\" ranked him the top-earning dead celebrity.\nDahl's short stories are known for their unexpected endings, and his children's books for their unsentimental, macabre, often darkly comic mood, featuring villainous adult enemies of the child characters. His children's books champion the kindhearted and feature an underlying warm sentiment. His works for children include \"James and the Giant Peach\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"Matilda\", \"The Witches\", \"Fantastic Mr Fox\", \"The BFG\", \"The Twits\", \"George's Marvellous Medicine\" and \"Danny, the Champion of the World\". His works for older audiences include the short story collections \"Tales of the Unexpected\" and \"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More\".\nEarly life and education.\nChildhood.\nRoald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegians Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (\"n\u00e9e\" Hesselberg). Dahl's father, a wealthy shipbroker and self-made man, had emigrated to Britain from Sarpsborg, Norway, and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s with his first wife, Frenchwoman Marie Beaurin-Gresser. They had two children together (Ellen Marguerite and Louis) before her death in 1907. Roald's mother belonged to a well-established Norwegian family of lawyers, wealthy merchants, estate owners and priests in the Norwegian state church, and emigrated to Britain when she married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild, and Else. The children were raised in Norway's Lutheran state church, the Church of Norway, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff. His maternal grandmother Ellen Wallace was a granddaughter of the member of parliament Georg Wallace and a descendant of an early 18th-century Scottish immigrant to Norway.\nDahl's sister Astri died from appendicitis, aged seven, in 1920 when Dahl was three years old, and his father died of pneumonia at the age of 57 several weeks later. Later in the same year, his youngest sister, Asta, was born. Upon his death, Harald Dahl left a fortune assessed for probate at \u00a3158,917,10s. 0d. (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023). Dahl's mother decided to remain in Wales instead of returning to Norway to live with relatives, as her husband had wanted their children to be educated in English schools, which he considered the world's best. When he was six years old, Dahl met his idol Beatrix Potter, author of \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\" featuring the mischievous Peter Rabbit, the first licensed fictional character. The meeting, which took place at Potter's home, Hill Top in the Lake District, north west England, was dramatised in the 2020 television film, \"\".\nDahl first attended The Cathedral School, Llandaff. At the age of eight, he and four of his friends were caned by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of gobstoppers at the local sweet shop, 11 High Street, which was owned by a \"mean and loathsome\" old woman named Mrs Pratchett. The five boys named their prank the \"Great Mouse Plot of 1924\". Mrs Pratchett inspired Dahl's creation of the cruel headmistress Miss Trunchbull in \"Matilda\", and a prank, this time in a water jug belonging to Trunchbull, would also appear in the book. Gobstoppers were a favourite sweet among British schoolboys between the two World Wars, and Dahl referred to them in his fictional Everlasting Gobstopper which was featured in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\".\nDahl transferred to St Peter's boarding school in Weston-super-Mare. His parents had wanted him to be educated at an English public school, and this proved to be the nearest because of the regular ferry link across the Bristol Channel. Dahl's time at St Peter's was unpleasant; he was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed his unhappiness to her. After her death in 1967, he learned that she had saved every one of his letters; they were broadcast in abridged form as BBC Radio 4's \"Book of the Week\" in 2016 to mark the centenary of his birth. Dahl wrote about his time at St Peter's in his autobiography \"Boy: Tales of Childhood\". Excelling at conkers\u2014a traditional autumnal children's game in Britain and Ireland played using the seeds of horse chestnut trees\u2014Dahl recollected, \"at the ages of eight, nine and ten, conkers brought sunshine to our lives during the dreary autumn term\".\nRepton School.\nFrom 1929, when he was 13, Dahl attended Repton School in Derbyshire. Dahl disliked the hazing and described an environment of ritual cruelty and status domination, with younger boys having to act as personal servants for older boys, frequently subject to terrible beatings. His biographer Donald Sturrock described these violent experiences in Dahl's early life. Dahl expresses some of these darker experiences in his writings, which is also marked by his hatred of cruelty and corporal punishment.\nAccording to Dahl's autobiography, \"Boy: Tales of Childhood\", a friend named Michael was viciously caned by headmaster Geoffrey Fisher. Writing in that same book, Dahl reflected: \"All through my school life I was appalled by the fact that masters and senior boys were allowed literally to wound other boys, and sometimes quite severely... I couldn't get over it. I never have got over it.\" Fisher was later appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, and he crowned Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. However, according to Dahl's biographer Jeremy Treglown, the caning took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton; the headmaster was in fact J. T. Christie, Fisher's successor as headmaster. Dahl said the incident caused him to \"have doubts about religion and even about God\". He viewed the brutality of the caning as being the result of the headmaster's enmity towards children, an attitude Dahl would later attribute to the Grand High Witch in his dark fantasy \"The Witches\", with the novel's main antagonist exclaiming that \"children are rrreee-volting!\".\nDahl was never seen as a particularly talented writer in his school years, with one of his English teachers writing in his school report, \"I have never met anybody who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is intended.\" He was exceptionally tall, reaching in adult life. Dahl played sports including cricket, football and golf, and was made captain of the squash team. As well as having a passion for literature, he developed an interest in photography and often carried a camera with him.\nDuring his years at Repton, the Cadbury chocolate company occasionally sent boxes of new chocolates to the school to be tested by the pupils. Dahl dreamed of inventing a new chocolate bar that would win the praise of Mr Cadbury himself; this inspired him in writing his third children's book, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", and to refer to chocolate in other children's books.\nThroughout his childhood and adolescent years, Dahl spent most of his summer holidays with his mother's family in Norway. He wrote about many happy memories from those visits in \"Boy: Tales of Childhood\", such as when he replaced the tobacco in his half-sister's fianc\u00e9's pipe with goat droppings. He noted only one unhappy memory of his holidays in Norway: at around the age of eight, he had to have his adenoids removed by a doctor. His childhood and first job selling kerosene in Midsomer Norton and surrounding villages in Somerset are subjects in \"Boy: Tales of Childhood\".\nAfter school.\nAfter finishing his schooling, in August 1934 Dahl crossed the Atlantic on the and hiked through Newfoundland with the British Public Schools Exploring Society.\nIn July 1934, Dahl joined the Shell Petroleum Company. Following four years of training in the United Kingdom, he was assigned first to Mombasa, Kenya, then to Dar es Salaam in the British colony of Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania). Dahl explains in his autobiography \"Going Solo\" that only three young Englishmen ran the Shell company in the territory, of which he was the youngest and junior. Along with the only two other Shell employees in the entire territory, he lived in luxury in the Shell House outside Dar es Salaam, with a cook and personal servants. While out on assignments supplying oil to customers across Tanganyika, he encountered black mamba snakes and lions, among other wildlife.\nFighter pilot.\nIn August 1939, as the Second World War loomed, the British made plans to round up the hundreds of Germans living in Dar-es-Salaam. Dahl was commissioned as a lieutenant into the King's African Rifles, commanding a platoon of Askari men, indigenous troops who were serving in the colonial army.\nIn November 1939, Dahl joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as an aircraftman with service number 774022. After a car journey from Dar es Salaam to Nairobi, he was accepted for flight training with sixteen other men, of whom only three survived the war. With seven hours and 40 minutes experience in a De Havilland Tiger Moth, he flew solo; Dahl enjoyed watching the wildlife of Kenya during his flights. He continued to advanced flying training in Iraq, at RAF Habbaniya, west of Baghdad. Following six months' training on Hawker Harts, Dahl was commissioned as a pilot officer on 24 August 1940, and was judged ready to join a squadron and face the enemy.\nHe was assigned to No. 80 Squadron RAF, flying obsolete Gloster Gladiators, the last biplane fighter aircraft used by the RAF. Dahl was surprised to find that he would not receive any specialised training in aerial combat or in flying Gladiators. On 19 September 1940, Dahl and another pilot were ordered to fly their Gladiators by stages from Abu Sueir (near Ismailia, in Egypt) to 80 Squadron's forward airstrip south of Mersa Matruh. On the final leg, they could not find the airstrip and, running low on fuel and with night approaching, Dahl was forced to attempt a landing in the desert. The undercarriage hit a boulder and the aircraft crashed. Dahl's skull was fractured and his nose was smashed; he was temporarily blinded. He managed to drag himself away from the wreckage and lost consciousness. His colleague, Douglas McDonald, had landed safely and was able to comfort Dahl until they were rescued. He wrote about the crash in his first published work. Dahl came to believe that the head injury he sustained in the crash resulted in his creative genius.\nDahl was rescued and taken to a first-aid post in Mersa Matruh, where he regained consciousness, but not his sight. He remained blind for six weeks due to massive swelling of the brain. He was transported by train to the Royal Navy hospital in Alexandria. There he fell in and out of love with a nurse, Mary Welland. An RAF inquiry into the crash revealed that the location to which he had been told to fly was completely wrong, and he had mistakenly been sent instead into the no man's land between the Allied and Italian forces.\nIn February 1941, Dahl was discharged from the hospital and deemed fully fit for flying duties. By this time, 80 Squadron had been transferred to the Greek campaign and based at Eleusina, near Athens. The squadron was now equipped with Hawker Hurricanes. Dahl flew a replacement Hurricane across the Mediterranean Sea in April 1941, after seven hours' experience flying Hurricanes. By this stage in the Greek campaign, the RAF had only 18 combat aircraft in Greece: 14 Hurricanes and four Bristol Blenheim light bombers. Dahl flew in his first aerial combat on 15 April 1941, while flying alone over the city of Chalcis. He attacked six Junkers Ju 88s that were bombing ships and shot one down. The next day, he shot down another Ju 88.\nOn 20 April 1941, Dahl took part in an event he called the Battle of Athens, alongside the highest-scoring British Commonwealth ace of World War II, Pat Pattle, and Dahl's friend David Coke. Of 12 Hurricanes involved, five were shot down and four of their pilots killed, including Pattle. Greek observers on the ground counted 22 German aircraft downed, but because of the confusion of the aerial engagement, none of the pilots knew which aircraft they had shot down. Dahl described it as \"an endless blur of enemy fighters whizzing towards me from every side\".\nIn May, as the Germans were pressing on Athens, Dahl was evacuated to Egypt. His squadron was reassembled in Haifa to take part in Operation Exporter. From there, Dahl flew sorties every day for a period of four weeks, shooting down a Vichy French Air Force Potez 63 on 8 June and another Ju 88 on 15 June. In a memoir, Dahl recounts in detail an attack by him and his fellow Hurricane pilots on the Vichy-held Rayak airfield. He says that as he and his fellow Hurricane pilots swept in:\n... low over the field at midday we saw to our astonishment a bunch of girls in brightly coloured cotton dresses standing out by the planes with glasses in their hands having drinks with the French pilots, and I remember seeing bottles of wine standing on the wing of one of the planes as we went swooshing over. It was a Sunday morning and the Frenchmen were evidently entertaining their girlfriends and showing off their aircraft to them, which was a very French thing to do in the middle of a war at a front-line aerodrome. Every one of us held our fire on that first pass over the flying field and it was wonderfully comical to see the girls all dropping their wine glasses and galloping in their high heels for the door of the nearest building. We went round again, but this time we were no longer a surprise and they were ready for us with their ground defences, and I am afraid that our chivalry resulted in damage to several of our Hurricanes, including my own. But we destroyed five of their planes on the ground.\nDespite this somewhat light-hearted account, Dahl also noted that, ultimately, Vichy forces killed four of the nine Hurricane pilots in his squadron. Describing the Vichy forces as \"disgusting\", he stated that \"... thousands of lives were lost, and I for one have never forgiven the Vichy French for the unnecessary slaughter they caused.\"\nWhen he began to get severe headaches that caused him to black out, he was invalided home to Britain where he stayed with his mother in Buckinghamshire. Although at this time Dahl was only a pilot officer on probation, in September 1941 he was simultaneously confirmed as a pilot officer and promoted to war substantive flying officer.\nDiplomat, writer and intelligence officer.\nAfter being invalided home, Dahl was posted to an RAF training camp in Uxbridge. He attempted to recover his health enough to become an instructor. In late March 1942, while in London, he met the Under-Secretary of State for Air, Major Harold Balfour, at his club. Impressed by Dahl's war record and conversational abilities, Balfour appointed the young man as assistant air attach\u00e9 at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. Initially resistant, Dahl was finally persuaded by Balfour to accept, and took passage on the from Glasgow a few days later. He arrived in Halifax, Canada, on 14 April, after which he took a sleeper train to Montreal.\nComing from war-starved Britain (in what was a wartime period of rationing in the United Kingdom), Dahl was amazed by the wealth of food and amenities to be had in North America. Arriving in Washington a week later, Dahl found he liked the atmosphere of the US capital. He shared a house with another attach\u00e9 at 1610 34th Street, NW, in Georgetown. But after ten days in his new posting, Dahl strongly disliked it, feeling he had taken on \"a most ungodly unimportant job\". He later explained, \"I'd just come from the war. People were getting killed. I had been flying around, seeing horrible things. Now, almost instantly, I found myself in the middle of a pre-war cocktail party in America.\"\nDahl was unimpressed by his office in the British Air Mission, attached to the embassy. He was also unimpressed by the ambassador, Lord Halifax, with whom he sometimes played tennis and whom he described as \"a courtly English gentleman\". Dahl socialised with Charles E. Marsh, a Texas publisher and oilman, at his house at 2136 R Street, NW, and the Marsh country estate in Virginia. As part of his duties as assistant air attach\u00e9, Dahl was to help neutralise the isolationist views still held by many Americans by giving pro-British speeches and discussing his war service; the United States had entered the war only the previous December, following the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nAt this time Dahl met the noted British novelist C. S. Forester, who was also working to aid the British war effort. Forester worked for the British Ministry of Information and was writing propaganda for the Allied cause, mainly for American consumption. \"The Saturday Evening Post\" had asked Forester to write a story based on Dahl's flying experiences; Forester asked Dahl to write down some RAF anecdotes so that he could shape them into a story. After Forester read what Dahl had given him, he decided to publish the story exactly as Dahl had written it. In reality a number of changes were made to the original manuscript before publication. He originally titled the article as \"A Piece of Cake\" but the magazine changed it to \"Shot Down Over Libya\" to make it sound more dramatic, although Dahl had not been shot down; it was published on 1 August 1942 issue of the \"Post\". Dahl was promoted to flight lieutenant (war-substantive) in August 1942. Later he worked with such other well-known British officers as Ian Fleming (who later published the popular \"James Bond\" series) and David Ogilvy, promoting Britain's interests and message in the US and combating the \"America First\" movement.\nThis work introduced Dahl to espionage and the activities of the Canadian spymaster William Stephenson, known by the codename \"Intrepid.\" During the war, Dahl supplied intelligence from Washington to Prime Minister Winston Churchill. As Dahl later said: \"My job was to try to help Winston to get on with FDR, and tell Winston what was in the old boy's mind.\" Dahl also supplied intelligence to Stephenson and his organisation, known as British Security Coordination, which was part of MI6. Dahl was once sent back to Britain by British Embassy officials, supposedly for misconduct\u2014\"I got booted out by the big boys\", he said. Stephenson promptly sent him back to Washington\u2014with a promotion to wing commander rank. Toward the end of the war, Dahl wrote some of the history of the secret organisation. He and Stephenson remained friends for decades after the war.\nUpon the war's conclusion, Dahl held the rank of a temporary wing commander (substantive flight lieutenant). Owing to the severity of his injuries from the 1940 accident, he was pronounced unfit for further service and was invalided out of the RAF in August 1946. He left the service with the substantive rank of squadron leader. His record of five aerial victories, qualifying him as a flying ace, has been confirmed by post-war research and cross-referenced in Axis records. It is possible that he shot down more aircraft, for example on 20 April 1941 when the Germans lost several aircraft.\nPost-war life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDahl married American actress Patricia Neal on 2 July 1953 at Trinity Church in New York City. Their marriage lasted for 30 years and they had five children:\nOn 5 December 1960, four-month-old Theo was severely injured when his baby carriage was struck by a taxicab in New York City. For a time, he suffered from hydrocephalus. As a result, Dahl became involved in the development of what became known as the \"Wade-Dahl-Till\" (or WDT) valve, a device to improve the shunt used to alleviate the condition. The valve was a collaboration between Dahl, hydraulic engineer Stanley Wade, and London's Great Ormond Street Hospital neurosurgeon Kenneth Till, and was used successfully on almost 3,000 children around the world.\nIn November 1962, Dahl's daughter Olivia died of measles encephalitis, age seven. Her death left Dahl \"limp with despair\", and feeling guilty about not having been able to do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation\u2014writing \"\" in 1988 in response to measles cases in the UK\u2014and dedicated his 1982 book \"The BFG\" to his daughter. After Olivia's death and a meeting with a Church official, Dahl came to view Christianity as a sham. In mourning he had sought spiritual guidance from Geoffrey Fisher, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, and was dismayed being told that, although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there. Dahl recalled years later:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I wanted to ask him how he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us. I sat there wondering if this great and famous churchman really knew what he was talking about and whether he knew anything at all about God or heaven, and if he didn't, then who in the world did?\nIn 1965, Dahl's wife Patricia Neal suffered three burst cerebral aneurysms while pregnant with their fifth child, Lucy. Dahl took control of her rehabilitation over the next months; Neal had to re-learn to talk and walk, but she managed to return to her acting career. This period of their lives was dramatised in the film \"The Patricia Neal Story\" (1981), in which the couple were played by Glenda Jackson and Dirk Bogarde.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1972, Roald Dahl met Felicity d'Abreu Crosland, niece of Lt.-Col. Francis D'Abreu who was married to Margaret Bowes Lyon, the first cousin of the Queen Mother, while Felicity was working as a set designer on an advert for Maxim coffee with the author's then wife, Patricia Neal. Soon after the pair were introduced, they began an 11-year affair. In 1983 Neal and Dahl divorced and Dahl married Felicity, at Brixton Town Hall, south London. Felicity (known as Liccy) gave up her job and moved into Gipsy House, Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire, which had been Dahl's home since 1954.\nIn August 1983, Dahl reviewed Australian author Tony Clifton's \"God Cried\", a picture book about the siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. The article, in which Dahl stated the Jews had never \"switched so rapidly from much-pitied victims to barbarous murderers\", appeared in the \"Literary Review\" and was the subject of media comment and criticism at the time. Dahl wrote that Clifton's book would make readers \"violently anti-Israeli\", saying, \"I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Israel.\" In 1990, Dahl spoke again on the Lebanon invasion, stating \"they killed 22,000 civilians when they bombed Beirut. It was very much hushed up in the newspapers because they are primarily Jewish-owned. I'm certainly anti-Israeli and I've become antisemitic in as much as that you get a Jewish person in another country like England strongly supporting Zionism. I think they should see both sides. It's the same old thing: we all know about Jews and the rest of it. There aren't any non-Jewish publishers anywhere, they control the media\u2014jolly clever thing to do\". His comments invoked responses from Jewish colleagues and friends, with the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, stating, \"I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak\", while Amelia Foster, Jewish director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, said, \"He had a childish reaction to what was going on in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner.\" As a consequence of his comments, in 2014, the Royal Mint decided not to produce a coin to commemorate the centenary of Dahl's birth. In 2020, Dahl's family published a statement on the official Roald Dahl website apologising for his antisemitism.\nIn the 1986 New Years Honours List, Dahl was offered an appointment to Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), but turned it down. He reportedly wanted a knighthood so that his wife would be Lady Dahl. Dahl's last significant involvement in medical charities during his lifetime was with dyslexia. In 1990, the year which saw the UN launch International Literacy Year, Dahl assisted with the British Dyslexia Association's Awareness Campaign. That year saw Dahl write one of his last children's books, \"The Vicar of Nibbleswicke\", which features a vicar who has a fictitious form of dyslexia that causes him to pronounce words backwards. Called \"a comic tale in the best Dahl tradition of craziness\" by Waterstones, Dahl donated the rights of the book to the Dyslexia Institute in London.\nIn 2012, Dahl was featured in the list of \"The New Elizabethans\" to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named Dahl among the group of people in Britain \"whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character\". In September 2016, Dahl's daughter Lucy received the BBC's \"Blue Peter\" Gold badge in his honour, the first time it had ever been awarded posthumously.\nWriting.\nDahl's first published work, inspired by a meeting with C. S. Forester, was \"A Piece of Cake\", on 1 August 1942. The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by \"The Saturday Evening Post\" for US$1,000 () and published under the title \"Shot Down Over Libya\".\nHis first children's book was \"The Gremlins\", published in 1943, about mischievous little creatures that were part of Royal Air Force folklore. The RAF pilots blamed the gremlins for all the problems with the aircraft. The protagonist Gus\u2014an RAF pilot, like Dahl\u2014joins forces with the gremlins against a common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis. While at the British Embassy in Washington, Dahl sent a copy to the First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt who read it to her grandchildren, and the book was commissioned by Walt Disney for a film that was never made. Dahl went on to write some of the best-loved children's stories of the 20th century, such as \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"Matilda\", \"James and the Giant Peach\", \"The Witches\", \"Fantastic Mr Fox\", \"The BFG\", \"The Twits\" and \"George's Marvellous Medicine\".\nDahl also had a successful parallel career as the writer of macabre adult short stories, which often blended humour and innocence with surprising plot twists. The Mystery Writers of America presented Dahl with three Edgar Awards for his work, and many were originally written for American magazines such as \"Collier's\" (\"The Collector's Item\" was \"Collier's\" Star Story of the week for 4 September 1948), \"Ladies' Home Journal\", \"Harper's\", \"Playboy\" and \"The New Yorker\". Works such as \"Kiss Kiss\" subsequently collected Dahl's stories into anthologies, and gained significant popularity. Dahl wrote more than 60 short stories; they have appeared in numerous collections, some only being published in book form after his death. His three Edgar Awards were given for: in 1954, the collection \"Someone Like You\"; in 1959, the story \"The Landlady\"; and in 1980, the episode of \"Tales of the Unexpected\" based on \"Skin\".\nOne of his more famous adult stories, \"The Smoker\", also known as \"Man from the South\", was filmed twice as both 1960 and 1985 episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", filmed as a 1979 episode of \"Tales of the Unexpected\", and also adapted into Quentin Tarantino's segment of the film \"Four Rooms\" (1995). This oft-anthologised classic concerns a man in Jamaica who wagers with visitors in an attempt to claim the fingers from their hands. The original 1960 version in the Hitchcock series stars Steve McQueen and Peter Lorre. Five additional Dahl stories were used in the Hitchcock series. Dahl was credited with teleplay for two episodes, and four of his episodes were directed by Alfred Hitchcock himself, an example of which was \"Lamb to the Slaughter\" (1958).\nDahl acquired a traditional Romanichal vardo in the 1960s, and the family used it as a playhouse for his children at home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. He later used the vardo as a writing room, where he wrote \"Danny, the Champion of the World\" in 1975. Dahl incorporated a similar caravan into the main plot of the book, in which the young English boy, Danny, and his father, William (played by Jeremy Irons in the film adaptation), live in a vardo. Many other scenes and characters from Great Missenden are reflected in his work. For example, the village library was the inspiration for Mrs Phelps' library in \"Matilda\", where the title character devours classic literature by the age of four.\nHis short story collection \"Tales of the Unexpected\" was adapted to a successful TV series of the same name, beginning with \"Man from the South\". When the stock of Dahl's own original stories was exhausted, the series continued by adapting stories written in Dahl's style by other authors, including John Collier and Stanley Ellin. Another collection of short stories, \"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More\", was published in 1977, and the eponymous short story was adapted into a short film in 2023 by director Wes Anderson with Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character Henry Sugar and Ralph Fiennes as Dahl.\nSome of Dahl's short stories are supposed to be extracts from the diary of his (fictional) Uncle Oswald, a rich gentleman whose sexual exploits form the subject of these stories. In his novel \"My Uncle Oswald\", the uncle engages a temptress to seduce 20th century geniuses and royalty with a love potion secretly added to chocolate truffles made by Dahl's favourite chocolate shop, Prestat of Piccadilly, London. \"Memories with Food at Gipsy House\", written with his wife Felicity and published posthumously in 1991, was a mixture of recipes, family reminiscences and Dahl's musings on favourite subjects such as chocolate, onions and claret.\nThe last book published in his lifetime, \"Esio Trot\", released in January 1990, marked a change in style for the author. Unlike other Dahl works (which often feature tyrannical adults and heroic/magical children), it is the story of an old, lonely man trying to make a connection with a woman he has loved from afar. In 1994, the English language audiobook recording of the book was provided by Monty Python member Michael Palin. Screenwriter Richard Curtis adapted it into a 2015 BBC television comedy film, \"Roald Dahl's Esio Trot\", featuring Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench as the couple.\nWritten in 1990 and published posthumously in 1991, \"Roald Dahl's Guide to Railway Safety\" was one of the last things he ever wrote. In a response to rising levels of train-related fatalities involving children, the British Railways Board had asked Dahl to write the text of the booklet, and Quentin Blake to illustrate it, to help young people enjoy using the railways safely. The booklet is structured as a conversation with children, and it was distributed to primary school pupils in Britain. According to children's literature critic Deborah Cogan Thacker, Dahl's tendency in his children's books is to \"put child characters in powerful positions\" and so, the idea of \"talking down\" to children was always an anathema to him, therefore Dahl, in the introduction of the booklet, states; \"I must now regretfully become one of those unpopular giants who tells you WHAT TO DO and WHAT NOT TO DO. This is something I have never done in any of my books.\"\nChildren's fiction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"He [Dahl] was mischievous. A grown-up being mischievous. He addresses you, a child, as somebody who knows about the world. He was a grown-up\u2014and he was bigger than most\u2014who is on your side. That must have something to do with it.\"\n \u2014Illustrator Quentin Blake on the lasting appeal of Dahl's children's books.\nDahl's children's works are usually told from the point of view of a child. They typically involve adult villains who hate and mistreat children, and feature at least one \"good\" adult to counteract the villain(s). These stock characters are possibly a reference to the abuse that Dahl stated that he experienced in the boarding schools he attended. In a biography of Dahl, Matthew Dennison wrote that \"his writing frequently included protests against unfairness\". Dahl's books see the triumph of the child; children's book critic Amanda Craig said, \"He was unequivocal that it is the good, young and kind who triumph over the old, greedy and the wicked.\" Anna Leskiewicz in \"The Telegraph\" wrote, \"It's often suggested that Dahl's lasting appeal is a result of his exceptional talent for wriggling his way into children's fantasies and fears, and laying them out on the page with anarchic delight. Adult villains are drawn in terrifying detail, before they are exposed as liars and hypocrites, and brought tumbling down with retributive justice, either by a sudden magic or the superior acuity of the children they mistreat.\"\nWhile his whimsical fantasy stories feature an underlying warm sentiment, they are often juxtaposed with grotesque, darkly comic and sometimes harshly violent scenarios. \"The Witches\", \"George's Marvellous Medicine\" and \"Matilda\" are examples of this formula. \"The BFG\" follows, with the good giant (the BFG or \"Big Friendly Giant\") representing the \"good adult\" archetype and the other giants being the \"bad adults\". This formula is also somewhat evident in Dahl's film script for \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\". Class-conscious themes also surface in works such as \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" and \"Danny, the Champion of the World\" where the unpleasant wealthy neighbours are outwitted.\nDahl also features characters who are very fat, usually children. Augustus Gloop, Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins are a few of these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge features in \"James and the Giant Peach\" and the nasty farmer Boggis in \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from Willy Wonka's chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In \"Matilda\", Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school; when he unexpectedly succeeds at this, Trunchbull smashes the empty plate over his head. In \"The Witches\", Bruno Jenkins is lured by the witches (whose leader is the Grand High Witch) into their convention with the promise of chocolate, before they turn him into a mouse. Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. When Dahl was a boy his mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures, and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in \"The BFG\", the fox family in \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" and the trolls in \"The Minpins\".\nIn 1972, Eleanor Cameron, also a children's book author, published an article in \"The Horn Book\" criticising \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and its depiction of the African-derived Oompa-Loompas, who \"have never been given the opportunity of any life outside of the chocolate factory\". In 1973, Dahl posted a reply, calling Cameron's accusations \"insensitive\" and \"monstrous\". The debate between the two authors sparked much discussion and a number of letters to the editor. In 1991, Michael Dirda also discussed other criticisms of Dahl's writing, including his alleged sexism, of which Dirda wrote, \"\"The Witches\" verges on a general misogyny.\" In 1998, Michele Landsberg analysed the alleged issues in Dahl's work and concluded that, \"Throughout his work, evil, domineering, smelly, fat, ugly women are his favourite villains.\" In 2008, Una Mullally argued that there are feminist messages in Dahl's work, even if they may be obscured, \"\"The Witches\" offers up plenty of feminist complexities. The witches themselves are terrifying and vile things, and always women... The book is often viewed as sexist, but that assessment ignores one of the heroines of the story, the child narrator's grandmother.\"\nReceiving the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, Dahl encouraged his children and his readers to let their imagination run free. His daughter Lucy stated \"his spirit was so large and so big he taught us to believe in magic.\" She said her father later told her that if they had simply said goodnight after a bedtime story, he assumed it wasn't a good idea. But if they begged him to continue, he knew he was on to something, and the story would sometimes turn into a book.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.\u2014\u200a\nDahl was also famous for his inventive, playful use of language, which was a key element to his writing. He invented over 500 new words by scribbling down his words before swapping letters around and adopting spoonerisms and malapropisms. The lexicographer Susan Rennie stated that Dahl built his new words on familiar sounds, adding:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He didn't always explain what his words meant, but children can work them out because they often sound like a word they know, and he loved using onomatopoeia. For example, you know that something \"lickswishy\" and \"delumptious\" is good to eat, whereas something \"uckyslush\" or \"rotsome\" is definitely not! He also used sounds that children love to say, like \"squishous\" and \"squizzle\", or \"fizzlecrump\" and \"fizzwiggler\".\nAs marketing director of Penguin Books in the 1980s, Barry Cunningham travelled the UK with Dahl on a promotional book tour, during which he asked Dahl what was the secret of his success; Dahl responded by saying that \"the thing you've got to remember, is that humour is delayed fear, laughter is delayed fear.\" Cunningham later recollected, \"if you look at the way he uses humour and the way that children use humour, perhaps sometimes it's the only weapon they have against terrifying circumstances or people. That's very indicative of his stories and the style of those stories.\"\nA UK television special titled \"Roald Dahl's Revolting Rule Book\", which was hosted by Richard E. Grant and aired on ITV on 22 September 2007, commemorated Dahl's 90th birthday and also celebrated his impact as a children's author in popular culture. It also featured eight main rules he applied on all his children's books:\nIn 2016, marking the centenary of Dahl's birth, Rennie compiled \"The Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary\" which includes many of his invented words and their meaning. Rennie commented that some of Dahl's words have already escaped his world, for example, \"Scrumdiddlyumptious\": \"Food that is utterly delicious\". In his poetry, Dahl gives a humorous re-interpretation of well-known nursery rhymes and fairy tales, parodying the narratives and providing surprise endings in place of the traditional happily-ever-after. Dahl's collection of poems, \"Revolting Rhymes\", is recorded in audiobook form, and narrated by actor Alan Cumming.\nIn 2023, Puffin Books, which holds the rights to all Dahl's children's books, published editions which included hundreds of revisions to the text at the advice of sensitivity readers. Changes included the use of gender-neutral words and phrases such as \"parents\" or \"siblings\" rather than \"boys and girls\", \"mothers and fathers\", the word \"fat\" being replaced with terms such as \"enormous\" or \"large\", and words like \"crazy\" and \"mad\" were regularly removed. The move was supported by a number of authors, including Society of Authors chair Joanne Harris and Diego Jourdan Pereira at \"Writer's Digest\", but it drew many more critical responses. Several public figures, including then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and author Salman Rushdie, spoke out against the changes. It was reported that when Dahl was alive, he had spoken out very strongly against any changes ever being made to any of his books. On 23 February 2023, Puffin announced it would release an unedited selection of Dahl's children's books as 'The Roald Dahl Classic Collection', stating, \"We've listened to the debate over the past week which has reaffirmed the extraordinary power of Roald Dahl's books\" and \"recognise the importance of keeping Dahl's classic texts in print\".\nScreenplays.\nFor a brief period in the 1960s, Dahl wrote screenplays. Two, the James Bond film \"You Only Live Twice\" and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\", were adaptations of novels by Ian Fleming. Dahl also began adapting his own novel \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", which was completed and rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\" (1971). Dahl later disowned the film, saying he was \"disappointed\" because \"he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie\". He was also \"infuriated\" by the deviations in the plot devised by David Seltzer in his draft of the screenplay. This resulted in his refusal for any more versions of the book to be made in his lifetime.\nHe wrote the script for a film that began filming but was abandoned, \"Death, Where is Thy Sting-a-ling-ling?\".\nInfluences.\nA major part of Dahl's literary influences stemmed from his childhood. In his younger days, he was an avid reader, especially awed by fantastic tales of heroism and triumph. He met his idol, Beatrix Potter, when he was six years old. His other favourite authors included Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray and former Royal Navy officer Frederick Marryat, and their works made a lasting mark on his life and writing. He named Marryat's \"Mr Midshipman Easy\" as his favourite novel. Joe Sommerlad in \"The Independent\" writes, \"Dahl's novels are often dark affairs, filled with cruelty, bereavement and Dickensian adults prone to gluttony and sadism. The author clearly felt compelled to warn his young readers about the evils of the world, taking the lesson from earlier fairy tales that they could stand hard truths and would be the stronger for hearing them.\"\nDahl was also influenced by Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". The \"Drink Me\" episode in \"Alice\" inspired a scene in Dahl's \"George's Marvellous Medicine\" where a tyrannical grandmother drinks a potion and is blown up to the size of a farmhouse. Finding too many distractions in his house, Dahl remembered the poet Dylan Thomas had found a peaceful shed to write in close to home. Dahl travelled to visit Thomas's hut in Carmarthenshire, Wales in the 1950s and, after taking a look inside, decided to make a replica of it to write in. Appearing on BBC Radio 4's \"Desert Island Discs\" in October 1979, Dahl named Thomas \"the greatest poet of our time\", and as one of his eight chosen records selected Thomas's reading of his poem \"Fern Hill\".\nDahl liked ghost stories, and claimed that \"Trolls\" by Jonas Lie was one of the finest ghost stories ever written. While he was still a youngster, his mother, Sofie Dahl, related traditional Norwegian myths and legends from her native homeland to Dahl and his sisters. Dahl always maintained that his mother and her stories had a strong influence on his writing. In one interview, he mentioned: \"She was a great teller of tales. Her memory was prodigious and nothing that ever happened to her in her life was forgotten.\" When Dahl started writing and publishing his famous books for children, he included a grandmother character in \"The Witches\", and later said that she was based directly on his own mother as a tribute.\nTelevision.\nIn 1961, Dahl hosted and wrote for a science fiction and horror television anthology series called \"Way Out\", which preceded the \"Twilight Zone\" series on the CBS network for 14 episodes from March to July. One of the last dramatic network shows shot in New York City, the entire series is available for viewing at The Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles. He also wrote for the satirical BBC comedy programme \"That Was the Week That Was\", which was hosted by David Frost.\nThe British television series, \"Tales of the Unexpected\", originally aired on ITV between 1979 and 1988. The series was released to tie in with Dahl's short story anthology of the same name, which had introduced readers to many motifs that were common in his writing. The series was an anthology of different tales, initially based on Dahl's short stories. The stories were sometimes sinister, sometimes wryly comedic and usually had a twist ending. Dahl introduced on camera all the episodes of the first two series, which bore the full title \"Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected\".\nDeath and legacy.\nRoald Dahl died on 23 November 1990, at the age of 74 of a rare cancer of the blood, myelodysplastic syndrome, in Oxford, and was buried in the cemetery at the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England. His obituary in \"The Times\" was titled \"Death silences Pied Piper of the macabre\". According to his granddaughter, the family gave him a \"sort of Viking funeral\". He was buried with his snooker cues, some very good burgundy, chocolates, HB pencils and a power saw. Today, children continue to leave toys and flowers by his grave.\nIn 1996, the Roald Dahl Children's Gallery was opened at the Buckinghamshire County Museum in nearby Aylesbury. The main-belt asteroid 6223 Dahl, discovered by Czech astronomer Anton\u00edn Mrkos, was named in his memory in 1996.\nIn 2002, one of Cardiff Bay's modern landmarks, the Oval Basin plaza, was renamed \"Roald Dahl Plass\". \"Plass\" is Norwegian for \"place\" or \"square\", alluding to the writer's Norwegian roots. There have also been calls from the public for a permanent statue of him to be erected in Cardiff. In 2016, the city celebrated the centenary of Dahl's birth in Llandaff. Welsh Arts organisations, including National Theatre Wales, Wales Millennium Centre and Literature Wales, came together for a series of events, titled Roald Dahl 100, including a Cardiff-wide City of the Unexpected, which marked his legacy.\nDahl's charitable commitments in the fields of neurology, haematology and literacy during his life have been continued by his widow since his death, through Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity, formerly known as the Roald Dahl Foundation. The charity provides care and support to seriously ill children and young people throughout Britain. In June 2005, the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in the author's home village Great Missenden was officially opened by Cherie Blair, wife of then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, to celebrate the work of Roald Dahl and advance his work in literacy education. Over 50,000 visitors from abroad, mainly from Australia, Japan, the United States and Germany, travel to the village museum every year.\nIn 2008, the UK charity Booktrust and Children's Laureate Michael Rosen inaugurated The Roald Dahl Funny Prize, an annual award to authors of humorous children's fiction. On 14 September 2009 (the day after what would have been Dahl's 93rd birthday) the first blue plaque in his honour was unveiled in Llandaff. Rather than commemorating his place of birth, however, the plaque was erected on the wall of the former sweet shop (and site of \"The Great Mouse Plot of 1924\") that features in the first part of his autobiography \"Boy\". It was unveiled by his widow Felicity and son Theo. In 2018, Weston-super-Mare, the town described by Dahl as a \"seedy seaside resort\", unveiled a blue plaque dedicated to him, on the site of the since-demolished boarding school Dahl attended, St Peter's. The anniversary of Dahl's birthday on 13 September is celebrated as \"Roald Dahl Day\" in Africa, the United Kingdom and Latin America.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Arguably the Shakespeare of children's literature, from \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" to \"Matilda\" and \"The BFG\", filmmakers and animators are still drawing from the enormous vat of material he created.\"\n \u2014\"Britain's top ten children's literature superstars\". \"The Independent\", 2012.\nIn honour of Dahl, the Royal Gibraltar Post Office issued a set of four stamps in 2010 featuring Quentin Blake's original illustrations for four of the children's books written by Dahl during his long career; \"The BFG\", \"The Twits\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", and \"Matilda\". A set of six commemorative Royal Mail stamps was issued in 2012, featuring Blake's illustrations for \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"The Witches\", \"The Twits\", \"Matilda\", \"Fantastic Mr Fox\", and \"James and the Giant Peach\". \nDahl's influence has extended beyond literary figures. For instance, the film director Tim Burton recalled from childhood \"the second layer [after Dr. Seuss] of connecting to a writer who gets the idea of the modern fable\u2014and the mixture of light and darkness, and not speaking down to kids, and the kind of politically incorrect humour that kids get. I've always liked that, and it's shaped everything I've felt that I've done.\" Steven Spielberg read \"The BFG\" to his children when they were young, stating the book celebrates the fact that it's OK to be different as well as to have an active imagination: \"It's very important that we preserve the tradition of allowing young children to run free with their imaginations and magic and imagination are the same thing.\" Actress Scarlett Johansson named \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" one of the five books that made a difference to her.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dahl has an incredibly distinctive style: his subversive, unpredictable plots, musical prose and caustic wit are impossible to imitate. And yet his stories have proved astonishingly malleable. Often adapted by equally idiosyncratic writers and directors, when translated onto stage and screen, his works seamlessly take on the impression of their new maker. Like in many of his stories, Dahl offers a narrative where troublemaking is rewarded, and games and tricks are more successful than following rules. Perhaps this, more than anything, is the reason why Dahl's stories excite the imagination of so many adults and children, and why so many storytellers across stage and screen can't resist remaking his tales in their own individual style. Right across his body of work, playfulness and inventiveness are always prized over boring qualities like obedience and deference. In Dahl's world, creative disruption is presented in such an appealing, delicious light, that you can't help but join in the fun.\u2014\u200a\nRegarded as \"one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century\", Dahl was named by \"The Times\" one of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. He ranks amongst the world's best-selling fiction authors with sales estimated at over 300\u00a0million, and his books have been published in 63 languages. In 2000, Dahl topped the list of Britain's favourite authors. In 2003, four books by Dahl, led by \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" at number 35, ranked among the Top 100 in \"The Big Read\", a survey of the British public by the BBC to determine the \"nation's best-loved novel\" of all time. In surveys of British teachers, parents and students, Dahl is frequently ranked the best children's writer. He won the first three Australian BILBY Younger Readers Award; for \"Matilda\", \"The BFG\", and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". \nIn a 2006 list for the Royal Society of Literature, \"Harry Potter\" creator J. K. Rowling named \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" one of her top ten books every child should read. Critics have commented on the similarities between the Dursley family from \"Harry Potter\" and the nightmarish guardians seen in many of Dahl's books, such as Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker from \"James and the Giant Peach\", Grandma from \"George's Marvellous Medicine\", and the Wormwoods from \"Matilda\". Barry Cunningham, who as publisher of Bloomsbury signed Rowling, cited his experiences travelling with Dahl in promotional book tours of the UK as helping him see the potential of Rowling's work, stating, \"I think it was because I didn't come from a traditional background. I'd come from marketing and promotion. I'd seen how children relate to books\". In 2012, \"Matilda\" was ranked number 30 among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\", a monthly with primarily US audience. The Top 100 included four books by Dahl, more than any other writer. The American magazine \"Time\" named three Dahl books in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time, more than any other author. Dahl is one of the most borrowed authors in British libraries.\nIn 2012, Dahl was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork\u2014the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover\u2014to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life he most admires. In 2016 Dahl's enduring popularity was proved by his ranking in Amazon's the top five best-selling children's authors on the online store over the last year, looking at sales in print and on the Kindle store. In a 2017 UK poll of the greatest authors, songwriters, artists and photographers, Dahl was named the greatest storyteller of all time, ranking ahead of Dickens, Shakespeare, Rowling and Spielberg. In 2017, the airline Norwegian announced Dahl's image would appear on the tail fin one of their Boeing 737-800 aircraft. He is one of the company's six \"British tail fin heroes\", joining Queen singer Freddie Mercury, England World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore, novelist Jane Austen, pioneering pilot Amy Johnson and aviation entrepreneur Freddie Laker.\nIn September 2021, Netflix acquired the Roald Dahl Story Company in a deal worth more than \u00a3500 million ($686 million). A film adaptation of \"Matilda the Musical\" was released by Netflix and Sony Pictures Releasing in December 2022, and the cast includes Emma Thompson as Miss Trunchbull. The next Dahl adaptation for Netflix, \"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\", was released in September 2023, with its director Wes Anderson also adapting three additional Dahl short stories for Netflix in 2024.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "55491", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55491", "title": "The Addams Family", "text": "Fictional family created by Charles Addams\nThe Addams Family is a fictional family created by American cartoonist Charles Addams. The Addams are an eccentric old-money clan who delight in the macabre and the grotesque and are seemingly unaware or unconcerned that other people find them bizarre or frightening. The Addams's view in seeing their family life and interests as normal was a basis for the satire and comedy. They originally appeared in a series of 150 standalone single-panel comics, about half of which were originally published in \"The New Yorker\" between 1938 and their creator's death in 1988. They have since appeared in other media, such as television, film, video games, comic books, a musical, and merchandise.\nThe family members were unnamed until the 1960s. Matriarch Morticia and daughter Wednesday received their names when a licensed doll collection was released in 1962; patriarch Gomez and son Pugsley were named when the 1964 television series debuted. The Addams Family consists of Gomez and Morticia Addams, their children, Wednesday and Pugsley, and close family members Uncle Fester and Grandmama, their butler Lurch, and Pugsley's pet octopus, Aristotle. The dimly seen Thing (later a disembodied hand) was introduced in 1954, and Gomez's Cousin Itt, Morticia's pet lion Kitty Kat and Morticia's carnivorous plant Cleopatra in 1964. Pubert Addams, Wednesday and Pugsley's infant brother, was introduced in the 1993 film \"Addams Family Values\".\nThe live-action television series premiered on ABC on Friday, September 18, 1964, and ran for two seasons. An animated series from Hanna-Barbera aired in 1973 and the characters had cameos in the animated \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\". The 1960s television show characters and actors returned in a 1977 telefilm titled \"Halloween with the New Addams Family.\" \nThe franchise was revived in the 1990s with a feature film series consisting of \"The Addams Family\" (1991) and \"Addams Family Values\" (1993). The films inspired a second animated series (1992\u20131993) which is set in the same fictional universe. The series was rebooted with a 1998 direct-to-video film and a spin-off live-action television series (1998\u20131999). In 2010, a live musical adaptation featuring Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth opened on Broadway to tepid reviews, but it was nominated for two Tony Awards and eight Drama Desk Awards, winning one Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Set Design. The series was rebooted again in 2019 with the animated film \"The Addams Family\", which led to a sequel in 2021. In 2022, Netflix debuted the original live action series \"Wednesday,\" based around the daughter of the family.\nThe franchise has spawned a video game series, and soundtracks, which are based around its Grammy-nominated theme song. A staple in pop culture for eight decades, The Addams Family has influenced American comics, cinema and television. The goth subculture and its fashion have also been influenced by The Addams Family.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nOrigins and \"The New Yorker\" cartoons (1933\u20131964).\nCharles Addams began as a cartoonist in \"The New Yorker\" with a sketch of a window washer that ran on February 6, 1932. Addams first drew the then-unnamed Morticia some years before her first published appearance in \"The New Yorker\". Some sources give a date of 1933, while Addams himself when asked in interview suggested \"around 1937.\" Media speculation at the time often connected Morticia to Charles Addams' first wife Barbara Jean Day, but he had yet to meet her. In an interview in 1981 he acknowledged that Morticia reflected the qualities he was attracted to. Because of this, the women he married later on resembled the character. He described Morticia as \"not patterned after anyone in particular, although I've often thought there was a little Gloria Swanson in her.\"\nThe first Addams Family cartoon was published in 1938, in a one-panel gag format. Charles Addams became a regular contributor to \"The New Yorker\" and drew approximately 1,300 cartoons between then and his death in 1988. 58 of these would feature the Addams Family, almost all of which were published in the 1940s and 1950s. Members of the family were introduced one by one, with Morticia first, Gomez (based on Thomas E. Dewey) joining four years later, Pugsley, and finally Wednesday and Fester shortly after. Addams indicated that Fester resembled himself, \"plus a little more hair.\" A Christmas 1946 strip, showing the family pouring boiling oil on carolers, was well received and was later sold on Christmas cards. Outside of \"The New Yorker\", Addams also published several collections, the most notable being \"Dear Dead Days: A Family Album\" in 1959. \nIn 1946, Addams briefly collaborated with science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, planning out an illustrated book about a supernatural family named \"The Elliotts\", similar to \"The Addams Family\". There was difficulty finding a publisher however, and the two went their separate ways. These stories were eventually anthologized in \"From the Dust Returned\" (2001), with a connecting narrative, an explanation of their collaboration, and the artwork Addams had created for the project in 1946.\nBeginning in the early 1960s, the development of the television series affected the comics. For one thing, it is claimed that Wednesday was first given her name in reference to the nursery rhyme Monday's Child, where \"Wednesday's child is full of woe\". Actress and poet Joan Blake offered Charles Addams the idea for the name and the others were eventually named ahead of the series' debut. Some suggestions from David Levy at NBC were introduced into the last comics of the era, including the addition of Thing and Cousin Itt. Itt was an invention of Levy's, while Thing was an expansion on a disembodied hand that had appeared in a 1954 strip. The comics ceased publication in \"The New Yorker\" in 1964, as the editor William Shawn banned the characters. He was concerned about the image of the publication, and did not want it associated with a mainstream sitcom. \"Smithsonian Magazine\" called him \"snooty\" for the decision.\nTV adaptations and rise to popularity (1964\u20131977).\nIn the early 1960s, NBC executive David Levy stumbled across one of Addams' books in a New York bookstore and realized that the tone would be perfect for television. He purchased the book and met with Addams in the Plaza Hotel, and the topic of a television adaptation was raised. Addams had been approached about television adaptations by others in the past, but he was inclined to take Levy up on the offer because of their shared friend in the author John O'Hara. At the next meeting, at Addams' apartment, Levy indicated the characters would need to be named, and Addams came up with a list for the third meeting. According to Levy, Addams had little involvement with the series after those three meetings. He retained the right to veto casting decisions and other choices, but did not make use of the power. Some rights to the franchise were given to Filmways, the production company for the show.\nThe 1964 television adaptation brought the series to a much wider audience and was well received publicly. Producer Nat Perrin took a \"less evil\" approach to the characters and stories than Addams had in the cartoons, emphasizing lighter, more comedic elements. Stephen Cox later described the series as \"more zany than spooky\". Charles Addams himself was less happy with the series, criticising the characters for being \"half as evil\" as in the comics.\nThe popular series, broadcast on the ABC network, ran only two seasons. No official reason was given for the cancellation, though \"Smithsonian Magazine\" speculated that it was due to the adoption of color programming on the network the following year. It has also been suggested that competition with \"Hogan's Heroes\" in the same time slot on CBS was a factor.\nThe sudden cancellation in 1966 brought issues for Addams, as he faced a drop in income with the show no longer in development. His second wife Barbara Barb was a practicing lawyer who had engaged in \"diabolical legal scheming\" during their marriage, and had convinced Addams to sign over the rights to future television and film adaptations, as well as rights to some of his other cartoons. Following their divorce she remained in possession of these rights until 1991, when she sold them to allow development of the Sonnenfeld films. Addams could also no longer publish his comics in \"The New Yorker\" as Shawn's ban remained in effect even after the television series concluded. Addams became bitter towards the magazine \"for disowning his family\". The franchise remained in the popular consciousness even after the series concluded, with the \"Lurch\" dance move remaining popular through the 1960s. The television series was often re-run through television syndication for years afterward, particularly in Australia.\nHanna-Barbera parodied the show in November 1964 by introducing a family named \"The Gruesomes\" to \"The Flintstones\", and the Gruesomes appeared occasionally in \"Flintstones\" media into the early 1970s. The studio later animated a 1972 Addams Family crossover with Scooby-Doo, which led to a 1973 animated series. The animated incarnation featured a new cast except for Felix Silla, who returned as Cousin Itt. The show had good ratings and spawned a line of children's merchandise, but only aired 16 episodes. A pilot was also produced that year for a new live action series entitled \"The Addams Family Funhouse\", using a different cast. The pilot was aired in 1973 but never picked up for a full series.\nA 1977 special, \"Halloween with the New Addams Family\", reunited most of the original cast from the 1964 series, with Blossom Rock absent due to her health. The made-for-TV movie faced issues during production and was poorly received. It was shot using a house set that had been constructed for the horror film \"Ben\", which didn't resemble the original Addams mansion and caused technical issues with lighting. The film was widely criticised for the script, direction, and the performances of some of the actors. Jackie Coogan in particular was recovering from a mild stroke during filming.\nWave of interest in Australia (1979\u20131989).\nWhile William Shawn's ban on further \"Addams Family\" comics in \"The New Yorker\" persisted until 1987, Addams was able to sneak in several of the characters as a cameo in \"Z Line Subway\", a 1979 strip. He married Marilyn Matthews Miller in 1981, in an Addams family themed ceremony conducted in a cemetery. Filmways, the production company of the 1964 series and holder of some franchise rights, was purchased in 1982 by Orion Pictures. The retirement of Shawn in 1987 allowed a brief return of the cartoons to \"The New Yorker\", though Addams died only a year later. While largely inactive in the United States, the franchise did however see a wave of popularity in Australia, brought on by widely watched reruns on TCN-9. New merchandise was released in Australia and a \"Morticia Boutique Dress Shop\" opened in Melbourne in 1988. A satellite-linked interview with surviving members of the original cast was also aired on Australian television. A fan quoted by Cox credited the tone of the Addams family for its success in 1980s Australia, noting that the characters were \"less American\" than the Munsters, and that Australians had a different life-style. Astin reprised his role as Gomez for a 1989 episode of Nick at Nite's Sitcom Zone, in which he introduced reruns of shows for a two-hour programming block. A 1989 video game \"Fester's Quest\" was developed by Sunsoft, and received mixed reviews. To promote the game some black-and-white advertisements were filmed using the characters.\nFilm series and \"The New Addams Family\" (1991\u20132001).\nThe head of production at 20th Century Fox, Scott Rudin, pitched an Addams Family film but Fox did not have the rights to the franchise. The rights were at the time split between two parties: The late Addams' second wife Barbara Barb, and Orion Pictures. The latter were in possession of film rights in particular after purchasing Filmways in 1982. Fox attempted to purchase those rights but failed, as Orion had plans for a new TV series. The studio's plans changed however after Barb sold her rights to Orion, and the studio brought Rudin on board to produce a film. Caroline Thompson and Larry Wilson wrote a script, and faced many re-writes early on. Tim Burton was considered for director, but the role ultimately went to Barry Sonnenfeld.\nThe film featured a new cast, Blossom Rock (Grandmama) having died in 1978, Ted Cassidy (Lurch) in 1979, Carolyn Jones (Morticia) in 1983 and Jackie Coogan (Fester) in 1984.\nProduction on the film was troubled, with Sonnenfeld blacking out on set, and a burst blood vessel in Raul Julia's eye further delaying the shoot. Director of photography Owen Roizman quit the production three months from completion, forcing Sonnenfeld to take on the role in addition to his existing responsibilities. Orion faced financial issues and sold the project and Addams family rights to Paramount mid-production- though the deal did not include overseas home media rights, which harmed distribution after release. Orion retained those, and those rights passed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when the studio was bought out in 1997.\nWhile the 1991 film received mixed reviews from critics, it performed reasonably well at the box office despite its production issues. The film triggered a lawsuit from David Levy over its use of Thing and Cousin Itt, as Levy had been the creator of those characters ahead of the launch of the 1964 television series. The case was settled out of court and the resolution is not known publicly. A second film in 1993, \"Addams Family Values\" was highly regarded by critics but performed poorly at the box office unexpectedly, and earned less than half the revenue of its predecessor. This, and the sudden death of Julia in 1994, prevented Sonnenfeld from producing further films. Both films received nominations for Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, and Hugo Awards. For her role as Morticia, Anjelica Huston was twice nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and Raul Julia (as Gomez), Christina Ricci (as Wednesday), Christopher Lloyd (as Fester), and Joan Cusack (as Fester's wife, Debbie Jellinsky, in the sequel) received multiple Saturn Award and American Comedy Award nominations for their portrayals.\nFollowing the wave of interest in the franchise, a 1992 animated television series notably saw John Astin reprise his role as Gomez, almost thirty years after his first appearance in the role in 1964. It was nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards, including one for Astin. That year, a pinball machine based on the franchise was also released, featuring original voice acting from Julia and Huston as Gomez and Morticia. It went on to become the highest selling pinball machine of all time at over 20,000 units.\nA direct-to-video film, \"The Addams Family Reunion\" produced by Saban Entertainment in 1998, featured the return of Carel Struycken as Lurch, but was otherwise unrelated to the Sonnenfeld films. It was very poorly received. The film was intended as the pilot for a Canadian-produced live-action television series, \"The New Addams Family\", made with a mostly different cast and airing the following year. Astin, then in his late 60s, returned as Grandpapa Addams in the TV series, rather than Gomez, who was played by Glenn Taranto. The show concluded after a single season in 1999. A video game adaptation of \"The New Addams Family\" was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Color.\nMusical and animated adaptations (2007\u20132021).\nIn 2007, Elephant Eye Theatrical announced that they had obtained the rights to a musical adaptation of the comic series, which at that time were held by the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation. After a try-out in Chicago in 2009, the musical was performed on Broadway in 2010, and thereafter in a sequence of international tours until 2021.\nThe rights to the franchise were purchased by Illumination Entertainment in 2010, and the studio shortly announced a Tim Burton stop-motion led film. However, Burton withdrew from the project in 2013 over a decision to use computer animation rather than stop motion as he had intended. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired the remaining rights and announced a computer animated film the same year, and entered into production in the late 2010s. Unlike the Burton version, this would use 3D computer animation. The film was eventually released in 2019, to a moderate box-office sales and mixed reception. A sequel, released in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, was far less successful and poorly received critically.\nNetflix series (2022\u2013present).\nMiles Millar and Alfred Gough began work on a live-action spin-off series entitled \"Wednesday\" in 2019, financed by MGM. The writers room for the series took place during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so was conducted remotely. The project was formally announced in 2020, with Burton as executive producer. The series premiered with its first season in 2022 to critical acclaim, and a second season followed in 2025. Amazon purchased MGM in 2021, which in turn means that the Addams Family rights now rest with the company.\nGomez and Pugsley are enthusiastic. Morticia is even in disposition, muted, witty, sometimes deadly. Grandma Frump is foolishly good-natured. Wednesday is her mother's daughter. A closely-knit family, the real head being Morticia \u2013 although each of the others is a definite character \u2013 except for Grandma, who is easily led. Many of the troubles they have as a family are due to Grandma's fumbling, weak character. The house is a wreck, of course, but this is a house-proud family just the same, and every trap door is in good repair. Money is no problem. style=\"text-align:right\"|\nPremise and background.\nThe family appears to be a branch of an extensive Addams clan, with relatives all over the world. In the original television series they are said to be related to \"those one-D Adamses\", a fact the family are deeply ashamed of. According to the film version, the family credo is, \"\" (pseudo-Latin: \"We gladly feast on those who would subdue us\"). Charles Addams was first inspired by his hometown of Westfield, New Jersey, an area full of ornate Victorian mansions and archaic graveyards. In the original comics series they live in a 'gothic' house on Cemetery Ridge. According to the television series, the residence is a gloomy mansion adjacent to a cemetery and a swamp located in an unspecified American town. In the musical (first shown in Chicago in 2009), the house is located in Central Park. In the 2019 film, the Addamses live in an abandoned asylum located in the outskirts of the state of New Jersey which is haunted by a disembodied resident who demands the property remain undisturbed.\nAlthough most of the humor derives from the fact that they share macabre interests, such as putting each other and themselves in the way of bodily harm (none of which seems to have any effect), the television Addamses are not evil. They are a close-knit extended family. Morticia is an exemplary mother, and she and Gomez remain passionate towards each other; as established in the television series: She occasionally fondly calls him \"bubbeleh\", to which he responds by kissing her arms, behavior which Morticia can also provoke by speaking a few words in French (their meanings are not important; any words in French will do). The parents are supportive of their children (except in the 2019 film when Wednesday arrives home wearing a pink dress). The family is friendly and hospitable to visitors; in some cases, it is willing to donate large sums of money to causes (television series and films), despite the visitors' horror at the Addamses' peculiar lifestyle. The characters were unnamed until the advent of the 1964 television adaptation, except for Wednesday and Morticia who were first named for a 1962 licensed doll collection.\nAdaptations.\nTelevision.\n\"The Addams Family\" (1964\u20131966).\nIn 1964, the ABC TV network created \"The Addams Family\" television series based on Addams's cartoon characters. The series was shot in black-and-white and aired for two seasons in 64 half-hour episodes (September 18, 1964 \u2013 September 2, 1966). During the original television run of \"The Addams Family\" television series, \"The New Yorker\" editor William Shawn refused to publish any \"Addams Family\" cartoons. However, he continued to publish other Charles Addams cartoons. Shawn regarded his magazine as targeting a more refined readership and he did not want it to be associated with characters who could be seen on television by the more general public. After Shawn's 1987 retirement, the characters were welcomed back to \"The New Yorker\".\n\"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" (1972).\nThe Addams Family's first animated appearance was on the third episode of Hanna-Barbera's \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\", \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Addams Family\" (a.k.a. \"Wednesday is Missing\"), which first aired on CBS Saturday morning, on September 23, 1972. Four members of the original cast (John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Jackie Coogan, and Ted Cassidy) returned for the special, which involved the Addamses in a mystery with the Scooby-Doo gang. The Addams Family characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. After the episode aired, fans wanted more animated adventures featuring the Addamses, and Hanna-Barbera obliged.\n\"The Addams Family Fun-House\" (1973).\nIn late 1972, ABC produced a pilot for a live-action musical variety show which was titled \"The Addams Family Fun-House\". The cast included Jack Riley and Liz Torres as Gomez and Morticia (the pair also co-wrote the special), Stubby Kaye as Uncle Fester, Pat McCormick as Lurch and Butch Patrick (who had played Eddie Munster on \"The Munsters\") as Pugsley. Felix Silla reprised his role as Cousin Itt, connecting it to the original TV series. The pilot aired in 1973, but it was not picked up for a series.\n\"The Addams Family\" (1973).\nThe first animated series ran on Saturday mornings from September 8 \u2013\nDecember 22, 1973 on NBC. In a departure from the original series, this series took the Addamses on the road in a Victorian-style RV. This series also marked the point where the relationships between the characters were changed so that Fester was now Gomez's brother, and Grandmama was now Morticia's mother (though the old relationships between the characters would be revisited in the 1977 television movie, in order to retain its continuity with the original sitcom). Although Coogan and Cassidy reprised their roles as Uncle Fester and Lurch, Astin and Jones did not; their parts were recast with Hanna-Barbera voice talents Lennie Weinrib as Gomez and Janet Waldo as Morticia, while a ten-year-old Jodie Foster provided the voice of Pugsley. Again, the characters were drawn to the specifications of the original Charles Addams cartoons. The show also had appearances from Thing, Cousin Itt, Kitty Kat and Cleopatra from the original series. The show also introduces new Addams Family animal companions, such as Ali the alligator, Ocho the octopus and Mr. V the vulture. One season was produced, and the second season consisted of reruns. The show's theme music was completely different and it had no lyrics and no finger snaps, although it retained a bit of the four-note score from the live-action show.\n\"The Addams Family Comic Book\".\nFrom 1974 to 1975, Gold Key Comics produced a comic book series in connection with the show, but it only lasted three issues. Each issue was adapted from a TV episode, starting with \"In Search of the Boola-Boola\" (October 1974).\n\"Halloween with the New Addams Family\" (1977).\nA television reunion movie, \"Halloween with the New Addams Family\", aired on NBC on Sunday, October 30, 1977. It features most of the original cast, except Blossom Rock, who had played Grandmama. She was still alive but was very ill at the time; Jane Rose replaced her. Veteran character actors Parley Baer and Vito Scotti, who both had recurring roles in the original series, also appeared in the movie. The movie has a slightly different version of the theme song; the finger snaps are used but not the lyrics.\nGomez and Morticia have had two more children, Wednesday Jr. and Pugsley Jr., who strongly resemble their older siblings. Gomez's brother, Pancho, is staying with the family while Gomez attends a lodge meeting in Tombstone, Arizona. Gomez is jealous of his brother, who once courted Morticia. Halloween is nigh, and Pancho tells the children the legend of the Great Pumpkin-like character of Cousin Shy, who distributes gifts and carves pumpkins for good children on Halloween night. Wednesday (now called \"Wednesday, Sr.\") is home from music academy, where she is studying the piccolo (breaking glass with it). Pugsley (now \"Pugsley, Sr.\") is home from a Nairobi medical school, where he is training to be a witch doctor. The family's home has been bugged by a gang of crooks which intends to steal the family's fortune. Lafferty, the boss, sends a gang member named Mikey into the house to investigate. Mikey panics and flees after treading on the tail of Kitty Kat the lion. The crooks employ a fake Gomez and Morticia to help them carry out their plans, along with two strong-arm goons, Hercules and Atlas. Gomez returns home to celebrate the Halloween party and trim the scarecrow. Lafferty poses as Quincy Addams (from Boston) to gain entrance to the house during the party. He has his men tie up Gomez and Morticia, and his doubles take their places, confusing Pancho, who is still in love with Morticia, and Ophelia, who is still in love with Gomez. Gomez and Morticia escape (thanks to the \"Old Piccolo Game\"), and rejoin the party, only to have Lafferty use various methods to try to get rid of them. Lurch scares off the thugs and terrifies Lafferty's other assistant. Fester, trying to be nice, puts Lafferty on the rack. Lafferty tries to escape through the secret passage and steps on Kitty Kat's tail. When the police arrive, the crooks gladly surrender. The Addamses are then free to celebrate Halloween happily, ending the night by singing together in welcome for Cousin Shy.\n\"The Addams Family: The Animated Series\" (1992\u20131993).\nThe remake series ran on Saturday mornings from 1992 to 1993 on ABC after producers realized the success of the 1991 \"Addams Family\" movie. This series returned to the familiar format of the original series, with the Addams Family facing their sitcom situations at home. John Astin returned to the role of Gomez, and celebrities Rip Taylor and Carol Channing took over the roles of Fester and Grandmama, respectively. Veteran voice actors Jim Cummings, Debi Derryberry, Jeannie Elias and Pat Fraley did the voices of Lurch, Wednesday, Pugsley and Cousin Itt, respectively. New artistic models of the characters were used for this series, though still having a passing resemblance to the original cartoons. Two seasons were produced, with the third year containing reruns. Oddly in this series, Wednesday maintained her macabre, brooding attitude from the Addams Family movies. Still, her facial expressions and body language conveyed the happy-go-lucky, fun attitude of her portrayal in the original television show. The original Vic Mizzy theme song, although slightly different, was used for the opening.\n\"The New Addams Family\" (1998\u20131999).\n\"The New Addams Family\" was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and ran for 65 episodes (one more than the original TV series) during the 1998\u20131999 season on the then-newly launched Fox Family Channel. Many storylines from the original series were reworked for this new series, incorporating more modern elements and jokes. John Astin returned to the franchise in some episodes of this series, albeit as \"Grandpapa\" Addams (Gomez's grandfather, a character introduced in \"Addams Family Reunion\"). The cast included Glenn Taranto as Gomez Addams, Ellie Harvie as Morticia, Michael Roberds as Fester, Brody Smith as Pugsley, Nicole Fugere (the only cast member from \"Addams Family Reunion\" to return) as Wednesday, John DeSantis as Lurch, Betty Phillips as Grandmama and Steven Fox as Thing.\n\"Wednesday\" (2022).\nIn 2021, Netflix announced a live-action TV series adaptation based on Wednesday Addams, produced by MGM Television and starring Jenna Ortega as the title character. Alfred Gough and Miles Millar were the showrunners and Tim Burton directed several episodes in his first televised directorial effort. Wednesday, a student at Nevermore Academy, solves mysteries using her psychic ability. These include murders and a 25-year-old mystery involving her family. Luis Guzm\u00e1n stars as Gomez, and Catherine Zeta-Jones stars as Morticia. In addition, Fred Armisen appears as Uncle Fester, George Burcea as Lurch, Victor Dorobantu as Thing, and Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley. Hunter Doohan, Georgie Farmer, Moosa Mostafa, Emma Myers, Naomi J. Ogawa, Joy Sunday, Percy Hynes White, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane and Gwendoline Christie were also added to the cast as series regulars. In March 2022, Christina Ricci, who portrayed Wednesday in \"The Addams Family\" (1991) and \"Addams Family Values\" (1993), joined the cast as a series regular.\nFeature films.\n\"The Addams Family\" (1991).\nIn the 1990s, Orion Pictures (which by then had inherited the rights to the series) developed a film version, \"The Addams Family\" (released on November 22, 1991). Because of the studio's financial troubles at the time, Orion sold the US rights to the film to Paramount Pictures. On October 1, 2019, Paramount Pictures released a double feature of \"The Addams Family\" and \"Addams Family Values\" on Blu-ray in the United States.\n\"Addams Family Values\" (1993).\nUpon the last film's success, a sequel followed: \"Addams Family Values\" (released on November 19, 1993, with worldwide distribution by Paramount). Loosened content restrictions allowed the films to use far more grotesque humor that strove to keep the Addams cartoons' original spirit (in fact, several gags were lifted straight from the single-panel cartoons). The two films used the same cast, except for Grandmama, played by Judith Malina and Carol Kane in the first and second films, respectively. A script for a third film was prepared in 1994, but was abandoned after the sudden death of actor Raul Julia that year.\n\"Addams Family Reunion\" (1998).\nAnother film, \"Addams Family Reunion\", was released direct-to-video on September 22, 1998, this time by Warner Bros. through its video division. It has no relation to the Paramount movies, being in fact a full-length pilot for a second live-action television version, \"The New Addams Family\", produced and shot in Canada. The third movie's Gomez, played by Tim Curry, follows the style of Raul Julia, while the new sitcom's Gomez, played by Glenn Taranto, is played in the style of John Astin, who had played the character in the 1960s. The only actors in this Warner Bros./Saban Entertainment production to have acted in the previous Paramount films were Carel Struycken as Lurch and Christopher Hart as Thing.\nCancelled film.\nIn 2010, it was announced that Illumination Entertainment, in partnership with Universal Pictures, had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings. The film was planned to be a stop-motion animated film based on Charles Addams's original drawings. Tim Burton was set to co-write and co-produce the film, with a possibility to direct. In July\u00a02013 however, it was reported that the film was cancelled.\n\"The Addams Family\" (2019) and \"The Addams Family 2\" (2021).\nOn October 31, 2013, it was announced in \"Variety\" that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer will be reviving The Addams Family as an animated film with Pamela Pettler to write the screenplay and Andrew Mittman and Kevin Miserocchi to executive produce the film and they were in final negotiations with BermanBraun's Gail Berman and Lloyd Braun to produce it. By October 2017, Conrad Vernon had been hired to direct the film, which he will also produce along with Berman and Alex Schwartz, based on a screenplay written by Pettler, with revisions by Matt Lieberman. The film was released on October 11, 2019. On October 8, 2020, MGM announced that a sequel is in the works with an announcement trailer. The original cast are set to return. Bill Hader and Javon \"Wanna\" Walton have also been cast to voice. Bill Hader played a new character named Dr. Cyrus Strange, while Javon replaced Finn Wolfhard as the voice of Pugsley Addams. Directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon returned as directors. The film was released on October 1, 2021.\nVideo games.\nTen video games released from 1989 to 2021 were based on \"The Addams Family\".\nPinball.\nA pinball game by Midway (under the Bally label) was released in 1992 shortly after the movie. It is the best-selling pinball game of all time.\nBooks.\n\"The Addams Family\".\nThis first novelisation of the television series, written by Jack Sharkey, was released near the end of the show's second season. The book details the family's arrival in their new home and explains how it got its bizarre d\u00e9cor. The arrival and origins of Thing are explained. Each chapter reads as a self-contained story, like episodes of the television show. The novel concludes with the Addams family discovering that their lives will be the basis for a new television series. It was published in paperback by Pyramid Books in 1965.\n\"The Addams Family Strikes Back\".\n\"The Addams Family Strikes Back\" by W.F. Miksch tells how Gomez plans to rehabilitate the image of Benedict Arnold by running for the local school board. The tone and characterizations in this book resemble the TV characters much more closely than in the first novel. Cousin Itt appears as a minor character in this story, but as a tiny, three-legged creature rather than the hairy, derby-hatted character seen on television and in the movies. The novel was published in paperback form by Pyramid Books in 1965.\n\"The Addams Family: An Evilution\".\n\"The Addams Family: An Evilution\" is a book about the \"evilution\" of The Addams Family characters, with more than 200 published and previously unpublished cartoons, and includes text by Charles Addams and H. Kevin Miserocchi, Director of the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation. Pomegranate Press published the book in 2010.\nAdvertising.\nIn 1994, the actors cast as the Addamses in the first two films (sans the recently deceased Raul Julia) were in several Japanese television spots for the Honda Odyssey. The Addamses are seen speaking Japanese\u2014most prominently Gomez (for whom a voice actor was used to impersonate Julia while footage from \"Addams Family Values\" was seen) and Morticia.\nIn 2007 and 2008, the Addams Family appeared as M&amp;M's in an advertising campaign for M&amp;M's Dark Chocolate.\nSoundtrack.\nA theme song for the 1964 TV series as well as a soundtrack album the next year were released, both composed by Vic Mizzy and the latter containing all of his compositions for the series entitled \"Original Music From The Addams Family\".\nMusical.\n\"The Addams Family\".\nIn May 2007, it was announced that a musical inspired by The Addams Family drawings by Charles Addams was being developed for the Broadway stage. Broadway veterans Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice wrote the book, and Andrew Lippa wrote the score. Julian Crouch and Phelim McDermott (Improbable theatre founders) directed and designed the production, with choreography by Sergio Trujillo. A workshop and private industry presentation was held August 4\u20138, 2008. Featured in the cast were Bebe Neuwirth as Morticia, Krysta Rodriguez as Wednesday, and Nathan Lane as Gomez. In addition, Kevin Chamberlin played Uncle Fester and Zachary James played Lurch.\nThe musical opened in previews at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Broadway on March 8, 2010, with an official opening on April 8, after an out-of-town tryout in Chicago at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts from November 13, 2009, to January 10, 2010. The cast includes Lane as Gomez, Neuwirth as Morticia, Terrence Mann as Mal Beineke, Carolee Carmello as Alice Beineke, Chamberlin as Uncle Fester, Jackie Hoffman as Grandma, Zachary James as Lurch, Krysta Rodriguez as Wednesday, and Wesley Taylor as Wednesday's love interest, Lucas Beineke. The Broadway production ran for 22 months, closing on December 31, 2011, after 35 previews and 722 performances.\nOn September 5, 2016, it was announced that the musical would premiere in the UK, on a major UK and Ireland tour produced by James Yeoburn and Stuart Matthew Price for United Theatrical. The production was directed by Matthew White and it opened at Edinburgh Festival Theatre on April 20, 2017, starring Samantha Womack, Les Dennis and Carrie Hope Fletcher.\n\nLegacy.\nThe family has had a profound influence on American comics, cinema and television, and it has also been seen as an inspiration for the goth subculture and its fashion. According to \"The Telegraph\", the Addamses \"are one of the most iconic families in American history, up there with the Kennedys\". Similarly, \"Time\" has compared \"the relevance and the cultural reach\" of the family with those of the Kennedys and the Roosevelts, \"so much a part of the American landscape that it's difficult to discuss the country's history without mentioning them\". For \"TV Guide\", which listed the characters in the top ten of the \"60\u00a0greatest TV families of all time\", the Addamses \"provid[ed] the design for cartoonish clans to come, like the Flintstones and the Simpsons\". Owing to their popularity, the first feature-length adaptation has been identified as a \"cult film\", while \"Addams Family Values\" was listed as one of the \"50\u00a0best family films\" by \"The Guardian\" and nominated for the American Film Institute's '100\u00a0Years ... 100\u00a0Laughs' at the turn of the century. Ricci's portrayal of Wednesday in the film series was ranked one of the \"100\u00a0greatest movie characters\" by \"Empire\", and in 2011 AOL named Morticia one of the \"100\u00a0most memorable female TV characters\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some of his recurring characters became known as the Addams Family, and were popularized through various adaptations.\nEarly life.\nAddams was born in Westfield, New Jersey. He was the son of Grace M. (n\u00e9e Spear; 1879\u20131943) and Charles Huey Addams (1873\u20131932), a piano company executive who had studied to be an architect. Known as \"something of a rascal around the neighborhood,\" as childhood friends recalled, Addams was distantly related to U.S. presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, despite the different spellings of their last names, and was a first cousin twice removed to noted social reformer Jane Addams.\nAddams would enjoy the Presbyterian Cemetery on Mountain Avenue in Westfield as a child, where \u2013 according to author and Addams expert Ron MacCloskey \u2013 he would wonder what it was like to be dead. In the cartoons, his ghoulish creations lived on Cemetery Ridge with a dreadful view.\nA house on Elm Street and another on Dudley Avenue \u2013 into which police once caught him breaking and entering \u2013 are said to be the inspiration for the Addams Family mansion in his cartoons. College Hall, the oldest building on the current campus of the University of Pennsylvania, where Addams studied, was also an inspiration for the mansion. One friend said of him: \"His sense of humor was a little different from everybody else's.\" He was also artistically inclined, \"drawing with a happy vengeance\", according to a biographer.\nHis father encouraged him to draw, and Addams did cartoons for the Westfield High School yearbook, \"Weathervane\". He attended Colgate University in 1929 and 1930. At 52 Maple Avenue on the corner of West Kendrick Avenue in Hamilton, is another home, and myth, that may have inspired the Addams Family house. He also attended the University of Pennsylvania in 1930 and 1931. He then studied at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City in 1931 and 1932.\nCareer.\nCharles Addams joined the layout department of \"True Detective\" magazine in 1933, where he retouched photos of corpses to remove the blood for appearance alongside magazine stories. Addams complained: \"A lot of those corpses were more interesting the way they were.\"\nThe New Yorker Obituary of October 17, 1988, says his first drawing for \"The New Yorker\" ran in February 1932. However, his first drawing actually appeared in the February 4, 1933, issue. Here he drew the first in the series that came to be called \"The Addams Family\" in August 6, 1938 and ran regularly until his death. Addams remained a freelancer throughout that time.\nDuring World War II, Addams served at the Signal Corps Photographic Center in New York, where he made animated training films for the U.S. Army.\nAddams created a 1952 mural for the bar of a Hamptons hotel. It is now located in the library at Penn State and depicts prominent Addams Family members.\nTelevision producer David Levy approached Addams with an offer to create \"The Addams Family\" television series, with a little help from the humorist. Addams gave his characters names as well as qualities for actors to use in portrayals; the series ran on ABC from 1964 to 1966.\nCartoons.\nAddams regularly had cartoons in \"The New Yorker\", and he also created the syndicated single-panel comic \"Out of This World\" between 1955 and 1957. Collections of his work include \"Drawn and Quartered\" (1942) and \"Monster Rally\" (1950), the latter with a foreword by John O'Hara. One cartoon shows two men standing in a patent attorney's office; one points a bizarre gun out the window toward the street, saying: \"Death ray, fiddlesticks! Why, it doesn't even slow them up!\".\n\"Dear Dead Days\" (1959) is a scrapbook-like compendium of vintage images (and occasional pieces of text) that appealed to the author's sense of the grotesque, including Victorian woodcuts, vintage medicine-show advertisements, and a boyhood photograph of Francesco Lentini, who had three legs.\nAddams drew more than 1,300 cartoons over the course of his life. Beyond \"The New Yorker\" pages, his cartoons appeared in \"Collier's\" and \"TV Guide\", as well as books, calendars, and other merchandise.\nThe 1957 album \"Ghost Ballads\", featuring folk songs with supernatural themes by singer-guitarist Dean Gitter, was packaged with cover art by Addams depicting a haunted house.\nThe Mystery Writers of America honored Addams with a Special Edgar Award in 1961 for his body of work. The films \"The Old Dark House\" (1963) and \"Murder by Death\" (1976) feature title sequences illustrated by Addams.\nIn 1946, Addams met science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury after having drawn an illustration for \"Mademoiselle\" magazine's publication of Bradbury's short story \"Homecoming\", the first in a series of tales chronicling a family of Illinois vampires named the Elliotts. The pair became friends and planned to collaborate on a book of the Elliott Family's complete history with Bradbury writing and Addams providing the illustrations, but it never materialized. Bradbury's stories about the \"Elliott Family\" were finally anthologized in \"From the Dust Returned\" in October 2001, with a connecting narrative and an explanation of his work with Addams, and Addams's 1946 \"Mademoiselle\" illustration used for the book's cover jacket. Although Addams's own characters were well-established by the time of their initial encounter, in a 2001 interview, Bradbury stated: \"[Addams] went his way and created the Addams Family, and I went my own way and created my family in this book.\"\nJanet Maslin, in a review of an Addams biography for \"The New York Times\", wrote: \"Addams's persona sounds cooked up for the benefit of feature writers\u00a0... was at least partly a character contrived for the public eye,\" noting that one outr\u00e9 publicity photo showed the humorist wearing a suit of armor at home, \"but the shelves behind him hold books about painting and antiques, as well as a novel by John Updike.\"\nFilmmaker Alfred Hitchcock was a friend of Addams, and owned two pieces of original Addams art. Hitchcock references Addams in his 1959 film \"North by Northwest\". During the auction scene, Cary Grant discovers two of his adversaries with someone who he also thinks is against him and says: \"The three of you together. Now that's a picture only Charles Addams could draw.\"\nPersonal life.\nAddams met first wife Barbara Jean Day in late 1942, who purportedly resembled his cartoon character Morticia Addams. She attended the University of Michigan, Beaver College, and was a graduate of Butler University. By 1940, at the age of 21, she and her family were living in Westfield. She was a member of the Westfield College Club, Tennis Club and Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority. By April 1943 shortly after the death of Addams mother, the couple were engaged. On May 29, 1943 the couple were married at 4 pm in St. Paul's Episcopal Church with the Rev. Arthur Francis O'Donnell, the rector of the church, officiating. A small reception was held in the home of the bride-elect's parents for the relatives and immediate friends. The marriage ended eight years later after Addams declined to have children (she later married \"New Yorker\" colleague John Hersey, author of the book \"Hiroshima\").\nAddams married second wife Barbara Barb (Estelle B. Barb) on November 12, 1954 in Charleston, South Carolina. A practicing lawyer, she \"combined Morticia-like looks with diabolical legal scheming,\" by which she wound up controlling the \"Addams Family\" television and film franchises and persuaded her husband to give away other legal rights. At one point, she got her husband to take out a US$100,000 insurance policy. Addams consulted a lawyer on the sly, who later humorously wrote: \"I told him the last time I had word of such a move was in a picture called \"Double Indemnity\" starring Barbara Stanwyck, which I called to his attention.\" In the movie, Stanwyck's character plotted her husband's murder. The couple were quickly divorced in October 1956. Barbara Barb later married Henry Hopkinson, 1st Baron Colyton.&lt;ref name=\"nytimes/deaths-colyton-lady-barbara\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\"I am so lucky, She doesn\u2019t want any alimony; she doesn\u2019t want any settlement. She just wants the rights to my cartoons.\"&lt;ref name=\"cracked/48320\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; - Charles Addams, 1956\nAddams was \"sociable and debonair\". A biographer described him as being \"a well-dressed, courtly man with silvery back-combed hair and a gentle manner, he bore no resemblance to a fiend\". Figuratively a \"ladykiller\", Addams accompanied women such as Greta Garbo, Joan Fontaine, and Jacqueline Kennedy on social occasions. For about a year after the death of Nelson Rockefeller, Addams dated Megan Marshack, the aide who was with the former US vice president when he died.\nAddams married his third and final wife Marilyn Matthews Miller, best known as \"Tee\" (1926\u20132002), in a pet cemetery. The Addamses moved to Sagaponack, New York, in 1985, where they named their estate \"The Swamp\".\nDeath.\nAddams died on September 29, 1988, at the age of 76, at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in New York City, having suffered a heart attack after parking his automobile. An ambulance took him from his apartment to the hospital, where he died in the emergency room. As he had requested, a wake was held rather than a funeral; he had wished to be remembered as a \"good cartoonist\". In accordance with Addams's wishes, he was cremated, and his ashes were interred in the pet cemetery of \"The Swamp\" estate.\nLegacy.\nThe Tee &amp; Charles Addams foundation was established in 1999 \"to interpret and share the artistic achievement of Charles Addams\u2019s life through exhibitions and programs developed from all works by Charles Addams including the Foundation\u2019s own collections and from its copyrights of the Addams oeuvre.\" Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the foundation offered tours of the couples' property and displayed artefacts from Addams' life.\nThe Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall in Philadelphia was named in his tribute by the University of Pennsylvania in 2001.\nOn the occasion of his 100th birthday, January 7, 2012, Charles Addams was honored with a Google Doodle.\nAddams was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2020.\nOn April 30, 2021, the original art for his macabre holiday illustration \"Addams and Evil\", a 1947 interior book cartoon from \"The Addams Family Christmas\", sold for $87,500, the author's world auction record, over seven times initial estimates.\nWorks.\nBooks of Addams's drawings or illustrated by him:\nAddams also illustrated two books by other authors. First was \"But Who Wakes the Bugler?\" (Houghton &amp; Mifflin, 1940) by Peter DeVries. The other was \"Afternoon In the Attic\" (Dodd, Mead, 1950) by John Kobler. He also provided the cover art for such books as \"The Compleat Practical Joker\" (Doubleday, 1953) by H. Allen Smith and \"Here at The New Yorker\" (Random House, 1975) by Brendan Gill.\nSee also.\nContemporary American cartoonists and American illustrators with similar macabre style include:\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

'Ali Muhammad of Shiraz). The B\u00e1b, an Iranian merchant-turned-prophet, professed that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible God who manifests His will in an unending series of theophanies, called Point () in B\u00e1b\u00ed terminology. The B\u00e1b's revelation, throughout which there was much evolution as he progressively outlined his teachings, was turbulent and short-lived and ended with his public execution in Tabriz in 1850. A campaign of extermination followed, in which thousands of followers were killed in what has been described as potentially one of the bloodiest actions of the Qajar Iranian military in the 19th century.\nAccording to current estimates, B\u00e1bism has no more than a few thousand adherents, most of whom are concentrated in Iran, but it has persisted into the modern era in the form of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, to which the majority of B\u00e1b\u00eds eventually converted.\nB\u00e1bism flourished in Iran until 1852, then lingered on in exile in the Ottoman Empire, especially Cyprus, as well as underground in Iran. An anomaly amongst Islamic messianic movements, the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement signaled a break with Shia Islam, beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. While B\u00e1bism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, whose followers consider the religion founded by the B\u00e1b as a predecessor to their own.\nEtymology.\nThe name B\u00e1b (lit.\u2009'Gate') is a reference to the gate to the Twelfth Imam.\n\"B\u00e1bism\", a term originating from Orientalists rather than the followers of the religion, comes from the Arabic noun \"gate\" (). Additionally, comes from the Semitic root \u0628 \u064a \u0646, which forms a class of words relating to concepts of clarity, differentiation, and separation, including , which can refer to explanation, commentary, or exposition as well as the branch of Arabic rhetoric dealing with metaphors and interpretation.\nHistory.\nAntecedents.\nTwelver Shia Muslims regard the Twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, as the last of the Imams. They contend that Muhammad al-Mahdi went into the Occultation in 874 CE, at which time communication between the Imam and the Muslim community could only be performed through mediators called ('gates') or ('representatives'). In 940, the fourth claimed that Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi had gone into an indefinite \"Major Occultation\", and that he would cease to communicate with the people. According to Twelver belief, the Hidden Imam is alive in the world, but in concealment from his enemies, and will only emerge shortly before the Last Judgment. At that time, acting as Qa'im Al Muhammad (\"He who will arise\"), a messianic figure also known as the Mahdi (\"He who is rightly guided\"), the Hidden Imam will start a holy war against evil, would defeat the unbelievers, and would start a reign of justice.\nIn 1830s Qajar Persia, Kazim Rashti was the leader of the Shaykhis, a sect of Twelvers. The Shaykhis were a group expecting the imminent appearance of al-Q\u0101\u02beim. At the time of Kazim's death in 1843, he had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Lord of the Age whose advent would soon break on the world.\nOrigin.\nOn 22 May 1844, Mull\u00e1 Husayn, of Boshruyeh in Khorasan, a prominent disciple of Sayyid K\u0101\u1e93im, entered Shiraz following the instruction by his master to search for al-Q\u0101'im. Soon after he arrived in Shiraz, Mull\u00e1 Husayn came into contact with the B\u00e1b. On the night of 22 May 1844, Mulla Husayn was invited by the B\u00e1b to his home; on that night Mull\u00e1 Husayn told him that he was searching for the possible successor to Sayyid K\u0101\u1e93im, al-Q\u0101'im, and the B\u00e1b told Mull\u00e1 Husayn privately that he was Sayyid K\u0101\u1e93im's successor and the bearer of divine knowledge. Through the night of the 22nd to dawn of the 23rd, Mull\u00e1 Husayn became the first to accept the B\u00e1b's claims as the gateway to Truth and the initiator of a new prophetic cycle; the B\u00e1b had replied in a satisfactory way to all of Mull\u00e1 Husayn's questions and had written in his presence, with extreme rapidity, a long commentary on the surah of Yusuf, which has come to be known as the Qayy\u016bmu l-Asm\u0101' and is often considered the B\u00e1b's first revealed work, though he had before then composed a commentary on Surat al-Fatihah and Surat al-Baqara. This night and the following day are observed in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith as a holy day since then.\nAfter Mull\u00e1 Husayn accepted the B\u00e1b's claim, the B\u00e1b ordered him to wait until 17 others had independently recognized the station of the B\u00e1b before they could begin teaching others about the new revelation.\nWithin five months, seventeen other disciples of Sayyid K\u0101\u1e93im had independently recognized the B\u00e1b as a Manifestation of God. Among them was one woman, Zarrin T\u0101j Baragh\u0101ni, a poet, who later received the name of T\u00e1hirih (the Pure). These 18 disciples were later to be known as the Letters of the Living and were given the task of spreading the new faith across Iran and Iraq. The B\u00e1b emphasized the spiritual station of these 18 individuals, who along with himself, made the first \"Unity\" of his religion.\nAfter his declaration, he soon assumed the title of the B\u00e1b. Within a few years the movement spread all over Iran, causing controversy. His claim was at first understood by some of the public at the time to be merely a reference to the Gate of the Hidden Im\u00e1m of Muhammad, but this understanding he publicly disclaimed. He later proclaimed himself, in the presence of the heir to the Throne of Persia and other notables, to be al-Q\u0101'im. In the B\u00e1b's writings, the B\u00e1b appears to identify himself as the gate () to Muhammad al-Mahdi and later he begins to explicitly proclaim his station as equivalent to that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God. Saiedi states the exalted identity the B\u00e1b was claiming was unmistakable, but due to the reception of the people, his writings appear to convey the impression that he is only the gate to the Hidden Twelfth Imam. To his circle of early believers, the B\u00e1b was equivocal about his exact status, gradually confiding in them that he was not merely a gate to the Hidden Imam, but the Manifestation of the Hidden Imam and al-Q\u0101'im himself. During his early meetings with Mull\u00e1 Husayn, the B\u00e1b described himself as the Master and the Promised One; he did not consider himself just Sayyid K\u0101\u1e93im Rashti's successor, but claimed a prophetic status, with a sense of deputyship delegated to him not just from the Hidden Imam, but from Divine authority. His early texts, such as the Commentary on the Sura of Yusuf, used Qur'anic language that implied divine authority and identified himself effectively with the Imam. When Mull\u0101 \u02bfAl\u012b Bas\u1e6d\u0101m\u012b, the second Letter of the Living, was put on trial in Baghdad for preaching about the B\u00e1b, the clerics studied the Commentary on the Sura of Yusuf, recognized in it a claim to divine revelation, and quoted from it extensively to prove that the author had made a messianic claim.\nSpread.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe B\u00e1b's message was disseminated by the Letters of the Living through Iran and southern Iraq. One of these initial activities was communicated to the West starting 8 January 1845 as an exchange of diplomatic reports concerning the fate of Mull\u00e1 \u02bfAli-e Bast\u0101mi, the second Letter. These were exchanges between Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet who wrote first to Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe. Followups continued until in 1846 he was sentenced by the Ottomans to serve in the naval shipyards at hard labor\u2014the Ottoman ruler refusing to banish him as it would be \"difficult to control his activities and prevent him spreading his false ideas.\" Separately each of the Letters and other early believers were sent on various missions to begin public presentations of the new religion. Indeed various activities the B\u00e1b initiated were devolved to various Letters of the Living like preaching activities and answering questions from the community. In particular, as these first public activities multiplied, opposition by the Islamic clergy arose and prompted the Governor of Shiraz to order the B\u00e1b's arrest. The B\u00e1b, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities. This series of events become the first public account of the new religion in the West when they were published 1 November 1845 in \"The Times\" of London. The story was also carried from 15 November by the \"Literary Gazette\" which was subsequently echoed widely. Meanwhile the B\u00e1b was placed under house arrest at the home of his uncle, and was restricted in his personal activities, until a cholera epidemic broke out in the city in September 1846.\nThe B\u00e1b was released and departed for Isfahan. There, many came to see him at the house of the im\u00e1m jum'ih, head of the local clergy, who became sympathetic. After an informal gathering where the B\u00e1b debated the local clergy and displayed his speed in producing instantaneous verses, his popularity soared. After the death of the Governor of Isfahan, Manouchehr Khan Gorji, an Iranian Georgian, who had become his supporter, pressure from the clergy of the province led to the Shah, Mohammad Shah Qajar, ordering the B\u00e1b to Tehran in January 1847. After spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, and before the B\u00e1b could meet the Shah, the Prime Minister sent the B\u00e1b to Tabriz in the northwestern corner of the country, and later Maku and Chehriq, where he was confined. During his confinement, he was said to have impressed his jailers with his patience and dignity. Communication between the B\u00e1b and his followers was not completely severed but was quite difficult, and more responsibilities were devolved to the \"Letters\" as he was not able to elucidate his teachings to the public. With B\u00e1b\u00ed teachings now mostly spread by his followers, they faced increasing persecution themselves.\nThe role played by T\u00e1hirih in Karbal\u0101\u02be was particularly significant. She began an effort of innovation in religion based on her station as a Letter of the Living and the incarnation of Fatimah. In his early teachings, the B\u00e1b emphasized observing sharia and extraordinary acts of piety. However, his claim of being the B\u00e1b, i.e. the authority direct from God, was in conflict with this more conservative position of supporting sharia. T\u00e1hirih innovated an advance in the understanding of the priority of the B\u00e1b's station above that of Islamic sharia by wedding the concept of the B\u00e1b's overriding religious authority with ideas originating in Shaykhism pointing to an age after outward conformity. She seems to have made this connection c.\u20091262/1846 even before the B\u00e1b himself. The matter was taken up by the community at large at the Conference of Badasht.\nThis conference was one of the most important events of the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement when in 1848 its split from Islam and Islamic law was made clear. Three key individuals who attended the conference were Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, Qudd\u00fas, and T\u00e1hirih. T\u00e1hirih, during the conference, was able to persuade many of the others about the B\u00e1b\u00ed split with Islam based on the station of the B\u00e1b and an age after outward conformity. She appeared at least once during the conference in public without a veil, heresy within the Islamic world of that day, signalling the split. During this same month the B\u00e1b was brought to trial in Tabriz and made his claim to be the Mahdi public to the Crown Prince and the Shi'a clergy.\nSeveral sources agree that by 1848 or 1850 there were 100,000 converts to Babism. In the fall of 1850 newspaper coverage fell behind quickly unfolding events. Though the B\u00e1b was named for the first time he had in fact already been executed.\nUprisings and massacres.\nBy 1848 the increased fervour of the B\u00e1b\u00eds and the clerical opposition had led to a number of confrontations between the B\u00e1b\u00eds and their government and clerical establishment. After the death of Mohammad Shah Qajar, the shah of Iran, a series of armed struggles and uprisings broke out in the country, including at Tabarsi. These confrontations all resulted in B\u00e1b\u00ed massacres; Bah\u00e1'\u00ed authors give an estimate of 20,000 B\u00e1b\u00eds killed from 1844 to present, with most of the deaths occurring during the first 20 years. The first major killings of B\u00e1b\u00eds recorded in history took place in Qazvin. Since then, attacks against the B\u00e1b\u00eds by prominent clerics and their followers became more common and some B\u00e1b\u00eds started to carry arms. In remote and isolated places the scattered B\u00e1b\u00eds were readily attacked and killed while in places where large numbers of them resided they acted in self-defense. One of these attacks occurred in Babol of Mazandaran which led to the death of several B\u00e1b\u00eds and their opponents, as well as an armed conflict between B\u00e1b\u00eds and their enemies in fort \u1e6cabars\u00ed. After that, two other big clashes between the B\u00e1b\u00eds and their opponents took place in the cities of Zanjan and Neyriz in the north and south of Iran, respectively, as well as a smaller conflict in Yazd. A total of several thousand B\u00e1b\u00eds were killed in these conflicts. In the three main conflicts in \u1e6cabars\u00ed, Zanjan and Neyriz, B\u00e1b\u00eds were accused by their enemies of revolting against the government. However, it seems unlikely that these actions were purely revolutionary. In all three cases, the battles that took place were of a defensive nature, and not considered an offensive jihad, as the B\u00e1b did not allow it and in the case of two urban conflicts (Neyriz and Zanjan), they were related to pre-existing social and political tensions within the towns. There is also no evidence of a coordinated plan of action. In mid-1850 a new prime-minister, Amir Kabir, was convinced that the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement was a threat and ordered the execution of the B\u00e1b which was followed by the killings of many B\u00e1b\u00eds.\nFort Tabarsi.\nOf the conflicts between the B\u00e1b\u00eds and the establishment, the first and best known took place in M\u0101zandar\u0101n at the remote shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi, about southeast of B\u0101rfarush (modern Babol). From October 1848 until May 1849, around 300 B\u00e1b\u00eds (later rising to 600), led by Qudd\u00fas and Mull\u00e1 Husayn, defended themselves against the attacks of local villagers and members of the Shah's army under the command of Prince Mahdi Qoli Mirza. They were, after being weakened through attrition and starvation, subdued through false promises of safety, and put to death or sold into slavery.\nZanjan upheaval.\nThe revolt at the fortress of \u02bfAli Mardan Khan in Zanjan in northwest Iran was by far the most violent of all the conflicts. It was headed by Mull\u0101 Muhammad 'Ali Zanjani, called Hujjat, and also lasted seven or eight months (May 1850\u2013January 1851). The B\u00e1b\u00ed community in the city had swelled to around 3,000 after the conversion of one of the town's religious leaders to the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement. The conflict was preceded by years of growing tension between the leading Islamic clergy and the new rising B\u00e1b\u00ed leadership. The city governor ordered that the city be divided into two sectors, with hostilities starting soon thereafter. The B\u00e1b\u00eds faced resistance against a large number of regular troops, and led to the death of several thousand B\u00e1b\u00eds. After Hujjat was killed, and the B\u00e1b\u00ed numbers being greatly reduced, the B\u00e1b\u00eds surrendered in January 1851 and were massacred by the army.\nNayriz upheaval.\nMeanwhile, a serious but less protracted struggle was waged against the government at Neyriz in Fars by Yahya Vahid Darabi of Nayriz. Vahid had converted around 1500 people in the community and had thus caused tensions with the authorities which led to an armed struggle in a nearby fort. The B\u00e1b\u00eds resisted attacks by the town's governor as well as further reinforcements. After being given a truce offer on 17 June 1850, Vahid told his followers to give up their positions, which led to Vahid and the B\u00e1b\u00eds being killed; the B\u00e1b\u00ed section of the town was also plundered, and the property of the remaining B\u00e1b\u00eds seized. Later, in March 1853 the governor of the city was killed by the B\u00e1b\u00eds. These further events led to a second armed conflict near the city where the B\u00e1b\u00eds once again resisted troop attacks until November 1853, when a massacre of B\u00e1b\u00eds happened, with their women being enslaved.\nAfter the execution of the B\u00e1b.\nThe revolts in Zanjan and Nayriz were in progress when in 1850 the B\u00e1b, with one of his disciples, was brought from his prison at Chehriq citadel, which was called , meaning 'mount extreme', by the B\u00e1b, to Tabriz and publicly shot in front of the citadel. The body, after being exposed for some days, was recovered by the B\u00e1b\u00eds and conveyed to a shrine near Tehran, whence it was ultimately removed to Haifa, where it is now enshrined.\nMost Western scholars who reviewed the Faith of the B\u00e1b after 1860 saw it as a way of letting in Western and Christian ideals into \"a closed and rigid Moslem system\" and gave the B\u00e1b himself sometimes less or more credit for being authentic in the process. However, some went further. In 1866 British diplomat Robert Grant Watson (1834\u20131892) published a history of the first 58 years of the 19th century of Persia and would serve in several diplomatic capacities. Watson summarizes the impact of the B\u00e1b in Persia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;B\u00e1bism, though at present a proscribed religion in Persia, is far from being extinct, or even declining, and the B\u00e1b may yet contest with Mahomed \"(sic)\" the privilege of being regarded as the real prophet of the faithful. B\u00e1bism in its infancy was the cause of a greater sensation than that even which was produced by the teaching of Jesus, if we may judge from the account of Josephus of the first days of Christianity.\nLatter commentators also noted these kinds of views: Ernest Renan, Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch, son of Charles Bulfinch, and others.\nFor the next two years comparatively little was heard of the B\u00e1b\u00eds. The B\u00e1b\u00eds became polarized with one group speaking of violent retribution against Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and the Qajar State, while the other, under the leadership of Baha'u'll\u00e1h, looked to reconsolidate the community, rebuild relationships with the government and advance the Bab\u00ed cause by persuasion and the example of virtuous living.\nThe militant group of B\u00e1b\u00eds was between thirty and seventy persons, only a small number of the total B\u00e1b\u00ed population of perhaps 100,000. Their meetings appear to have come under the control of a \"Husayn Jan\", an emotive and magnetic figure who obtained a high degree of personal devotion to himself from the group. Meanwhile, Tahirih and Baha'u'll\u00e1h, visible leaders of the community previously, were removed from the scene \u2013 Tahirih by arrest and in the case of Baha'u'll\u00e1h an 'invitation', by order of Amir Kabir, to go on pilgrimage to Karbila. On 15 August 1852, three from this small splinter group, acting on their own initiative, attempted to assassinate Naser al-Din Shah Qajar as he was returning from the chase to his palace at Niavar\u0101n. Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire B\u00e1b\u00ed community was blamed, and a mass slaughter of thousands of B\u00e1b\u00eds followed, starting on 31 August 1852 with some thirty B\u00e1b\u00eds, including T\u00e1hirih. Dr Jakob Eduard Polak, then the Shah's physician, was an eye-witness to her execution. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h surrendered himself and he along with a few others were imprisoned in the Si\u0101hch\u0101l ('Black Pit'), an underground dungeon in Tehran. Meanwhile, echoes of the newspaper coverage of the violence continued into 1853.\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed\u2013Azali split.\nIn most of his prominent writings, the B\u00e1b alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as \"He whom God shall make manifest\", and that he himself was \"but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest.\" Within 20 years of the B\u00e1b's death, over 25 people claimed to be the Promised One, most significantly Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.\nShortly before the B\u00e1b's execution, a follower of the B\u00e1b, Abd al-Karim, brought to the B\u00e1b's attention the necessity to appoint a successor; thus the B\u00e1b wrote a certain number of tablets which he gave to Abd al-Karim to deliver to Subh-i Azal and Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. These tablets were later interpreted by both Azalis and Bah\u00e1'\u00eds as proof of the B\u00e1b's delegation of leadership. 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 stated that the B\u00e1b did this at the suggestion of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. In one of the tablets, which is commonly referred to as the Will and Testament of the B\u00e1b, Subh-i Azal is viewed to have been appointed as leader of the B\u00e1b\u00eds after the death of the movement's founder. The tablet orders, in verse 27, orders Subh-i Azal \"...to obey Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest, and in verse 37 to \"protect yourself, then protect yourself, then protect what is revealed in the Bayan followed by what is revealed from your presence.\" At the time of the apparent appointment Subh-i Azal was still a teenager, had never demonstrated leadership in the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement, and was still living in the house of his older brother, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.\nSubh-i Azal's leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the B\u00e1b\u00ed community spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; and even went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the B\u00e1b on several occasions. Subh-i Azal gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the B\u00e1b\u00eds who started to give their alliance to other claimants. During the time that both Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h and Subh-i-Azal were in Baghdad, since Subh-i Azal remained in hiding, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h performed much of the daily administration of the B\u00e1b\u00ed affairs.\nBah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h claimed that in 1853, while a prisoner in Tehran, he was visited by a \"Maid of Heaven\", which symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. Ten years later in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration to be \"He whom God shall make manifest\" to a small number of followers, and in 1866 he made the claim public. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's claims threatened Subh-i Azal's position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the B\u00e1b\u00eds if \"Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest\" were to appear and start a new religion. Subh-i-Azal responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional B\u00e1bism was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority.\nEventually Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h was recognized by the vast majority of B\u00e1b\u00eds as \"He whom God shall make manifest\" and his followers began calling themselves Bah\u00e1'\u00eds. By 1908, there were probably from half a million to a million Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, and at most only a hundred followers of Subh-i Azal. According to Ali Raza Naqavi, B\u00e1bism and the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith are \"almost inseparable\" and have \"almost identical beliefs and doctrines.\" He writes that in the way Muslims view Judaism as having been abrogated by Christianity and Christianity as having been abrogated by Islam, Bah\u00e1'\u00eds view B\u00e1bism as having been abrogated and replaced by the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\nSubh-i Azal died in Famagusta, Cyprus in 1912, and his followers are known as Azalis or Azali B\u00e1bis. Denis MacEoin notes that after the deaths of those Azali Babis who were active in the Persian Constitutional Revolution, the Azali form of Babism entered a stagnation from which it has not recovered as there is no acknowledged leader or central organization.\nIn 2001, Azalis were estimated to number no more than a few thousand, living mainly in Iran.\nBeliefs and teachings.\nThe B\u00e1b's teachings can be grouped into three broad stages which each have a dominant thematic focus. His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the Quran and other Islamic traditions. While this interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to the philosophical elucidation and finally to legislative pronouncements. In the second philosophical stage, the B\u00e1b gives an explanation of the metaphysics of being and creation, and in the third legislative stage his mystical and historical principles are explicitly united. An analysis of the B\u00e1b's writings throughout the three stages shows that all of his teachings were animated by a common principle that had multiple dimensions and forms. \nThe teachings of the B\u00e1b give new meanings to the notions of God, religion, and prophets, and interprets religious concepts such as heaven and hell and resurrection accordingly. Progressive revelation, continuity and renewal of religion, improving the status of women, abolishing priesthood, and emphasizing on human nobility are among some of the important teachings of the B\u00e1b. Yet another fundamental focus of his teachings is his emphasis on the advent of a messianic figure that he frequently refers to as \"he whom God shall make manifest\". The B\u00e1b always discusses his own revelation and laws in the context of this promised figure. Unlike previous religions that the reference to promised figures were only occasional and in hints and allusions, the main focus of Bayan, the mother book of the B\u00e1b\u00ed dispensation, is preparing the way for \"he whom God shall make manifest\".\nGod and prophets.\nThe B\u00e1b emphasizes on the absolute transcendence of God and rejects any anthropomorphic conception of him. The B\u00e1b states that God is unknowable, indescribable, inaccessible to the world, but he reveals himself through prophets to humanity out of his love for them. This teaching of the B\u00e1b continue as a key principle of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. (see God in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith). It is through their recognition that God can be known and they are the supreme manifestations of God in the world. According to the writings of the B\u00e1b there is a unity among prophets of God. They resemble pure mirrors, that while being diverse, reflect the same sun (a metaphor for the one God) in themselves. The writings of the B\u00e1b emphasize that there is no end to the revelation of God, and new religions and prophets will appear forever throughout history.\nProgressive revelation.\nOne of the most fundamental teachings of the B\u00e1b is the continuity and evolution of religion. God gradually manifests himself to humanity through his prophets; and as humanity advances throughout history, divine teachings become more progressive and comprehensive. Each religion appears in response to the social needs of humanity at the time of its advent. It is more advanced compared to its predecessors, but its potential perfection is realized through the emergence of the next religion. According to this logic, no religion is the final religion.\nResurrection then according to the B\u00e1b is not the end of world, but the decline of the old religion and its revival in the form of a new revelation. The B\u00e1b uses the metaphor of seasons to further explains this cyclical progression. \"the tree of prophethood\" blossoms in the spring, gains strength in the summer, and reaches fruition in the fall, and finally dies in the winter. The tree however is reborn and revived in the following spring. The tree changes and grows over time yet it is the same tree throughout. This concept of prophetic renewal carries a sense of historical relativism in it and acknowledges historical change. It calls implicitly for human agency rather than prophetic finality and promotes a forward-looking perspective. The B\u00e1b thus promotes an indigenous notion of modernity which relies on historical progression rather than the sanctity of the past.\nAccording to the B\u00e1b, religion is a dialogical and relative phenomenon that is the product of the interaction of the will of God with the historical stage of the development of humanity. The B\u00e1b rejects the traditional concept of religion which portrays it as an absolute and eternally binding imposition of the will of God on humans. Religion is a dynamic and progressive reality similar to humanity. One of the most significant and central expressions of this dialectical and historical concept is the B\u00e1b's use of the term irtif\u00e1 () which carries two contradictory meaning; cancellation and elevation. Irtif\u00e1\u2018 conveys the same semantics as Hegel\u2019s Aufhebung (to elevate/abolish). According to the B\u00e1b, each new religion is an irtif\u00e1\u2018 of the previous religion. The new religion is the negation and abrogation of the previous religion, yet at the same it is the same previous religion, which appears in a higher, more elevated form.\nThis notion of continuity and renewal anticipates future prophetic revelations after the B\u00e1b. More specifically the B\u00e1b states that the essence and purpose of his own mission, as he always stresses, is to prepare the people for the advent of a yet greater messianic figure that appears after him which he refers to as \"he whom God shall make manifest\".\nAccording to the B\u00e1b, the word of God is alive and dynamic and wants to appear in its new form in conjunction with the evolution of mankind. He deeply regrets that religious traditionalists, out of their love for their divine book, prevent the evolution of the same book and reject its re-appearance in the next religious dispensation.\nResurrection, Judgment Day and cyclical revelation.\nThe B\u00e1b taught that his revelation was beginning an apocalyptic process that was bringing the Islamic dispensation to its cyclical end, and starting a new dispensation. He taught that the terms \"resurrection\", \"Judgement Day\", \"paradise\" and \"hell\" used in Shi\u02bba prophecies for the end-times are symbolic. He stated that \"Resurrection\" means that the appearance of a new revelation, and that \"raising of the dead\" means the spiritual awakening of those who have stepped away from true religion. He further stated that \"Judgement Day\" refers to when a new Manifestation of God comes, and the acceptance or rejection of those on the Earth. Thus the B\u00e1b taught that with his revelation the end times ended and the age of resurrection had started and that the end-times were symbolic as the end of the past prophetic cycle. The B\u00e1b wrote: \"Verily, the world and the hereafter are two spiritual states. If you turn towards God, exalted be He, then you are in paradise and if you are occupied with your self then you are in hell and in the world. Therefore understand these allusions.\"\nIn the Persian Bay\u00e1n, the B\u00e1b wrote that religious dispensations come in cycles, as the seasons, to renew \"pure religion\" for humanity. This notion of continuity anticipated future prophetic revelations after the B\u00e1b.\nHe whom God shall make manifest.\nOne of the core B\u00e1b\u00ed teachings is that a new prophet would soon come, whom the B\u00e1b termed He whom God shall make manifest (, ), a messianic figure that would complete the revelation that the B\u00e1b begun. The B\u00e1b describes this messianic figure as the origin of all divine attributes, and states that his command is equivalent to God's command. Unlike earlier religions in which references to future promised figures were occasional and only in hints and allusions, the entirety of the Bayan, the mother book of the B\u00e1b\u00ed dispensation, is essentially a discourse on a messianic figure, even greater than himself, that the B\u00e1b refers to as \"he Whom God shall make manifest\". The B\u00e1b always discusses his own revelation and laws in the context of this promised figure. The essence and purpose of the B\u00e1b's own mission, as he always stressed, was to prepare the people for the advent of him. He asks his followers to independently investigate and look for the promised one, and recognize him out of his own intrinsic reality, works and attributes, and not due to any reasons external to him. He even warns them not to be deprived of the promised one by arguing against him from the works of the B\u00e1b, the same way the followers of the previous religions opposed the next prophet while citing their holy scriptures. Furthermore, the B\u00e1b speaks of the imminence of the advent of the promised one and refers to the time of his advent as year nine and nineteen. After the B\u00e1b's execution in 1850, there were some B\u00e1bis who claimed to be \"He whom God shall make manifest\". Later in 1863, nineteen years after the declaration of the B\u00e1b, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h privately laid claim to be the messianic figure, and made his claim publicly in 1866\u20131868. His claim was by far the most successful. The majority of the B\u00e1bis followed him and later became known as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds. The Azalis (those Babis who did not accept Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h) objected to Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's statement.\nHuman nobility.\nThe B\u00e1b sees humans as noble beings who are endowed with the inherent capacity to think for themselves and, therefore, are obligated to engage in the independent investigation of truth. This means that no human being should be dependent on others to investigate the spiritual truth. Two major expressions of this idea are the B\u00e1b's abolishment of priesthood and his emphasis on the words of revelation, not miracles, as the valid evidence of the legitimacy of the claims of a prophet.\nThe writings of the B\u00e1b eliminated the institution of clergy and prohibited anyone from mounting the pulpit. He finds such ascent, as well as the seating of the people beneath a cleric, as an insult to the dignity of all human beings. He also prohibits congregational prayer, which requires following a clerical leader of the prayer. According to the B\u00e1b, the worship of God does not require human mediation. Even when the B\u00e1b makes an exception in the case of the congregational prayer for the dead, He emphasizes that no one should stand ahead of others. All must stand in equal rows to honor the deceased.\nAccording to the B\u00e1b, one of the main reasons for the corruption of religions in general is the clergy. The B\u00e1b also criticizes the practice of confessing sins to priests.\nOne of the central teachings of the B\u00e1b is that miracles, as the breaking of the laws of nature, has nothing to do with the mission of prophets, which is the spiritual and moral education of humanity. Therefore, miracles cannot prove the truth of prophethood. The B\u00e1b rejects Shia's obsessive preoccupation with miracles to foster rationalism, and remove superstition from religion. According to the B\u00e1b there is only one valid evidence for the legitimacy of a prophet, and that is the creative words of the prophet which address the needs of the time and bring a new culture, value system, and meaning to the lives of the people, transforms them and help them reach human perfection.\nImproving the status of women.\nMost contemporary accounts agree that one of the main social impacts of the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement was the improvement of the status of women. The B\u00e1b generally treats women and men equally in his laws. He specifically alleviates some of the burdens that Islamic law had laid upon women; e.g. by adding a twelve-month delay to divorce, he makes it more difficult, he discourages polygamy, and forbids concubinage, forced marriage, men having intercourse with their wife without her permission, and men unilaterally divorcing their wives. He relaxes severe restrictions on women\u2019s social intercourse, and orders men not to harm women. He orders men to treat women with the utmost love. On occasions, the B\u00e1b even gives women preference over men; for example, he sets a penalty for anyone who causes grief to another person, which he equates to causing grief to God, but he says that the penalty for causing grief to women is doubled.\nThe B\u00e1b teaches that, since God transcends the boundaries of male and female, God wishes that \"neither men exalt themselves over women, nor women exalt themselves over men\".\nIn one of his early works, the B\u00e1b states that everybody should treat women in \"the best way of kindness\", and wrote that harassing women, even to the extent of blinking an eye, is a violation of God's command.\nThe B\u00e1b encouraged the education of women and did not display a gender distinction in B\u00e1b\u00ed laws on education.\nIn addition to his writings, the B\u00e1b also showed that his religion wants to improve the situation of women by supporting his leading female disciple Tahereh. The B\u00e1b always praised Tahereh and approved of her activities that included her removing her hijab, advancing the claims of the B\u00e1b, and breaking the B\u00e1b\u00ed faith from Islam, even when some B\u00e1b\u00eds complained about them or opposed them. Shortly after the conference Badasht gathering, in which Tahereh played a central role, the B\u00e1b praised her in one of his writings and equated her to the totality of the remaining seventeen letters of the living. The letters of the living, which Tahereh is one of, are the first eighteen individuals who believed in the B\u00e1b, and for this reason, have the highest spiritual station in the dispensation of the B\u00e1b among his followers.\nThe teachings of the B\u00e1b on improving the status of women represented a significant departure from legal norms and social customs that were prevalent in parts of the Muslim world that have lingered even to the present day. Armin Eschraghi notes the context of 19th century Iran and that, \"Modern western readers might not appreciate the revolutionary potential\" of the teachings of B\u00e1b.\nThe Primal Will of God is personified as the female figure of the maid of heaven in the writings of the Bab.\nImportance of education.\nThe B\u00e1b emphasized rationality, science, and efficient education. Education has to be well organized and knowledge conveyed to children in a systematic way. According to the B\u00e1b, a progressive society is based on an efficient pedagogical approach, with well-organized schools. There are some key themes that must be thought about in the schools: ethical issues such as the importance of respect for other opinions and ideas; the relativity of spirituality; the methodology required to be free from past superstitions; the nobility of the role of humankind in the world civilization; and the promotion of respect and valuing the role of the women in the society. The B\u00e1b also considered natural sciences important, including biology, physics, and chemistry, as well as medicine. He proposed radical reform in the sphere of education. He recommended modernizing it by eliminating all obsolete themes such as Islamic law and religious logic. Moreover, he wanted to eliminate the use of complicated words and to make the language easier and less complicated.\nThe B\u00e1b encourages believers to be proactive in order to learn the sciences. In such a context, the B\u0101b recommended that teachers be attentive in their teaching methodology, recommending them to use kindness, patience, and particularly fantasy. The use of the game is fundamental in order to improve the learning process, The B\u00e1b says. He also recommended that teachers not use corporal punishment toward children. For this reason, The Bab devotes a part of his reflection on education to dissuading teachers from using violence toward the children. He recommended that teachers be very careful in their communication, as children\u2019s souls are very delicate and they can easily be hurt in their childhood, and this might influence their behavior in society in the future. The B\u0101b thus promotes discipline in schools but forbids the use of violence. He clearly states in the Arabic part of Bayan: \u201cDo not hit anyone, not ever.\u201d At the same time, The Bab recommends that children and pupils should be respectful of their teachers, who are very important in society. It is the teachers who teach the children how to read and write and for this reason they have an enormous role in the process of civilization. Moreover, the B\u0101b recommends that parents should educate their children with attention, teaching them kindness. According to the B\u0101b, the main purpose of civilization is peaceful cohabitation, and this can be reached only through the use of kindness and the spread of gentle manners in society.\nEthics.\nThe bulk of Persian Bayan elaborates on the basic ethical principle that, even if people wrong you, you must forgive them, do good to them, and behave toward them as God would when he gives grace to those who ungratefully repudiate Him. In short, they call for an inner spiritual transformation. One must be content with God, with the laws of God, with one's parents, and with oneself. The B\u00e1b calls for perfection and refinement in a variety of senses: in keeping rivers pure and unpolluted; in preserving the environment and not damaging the nature as it is the mirror of God; in producing crafts and goods of the highest quality; in building beautiful dwellings with doors high enough for even the tallest person to enter; in the creation of beautiful art; in bathing regularly; in wearing clean and spotless clothing; and in the spread of prosperity to all. He forbade causing grief and sadness to anyone and said this was \"doubly binding\" in the treatment of women, implying a new status of women in society. He also forbade the physical punishment and humiliation of children. The B\u00e1b saw all of these actions as expressions of the beauty and virtue of God in one's life and as forms of worship. He sought to spiritualize one's understanding of the world, including a symbolic description of time itself through the introduction of a calendar of nineteen months, each with nineteen days, with the days and months named after attributes of God. In short, the B\u00e1b sought to create an entirely new sort of community, one focused on unity, love, and service to others and one where there would be no role for violence, except perhaps occasionally in the restraint of criminals. According to the B\u00e1b, the main purpose of civilization is peaceful coexistence, and this can be reached only through the use of kindness and the spread of gentle manners in society.\nJack McLean, summarizing Nader Saiedi's analysis, writes that the B\u00e1b's writings \"foresee current global issues of crisis, such as the protection of the environment and the commodification of natural resources\". The B\u00e1b specifically calls for the absolute purity of water in the Bay\u00e1n and as all substances return to the inland water table and the oceans, this could easily be seen as a general law for the protection of the environment. The Arabic Bay\u00e1n also forbids the commodification of the four elements, earth, air, fire and water.\nThe B\u00e1b also foreshadowed later developments in media, by emphasizing the need for a rapid system of news communication, which would be available for all to access, no matter their wealth or social standing. He writes, regarding the news, that \"until such a system is made universal, its benefit will not reach those servants of the kingdom unless there come a time when it will be accessible to all the people. Although today the kings have their own special couriers, this is fruitless, for the poor are deprived of such a service.\"\nAesthetics and Spiritual Refinement.\nThe B\u00e1b also developed a distinct philosophy of aesthetics, which emphasized beauty and refinement (\"litafat\") as governing principles, not only for art but for our actions, and stressed the need to bring all things to their highest state of perfection, or paradise (\"itqan\"). Saiedi writes that, \"The Bab makes it clear that He wants His community to be the embodiment of perfection in all things. Furthermore, He defines beautification and excellence in art as the means of the spiritualization of the world.\" The B\u00e1b himself writes, using calligraphy as an example of a universal principle, \"Should he know of a higher degree of refinement and fail to manifest it upon that paper, he would deprive it of its paradise, and he would be held accountable, for why hast thou, despite the possession of the means, withheld the effusion of grace and favor?\"\nHidden Imam.\nIn Twelver Shi\u02bba Islamic belief there were twelve Imams, the last of whom, known as Imam Mahdi, communicated with his followers only through certain representatives. According to the Twelver's belief, after the last of these representatives died, the Imam Mahdi went into a state of Occultation; while still alive, he was no longer accessible to his believers. Shi\u02bba Muslims believe that when the world becomes oppressed, the Imam Mahdi (also termed the Qa'im) will come out of occultation and restore true religion on Earth before the cataclysmic end of the world and judgement day.\nIn B\u00e1b\u00ed belief the B\u00e1b is the return of the Imam Mahdi, but the doctrine of the Occultation is implicitly denied; instead the B\u00e1b stated that his manifestation was a symbolic return of the Imam, and not the physical reappearance of the Imam Mahdi who had died a thousand years earlier. In B\u00e1b\u00ed belief the statements made from previous revelations regarding the Imam Mahdi were set forth in symbols. The B\u00e1b also stated that he was not only the fulfillment of the Shi\u02bbi expectations for the Q\u00e1'im, but that he also was the beginning of a new prophetic dispensation.\nReligious law.\nThe B\u00e1b abrogated Islamic law and in the \"Persian Bay\u00e1n\" promulgated a system of B\u00e1b\u00ed law, thus establishing a separate religion distinct from Islam. Some of the new laws included changing the direction of the Qibla to the B\u00e1b's house in Shiraz, Iran and changing the calendar to a solar calendar of nineteen months and nineteen days (which became the basis of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calendar) and prescribing the last month as a month of fasting. The Bab also prohibits confession and seeking forgiveness from anyone but God and His Manifestation.\nIn many respects, the B\u00e1b raised the status of women in his teachings. The B\u00e1b taught that, since God transcends the boundaries of male and female, God wishes that \"neither men exalt themselves over women, nor women exalt themselves over men.\" He instructs his followers to not mistreat women \"even for the blink of an eye\" and sets the penalty for causing grief to women as double that of causing grief to men. (Persian Bay\u0101n 7:18) He also encourages the education of women and does not display a gender distinction in B\u00e1bi laws on education. Armin Eschraghi notes the context of 19th century Iran and that, \"Modern western readers might not appreciate the revolutionary potential\" of the B\u00e1b's teaching that \"Those who have been brought up in this community, men and women, are allowed to look [at each other], speak and sit together.\" The Primal Will of God is also personified as the female figure of the Maid of Heaven. The B\u00e1b also foreshadowed later developments in media, by emphasising the need for a rapid system of news communication, which would be available for all to access, no matter their wealth or social standing. He writes, regarding the news, that \"until such a system is made universal, its benefit will not reach those servants of the kingdom unless there come a time when it will be accessible to all the people. Although today the kings have their own special couriers, this is fruitless, for the poor are deprived of such a service.\" Commenting on the extremes of wealth and poverty in society, the B\u00e1b also teaches that the true station of the rich should be as \"the depositories of God\" and enjoins generosity and charity. He says, \"Should ye find one stricken with poverty, enrich him to the extent of your ability ... should ye find one who is in distress, bring him tranquility by any means in your power.\"\nJack McLean, summarizing Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scholar Nader Saiedi's analysis, writes that \"the B\u00e1b's writings even foresee current global issues of crisis, such as the protection of the environment and the commodification of natural resources.\" The B\u00e1b specifically calls for the absolute purity of water (Bay\u00e1n 6:2). It may be easily deduced from this injunction that the environment must not be polluted since all substances return to the inland water table and the oceans. The Arabic Bay\u00e1n (9:11) also forbids the commodification of the four elements, earth, air, fire and water.\nThe B\u00e1b also created a large number of other rituals, rites and laws. Some of these include the carrying of arms only in times of necessity, abstaining from smoking tobacco, the obligatory sitting on chairs, the advocating of the cleanliness displayed by Christians, the non-cruel treatment of animals, the prohibition of beating children severely, the recommendation of the printing of books, even scripture and the prohibition on the study of logic or dead languages, and abolishment of priesthood. Other laws include elaborate regulations regarding pilgrimage, fasting, the manufacture of rings, the use of perfume, and the washing and disposal of the dead.\nNader Saiedi states that the severe laws of the Bay\u00e1n were never meant to be put in practice, because their implementation depended on the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest, while at the same time all of the laws would be abrogated unless the Promised One would reaffirm them. Saiedi concludes that these can then only have a strategic and symbolic meaning, and were meant to break through traditions and to focus the B\u00e1b's followers on obedience to He whom God shall make manifest.\nWritings.\nThe B\u00e1b affirms that the verses revealed by a Manifestation of God are the greatest proof of His mission and the writings of the B\u00e1b comprise over two thousand tablets, epistles, prayers, and philosophical treatises. These writings form part of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scripture, particularly his prayers, which are often recited individually as well as in devotional gatherings. \nThe B\u00e1b's major writings include the Qayy\u00famu'l-Asm\u00e1\u02bc (a commentary on the Sura of Joseph), and the Persian Bay\u00e1n, which the B\u00e1b\u00eds saw as superseding the Qur\u02bcan. The latter has been translated into French; only portions exist in English.\nThe works of the B\u00e1b have also excited scholarly interest and analysis. Elham Afnan describes the writings of the B\u00e1b as having \"restructured the thoughts of their readers, so that they could break free from the chains of obsolete beliefs and inherited customs\". Jack McLean notes the novel symbolism of the B\u00e1b's works, observing that \"The universe of the B\u00e1b's sacred writings is pervasively symbolic. Numbers, colors, minerals, liquids, the human body, social relationships, gestures, deeds, language (letters and words), and nature itself are all mirrors or signs that reflect the profounder reality of the names and attributes (asm\u00e1 va sif\u00e1t) of God\". Todd Lawson similarly identifies in the commentaries of the B\u00e1b an assertion of \"the potential and ultimate meaningfulness of all created things, from the highest to the lowest.\" The B\u00e1b's works are characterised by linguistic innovation, including many neologisms whenever He found existing theological terms inadequate. Several scholars have identified the continual repetition of particular words or phrases of religious importance to be a distinct feature throughout the Bab's writings. John Walbridge views the \"unquestionably hypnotic\" use of repetition in the Bab's Kitab-i-Panj Sha'n, where \"the same evocative words are repeated ceaselessly\" with gradual variations over time, as anticipating a minimalist aesthetic as well as possibly prefiguring the modernist style of Finnegans Wake. The B\u00e1b himself categorised his writings into five modes: divine verses, prayers, commentaries, rational discourse \u2013 written in Arabic \u2013 and the Persian mode, which encompasses the previous four. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scholars have argued that there are commonalities between the B\u00e1b's writings and those of Western philosophers such as Hegel, Kant and James Joyce.\nMost of the writings of the B\u00e1b have been lost. The B\u00e1b himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qur\u02bcan, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of text. Nab\u00edl-i-Zarand\u00ed, in \"The Dawn-Breakers\", mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qur\u02bcan, revealed during the B\u00e1b's imprisonment at M\u00e1h-K\u00fa, which have been lost without a trace. Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, as already noted, is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the B\u00e1b's major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted secretaries.\nMost works were revealed in response to specific questions by B\u00e1b\u00eds. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been a venerable medium for composing authoritative texts as far back as Paul of Tarsus. Three-quarters of the chapters of the New Testament are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within them. Sometimes the B\u00e1b revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and witnesses.\nThe Archives Department at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre currently holds about 190 Tablets of the B\u00e1b. Excerpts from several principal works have been published in an English language compilation of the B\u00e1b's writings: \"Selections from the Writings of the B\u00e1b\", other publications include \"\". Denis MacEoin, in his \"Sources for Early B\u0101b\u012b Doctrine and History\", gives a description of many works; much of the following summary is derived from that source. In addition to major works, the B\u00e1b revealed numerous letters to his wife and followers, many prayers for various purposes, numerous commentaries on verses or chapters of the Qur\u02bcan, and many khutbihs or sermons (most of which were never delivered). Many of these have been lost; others have survived in compilations.\nAlso significant to B\u00e1bism are the writings of Qudd\u00fas, which \"display a close similarity to that of the B\u00e1b in both form and content\" according to Moojan Momen and Todd Lawson, as well as the poetry and prose of Tahirih.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEncyclopedias.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution:"}
{"id": "55495", "revid": "14264656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55495", "title": "Miller's Crossing", "text": "1990 film by the Coen brothers\nMiller's Crossing is a 1990 American neo-noir gangster film written, directed and produced by Joel and Ethan Coen, and starring Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Jon Polito, J. E. Freeman, and Albert Finney. The plot concerns a power struggle between two rival gangs and how the protagonist, Tom Reagan (Byrne), plays both sides against each other.\nIn 2005, \"Time\" chose \"Miller's Crossing\" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical. \"Time\" critic Richard Corliss called it a \"noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest\".\nPlot.\nIn 1929, Tom Reagan is the right-hand man for Irish mobster Leo O'Bannon, a political boss who runs an unnamed U.S. city during Prohibition. Leo sets off a mob war when he extends protection to his girlfriend Verna's brother, a bookie named Bernie Bernbaum, who is skimming off the match fixing scheme of Leo's rival, the Italian gangster Johnny Caspar. The situation is further complicated by the fact that behind Leo's back, Verna is also sleeping with Tom.\nDespite his own relationship with Verna, Tom presses Leo to give up her brother to Caspar. When the war heats up, with an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom tries to persuade Leo that he is foolish to protect Bernie on Verna's behalf, making the point by revealing his affair with her. Leo publicly beats Tom and cuts ties with both him and Verna.\nCast out and needing work, Tom turns to Caspar. As a loyalty test, Caspar commands Tom to kill Bernie, an awkward request given Tom's relationship with Bernie's sister. With Caspar's henchmen in tow, Tom leads Bernie to his execution in the woods at a spot called Miller's Crossing. Bernie grovels for his life and desperately begs Tom not to kill him. Tom fakes the killing by firing his gun into the ground and orders Bernie to leave town. Caspar's henchmen, who are within earshot but cannot see the two men, are fooled and neglect to check for the body before leaving with Tom.\nWith Leo weakened, Caspar takes his place as city boss, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo's operations.\nWithin Caspar's gang, there is tension between Tom and Caspar's trusted enforcer, the brutal Eddie Dane (\"the Dane\"). Upon learning that his men did not actually see Tom kill Bernie, the Dane takes Tom back to Miller's Crossing to verify that Bernie's body is there. Tom expects to find no corpse and to be executed for it, but instead the group finds a decomposing body that had been shot in the face and disfigured beyond recognition by birds. The Dane and his men assume the body is that of Bernie, but it is actually that of the Dane's lover Mink, whom Bernie had secretly killed and placed as a decoy where his own body should have been. Tom is now vulnerable if the Dane or Caspar discovers the identity of the body, a fact that Bernie uses in an attempt to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar.\nWith Bernie supposedly dead, someone continues to cut into Caspar's match fix, and Tom and the Dane each try to convince Caspar that the other is behind it. Tom uses Mink's sudden disappearance to sow suspicion about the Dane by insinuating that Mink has gone into hiding after he and the Dane betrayed Caspar. Caspar must decide between Tom and the Dane, a dilemma he resolves by shooting the Dane in the head as Tom looks on.\nTom then thins out his rivals by engineering a surprise meeting between Bernie and Caspar, knowing that the first one to be seen by the other is likely to be killed. Shortly after the arranged time, Tom arrives to discover that Bernie has killed Caspar. Tom tricks Bernie into surrendering his gun and declares his intent to kill him in retribution for his blackmail. Bernie again begs for mercy, but Tom rejects his plea and shoots him dead.\nWith Caspar and the Dane dead, Leo resumes his post as the only boss in town. At Bernie's burial, Verna, now back in Leo's good graces, reacts coldly to Tom and walks back to her car. Leo notifies Tom that Verna has proposed to marry him. He offers Tom his job back but Tom turns him down and stays behind, watching Leo as he walks away.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan\nProduction.\nWhile writing the screenplay, the Coen brothers tentatively titled the film \"The Bighead\"\u2014their nickname for Tom Reagan. The first image they conceived was that of a black hat coming to rest in a forest clearing; then, a gust of wind lifts it into the air, sending it flying down an avenue of trees. This image closes the film's opening credit sequence.\nBecause of the intricate, dense plot, the Coens suffered from writer's block with the script. They stayed with a close friend of theirs at the time, William Preston Robertson in Saint Paul, Minnesota, hoping that a change of scenery might help. After watching the romantic comedy \"Baby Boom\" one night, they returned to New York City and wrote \"Barton Fink\" (in three weeks) before resuming the \"Miller's Crossing\" screenplay.\nThe budget was reported by film industry magazines as around $14 million, but the Coens have said that the film cost \"substantially less\" than that. According to Paul Coughlin, \"The casting of Byrne allows for the psychological assurance, self-confidence and icy demeanour to be physically reproduced in the sturdy and unruffled presence of the tall and lean actor. Tom is 'a man who walks behind a man, whispers in his ear', he is the brains behind Leo's operation, and he is the heartless centre of \"Miller's Crossing\".\" Although Byrne was a native Irishman playing a lieutenant to an Irish mobster, the Coens did not originally want him to use his own accent in the film. Byrne argued that his dialogue was structured in such a way that it was a good fit for his accent, and after he tried it the Coens agreed.\nDuring casting they had envisioned Trey Wilson (who played Nathan Arizona in their previous film \"Raising Arizona\") as gangster boss Leo O'Bannon, but two days before principal photography began, Wilson died from a brain hemorrhage and Finney was cast. Roger Westcombe calls Finney's portrayal of Leo \"perfectly nuanced in a brilliant performance\". Finney also appears in a cameo, as an elderly female ladies' room attendant.\nThe Coens cast family and friends in minor roles. Director Sam Raimi \u2013 a friend of the Coens \u2013 appears as the snickering gunman at the siege of the Sons of Erin social club, while Frances McDormand \u2013 Joel's wife \u2013 appears as the mayor's secretary. The role of The Swede was written for Peter Stormare, but he was busy playing Hamlet (a role often referred to as \"The Dane\"). J. E. Freeman was cast and the name of the character was changed to The Dane, while Stormare went on to be featured in \"Fargo\" and \"The Big Lebowski\".\nThe city in which the story takes place is unidentified but the film was shot in New Orleans, as the Coen Brothers were attracted to its look. Ethan Coen commented in an interview, \"There are whole neighborhoods here of nothing but 1929 architecture. New Orleans is sort of a depressed city; it hasn't been gentrified. There's a lot of architecture that hasn't been touched, store-front windows that haven't been replaced in the last sixty years.\" Principal photography ran from January 27 to April 28, 1989.\nInfluences.\nChristopher Orr sees the opening scene, in which Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) confronts Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney) and Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) as \"an obvious nod to the opening of \"The Godfather\"\".\nRoger Westcombe finds the title sequence of a fedora being blown off its bed of fallen leaves in the forest to be a subtle homage to Jean-Pierre Melville's crime film \"Le Doulos\" (1962), which ends with the gangster protagonist's fate underlined wistfully by the shot of his fedora coming to rest, alone in the frame, in the soil of the forest floor.\n\"Miller's Crossing\" quotes many gangster films and films noir. Many situations, characters and dialogue are derived from the work of Dashiell Hammett, particularly his 1931 novel \"The Glass Key\". There are some parallels between the two stories and many scenes and lines are lifted from this novel. The relationship between Tom and Leo in the film mirrors the relationship between Ned Beaumont and Paul Madvig, the principal characters of the Hammett novel. Another important Hammett source was his 1929 novel \"Red Harvest\", which details the story of a gang war in a corrupt Prohibition-era American city, a war initiated by the machinations of the main character. While \"Miller's Crossing\" follows the plot and main characters of \"The Glass Key\" fairly closely, the film has no direct scenes, characters, or dialogue from \"Red Harvest\" except for using a fixed boxing fight as a plot device.\nOrr also notes, \"The ending of \"Miller's Crossing\" makes even clearer reference to the immaculate final scene of \"The Third Man\": a funeral, a protagonist abandoned by his car, who watches as the last person he cares for in the world walks away down a dirt road hemmed by trees\".\nReception and legacy.\n\"Miller's Crossing\" opened in limited release in New York City on September 22, 1990, after premiering at the New York Film Festival the day before. It was a box-office failure at the time, making slightly more than $5 million, out of its $10\u2013$14 million budget. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though possibly more notable for its distinctive style than an airtight story, this Coen brothers' take on the classic gangster flick features sharp dialogue, impressive cinematography, and a typically quirky cast of characters.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C-\" on an A+ to F scale.\nFilm critic David Thomson calls the film \"a superb, languid fantasia on the theme of the gangster film that repays endless viewing\". Of Turturro's performance he says, \"This could be the finest work of one of our best supporting actors\". Roger Ebert gave it 3/4 stars, stating, \"It is likely to be most appreciated by movie lovers who will enjoy its resonance with films of the past.\" \"Miller's Crossing\" won the Critic's Award at the 2nd Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1991. It was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.\n\"The Sopranos\" pays homage to \"Miller's Crossing\", particularly in the \"Pine Barrens\" episode. Frank Moraes says, \"Gabriel Byrne does an excellent job in this film, ... this film lives and dies on his performance\". Taking particular note of the work of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld and production designer Dennis Gassner, Christopher Orr observed, \"Miller's Crossing is an aesthetic pleasure of the highest order on nearly every level\". \"Time\" and \"Total Film\" placed it in their top 100 list. In 2010, \"The Guardian\" called it the 24th best crime movie of all time.\nSoundtrack.\nThe score was written by Carter Burwell, his third collaboration with the Coen brothers. The main theme is based on the Irish folk ballad \"Lament for Limerick\". Burwell takes a traditional piece of music with some culturally relevant connection and uses it as the central motif of the broader arrangement. The main theme has been utilized in trailers for a number of other films, including \"The Shawshank Redemption\", as well as in an ad for Caffrey's Irish Ale.\nThe soundtrack includes jazz tunes, such as \"King Porter Stomp\", reflective of the era in which the film is set. Other songs include \"Danny Boy\", sung by Frank Patterson, an Irish tenor, which is heard in Leo's house. Patterson can also be heard singing Jimmy Campbell's \"Goodnight Sweetheart\" in a scene in the Shenandoah Club.\nSee also.\nTwo other gangster films released in the same year as \"Miller's Crossing\":\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
