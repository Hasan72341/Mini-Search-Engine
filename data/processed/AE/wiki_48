Unlike the Indo-European languages spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Swedish and Norwegian, which are North Germanic languages, or Russian, which is a Slavic language, Finnish is a Uralic language of the Finnic languages group. Typologically, Finnish is agglutinative. As in some other Uralic languages, Finnish has vowel harmony, and like other Finnic languages, it has consonant gradation.\nPronouns.\nThe pronouns are inflected in the Finnish language much in the same way that their referent nouns are.\nPersonal pronouns.\nPersonal pronouns are used to refer to human beings only. In Finnish all personal pronouns are gender-neutral and the English \"she\" and \"he\" can't be translated directly. Personal pronouns in Standard Finnish in the nominative case are listed in the following table:\nBecause Finnish verbs are inflected for person and number, in Finnish standard language subject pronouns are not required, and the first and second-person pronouns are usually omitted except when used for emphasis. In the third person, however, the pronoun is required: '(s)he goes'/'they go (singular they)'. In spoken Finnish, all pronouns are generally used, even without emphatic meaning.\nIn colloquial Finnish, the inanimate pronouns and are very commonly used in place of the singular and plural animate third-person pronouns, respectively. Use of and is mostly restricted to writing and formal or markedly polite speech as this clear distinction has never occurred naturally in the language. Do note the animals are marked as less animate and are therefore never referred to as or . and are usually replaced with colloquial forms. The most common variants are and , though, in some dialects and , and or and are used. On the other hand, , and lack reduced colloquial forms, so variants such as , , and of some eastern varieties are dialectal. Some common verbs, such as \"to be\" and \"to come\", exhibit similarly reduced colloquial forms:\nThe second-person plural can be used as a polite form when addressing one person, as in some Indo-European languages. However, this usage is diminishing in Finnish society.\nDemonstrative pronouns.\nThe demonstratives are used of non-human animate entities and inanimate objects. However, and is often used to refer to humans in colloquial Finnish. (This usage is quite correct in a demonstrative sense, i.e. when qualified by the relative pronoun , and in fact, it is hypercorrect to replace a demonstrative or with or just because the antecedent is human.) Furthermore, the demonstratives are used to refer to group nouns and the number of the pronoun must correlate with the number of its referent.\nInterrogative pronouns.\n is now archaic, but its inflected forms are used instead of those of : instead of (\"whom\"): \"Whom do you love?\"\nIndefinite pronouns.\nA large group that entails all of the pronouns that do not fall into any of the categories above. Notice that there are no negative pronouns, such as \"nobody\"; rather, the positive pronoun is negated with the negative verb . No double negatives are possible.\nEach pronoun declines. However, the endings and are clitics, and case endings are placed before them, e.g. \"any\", \"from any\". There are irregular nominatives. As indicated, is an irregular nominative; the regular root is with , e.g. \"(not) anyone\", \"from (not) anyone\".\nEnglish lacks a direct equivalent to the pronoun ; it would be \"that-th\", or \"which-th\" for questions. For example, \"The reward depends on \"as-which-th\" one comes to the finish\", or explicitly \"The reward depends on in which position one comes to the finish\". It would be difficult to translate the question , but, although far from proper English, the question \"How manyeth\" may give an English-speaking person an idea of the meaning.\nSome indefinite adjectives are often perceived as indefinite pronouns. These include:\nNouns.\nFinnish does not have grammatical gender, not even in personal pronouns: is 'he'or'she' depending on the referent. There are no articles, neither definite nor indefinite.\nCases.\nFinnish has fifteen noun cases: four grammatical cases, six locative cases, two essive cases (three in some Eastern dialects), and three marginal cases. \nSome notes about the cases listed in the table above:\nRelationship between locative cases.\nAs in many other Uralic languages, locative cases in Finnish can be classified according to three criteria: the spatial position (interior or surface), the motion status (stationary or moving), and within the latter, the direction of the movement (approaching or departing). The classification captures a morphophonological pattern that distinguishes interior and surface spatial position; long consonants ( in / and in / ) express stationary motion, whereas a expresses \"movement from\". The table below shows these relationships schematically: \nPlurals.\nFinnish nominal plurals are often marked by (though is a suppletive variant in the nominative and accusative, as is common in Uralic languages). Singular and plural numbers cross-cut the distinctions in grammatical cases, and several number/case combinations have somewhat idiosyncratic uses. Several of these deserve special mention.\nNominative/accusative plural.\nThe nominative plural is used for definite count nouns that are subjects, while the plural object of a telic verb bears the accusative plural. The syncretic suffix that covers both uses is . This suffix can only appear in the word-final position; i.e. it is omitted when a possessive suffix is present.\nNumerals.\nWhen a noun is modified by a numeral not equal to one, and the numeral is in the nominative singular, the noun bears the partitive singular. Otherwise, the noun and the numeral agree with each other in number and case.\nInflected plural.\nThis uses the stem of the partitive plural inflected with the same set of endings as for singular nouns. The suffix is , and it suppresses long vowels; it may only appear before another suffix.\nAs a combined example of plurals\nInflection of pronouns.\nThe personal pronouns are inflected in the same way as nouns, and can be found in most of the same cases as nouns. For example:\nNoun/adjective stem types.\nThe stem of a word is the part to which inflectional endings are affixed. For most noun and adjective types, the nominative case is identical to the basic stem (the nominative is unmarked).\nVowel stems.\nA word with a vowel stem is one that ends in a vowel in the nominative, and retains a final vowel in all forms. The stem vowel can however change in certain inflected forms:\nThe change of original (pre-Proto-Finnic) final \"*e\" to means that the stem vowel of a word ending in cannot be determined from the nominative alone; one of the inflected forms must be consulted. However, most old inherited words ending in decline as \"e\"-stems (or consonants stems, see below), while modern loans, where frequently is added for phonotactic reasons (as in the case of ), always decline as \"i\"-stems.\nConsonant stems.\nA word with a consonant stem is one where case suffixes can in some cases be affixed directly after the last consonant for at least some forms. Words with consonant stems come in three broad classes.\nThe first class of consonant-stem words largely resemble \"e\"-stems, but allow elision of the stem vowel in the partitive singular, and for certain words, plural genitive. In the later case, this involves a special allomorph , employing the plural marker rather than /.\nThe final consonant in words of this class must be one of \"h, l, m, n, r, s, t\". Other remarks for \"e\"-stem words still apply.\nWords of this type may have somewhat irregular declension due to additional historical changes:\nFor some words of this type, modern Finnish displays a tendency of development from consonant-stems to e-stems. For example, the partitive singular of the word \"bird cherry\" may be (consonant stem) or (vowel stem).\nAnother class of consonant-stem words end in a consonant even in the nominative; if a stem vowel is required for phonotactic reasons, \"e\" again appears. In Modern Finnish, only dental and alveolar consonants /l n r s t/) occur word-finally but previously words ending in /\u0283~\u0282 h k m/ were possible as well.\nNouns ending in \"-s\".\nVocalization or lenition is found in addition to any possible consonant gradation, e.g. (nominative) ~ (genitive), or ~ . The illatives are marked thus: , .\n\"-nen\" nouns.\nThis is a very large class of words which includes common nouns (for example 'woman'), many proper names, and many common adjectives. Adding to a noun is a very productive mechanism for creating adjectives ( 'dirt, filth' \u2192 'dirty'; 'joy' \u2192 'merry, happy'; 'plastic' \u2192 'made of plastic'/'plastic-like' ). It can also function as a diminutive ending.\nThe form behaves as if it ended in , with the exception of the nominative, where it is . Thus, the stem for these words removes the and adds after which the inflectional ending is added:\nHere are some of the diminutive forms that are in use:\nA special class of Finnish nouns in -nen are surnames. Some of these are very old and often their original meaning is not readily apparent to a modern speaker. Many were later coined on the -nen pattern and these often have the suffix added to a word meaning a natural feature. Some representative examples are:\nThe suffix also occurs in place-names. Many place-names ending with assume a plural form when inflected. For instance, the illative of is instead of singular .\n\"-e\" nouns.\nMost present-day -e nouns derive from older *-eh (&lt;*-e\u0161) or *-ek stems in which the consonant has been lost, which also explains why words in this class behave differently from the -i/-e class, which underwent word-final vowel raising in the nominative singular, such as *\"saare &gt; \"saari ('island') but \"saaren\", \"saarella, etc.\" ('island's', 'on the island'). Class -e word-final consonant does not survive in any form of the paradigm, although the existence of a consonant is still seen in that the nominative singular form (citation form) shows weak gradation, and strong grade vowel stem to which most case suffixes are applied. \nE-stem words have an additional e in the inflected stem: 'family' (&lt; *\"pereh\" via metathesis), but , so , , etc.; which represents the historical loss of a medial consonant. \nHowever, in some dialects, the much older *-\u0161 and *-k stems have shifted to and instead, for instance in Pohjanmaa dialect *wene\u0161 &gt; \"venes\" for standard \"vene\" ('boat') and *kast\u00ebk &gt; \"kastet\" for standard \"kaste\" ('dew').\nThe partitive stem behaves yet differently due to a loss of word-medial -e- in some contexts before the change from *-k- to *-h- took place, in which the consonant has been assimilated to a before it occurred in the context for being lost. Other case endings are suffixed to the strong grade/vowel stem.\nMore of this phenomenon is discussed in Finnish Phonology: Sandhi.\nAdjectives.\nAdjectives in Finnish are inflected in exactly the same way as nouns, and an adjective must agree in number and case with the noun it is modifying.\nFor example, here are some adjectives:\nAnd here are some examples of adjectives inflected to agree with nouns:\nNotice that the adjectives undergo the same sorts of stem changes when they are inflected as nouns do.\nComparative formation.\nThe comparative of the adjective is formed by adding to the inflecting stem. For example:\nSince the comparative adjective is still an adjective, it must be inflected to agree with the noun it modifies. To make the inflecting stem of the comparative, the ending loses its final \"i\". If the syllable context calls for a weak consonant, the becomes . Then is added before the actual case ending (or in plural). This should become clear with a few examples:\nSuperlative formation.\nThe superlative of the adjective is formed by adding to the inflecting stem. For example:\nNote that because the superlative marker vowel is , the same kind of changes can occur with vowel stems as happen in verb imperfects, and noun inflecting plurals:\nSince the superlative adjective is still an adjective, it must be inflected to agree with the noun it modifies. The becomes either or (plural or ) depending on whether the syllable context calls for a weak or strong consonant. Here are the examples:\nIrregular forms.\nThe most important irregular form is:\nThe form \"good\" is not found in standard Finnish, but can be found in the Southern Ostrobothnian dialect.\nNotice also:\nThere are a small number of other irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as:\nWhere the inflecting stem is but the superlative is = 'newest'.\nAdpositions.\nPostpositions are more common in Finnish than prepositions. Both postpositions and prepositions can be combined with either a noun or a possessive suffix to form a postpositional phrase.\nPostpositions.\nPostpositions indicate place, time, cause, consequence or relation. In postpositional phrases the noun is usually in genitive:\nThe noun (or pronoun) can be omitted when there is a possessive suffix:\nAs with verbs, the pronoun cannot be omitted in the third person (singular or plural):\n \"I was with you\"\nbut \"I was with him/her\"\n \"I will come with you (plural or polite)\"\nbut \"I will come with them\"\nPrepositions.\nThere are few important prepositions in Finnish. In prepositional phrases the noun is always in the partitive:\nSome postpositions can also be used as prepositions:\nUsing postpositions as prepositions is not strictly incorrect and occurs in poetry, as in, for example, the song \"\" \"under a maple tree\", instead the usual .\nVerbs.\nFinnish verbs are usually divided into seven groups depending on the stem type. All seven types have the same set of endings, but the stems undergo (slightly) different changes when inflected.\nThere are very few irregular verbs in Finnish. In fact, only = 'to be' has two irregular forms \"is\" and \"are (pl.)\"; other forms follow from the stem ; e.g. \u2190 \"you are\", \u2190 \"let it be\". A handful of verbs, including \"to see\", \"to do/make\", and \"to run\" have rare consonant mutation patterns which are not derivable from the infinitive. In spoken Finnish, some frequently used verbs () have irregular stems (, instead of (\"go, come, be, put\"), respectively).\nFinnish does not have a separate verb for possession (compare English \"to have\"). Possession is indicated in other ways, mainly by genitives and existential clauses. For animate possessors, the adessive case is used with , for example = 'the dog has a tail' \u2013 literally 'on the dog is a tail', or in English grammar, \"There is a tail on the dog\". This is similar to Irish and Welsh forms such as \"There is a hunger on me\".\nTense-aspect forms.\nFinnish verbs have present, imperfect, perfect and pluperfect tense-aspect forms.\nAs stated above, Finnish has no grammatical future tense. To indicate futurity, a Finnish speaker may use forms that are, by some, deprecated as ungrammatical. One is the use of the verb , 'to come', as it were as an auxiliary: 'This is going to be a problem', cf Swedish . Another, less common and now archaic, is to use the verb , 'to be', with the present passive participle of the main verb: 'For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord' (Luke 1:15).\nVoices.\nFinnish has two possible verb voices: active and passive. The active voice corresponds with the active voice of English, but the Finnish passive voice has some important differences from the English passive voice.\nPassive voice.\nThe so-called Finnish passive is impersonal and unipersonal, that is, it only appears in one form regardless of who is implicitly understood to be the performer of the action. In that respect, it could be described as a \"fourth person\" since there is no way of connecting the action performed with a particular agent (except for some nonstandard forms; see below). It is called \"passive\" for historical reasons in imitation of Swedish and Latin grammars, but this term is in fact incorrect because the object of an active sentence remains an object in the equivalent Finnish \"passive\" sentence, in other words, the Finnish \"passive\" sentence is in fact active. In languages with true passives, an active sentence's object becomes the subject in the equivalent passive sentence. Active: \"we will arrest him\" =&gt; passive: \"he will be arrested\".\nConsider the example: \"the house will be painted\". The time when the house is being painted could be added: \"the house will be painted in November\". The colour and method could be added: \"the house will be painted red with a brush\". But nothing can be said about the person who will do the painting; there is no simple way to say \"the house will be painted by Jim\". There is a calque, evidently from Swedish, \"by the action of\", that can be used to introduce the agent: , approximately \"The house will be painted by the action of Jim\". This type of expression is considered prescriptively incorrect, but it may be found wherever direct translations from Swedish, English, etc. are made, especially in legal texts, and has traditionally been a typical feature of Finnish \"officialese\". An alternative form, passive + ablative, also a calque from Swedish, was once common but is now archaic.\nNotice also that the object is in the form of the accusative that has the same form as the nominative case (which is true of all words except for the personal pronouns). Verbs which govern the partitive case continue to do so in the passive, and where the object of the action is a personal pronoun in the accusative, that goes into its special accusative form: \"I/you/(s)he/we/you/they was/were forgotten\". Whether the object of a passive verb should be termed the subject of the clause has been debated, but traditionally Finnish grammars have considered a passive clause to have no subject.\nUse of the passive voice is not as common in Finnish as in Germanic languages; sentences in the active voice are preferred, if possible. Confusion may result, as the agent is lost and becomes ambiguous. For instance, a bad translation of the English \"the PIN code is asked for by the device when...\" into raises the question \"who asks?\", whereas (\"the device asks for the PIN code when...\") is unambiguous. Nevertheless, this usage of the passive is common in Finnish, particularly in literary and official contexts. Occasionally this leads to extreme cases such as \"it is wanted that the municipal board be dismissed\", implying that a popular uprising could be near, when this suggestion could also be made by a political group in the town council consisting of only a few or theoretically (very unlikely because misleading) even a single person.\nIt can also be said that in the Finnish passive the agent is always human and never mentioned. A sentence such as 'the tree was blown down' would translate poorly into Finnish if the passive were used, since it would suggest the image of a group of people trying to blow the tree down.\nColloquially, the first-person plural indicative and imperative are replaced by the passive, e.g. (\"we'll go to our place\") and (\"let us go to our place\") are replaced by (see spoken Finnish).\nBecause of its vagueness about who is performing the action, the passive can also translate the English \"one does (something)\", \"(something) is generally done\", as in \"they say that...\"\nFormation of the passive is dealt with in the article on Finnish verb conjugation.\nAs first-person plural.\nIn modern colloquial Finnish, the passive form of the verb is used instead of the active first-person plural in the indicative and the imperative, to the almost complete exclusion of the standard verb forms. For example, in the indicative, the standard form is 'we are going', but the colloquial form is . Without the personal pronoun , the passive alone replaces the first-person plural imperative, as in 'Let's go!'. In colloquial speech, the pronoun cannot be omitted without confusion, unlike when using the standard forms (indicative) and (imperative).\nZero person.\nThe so-called \"zero person\" is a construct in which a verb appears in the third-person singular with no subject, and the identity of the subject must be understood from the context. Typically the implied subject is either the speaker or their interlocutor, or the statement is intended in a general sense. The zero person has some similarity to the English use of the formal subject .\n* \"In the sauna, one sweats\"\n* \"If you arrive in good time, you get a better seat\"\nMoods.\nIndicative.\nThe indicative is the form of the verb used for making statements or asking simple questions. In the verb morphology sections, the mood referred to will be the indicative unless otherwise stated.\nConditional.\nThe conditional mood expresses the idea that the action or state expressed by the verb may or may not actually happen. As in English, the Finnish conditional is used in conditional sentences (for example \"I would tell you if I knew\") and in polite requests (for example \"I would like some coffee\").\nIn the former case, and unlike in English, the conditional must be used in both halves of the Finnish sentence:\n = *\"I would understand if you would speak more slowly\".\nThe characteristic morphology of the Finnish conditional is 'isi' inserted between the verb stem and the personal ending. This can result in a closed syllable becoming open and so trigger consonant gradation:\n = 'I know', = 'I would know'.\n = 'I want', = 'I would like'.\nConditional forms exist for both active and passive voices, and for present tense and perfect.\nThe conditional can be used for added politeness when offering, requesting, or pleading: 'Would you like some coffee?'; 'May I have that red one?'; 'I do wish you would tell me'.\nImperative.\nThe imperative mood is used to express commands. In Finnish, there is only one tense form (the present-future). The possible variants of Finnish imperatives are:\nActive, 2nd-person imperatives.\nThese are the most common forms of the imperative: \"Do this\", \"Don't do that\".\nThe singular imperative is simply the verb's present tense without any personal ending (that is, remove the from the first-person-singular form):\nTo make this negative, (which is the active imperative singular 2nd person of the negative verb) is placed before the positive form:\nTo form the plural, add or to the verb's stem:\nTo make this negative, (which is the active imperative present plural 2nd person of the negative verb) is placed before the positive form and the suffix or is added to the verb stem:\nNote that 2nd-person-plural imperatives can also be used as polite imperatives when referring to one person.\nThe Finnish language has no simple equivalent to the English \"please\". The Finnish equivalent is to use either or = 'be good', but it is generally omitted. Politeness is normally conveyed by tone of voice, facial expression, and use of conditional verbs and partitive nouns. For example, means \"could you\", in the polite plural, and is used much like English \"Could you...\" sentences: \"could you help me, please?\"\nAlso, familiar (and not necessarily so polite) expressions can be added to imperatives, e.g. , , . These are hard to translate exactly, but extensively used by Finnish speakers themselves. implies expectation, that is, it has been settled already and requires no discussion; has the which indicates insistence, and means approximated \"indeed\".\n3rd-person imperatives.\nThe 3rd-person imperatives behave as if they were jussive; besides being used for commands, they can also be used to express permission. In colloquial language, they are most often used to express disregard to what one might or might not do, and the singular and plural forms are often confused.\n1st-person-plural imperatives.\nThe 1st-person imperative sounds archaic, and a form resembling the passive indicative is often used instead: = 'let's go!'\nOptative.\nThe optative mood is an archaic or poetic variant of the imperative mood that expresses hopes or wishes. It is not used in normal language. Although it in principle has all forms, it is encountered mainly in the 2nd person singular forms \"-:os\"/\"-:\u00f6s\" (replacement of /k/ with the gemination of the previous consonant).\nOptatives are rare even in original archaic poems, and the forms used to express the optative are different from standard Finnish. An example of a true optative is \"ruvetkommas tappelohon\" \"let's go and start fighting\". However, when compiling the Kalevala, Elias L\u00f6nnrot tripled the number of optatives, by changing these dialectal forms in the original poems to the standard optative.\nPotential.\nThe potential mood is used to express that the action or state expressed by the verb is possible but not certain. It is relatively rare in modern Finnish, especially in speech. Most commonly it is used in news reports and in official written proposals in meetings. It has only the present tense and perfect. The potential has no specific counterpart in English, but can be translated by adding \"possibly\" (or occasionally \"probably\") to the verb.\nThe characteristic morphology of the Finnish potential is , inserted between the verb stem and the personal ending. Before this affix, continuants assimilate progressively ( \u2192 ) and stops regressively ( \u2192 ). The verb 'to be' in the potential has the special suppletive form , e.g. the potential of 'has been fetched' is 'may have been fetched'.\nPotential forms exists for both active and passive voices, and for present tense and perfect:\nIn some dialects ('may come') is an indicative form verb ( 'comes'). This is not a potential form, but rather due to secondary gemination.\nEventive.\nNo longer used in modern Finnish, the eventive mood is used in the \"Kalevala\". It is a combination of the potential and the conditional. It is also used in some dialects of Estonian.\nInfinitives.\nFinnish verbs are described as having four, sometimes five infinitives:\nFirst infinitive.\nThe first infinitive short form of a verb is the citation form found in dictionaries. It is not unmarked; its overt marking is always the suffix or , though sometimes there are modifications (which may be regarded as stem or ending modifications depending on personal preference).\nWhen the stem is itself a single syllable or is of two or more syllables ending in or , the suffix is or , respectively. (This represents the historically older form of the suffix, from which the has been lost in most environments.)\nIf the stem ends in one of the consonants , , , then the final consonant is doubled before adding the infinitive or . In the case of a stem ending in the consonant , the infinitive ending gains the consonant , becoming or . (These consonant stems take a linking vowel when forming the present tense, or when forming the imperfect, e.g. 'to wash': 'I wash' : 'I washed'). Stems ending in , followed by a link vowel in the present or imperfect, drop the from the stem before adding the infinitive marker or .\nSome verbs have so called \"alternating stems\" or multiple stems with weak-strong consonant gradation between them. It depends on the verb if the infinitive is in the strong or weak form. These have long vowel stems in the present/future tense, which already ends with or . These verbs drop the which is present in the present tense stem and replace it with in the first infinitive stem followed by the standard or first infinitive marker. The dropping to weakens a preceding , or so that a weak grade is seen in the first infinitive form. This often creates difficulties for the non-Finn when trying to determine the infinitive (in order to access the translation in a dictionary) when encountering an inflected form. Inflected forms are generally strong except when the stem ending contains a double consonant and there is only a single vowel separating this from the last stem , or .\nSome verbs lose elements of their stems when forming the first infinitive. Some verbs stem have contracted endings in the first infinitive. Stems ending / in the present/imperfect drop the and replace it with , and where applicable, trigger the weak grade in the infinitive stem. The contracted infinitive ending / have / verbs take the infinitive stem /. These contracted verbs may also be subject to consonant weakening when forming the infinitive\ne.g. 'to mention' has the longer conjugated stem as in 'I'll mention tomorrow that...'\ne.g. 'to flee' has the longer conjugated stem as in 'we fled from Afghanistan'\nThe first infinitive long form is the translative plus a possessive suffix (rare in spoken language).\nThe first infinitive only has an active form.\nSecond infinitive.\nThe second infinitive is used to express aspects of actions relating to the time when an action takes place or the manner in which an action happens. In equivalent English phrases these time aspects can often be expressed using \"when\", \"while\" or \"whilst\" and the manner aspects using the word \"by\" or else the gerund, which is formed by adding \"-ing\" to English verb to express manner.\nIt is recognizable by the letter in place of the usual or as the infinitive marker. It is only ever used with one of two case makers; the inessive indicating time or the instructive indicating manner. Finnish phrases using the second infinitive can often be rendered in English using the gerund.\nThe second infinitive is formed by replacing the final of the first infinitive with then adding the appropriate inflectional ending. If the vowel before the is already an , this becomes (see example from 'to read').\nThe cases in which the second infinitive can appear are:\nThe inessive form is mostly seen in written forms of language because spoken forms usually express the same idea in longer form using two clauses linked by the word (\"when\"). The instructive is even rarer and mostly exists nowadays in set phrases (for example = 'in other words').\nIf the person performing the action of the verb is the same as the person in the equivalent relative clause, then the verb uses the appropriate personal possessive suffix on the verb for the person. If the person in the main clause is different from that in the relative clause then this is indicated by with the person in the genitive and the verb is unmarked for person.\nThird infinitive.\nThis corresponds to the English gerund (\"verb + -ing\" form), and behaves as a noun in Finnish in that it can be inflected, but only in a limited number of cases. It is used to refer to a particular act or occasion of the verb's action.\nThe third infinitive is formed by taking the verb stem with its consonant in the strong form, then adding followed by the case inflection.\nThe cases in which the third infinitive can appear are:\nA rare and archaic form of the third infinitive which occurs with the verb :\nThe third infinitive instructive is usually replaced with the first infinitive short form in modern Finnish.\nNote that the form without a case ending is called the 'agent participle' (see #Participles below). The agent participle can also be inflected in all cases, producing forms which look similar to the third infinitive.\nFourth infinitive.\nThe fourth infinitive has the stem ending and indicates obligation, but it is quite rare in Finnish today. This is because there are other words like and that can convey this meaning.\nFor example\nThough not an infinitive, a much more common verbal stem ending is the noun construct which gives the name of the activity described by the verb. This is rather similar to the English verbal noun '-ing' form, and therefore as a noun, this form can inflect just like any other noun.\nFifth infinitive.\nThis is a fairly rare form which has the meaning 'on the point of ...ing / just about to ...'\nVerb conjugation.\nFor full details of how verbs are conjugated in Finnish, please refer to the Finnish verb conjugation article.\nParticiples.\nFinnish verbs have past and present participles, both with passive and active forms, and an 'agent' participle. Participles can be used in different ways than ordinary adjectives and they can have an object.\nPast passive participle.\nThis is formed in the same way as the passive perfect or passive past-perfect forms, by taking the passive past form, removing the ending and replacing it with (depending on vowel harmony)\nPast active participle.\nBasically this is formed by removing the infinitive ending and adding (depending on vowel harmony) and in some cases , , . For example:\nHowever, depending on the verb's stem type, assimilation can occur with the consonant of the stem ending.\nIn type II verbs, and , , or in the stem ending is assimilated to the consonant in the participle ending (as also happens in formation of the first infinitive, although stem endings take an extra in the first infinitive)\nThe assimilation causes the final consonant cluster to be strengthened which in turn can weaken a strong cluster if one exists in the stem. See above.\nIn verbs of types IV, V and VI, the at the end of the stem is assimilated to the :\nPresent passive participle.\nThe present passive participle can be constructed from the past passive form of the verb. The ending of the past passive is replaced with , which can be inflected in the same way as the present active participle. For example:\nIt is possible to translate this participle in several related ways e.g. 'which must be/is to be said', 'which can be said', 'which will be said' or 'which is said'.\nHere are some sentences and phrases further illustrating the formation and use of the present passive participle:\nThis participle can also be used in other ways. If used with the appropriate third-person singular form of the verb and with the subject in the genitive it can express necessity or obligation.\n 'I must leave'\n 'They would have to go'\nInflected in the inessive plural, it can be used in conjunction with the verb 'to be' to indicate that something can or cannot be done.\n 'Is Pekka available?'/'Is Pekka able to be met with?'\nPresent active participle.\nThis participle is formed simply by finding the 3rd person plural form of the verb and removing -t, and acts as an adjective describing what the object or subject of the sentence is doing, for example:\nAgent participle.\nThe agent participle is formed in a similar way as the third infinitive (see above), adding -ma or -m\u00e4 to the verb stem. It allows the property of being a target of an action to be formatted as an adjective-like attribute. Like adjectives, it can be inflected in all cases. For example, \"a man-made formation\". The party performing the action is indicated by the use of genitive, or by a possessive suffix. This is reflected in English, too: \u2013 \"of man's making\", or \"book of my writing\". For example:\nIt is not required for the action to be in the past, although the examples above are. Rather, the construction simply specifies the subject, the object and the action, with no reference to time. For an example in the future, consider: \"tomorrow, as the instrument you will be using is...\". Here, \"that which is used\" describes, i.e. is an attribute to \"instrument\". (Notice the case agreement between and .) The suffix \"your\" specifies the person \"owning\" the action, i.e. who does it, thus is \"that which was used by you(pl.)\", and is \"as that which was used by you\".\nIt is also possible to give the actor with a pronoun, e.g. \"that which was used by you\". In standard language, the pronoun \"your\" is not necessary, but the possessive suffix is. In inexact spoken usage, this goes vice versa; the possessive suffix is optional, and used typically only for the second-person singular, e.g. .\nNegation of verbs.\nPresent indicative.\nVerbs are negated by using a negative verb in front of the stem from the present tense (in its 'weak' consonant form). This verb form used with the negative verb is called a connegative.\nNote that the inflection is on the negative verb, not on the main verb, and that the endings are regular apart from the 3rd-person forms.\nPresent passive.\nThe negative is formed from the third-person singular \"negative verb\" and the present passive with the final removed:\nImperfect indicative.\nThe negative is formed from the appropriate part of the negative verb followed by the nominative form (either singular or plural depending on the number of the verb's subject) of the active past participle. So for the pattern is:\nNote one exception: when the 'te' 2nd-person plural form is used in an honorific way to address one person, the singular form of the participle is used: = 'you (sg. polite) did not speak'.\nImperfect passive.\nThe negative is formed from the third-person singular negative verb \u2013 'ei' \u2013 and the nominative singular form of the passive present participle (compare this with the negative of the imperfect indicative):\nNote that in the spoken language, this form is used for the first-person plural. In this case, the personal pronoun is obligatory:\nAdverbs.\nA very common way of forming adverbs is by adding the ending to the inflecting form of the corresponding adjective:\nAdverbs modify verbs, not nouns, therefore they do not inflect. adverbs are not used to modify adjectives (such as to express degree) like adverbs might be in English; the genitive of adjectives is used for this purpose.\nComparative formation.\nThe comparative form of the adverb has the ending .\nSuperlative formation.\nThe superlative form of the adverb has the ending .\nBecause of the , the stem vowel can change, similarly to superlative adjectives, or to avoid runs of three vowels:\nIrregular forms.\nThere are a number of irregular adverbs, including:\nNumbers.\nThe ordinary counting numbers (cardinals) from 0 to 10 are given in the table below. Cardinal numbers may be inflected and some of the inflected forms are irregular in form.\n(*) sometimes (alternative form) \nIn colloquial spoken Finnish, the numerals usually appear in contracted forms.\nTo form teens, is added to the base number. is the partitive form of , meaning here \"second group of ten\". Hyphens are written here to separate morphemes. In Finnish text, hyphens are not written.\n\"one of the second, two of the second, ... nine of the second\"\n11, 12, ... 19\nIn older Finnish, until about the early 20th Century, the same pattern was used up to one hundred: 'thirty-three'.\nSentence structure.\nWord order.\nSince Finnish is an agglutinative language, word order within sentences can be much freer than, for example, English. In English the strong subject\u2013verb\u2013object order typically indicates the function of a noun as either subject or object although some English structures allow this to be reversed. In Finnish sentences, however, the role of the noun is determined not by word order or sentence structure as in English but by case markings which indicate subject and object.\nThe most usual neutral order, however, is subject\u2013verb\u2013object. But usually what the speaker or writer is talking about is at the head of the sentence.\nHere ('dog') is in the nominative form but ('man') is marked as object by the case marked form . This sentence is a bald statement of fact. Changing the word order changes the emphasis slightly but not the fundamental meaning of the sentence.\n here is the word (I) in a case form ending which when used with the verb (to be, expressed here in the form ) expresses ownership. This is because Finnish does not have a verb form equivalent of the English word 'have'. is not considered the subject.\nAnd finally, a classic example:\nBesides the word-order implications of turning a sentence into a question, there are some other circumstances where word-order is important:\nExistential sentences.\nThese are sentences which introduce a new subject \u2013 they often begin with 'there is' or 'there are' in English.\nThe location of the thing whose existence is being stated comes first, followed by its stative verb, followed by the thing itself. Note how this is unlike the normal English equivalent, though English can also use the same order:\nForming questions.\nThere are two main ways of forming a question \u2013 either using a specific question word, or by adding a suffix to one of the words in a sentence. A question word is placed first in the sentence, and a word with the interrogative suffix is also moved to this position:\nForming answers.\nThe response to a question will of course depend on the situation, but grammatically the response to a question typically follows the grammatical structure in the question. Thus a question structured in the inessive case (e.g. 'in which town do you live?') will have an answer that is also in the inessive (e.g. 'in Espoo') unless special rules dictate otherwise. Questions which in English would be answered with 'yes' or 'no' replies are usually responded to by repeating the verb in either the affirmative or negative.\nThe words and are often shown in dictionaries as being equivalent to 'yes' and 'no', but the situation is a little more complicated than that. The typical response to a question which in English is answered 'yes' or 'no' is, as we see above, more usually answered by repeating the verb in either an affirmative or negative form in the appropriate person. The word 'kyll\u00e4' is rather a strong affirmation in response to a question and is similar to the word 'niin' which is an affirmation of a response to a statement of fact or belief. (However, in conversations, may even simply mean that the sentence was heard, not expressing any sort of concurrence. The same problem occurs with the colloquial \"yeah\".)\nThe word is the negative verb form and has to be inflected for person and the verb itself is usually present, though not always.\n 'can you (speak) German?'\n ('no'; lit. 'I don't')\nor better\n ('I can't')\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50435", "revid": "50834594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50435", "title": "Lancashire", "text": "County of England\nLancashire ( , ; abbreviated \"Lancs\") is a ceremonial county in North West England. It is bordered by Cumbria to the north, North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to the east, Greater Manchester and Merseyside to the south, and the Irish Sea to the west. The largest settlement is the city of Preston.\nThe county has an area of and had a population of 1,601,645 in 2024. Preston and Blackburn are located near the centre, Burnley in the east, the seaside resort of Blackpool on the Irish Sea coast in the west, and the city of Lancaster in the north. For local government purposes the county comprises a non-metropolitan county, with twelve districts, and two unitary authority areas: Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool. Lancashire County Council and the two unitary councils collaborate through the Lancashire Combined County Authority. The county historically included the Furness and Cartmel peninsulas of Cumbria, northern Greater Manchester and Merseyside, and Warrington, but excluded the eastern part of the Forest of Bowland.\nThe west of Lancashire contains flat coastal plains: the West Lancashire coastal plain to the south and the Fylde in the centre. The north-western coast is hilly and contains part of Arnside and Silverdale, a national landscape. The east of the county is upland, with the West Pennine Moors in the south-east and the Forest of Bowland in the north-east; Bowland has also been designated a national landscape. The major rivers of the county are, from north to south, the Lune, the Wyre, and the Ribble, which all flow west into the Irish Sea. The highest point in Lancashire is either Gragareth or Green Hill, both approximately high and located in the far north-east of the county.\nLancashire was founded in the 12th century; in the Domesday Book of 1086 much of what would become the county is treated as part of Yorkshire and Cheshire. Until the Early Modern period the county was a comparatively poor backwater, although in 1351 it became a palatine, with a semi-independent judicial system. This changed during the Industrial Revolution, when the county rapidly industrialised; until 1974 it included both Liverpool, a major port, and Manchester, which with its surrounding towns dominated the manufacture of textiles. The Lancashire coalfield was also exploited, with many collieries opening. By 1971 Lancashire had a population of 5,118,405, which made it the most heavily populated county in the United Kingdom after Greater London.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nBefore the county.\nDuring Roman times the area was part of the Brigantes tribal area in the military zone of Roman Britain. The towns of Manchester, Lancaster, Ribchester, Burrow, Elslack and Castleshaw grew around Roman forts. In the centuries after the Roman withdrawal in 410 AD the northern parts of the county probably formed part of the Brythonic kingdom of Rheged, a successor entity to the Brigantes tribe. During the mid-8th century, the area was incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria from the north of the River Ribble and the Kingdom of Mercia from the south, which both became parts of England in the 10th century.\nIn the \"Domesday Book\", land between the Ribble and Mersey were known as and included in the returns for Cheshire. Although some historians consider this to mean south Lancashire was then part of Cheshire, it is by no means certain. It is also claimed that the territory to the north formed part of the West Riding of Yorkshire.\nEarly history.\nThe county was established in 1182, and came to be bordered by Cumberland, Westmorland, Yorkshire, and Cheshire. It was divided into the hundreds of Amounderness, Blackburn, Leyland, Lonsdale, Salford and West Derby. Lonsdale was further partitioned into Lonsdale North, the detached part north of the sands of Morecambe Bay including Furness and Cartmel, and Lonsdale South.\nVictorian era to late 20th century.\nSince the Victorian era, Lancashire has had multiple reforms of local government. In 1889, the administrative county of Lancashire was created, covering the greater part of the county. Multiple county boroughs were outside the county council control: Barrow-in-Furness, Blackburn, Bolton, Bootle, Burnley, Bury, Liverpool, Manchester, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale, Salford, St. Helens, and Wigan. The area served by the Lord-Lieutenant (termed now a ceremonial county) covered the entirety of the administrative county and the county boroughs. It expanded whenever boroughs annexed areas in neighbouring counties such as Wythenshawe in Manchester south of the River Mersey and from Cheshire, and southern Warrington. It did not cover the western part of Todmorden, where the ancient border between Lancashire and Yorkshire passes through the middle of the town.\nDuring the 20th century, the county became increasingly urban with Warrington (1900), Blackpool (1904) and Southport (1905) becoming county boroughs, with many boundary extensions. The borders around the Manchester area were particularly complicated, with narrow protrusions of the administrative county between the county boroughs \u2013 Lees Urban District formed a detached part of the administrative county, between Oldham county borough and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Lancaster, the historic county town, became a city in 1937. \nThe administrative county was also the most populous of its type outside London, with a population of 2,280,359 in 1961. By the census of 1971, the population of Lancashire and its county boroughs had reached 5,129,416, making it the most populous geographic county in the UK.\nPost-1974.\nOn 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the local government structure of Lancashire was reorganised. The south-east of the county became part of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester and the south-west became part of the metropolitan county of Merseyside; Widnes and Warrington in the south were transferred to Cheshire. In the north, the non-metropolitan county of Cumbria incorporated the Furness exclave. \nThe remainder of Lancashire was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan county with thirteen districts. It included some areas formerly in the West Riding of Yorkshire, namely the urban districts of Barnoldswick and Earby, Bowland Rural District, and the parishes of Bracewell and Brogden and Salterforth from Skipton Rural District. \nIn 1994, the parish of Simonswood was transferred from the borough of Knowsley in Merseyside to the district of West Lancashire. In 1998, Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen became unitary authorities, removing them from the non-metropolitan county but not from the ceremonial county.\nGeography.\nGeology, landscape, and ecology.\nThe three main rivers of Lancashire are, from north to south, the Lune, the Wyre, and the Ribble, which all flow west into the Irish Sea. The Lune rises in Cumbria, before entering Lancashire and flowing through Lancaster. The Wyre rises in Bowland and flows west then south, turning west again across the Fylde and then north as it broadens into its estuary west of Fleetwood. The Ribble rises in North Yorkshire, and flows south-west through Lancashire past Clitheroe and Preston before broadening into the Ribble Estuary. Many of Lancashire's other rivers are tributaries of the Ribble, including the Calder, Darwen, Douglas, and Hodder. The Irwell, which flows through Manchester, has its source in Lancashire.\nTo the west of the county are the Fylde coastal plain and West Lancashire coastal plain, which lie north and south of the Ribble Estuary respectively. Apart from the coastal resorts these areas are largely rural and devoted to vegetable crops. Further north is Morecambe Bay. In the northwest corner of the county, straddling the border with Cumbria, is the Arnside and Silverdale National Landscape, characterised by its limestone pavements and home to the Leighton Moss nature reserve.\nIn the east of the county are upland areas leading to the Pennines. North of the Ribble are Beacon Fell Country Park and the Forest of Bowland, another National Landscape. Much of the lowland in this area is devoted to dairy farming and cheesemaking, whereas the higher ground is more suitable for sheep, and the highest ground is uncultivated moorland. The valleys of the River Ribble and its tributary the Calder form a large gap to the west of the Pennines, overlooked by Pendle Hill. South of the Ribble are the West Pennine Moors and the Forest of Rossendale, where former cotton mill towns are in deep valleys. The Lancashire Coalfield, largely in modern-day Greater Manchester, extended into Merseyside and to Ormskirk, Chorley, Burnley and Colne in Lancashire.\nThe highest point of the ceremonial county is Gragareth, near Whernside, which reaches a height of 627 m (2,057 ft). Green Hill near Gragareth has also been cited as the \"county\" top. The highest point in the historic county is Coniston Old Man in the Lake District, at 803 m (2,634 ft).\nHuman geography.\nThe north of the ceremonial county is less densely populated than the south, especially inland. The Fylde coast is continuously built-up from Lytham St Annes to Fleetwood, including Blackpool, and further north Lancaster, Morecambe, and Heysham form a conurbation. The rest of the region is characterised by small towns and villages in the flat farmland surrounding the lower reaches of the Ribble, Wyre, and Lune and the sparsely populated uplands of the Forest of Bowland.\nThe centre and south-east of Lancashire are relatively urbanised, especially around the major settlements of Preston, Blackburn, and Burnley and near the border with Greater Manchester. The Central Lancashire urban area includes the city of Preston and the towns of Penwortham, Leyland and Chorley. A short distance east, Blackburn and Darwen are the first of several adjacent areas urban areas which continue east toward West Yorkshire and south into the valleys leading to Greater Manchester, the others being Accrington and Rossendale and Burnley. West Lancashire in the south-west is rural with the exception of Skelmersdale, which forms part of Wigan urban area. \nThe North West Green Belt covers a large part of the south and centre of the county to prevents the settlements there from converging both with each other and with the nearby Merseyside and Greater Manchester conurbations. It includes all of the non-urban areas in the boroughs of West Lancashire and South Ribble and the majority of Chorley; elsewhere it is less extensive, but covers the areas between the major settlements. There is a further area of green belt in the north of the county between Lancaster, Morecambe, and Carnforth.\nThe cities of Manchester, Salford, Liverpool and the following settlements within the historic county boundaries are currently in the ceremonial counties of West Yorkshire, Cheshire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Cumbria:\nBoundary changes before 1974 include:\nGovernance.\nLocal government.\nThe ceremonial county of Lancashire is divided into fourteen local government districts. \nThe twelve districts of Burnley, Chorley, Fylde, Hyndburn, Lancaster, Pendle, Preston, Ribble Valley, Rossendale, South Ribble, West Lancashire, and Wyre are part of the two-tier non-metropolitan county of Lancashire, which is administered by Lancashire County Council and twelve district councils. The county council is based in County Hall in Preston, and has 84 councillors. It has been controlled by Reform UK since the 2025 local election. \nBlackpool and Blackburn with Darwen are unitary authority areas, meaning their councils combine the functions of a district and county council. They were formed in 1996, before which each district was part of the non-metropolitan county of Lancashire. Both authorities currently have a majority Labour administration.\nLancashire County Council, Blackpool Council, and Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council collaborate through the Lancashire Combined County Authority, which was established in February 2025.\nThe ceremonial county itself only has a minor administrative function, being the area to which the Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire is appointed; the shrieval county has the same boundaries and is the area to which the High Sheriff of Lancashire is appointed.\nParliamentary constituencies.\nThe ceremonial county is divided into sixteen constituencies for the purpose of parliamentary representation.\nDuchy of Lancaster.\nThe Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of the sovereign, exercises the right of the Crown in the County Palatine of Lancaster. The most prominent effect of this is that the Duchy administers \"bona vacantia\" within the County Palatine, receiving the property of persons who die intestate and where the legal ownership cannot be ascertained. The county palatine boundaries remain the same as the historic boundaries, ignoring subsequent local government reforms.\nEconomy.\nLancashire in the 19th century was a major centre of economic activity, and hence one of wealth. Activities included coal mining, textile production, particularly that which used cotton, and fishing. Preston Docks, an industrial port is now disused. Lancashire was historically the location of the port of Liverpool while Barrow-in-Furness is famous for shipbuilding.\nAs of 2013, the largest private sector industry is the defence industry with BAE Systems Military Air Solutions division based in Warton on the Fylde coast. The division operates a manufacturing site in Samlesbury. Other defence firms include BAE Systems Global Combat Systems in Chorley, Ultra Electronics in Fulwood and Rolls-Royce plc in Barnoldswick.\nThe nuclear power industry has a plant at Springfields, Salwick operated by Westinghouse and Heysham nuclear power station is operated by British Energy. Other major manufacturing firms include Leyland Trucks, a subsidiary of Paccar building the DAF truck range.\nOther companies with a major presence in Lancashire include:\nEnterprise zone.\nThe creation of Lancashire Enterprise Zone was announced in 2011. It was launched in April 2012, based at the airfields owned by BAE Systems in Warton and Samlesbury. Warton Aerodrome covers and Samlesbury Aerodrome is 74 hectares. Development is coordinated by Lancashire Enterprise Partnership, Lancashire County Council and BAE Systems. The first businesses to move into the zone did so in March 2015, at Warton.\nIn March 2015 the government announced a new enterprise zone would be created at Blackpool Airport, using some airport and adjoining land. Operations at the airport will not be affected.\nEconomic output.\nThis is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of the non-metropolitan county of Lancashire at basic prices published by the Office for National Statistics with figures in millions of British pounds sterling.\nEducation.\nLancashire has a mostly comprehensive system with four state grammar schools. Not including sixth form colleges, there are 77 state schools (not including Burnley's new schools) and 24 independent schools. Sixth form provision is limited at most schools in most districts, with only Fylde and Lancaster districts having mostly sixth forms at schools. The rest depend on FE colleges and sixth form colleges, where they exist. South Ribble has the largest school population and Fylde the smallest (only three schools). Burnley's schools have had a new broom and have essentially been knocked down and started again in 2006. There are many Church of England and Catholic faith schools in Lancashire.\nLancashire is home to four universities: Lancaster University, the University of Central Lancashire, Edge Hill University and the Lancaster campus of the University of Cumbria. Seven colleges offer higher education courses.\nTransport.\nRoadways.\nThe Lancashire economy relies strongly on the M6 motorway which runs from north to south, past Lancaster and Preston. The M55 connects Preston to Blackpool and is 11.5 miles (18.3 km) long. The M65 motorway from Colne, connects Burnley, Accrington, Blackburn to Preston. The M61 from Preston via Chorley and the M66 starting inside the county boundary near Edenfield, provide links between Lancashire and Manchester, and the trans-Pennine M62. The M58 crosses the southernmost part of the county from the M6 near Wigan to Liverpool via Skelmersdale.\nOther major roads include the east\u2013west A59 between Liverpool in Merseyside and Skipton in North Yorkshire via Ormskirk, Preston and Clitheroe, and the connecting A565 to Southport; the A56 from Ramsbottom to Padiham via Haslingden and from Colne to Skipton; the A585 from Kirkham to Fleetwood; the A666 from the A59 north of Blackburn to Bolton via Darwen; and the A683 from Heysham to Kirkby Lonsdale via Lancaster.\nSeveral bus companies run bus services in the Lancashire area serving the main towns and villages in the county with some services running to neighbouring areas, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and West Yorkshire. Some of these include: \nRailways.\nThe West Coast Main Line provides direct rail links with London, Glasgow and other major cities, with stations at Preston and Lancaster. East-west connections are carried via the East Lancashire Line between Blackpool and Colne via Lytham, Preston, Blackburn, Accrington and Burnley. The Ribble Valley Line runs from Bolton to Hellifield with regular passenger services running as far as Clitheroe via Darwen and Blackburn. There are connecting lines from Preston to Ormskirk and Bolton, and from Lancaster to Morecambe, Heysham and Skipton.\nAirways.\nThere are no airports within Lancashire offering commercial flights, although these were formerly operated from Blackpool Airport until 2014, which is still the home of flying schools, private operators and North West Air Ambulance. Manchester Airport is the main airport in the region. Liverpool John Lennon Airport is nearby, while the closest airport to the Pendle area is Leeds Bradford.\nThere is an operational airfield at Warton near Preston where there is a major assembly and test facility for BAE Systems.\nWaterways.\nHeysham offers ferry services to Ireland and the Isle of Man. As part of its industrial past, Lancashire gave rise to an extensive network of canals, which extend into neighbouring counties. These include the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, Lancaster Canal, Sankey Canal, Bridgewater Canal, Rochdale Canal, Ashton Canal and Manchester Ship Canal.\nDemography.\nThe major settlements in the ceremonial county are concentrated on the Fylde coast (the Blackpool Urban Area), and a number of notable settlements along west to east of the M65: including the city of Preston and towns of Blackburn, Darwen, Accrington, Burnley, Padiham, Brierfield, Nelson and Colne. South of Preston are the towns of Leyland and Chorley (which, with Preston, formed Central Lancashire New Town designated in 1970), as well as Penwortham, Skelmersdale and Ormskirk. \nThe north of the county is predominantly rural and sparsely populated, except for the city of Lancaster and the towns of Morecambe and Heysham, the three of which form a large conurbation of almost 100,000 people. Lancashire is home to a significant Asian population, numbering over 70,000 and 6% of the county's population, and concentrated largely in the former cotton mill towns in the south east.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture.\nSymbols.\nThe Red Rose of Lancaster is the county flower found on the county's heraldic badge and flag. The rose was a symbol of the House of Lancaster, immortalised in the verse \"In the battle for England's head/York was white, Lancaster red\" (referring to the 15th-century Wars of the Roses). \nA flag consisting of a red rose on a gold field was designed by the Friends of Real Lancashire, a pressure group which promotes the historic county, and registered with the Flag Institute, a vexillological charity, in 2008. The flag has been flown from public buildings within the historic county boundaries on Lancashire Day (27 November), including from County Hall in Preston, St Helens Town Hall, and in parts of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham which were previously in Lancashire. It has also been flown from the Ministry for Housing, Communities, and Local Government building in London.\nAn alternative flag consists of a red rose on a white field. This design had already been registered by Montrose in Scotland.\nSport.\nCricket.\nLancashire County Cricket Club has been one of the most successful county cricket teams, particularly in the one-day game. It is home to England cricket team members James Anderson and Jos Buttler. The County Ground, Old Trafford, Trafford, has been the home cricket ground of LCCC since 1864.\nLocal cricket leagues include the Lancashire League, the Central Lancashire League and the North Lancashire and Cumbria League.\nSince 2000, the designated ECB Premier League for Lancashire has been the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition.\nFootball.\nFootball in Lancashire is governed by the Lancashire County Football Association which, like most county football associations, has boundaries that are aligned roughly with the historic counties. The Manchester Football Association and Liverpool County Football Association respectively operate in Greater Manchester and Merseyside.\nLancashire clubs were prominent in the formation of the Football League in 1888, with the league being officially named at a meeting in Manchester. Of the twelve founder members of the league, six were from Lancashire: Accrington, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Everton, and Preston North End.\nThe Football League is now based in Preston. The National Football Museum was founded at Deepdale, Preston in 2001, but moved to Manchester in 2012.\nSeven professional full-time teams were based in Lancashire at the start of the 2024\u201325 season:\nThe county's most prominent football rivalries are the East Lancashire derby between Blackburn Rovers and Burnley, and the West Lancashire derby between Blackpool and Preston North End.\nA further nine professional full-time teams lie within the historical borders of Lancashire but outside of the current ceremonial county. These include the Premier League clubs Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United.\nRugby league.\nAlong with Yorkshire and Cumberland, Lancashire is recognised as the heartland of Rugby League. The county has produced many successful top flight clubs such as St. Helens, Wigan, Warrington, Oldham, Salford and Widnes. The county was once the focal point for many of the sport's professional competitions including the Lancashire League competition which ran from 1895 to 1970, and the Lancashire County Cup which ran until 1993. Rugby League has also seen a representative fixture between Lancashire and Yorkshire contested 89 times since its inception in 1895. In recent times there were several rugby league teams that are based within the ceremonial county which include Blackpool Panthers, East Lancashire Lions, and Blackpool Sea Eagles.\nArchery.\nThere are many archery clubs located within Lancashire. In 2004 Lancashire took the winning title at the Inter-counties championships from Yorkshire who had held it for 7 years.\nWrestling.\nLancashire has a centuries-long history of combat sports and wrestling, developing its own style called Lancashire wrestling, and becoming a breeding ground for many of Britain's best amateur and professional wrestlers. Through travelling performers and immigration, the style spread abroad to British colonies, Europe, the United States, and other countries. It was a primary influence on catch wrestling and its descendants including freestyle wrestling, American folkstyle wrestling, theatrical professional wrestling, and mixed martial arts. It was preserved due to the influence of Lancashire native Billy Riley and his gym, popularly known as The Snake Pit, and students such as Karl Gotch and Billy Robinson. It became particularly influential in Japan, where catch wrestling is popularly referred to as \"Lancashire style\" .\nMusic.\nFolk music.\nLancashire has a long and highly productive tradition of music making. In the early modern era the county shared in the national tradition of balladry, including perhaps the finest border ballad, \"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\", thought to have been composed by the Lancashire-born minstrel Richard Sheale. The county was also a common location for folk songs, including \"The Lancashire Miller\", \"Warrington Ale\" and \"The soldier's farewell to Manchester\", while Liverpool, as a major seaport, was the subject of many sea shanties, including \"The Leaving of Liverpool\" and \"Maggie May\", beside several local Wassailing songs. In the Industrial Revolution changing social and economic patterns helped create new traditions and styles of folk song, often linked to migration and patterns of work. These included processional dances, often associated with rushbearing or the Wakes Week festivities, and types of step dance, most famously clog dancing.\nA local pioneer of folk song collection in the first half of the 19th century was Shakespearean scholar James Orchard Halliwell, but it was not until the second folk revival in the 20th century that the full range of song from the county, including industrial folk song, began to gain attention. The county produced one of the major figures of the revival in Ewan MacColl, but also a local champion in Harry Boardman, who from 1965 onwards probably did more than anyone to popularise and record the folk song of the county. Perhaps the most influential folk artists to emerge from the region in the late 20th century were Liverpool folk group the Spinners, and from Manchester folk troubadour Roy Harper and musician, comedian and broadcaster Mike Harding. The region is home to numerous folk clubs, many of them catering to Irish and Scottish folk music. Regular folk festivals include the Fylde Folk Festival at Fleetwood.\nClassical music.\nLancashire had a lively culture of choral and classical music, with very large numbers of local church choirs from the 17th century, leading to the foundation of local choral societies from the mid-18th century, often particularly focused on performances of the music of Handel and his contemporaries. It also played a major part in the development of brass bands which emerged in the county, particularly in the textile and coalfield areas, in the 19th century. The first open competition for brass bands was held at Manchester in 1853, and continued annually until the 1980s. \nThe vibrant brass band culture of the area made an important contribution to the foundation and staffing of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra from 1857, the oldest extant professional orchestra in the United Kingdom. The same local musical tradition produced eminent figures such as Sir William Walton (1902\u201388), son of an Oldham choirmaster and music teacher, Sir Thomas Beecham (1879\u20131961), born in St. Helens, who began his career by conducting local orchestras and Alan Rawsthorne (1905\u201371) born in Haslingden. The conductor David Atherton, co-founder of the London Sinfonietta, was born in Blackpool in 1944. Lancashire also produced more populist figures, such as early musical theatre composer Leslie Stuart (1863\u20131928), born in Southport, who began his musical career as organist of Salford Cathedral.\nMore recent Lancashire-born composers include Hugh Wood (1932\u2013 Parbold), Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (1934\u20132016, Salford), Sir Harrison Birtwistle (1934\u20132022, Accrington), Gordon Crosse (1937\u2013, Bury), John McCabe (1939\u20132015, Huyton), Roger Smalley (1943\u20132015, Swinton), Nigel Osborne (1948\u2013, Manchester), Steve Martland (1954\u20132013, Liverpool), Simon Holt (1958\u2013, Bolton) and Philip Cashian (1963\u2013, Manchester).\nThe Royal Manchester College of Music was founded in 1893 to provide a northern counterpart to the London musical colleges. It merged with the Northern College of Music (formed in 1920) to form the Royal Northern College of Music in 1972.\nPopular music.\nLiverpool, both during its time in Lancashire and after being moved to the new county of Merseyside, has produced a number of successful musicians. This includes pop stars such as Frankie Vaughan and Lita Roza, as well as rock stars such as Billy Fury, who is considered to be one of the most successful British rock and roll stars of all time. Many Lancashire towns had vibrant skiffle scenes in the late 1950s, out of which a culture of beat groups emerged by the early 1960s, particularly around Liverpool and Manchester. It has been estimated that there were at least 350 bands\u2014including the Beatles\u2014active in and around Liverpool during this era, playing ballrooms, concert halls, and clubs. A number of Liverpool performers followed the Beatles into the charts, including Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, the Searchers, and Cilla Black.\nThe first musicians to break through in the UK who were not from Liverpool or managed by Beatles manager Brian Epstein were Manchester's Freddie and the Dreamers, with Herman's Hermits and the Hollies also hailing from Manchester. The Beatles led a movement by various beat groups from the region which culminated in the British Invasion of the US, which in turn made a major contribution to the development of modern rock music. After the decline of beat groups in the late 1960s, the centre of rock culture shifted to London, and there were relatively few Lancashire bands who achieved national prominence until the growth of a disco scene and the punk rock revolution in the mid-and-late 1970s.\nCuisine.\nLancashire is the origin of the Lancashire hotpot, a casserole dish traditionally made with lamb. Other traditional foods from the area include:\nCinema.\n\"Whistle Down the Wind\" (1961) was directed by Bryan Forbes, set at the foot of Worsaw Hill and in Burnley, and starred local Lancashire schoolchildren.\nThe tunnel scene was shot on the old Bacup-Rochdale railway line, location 53\u00b041'29.65\"N, 2\u00b011'25.18\"W, off the A6066 (New Line) where the line passes beneath Stack Lane. The tunnel is still there, in use as an industrial unit but the railway has long since been removed.\n\"Funny Bones\" (1995) was set mostly in Blackpool, after opening scenes in Las Vegas.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nThe county is covered by BBC North West and ITV Granada which broadcast from Salford. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. A small part of East Lancashire around Barnoldswick and Earby is served by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire broadcasting from Leeds. This area is served by a local transmitter in Skipton which is relayed from the Emley Moor TV transmitter.\nRadio.\nBBC Local Radio for the county is served by BBC Radio Lancashire which broadcast from its studios in Blackburn, BBC Radio Merseyside can be heard in southern parts, BBC Radio Manchester in the east and BBC Radio Cumbria in the north. County-wide commercial stations are Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire, Capital Manchester and Lancashire, Heart North West, and Smooth North West. Community based stations are Beyond Radio (covering northwestern Lancashire), Pendle Community Radio (serving the Pendle area), Rossendale Radio (for Rossendale), and Central Radio (for The Fylde, Preston, Leyland and Chorley areas of Lancashire).\nNewspapers.\nThe county is served by these local newspapers:\nThe national weekly \"Farmers Guardian\" is published in Fulwood, Preston.\nPlaces of interest.\nThe following are places of interest in the ceremonial county:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50441", "revid": "48539996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50441", "title": "Gang of Four", "text": "Chinese Cultural Revolution faction\nThe Gang of Four () was a Maoist political faction composed of four Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials. They came to prominence during the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976) and were later charged with a series of treasonous crimes due to their responsibility for the excesses and failures in the Cultural Revolution. The gang's leading figure was Jiang Qing (Mao Zedong's last wife). The other members were Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen.\nThe Gang of Four controlled the power organs of the CCP through the later stages of the Cultural Revolution, although it remains unclear which major decisions were made by CCP Chairman Mao Zedong and carried out by the Gang, and which were the result of the Gang of Four's own planning. Following a series of five deaths in 18 months concluding with Mao's, the gang comprised half the remaining members of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee.\nTheir fall did not amount to a rejection of the Cultural Revolution as such; it was organized by the new leader, CCP Chairman Hua Guofeng, and others who had risen during that period. Significant repudiation of the entire process of change came later, with the return of Deng Xiaoping at the 11th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and Hua's gradual loss of authority.\nFormation.\nThe group was led by Jiang Qing, and consisted of three of her close associates, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen. Two other men who were already dead in 1976, Kang Sheng and Xie Fuzhi, were named as having been part of the \"Gang\". Chen Boda and Mao Yuanxin, the latter being Mao's nephew, were also considered some of the Gang's closer associates.\nMost Western accounts consider that the actual leadership of the Cultural Revolution consisted of a wider group, referring predominantly to the members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Most prominent was Lin Biao, until his purported defection from China and death in a plane crash in 1971. Chen Boda is often classed as a member of Lin's faction rather than Jiang Qing's.\nRole.\nAt the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, on November 10, 1965, Yao Wenyuan, in one of his most famous pieces of writing, published an article in \"Wenhuibao\" criticizing the play \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\". The article argued that the opera was actually a sympathetic portrayal of the reformist efforts of the military hero Peng Dehuai and thus an attack on Chairman Mao's Great Leap Forward. Mao subsequently purged Peng from power. The article is cited as the spark that launched the Cultural Revolution.\nJiang Qing staged revolutionary operas during the Cultural Revolution and met with the Red Guards.\nThe removal of this group from power is sometimes considered to have marked the end of the Cultural Revolution, which had been launched by Mao in 1966 as part of his power struggle with leaders such as Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping and Peng Zhen. Mao placed his wife Jiang Qing, a former film actress who before 1966 had not taken a public political role, in charge of the country's cultural apparatus. Zhang, Yao and Wang were party leaders in Shanghai who had played leading roles in securing that city for Mao during the Cultural Revolution.\nAround the time of the death of Lin Biao in 1971, the Cultural Revolution began to lose momentum. The new commanders of the People's Liberation Army demanded that order be restored in light of the dangerous situation along the border with the Soviet Union (see Sino-Soviet split). Premier Zhou Enlai, who had accepted the Cultural Revolution, but never fully supported it, regained his authority, and used it to bring Deng Xiaoping back into the Party leadership at the 10th Party Congress in 1973. Former President Liu Shaoqi had meanwhile died in prison in 1969.\nNear the end of Mao's life, a power struggle occurred between the Gang of Four and the alliance of Deng Xiaoping, Zhou Enlai, and Ye Jianying.\nDownfall.\nZhou Enlai died in January 1976, and, in the subsequent months, a power struggle occurred in the top echelons of the party. The reformist Deng was named acting premier, while the Gang of Four began using their newspapers to criticize Deng and to mobilize their urban militia groups. Much of the military and party security remained under the control of the party elders of the Central Committee, who generally took a cautious role in mediating between the reformist Deng and the radical Gang of Four. They agreed to the removal of Deng from office after the April Tiananmen Incident but took steps to ensure that Deng and his allies would not be personally harmed in the process.\nOn September 9, Chairman Mao died. For the next few weeks the Gang of Four retained control over the government media, and many articles appeared on the theme of \"principles laid down\" (or \"established\") by Mao near the end of his life. (The words \"principles laid down\" were themselves supposedly a quotation from Mao, but their canonical status was in dispute.) Urban militia units commanded by supporters of the radical group were placed on a heightened state of readiness.\nAfter Mao died, the four represented a quarter of the remaining members of the last Politburo Mao had chosen. Premier Hua Guofeng attacked the radicals' media line at a Politburo meeting in late September; but Jiang Qing emphatically disagreed with Hua, and she insisted that she be named as the new party chairman. The meeting ended inconclusively. On October 4 the radical group warned, via an article in the \"Guangming Daily\", that any revisionist who interfered with the established principles would \"come to no good end\".\nThe radicals hoped that the key military leaders Wang Dongxing and Chen Xilian would support them, but instead, Hua won the Army over to his side. On 6 October 1976, Hua had the four leading radicals and a number of their lesser associates arrested. Han Suyin gave a detailed account of their overthrow:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;An emergency session of the Politburo was to take place in the Great Hall of the People that evening. Their presence was required. Since Wang Dongxing had been their ally, they did not suspect him... As they passed through the swinging doors into the entrance lobby, they were apprehended and led off in handcuffs. A special 8341 unit then went to Madam Mao's residence at No. 17 Fisherman's Terrace and arrested her. That night Mao Yuanxin was arrested in Manchuria, and the propagandists of the Gang of Four in Peking University and in newspaper offices were taken into custody. All was done with quiet and efficiency. In Shanghai, the Gang's supporters received a message to come to Beijing \"for a meeting\". They came and were arrested. Thus, without shedding a drop of blood, the plans of the Gang of Four to wield supreme power were ended.\nAccording to historian Immanuel C.Y. Hs\u00fc, the operation was not completely bloodless \u2013 Wang Hongwen killed two of the guards trying to capture him and was wounded himself before being subdued.\nBeginning on 21 October, nationwide denunciations of the Gang began, which culminated in the December release of files related to the Gang's alleged crimes to the public. The party issued a denunciation of the Gang of Four as \"left in form, right in essence\". Government media blamed the Gang of Four and Lin Biao for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. According to both civilian and government accounts, celebrations were prominent and nationwide, not limited to the streets of Beijing and other major cities. During the nationwide \"Movement of Exposition, Criticism and Uncovering (\u63ed\u6279\u67e5\u8fd0\u52a8)\" millions of formerly \"rebel faction\" red guards were publicly criticized as they were thought to be related to the Gang of Four. For many Chinese, the Gang, and its head Jiang Qing in particular, were a living symbol of everything that had gone wrong during the Cultural Revolution and their downfall was taken as a sign that China was on the brink of a new era.\nAftermath.\nImmediately after the arrests, Premier Hua Guofeng, Marshal Ye Jianying, and economic czars Chen Yun and Li Xiannian formed the core of the next party leadership. These four, together with the rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping and Wang Dongxing, were elected party Vice Chairmen at the August 1977 National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. At the politburo level, the membership of all four living marshals, seven other generals and at least five others with close military ties reflected the deep concern for national stability.\nTrial.\nThe Gang of Four trials were part of the communist party's effort to establish an institutionalized justice system.222 The trials were highly visible to the Chinese public thanks to the daily television broadcasts of trial sessions and wide circulation of documentary films about the trials.222\nIn late 1980, the four deposed leaders were subjected to a trial by the Supreme People's Court of China with Jiang Hua presiding; in January 1981, they were convicted of anti-party activities. During the trial, Jiang Qing in particular was extremely defiant, protesting loudly and bursting into tears at some points. She was the only member of the Gang of Four to argue on her own behalf. The defence's argument was that she obeyed the orders of Chairman Mao Zedong at all times. Zhang Chunqiao refused to admit any wrongdoing. Yao Wenyuan and Wang Hongwen expressed repentance and confessed their alleged crimes.\nThe prosecution separated political errors from actual crimes. Among the latter were the usurpation of state power and party leadership; the persecution of some 750,000 people, 34,375 of whom died during the period 1966\u20131976. The official records of the trial have not yet been released.\nAudience members who attended the opening of the trial included selected people's representatives from each province and autonomous region, as well as victims' families including the widows of Liu Shaoqi, He Long, and Luo Ruiqing.223\nJiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao received death sentences that were later commuted to life imprisonment, while Wang Hongwen and Yao Wenyuan were given life and twenty years in prison, respectively. All members of the Gang of Four have since died; Jiang Qing committed suicide in 1991, Wang Hongwen died in 1992, and Yao Wenyuan and Zhang Chunqiao died in 2005, having been released from prison in 1996 and 1998, respectively.\nSupporters of the Gang of Four, including Chen Boda and Mao Yuanxin, were also sentenced.\nUse of the term as a historical analogy.\n\"Little Gang of Four\".\nIn the struggle between Hua Guofeng's and Deng Xiaoping's followers, a new term emerged, pointing to Hua's four closest collaborators, Wang Dongxing, Wu De, Ji Dengkui and Chen Xilian. In 1980, they were charged with \"grave errors\" in the struggle against the Gang of Four and demoted from the Political Bureau to mere Central Committee membership.\nHong Kong's \"Gangs of Four\".\nIn 2013, mainland Chinese state media labelled Anson Chan, Martin Lee, Joseph Zen and Jimmy Lai as 'Hong Kong's \"Gang of Four\"' due to their alleged foreign connections.\nIn 2016, the pro-Beijing newspaper Sing Pao Daily News started publishing editorials that criticized Tung Chee-hwa, Leung Chun-ying, Zhang Xiaoming and Jiang Zaizhong as another 'Hong Kong's Gang of Four'. The articles claim that although all of them appeared to be loyal to Beijing, they were actually betraying it and destabilizing Hong Kong for their personal interest, by igniting social and political conflicts, as well as through other mischievous means.\nIn 2019, Chinese state media labelled Anson Chan, Martin Lee, Jimmy Lai and Albert Ho as yet another 'Gang of Four of Hong Kong' due to their alleged collusion with foreign forces in relation to the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests. The phrase has in turn been denounced by the four individuals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Zhou served under Chairman Mao Zedong and aided the Communist Party in rising to power, later helping consolidate its control, form its foreign policy, and develop the Chinese economy.\nAs a diplomat, Zhou served as the Chinese foreign minister from 1949 to 1958. Advocating peaceful coexistence with the West after the Korean War, he participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference and the 1955 Bandung Conference and helped orchestrate Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. He helped devise policies regarding disputes with the United States, Taiwan, the Soviet Union (after 1960), India, Korea, and Vietnam.\nZhou survived the purges of other top officials during the Cultural Revolution. While Mao dedicated most of his later years to political struggle and ideological work, Zhou was one of the main driving forces behind the affairs of state during much of the Cultural Revolution. His attempts at mitigating the Red Guards' damage and his efforts to protect others from their wrath made him immensely popular in the Cultural Revolution's later stages.\nMao's health began to decline in 1971, and Lin Biao fell into disgrace and later died in a plane crash. Amid these events, Zhou was elected to the vacant position of First Vice Chairman of the Communist Party by the 10th Central Committee in 1973 and thereby designated as Mao's successor (the third person to be so designated after Liu Shaoqi and Lin Biao), but still struggled internally against the Gang of Four over leadership of China. His last major public appearance was at the first meeting of the 4th National People's Congress on 13 January 1975, where he presented the government work report. He then fell out of the public eye for medical treatment and died one year later. The massive public outpouring of grief which his death provoked in Beijing turned to anger at the Gang of Four, leading to the 1976 Tiananmen Incident. Although Zhou was succeeded by Hua Guofeng as First Vice Chairman and designated successor, Zhou's ally Deng Xiaoping was able to outmaneuver the Gang of Four politically and took Hua's place as paramount leader by 1978.\nEarly life.\nYouth.\nZhou Enlai was born in Huai'an, Jiangsu province, on 5 March 1898, the first son of his branch of the Zhou family. The Zhou family was originally started by an official of Shaoxing in Zhejiang province while Zhou Enlai's Gan Jiangxi mother was from Nanchang city. Shaoxing was famous as the home of families such as Zhou's, whose members worked as government \"clerks\" (\u5e2b\u723a, shiye) generation after generation. To move up the ladder in civil service, the men in these families often had to be transferred, and in the late years of the Qing regime, Zhou Enlai's branch of the family moved to Huai'an. Even after the move, however, the family continued to view Shaoxing as its ancestral home.\nZhou's grandfather, Zhou Panlong, and his granduncle, Zhou Jun'ang, were the first members of the family to move to Huai'an. Panlong apparently passed the provincial examinations, and Zhou Enlai later claimed that Panlong served as magistrate governing Huai'an county. Zhou's father, Zhou Yineng, was the second of Zhou Panlong's four sons. Zhou's birth mother, surnamed Wan, was the daughter of a prominent Jiangxi origin official.\nLike many others, the economic fortunes of Zhou's large family of scholar-officials were decimated by a great economic recession that China suffered in the late 19th century. Zhou Yineng had a reputation for honesty, gentleness, intelligence and concern for others, but was also considered \"weak\" and \"lacking in discipline and determination\". He was unsuccessful in his personal life, and drifted across China doing various occupations, working in Beijing, Shandong, Anhui, Liaodong peninsula, Inner Mongolia. Zhou Enlai later remembered his father as being always away from home and generally unable to support his family.\nSoon after birth, Zhou Enlai was adopted by his father's youngest brother, Zhou Yigan, who was ill with tuberculosis. Apparently, the adoption was arranged because the family feared Yigan would die without an heir. Zhou Yigan died soon after the adoption, and Zhou Enlai was raised by Yigan's widow, whose surname was Chen. Madame Chen was also from a scholarly family and received a traditional literary education. According to Zhou's own account, he was very close to his adoptive mother and acquired his lasting interest in Chinese literature and opera from her. Madame Chen taught Zhou to read and write at an early age, and Zhou later claimed to have read the famous vernacular novel \"Journey to the West\" at the age of six. By the age of eight, he was reading other traditional Chinese novels, including \"the Water Margin\", \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", and \"Dream of the Red Chamber\".\nZhou's birth mother Wan died in 1907 when Zhou was 9, and his adoptive mother Chen in 1908 when Zhou was 10. Zhou's father was working in Hubei, far from Jiangsu, so Zhou and his two younger brothers returned to Huai'an and lived with his father's remaining younger brother Yikui for the next two years. In 1910, Zhou's uncle Yigeng, his father's older brother, offered to care for Zhou. The family in Huai'an agreed, and Zhou was sent to stay with his uncle in Manchuria at Fengtian (now Shenyang), where Zhou Yigeng worked in a government office.\nEducation.\nIn Fengtian, Zhou attended the Dongguan Model Academy, a modern-style school. His previous education consisted entirely of homeschooling. In addition to new subjects such as English and science, Zhou was also exposed to the writings of reformers and radicals such as Liang Qichao, Kang Youwei, Chen Tianhua, Zou Rong, and Zhang Binglin. At the age of fourteen, Zhou declared that his motivation for pursuing education was to \"become a great man who will take up the heavy responsibilities of the country in the future.\" In 1913, Zhou's uncle was transferred to Tianjin, where Zhou entered the famous Nankai Middle School.\nNankai Middle School was founded by Yan Xiu, a prominent scholar and philanthropist, and headed by Zhang Boling, one of the most important Chinese educators of the 20th century. Nankai's teaching methods were unusual by contemporary Chinese standards. By the time Zhou began attending, it had adopted the educational model used at the Phillips Academy in the United States. The school's reputation, with its \"highly disciplined\" daily routine and \"strict moral code\", attracted many students who later became prominent in public life. Zhou's friends and classmates there ranged from Ma Jun (an early communist leader executed in 1927) to K. C. Wu (later mayor of Shanghai and governor of Taiwan under the Nationalist party). Zhou's talents also attracted the attention of Yan Xiu and Zhang Boling. Yan in particular thought highly of Zhou, helping to pay for his studies in Japan and later France.\nYan was so impressed with Zhou that he encouraged Zhou to marry his daughter, but Zhou declined. Zhou later expressed the reasons for his decision not to marry Yan's daughter to his classmate, Zhang Honghao. Zhou said that he declined the marriage because he feared that his financial prospects would not be promising, and that Yan would, as his father-in-law, later dominate his life.\nZhou did well in his studies at Nankai; he excelled in Chinese, won several awards in the school speech club, and became editor of the school newspaper in his final year. Zhou was also very active in acting and producing dramas and plays at Nankai; many students who were not otherwise acquainted with him knew of him through his acting. Nankai preserves a number of essays and articles written by Zhou at this time, and these reflect the discipline, training, and concern for country that Nankai's founders attempted to instill in their students. At the school's tenth commencement in June 1917, Zhou was one of five graduating students honored at the ceremony, and one of the two valedictorians.\nBy the time that he graduated from Nankai, Zhang Boling's teachings of \"gong\" (public spirit) and \"neng\" (ability) had made a great impression on him. His participation in debates and stage performances contributed to his eloquence and skills of persuasion. Zhou left Nankai with a great desire to pursue public service, and to acquire the skills required to do so.\nFollowing many of his classmates, Zhou went to Japan in July 1917 for further studies. During his two years in Japan, Zhou spent most of his time in the East Asian Higher Preparatory School, a language school for Chinese students. Zhou's studies were supported by his uncles, and apparently Nankai founder Yan Xiu as well, but their funds were limited; during this period, Japan suffered from severe inflation. Zhou originally planned to win one of the scholarships offered by the Chinese government; these scholarships, however, required Chinese students to pass entrance examinations in Japanese universities. Zhou took entrance examinations for at least two schools but failed to gain admission. Zhou's reported anxieties were compounded by the death of his uncle, Zhou Yikui, his inability to master Japanese, and the acute Japanese cultural chauvinism that discriminated against Chinese. By the time that Zhou returned to China in the spring of 1919, he had become deeply disenchanted with Japanese culture, rejecting the idea that the Japanese political model was relevant to China and disdaining the values of elitism and militarism that he observed.\nZhou's diaries and letters from his time in Tokyo show a deep interest in politics and current events, in particular, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Bolsheviks' new policies. He began to read avidly Chen Duxiu's progressive and left-leaning magazine, \"New Youth\". He read early Japanese works on Marx, and it has been claimed that he even attended Kawakami Hajime's lectures at Kyoto University. Kawakami was an important figure in the early history of Japanese Marxism, and his translations and articles influenced a generation of Chinese communists. However, it now seems unlikely that Zhou met him or heard any of his lectures. Zhou's diaries also show his interest in Chinese student protests in opposition to the Sino-Japanese Joint Defense Agreement in May 1918, but he did not actively participate in them or return to China as part of the \"Returning Home Movement\". His active role in political movements began after his return to China.\nEarly political activities.\nZhou returned to Tianjin sometime in the spring of 1919. Historians disagree over his participation in the May Fourth Movement (May to June 1919). Zhou's \"official\" Chinese biography states that he was a leader of the Tianjin student protests in the May Fourth movement, but many modern scholars believe that it is highly unlikely that Zhou participated at all, based on the total lack of direct evidence among the surviving records from the period. In July 1919, however, Zhou became editor of the Tianjin Student Union Bulletin, apparently at the request of his Nankai classmate, Ma Jun, a founder of the Union. During its brief existence from July 1919 to early 1920, the Bulletin was widely read by student groups around the country and suppressed on at least one occasion by the national government as \"harmful to public safety and social order.\"\nWhen Nankai became a university in August 1919, Zhou was in the first class, but was an activist full-time. His political activities continued to expand, and in September, he and several other students agreed to establish the \"Awakening Society\", a small group, never numbering more than 25. In explaining the goals and purpose of the Awakening Society, Zhou declared that \"anything that is incompatible with progress in current times, such as militarism, the bourgeoisie, partylords, bureaucrats, inequality between men and women, obstinate ideas, obsolete morals, old ethics... should be abolished or reformed\", and affirmed that it was the purpose of the Society to spread this awareness among the Chinese people. It was in this society that Zhou first met his future wife, Deng Yingchao. In some ways, the Awakening Society resembled the clandestine Marxist study group at Peking University headed by Li Dazhao, with the group members using numbers instead of names for \"secrecy\". (Zhou was \"Number Five\", a pseudonym which he continued to use in later years.) Indeed, immediately after the group was established, it invited Li Dazhao to give a lecture on Marxism.\nZhou assumed a more prominent active role in political activities over the next few months. The largest of these activities were rallies in support of a nationwide boycott of Japanese goods. As the boycott became more effective, the national government, under pressure from Japan, attempted to suppress it. On 23 January 1920, a confrontation over boycott activities in Tianjin led to the arrest of a number of people, including several Awakening Society members, and on 29 January Zhou led a march on the Governor's Office in Tianjin to present a petition calling for the arrestees' release. Zhou and three other leaders were themselves arrested. The arrestees were held for over six months; during their detention, Zhou supposedly organized discussions on Marxism. At their trial in July, Zhou and six others were sentenced to two months; the rest were found not guilty. All were immediately released since they had already been held over six months.\nAfter Zhou's release, he and the Awakening Society met with several Beijing organizations and agreed to form a \"Reform Federation\"; during these activities Zhou became more familiar with Li Dazhao and met Zhang Shenfu, who was the contact between Li in Beijing and Chen Duxiu in Shanghai. Both men were organizing underground Communist cells in cooperation with Grigori Voitinsky, a Comintern agent, but Zhou apparently did not meet Voitinsky at this point.\nSoon after his release, Zhou decided to go to Europe to study. (He was expelled from Nankai University during his detention.) Although money was a problem, he received a scholarship from Yan Xiu. In order to gain greater funding, he successfully approached a Tianjin newspaper, \"Yishi bao\" (literally, Current Events Newspaper), for work as a \"special correspondent\" in Europe. Zhou left Shanghai for Europe on 7 November 1920 with a group of 196 work study students, including friends from Nankai and Tianjin.\nZhou's experiences after the May Fourth incident seem to have been crucial to his Communist career. Zhou's friends in the Awakening Society were similarly affected. 15 of the group's members became Communists for at least some time, and the group remained close later on. Zhou and six other group members travelled to Europe in the next two years, and Zhou eventually married Deng Yingchao, the group's youngest member.\nEuropean activities.\nZhou's group arrived in Marseille on 13 December 1920. Unlike most other Chinese students, who went to Europe on work-study programs, Zhou's scholarship and position with \"Yishi bao\" meant that he was well provided for and did not have to do any work during his stay. Because of his financial position, he was able to devote himself full-time to revolutionary activities. In a letter to his cousin on 30 January 1921, Zhou said that his goals in Europe were to survey the social conditions in foreign countries and their methods of resolving social issues, in order to apply such lessons in China after his return. In the same letter, Zhou told his cousin that, regarding his adoption of a specific ideology, \"I still have to make up my mind.\"\nWhile in Europe, Zhou, also named as John Knight, studied the differing approaches to resolving class conflict adopted by various European nations. In London in January 1921, Zhou witnessed a large miners' strike and wrote a series of articles for the \"Yishi bao\" (generally sympathetic to the miners) examining the conflict between workers and employers, and the conflict's resolution. After five weeks in London he moved to Paris, where interest in Russia's 1917 October Revolution was high. In a letter to his cousin, Zhou identified two broad paths of reform for China: \"gradual reform\" (as in England) or \"violent means\" (as in Russia). Zhou wrote that \"I do not have a preference for either the Russian or the British way... I would prefer something in-between, rather than one of these two extremes\".\nStill interested in academic programs, Zhou traveled to Britain in January 1921 to visit Edinburgh University. Concerned by financial problems and language requirements, he did not enroll, returning to France at the end of January. There are no records of Zhou entering any academic program in France. In spring 1921, he joined a Chinese Communist cell. Zhou was recruited by Zhang Shenfu, whom he had met in August of the previous year in connection with Li Dazhao. He also knew Zhang through Zhang's wife, Liu Qingyang, a member of the Awakening Society. Zhou has sometimes been portrayed at this time as uncertain in his politics, but his swift move to Communism suggests otherwise.\nThe cell Zhou belonged to was based in Paris; in addition to Zhou, Zhang, and Liu it included two other students, Zhao Shiyan and Chen Gongpei. Over the next several months, this group eventually formed a united organization with a group of Chinese radicals from Hunan, who were living in Montargis south of Paris. This group included such later prominent figures as Cai Hesen, Li Lisan, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Deng Xiaoping, and also Guo Longzhen, another member of the Awakening Society. Unlike Zhou, most of the students in this group were participants in the work-study program. A series of conflicts with the Chinese administrators of the program over low pay and poor working conditions resulted in over a hundred students occupying the program's offices at the Sino-French Institute in Lyon in September 1921. The students, including several people from the Montargis group, were arrested and deported. Zhou was apparently not one of the occupying students and remained in France until February or March 1922, when he moved with Zhang and Liu from Paris to Berlin. Zhou's move to Berlin was perhaps because the relatively \"lenient\" political atmosphere in Berlin made it more favorable as a base for overall European organizing. In addition, the Western European Secretariat of the Comintern was located in Berlin and it is clear that Zhou had important Comintern connections, though the nature of these is disputed. After moving operations to Germany, Zhou regularly shuttled between Paris and Berlin.\nZhou participated in the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement.37\nZhou returned to Paris by June 1922, where he was one of the twenty two participants present at the organization of the Chinese Youth Communist Party, established as the European Branch of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhou helped draft the party's charter and was elected to the three member executive committee as director of propaganda. He also wrote for and helped edit the party magazine, \"Shaonian\" (Youth), later renamed \"Chiguang\" (Red Light). It was in Zhou's capacity as general editor of this magazine that Zhou first met Deng Xiaoping, only seventeen years old, whom Zhou hired to operate a mimeograph (copy) machine. The party went through several reorganizations and name changes, but Zhou remained a key member of the group throughout his stay in Europe. Other important activities Zhou undertook included recruiting and transporting students for the University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow, and the establishment of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) European branch.\nIn June 1923, the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party accepted the Comintern's instructions to ally with the KMT, led at the time by Sun Yat-sen. These instructions called for CCP members to join the Nationalist Party as \"individuals\", while still retaining their association with the CCP. After joining the KMT, they would work to lead and direct it, transforming it into a vehicle of revolution. Within several years, this strategy would become the source of serious conflict between the KMT and the CCP.\nAs well as joining the KMT, Zhou helped organize the founding of the Nationalist Party European branch in November 1923. Under Zhou's influence, most of the European branch's officers were in fact communists. Zhou's wide-ranging contacts and personal relationships formed during this period were central to his career. Important party leaders, such as Zhu De and Nie Rongzhen, were first admitted to the party by Zhou.\nBy 1924, the Soviet-Nationalist alliance was expanding rapidly and Zhou was summoned back to China for further work. He left Europe probably in late July 1924, returning to China as one of the most senior Chinese Communist Party members in Europe.\nPolitical and military work in Whampoa.\nEstablishment in Guangzhou.\nZhou returned to China in late August or early September 1924 to join the Political Department of the Whampoa Military Academy, probably through the influence of Zhang Shenfu, who had previously worked there. Zhou was Whampoa's chief political officer.55 While he was serving in Whampoa, Zhou was also made the secretary of the Communist Party of Guangdong-Guangxi, and served as the CCP representative with the rank of major-general.\nThe island of Whampoa, ten miles downriver from Guangzhou, was at the heart of the Soviet-Nationalist Party alliance. Conceived as the training center of the Nationalist Party Army, it was to provide the military base from which the Nationalists would launch their campaign to unify China, which was split into dozens of military satrapies. From its beginning, the school was funded, armed, and partly staffed by the Soviets.\nThe Political Department, where Zhou worked, was responsible for political indoctrination and control. As a result, Zhou was a prominent figure at most Academy meetings, often addressing the school immediately after commandant Chiang Kai-shek. He was extremely influential in establishing the political department/party representative (commissar) system which was adopted in Nationalist armed forces in 1925.\nConcurrent with his Whampoa appointment, Zhou became secretary of the Communist Party's Guangdong Provincial Committee, and at some point a member of the Provincial Committee's Military Section. Zhou vigorously extended Communist influence at the academy. He soon arranged for a number of other prominent Communists to join the Political Department, including Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Yun Daiying, and Xiong Xiong. Zhou played an important role in establishing the Young Soldiers Association, a youth group which was dominated by the Communists, and Sparks, a short-lived Communist front group. He thus recruited numerous new Communist party members from cadet ranks, and eventually set up a covert Communist Party branch at the academy to direct the new members. When Nationalists concerned with the increasing number of Communist members and organizations at Whampoa set up a \"Society for Sun Yat-senism\", Zhou attempted to squelch it; the conflict between these student groups set the background for Zhou's removal from the academy.\nMilitary activities.\nZhou participated in two military operations conducted by the Nationalist regime in 1925, later known as the first and second Eastern Expeditions. The first was in January 1925 when Chen Jiongming, an important Cantonese military leader previously driven out of Guangzhou by Sun Yat-sen, attempted to retake Guangzhou. The Nationalist regime's campaign against Chen consisted of forces from the Guangdong Army under Xu Chongzhi, and two training regiments of the Nationalist Party Army, led by Chiang Kai-shek and staffed by Academy officers and cadets. The fighting lasted through May 1925, with the defeat, but not destruction, of Chen's forces. Zhou accompanied the Whampoa cadets on the expedition as a political officer.\nWhen Chen regrouped and attacked Guangzhou again in September 1925, the Nationalists launched a second expedition. Nationalist forces by this time had been reorganized into five corps (or armies) and adopted the commissar system with Political Departments and Nationalist party representatives in most divisions. The First Corps, made up of the Nationalist Party Army, was led by Whampoa graduates and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, who personally appointed Zhou director of the First Corps Political Department. Soon after, the Nationalist Party's Central Executive Committee appointed Zhou Nationalist Party party representative, making Zhou chief commissar of the First Corps. The first major battle of expedition saw the capture of Chen's base in Huizhou on 15 October. Shantou was taken on 6 November, and by the end of 1925, the Nationalists controlled all of Guangdong province.\nZhou's appointment as chief commissar of the First Corps allowed him to appoint Communists as commissars in four of the Corps' five divisions. Following the conclusion of the Expedition, Zhou was appointed special commissioner for the East River District, which placed him in temporary administrative control of several counties; he apparently used this opportunity to establish a Communist party branch in Shantou and strengthen the CCP's control of local unions. This marked the high point of Zhou's time at Whampoa.\nPolitical activities.\nIn personal terms, 1925 was also an important year for Zhou. Zhou had kept in touch with Deng Yingchao, whom he had met in the Awakening Society while in Tianjin; and, in January 1925, Zhou asked for and received permission from CCP authorities to marry Deng. The two married in Guangzhou on 8 August 1925.\nZhou's work at Whampoa came to an end with the Zhongshan Warship Incident of 20 March 1926, in which a gunboat with a mostly Communist crew moved from Whampoa to Guangzhou without Chiang's knowledge or approval. This event led to Chiang's exclusion of Communists from the academy by May 1926, and the removal of numerous Communists from high positions in the Nationalist Party. In his memoirs, Nie Rongzhen suggested that the gunboat had moved in protest of Zhou Enlai's (brief) arrest.\nZhou's time in Whampoa was a significant period in his career. His pioneering work as a political officer in the military made him an important Communist Party expert in this key area; much of his later career centered on the military. Zhou's work in the CCP Guangdong Regional Committee Military Section was typical of his covert activities in the period. The Section was a secret group consisting of three members of the Provincial Central Committee, and was first responsible for organizing and directing CCP nuclei in the army itself. These nuclei, organized at the regimental level and above, were \"illegal\", meaning they were formed without Nationalist knowledge or authorization. The Section was also responsible for organizing similar nuclei in other armed groups, including secret societies and key services such as railroads and waterways. Zhou did extensive work in these areas until the final separation of the Nationalist and Communist parties and the end of the Soviet-Nationalist alliance in 1927.\nNationalist-Communist split.\nExtent of cooperation.\nZhou's activities immediately after his removal from his positions at Whampoa are uncertain. An earlier biographer claims that Chiang Kai-shek put Zhou in charge of \"an advanced training center for the CCP members and commissars withdrawn from the army\". More recent Chinese Communist sources claim that Zhou had an important role at this time in securing Communist control of Ye Ting's Independent Regiment. The regiment and Ye Ting later played a leading role in the Communists' first major military action, the Nanchang Revolt.\nIn July 1926, the Nationalists began the Northern Expedition, a massive military attempt to unify China. The Expedition was led by Chiang Kai-shek and the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), an amalgam of earlier military forces with significant guidance from Russian military advisors and numerous Communists as both commanding and political officers. With the early successes of the Expedition, there was soon a race between Chiang Kai-shek leading the \"right-wing\" of the Nationalist Party and the Communists, running inside the \"left-wing\" of the Nationalists, for control of major southern cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai. At this point the Chinese portion of Shanghai was controlled by Sun Chuanfang, one of the militarists targeted by the North Expedition. Distracted by fighting with the NRA and defections from his army, Sun reduced his forces in Shanghai, and the Communists, whose party headquarters was located in Shanghai, made three attempts to seize control of the city, later called \"the three Shanghai Uprisings\", in October 1926, February 1927 and March 1927.\nActivities in Shanghai.\nZhou was transferred to Shanghai to assist in these activities, probably in late 1926. It seems he was not present for the first uprising on 23\u201324 October, but he was certainly in Shanghai by December 1926. Early accounts credit Zhou with labor organizing activities in Shanghai after his arrival, or, more credibly, working to \"strengthen the indoctrination of political workers in labor unions and smuggle arms for the strikers.\" Reports that Zhou \"organized\" or \"ordered\" the second and third uprisings on 20 February and 21 March exaggerate his role. Major decisions during this period were made by the Communist head in Shanghai, Chen Duxiu, the Party's general secretary, with a special committee of eight party officials coordinating Communist actions. The committee also consulted closely on decisions with the Comintern representatives in Shanghai, headed by Grigori Voitinsky. The partial documentation available for this period shows that Zhou headed the Communist Party Central Committee's Military Commission in Shanghai. He participated in both the February and March actions, but was not the guiding hand in either event, instead working with A. P. Appen, the Soviet military advisor to the Central Committee, training the pickets of the General Labor Union, the Communist controlled labor organization in Shanghai. He also worked to make union strong arm squads more effective when the Communists declared a \"Red Terror\" after the failed February uprising; this action resulted in the murder of twenty \"anti-union\" figures, and the kidnapping, beating, and intimidation of others associated with anti-union activities.\nThe third Communist uprising in Shanghai took place from 20 to 21 March. Approximately 600,000 rioting workers cut power and telephone lines and seized the city's post office, police headquarters, and railway stations, often after heavy fighting. During this uprising, the insurrectionists were under strict orders not to harm foreigners, which they obeyed. The forces of Sun Chuanfang withdrew and the uprising was successful, despite the small number of armed forces available. The first Nationalist troops entered the city the next day.\nAs the Communists attempted to install a soviet municipal government, conflict began between the Nationalists and Communists, and on 12 April Nationalist forces, including both members of the Green Gang and soldiers under the command of Nationalist general Pai Ch'ung-hsi attacked the Communists and quickly overcame them. On the eve of the Nationalist attack, Wang Shouhua, who was both the head of the CCP Labor Committee and the Chairman of the General Labor Committee, accepted a dinner invitation from \"Big-eared Du\" (a Shanghai gangster) and was strangled after he arrived. Zhou himself was nearly killed in a similar trap, when he was arrested after arriving at a dinner held at the headquarters of Si Lie, a Nationalist commander of Chiang's Twenty-sixth Army. Despite rumors that Chiang had put a high price on Zhou's head, he was quickly released by Pai Ch'ung-hsi's forces. The reasons for Zhou's sudden release may have been that Zhou was then the most senior Communist in Shanghai, that Chiang's efforts to exterminate the Shanghai Communists were highly secretive at the time, and that his execution would have been noticed as a violation of the cooperation agreement between the CCP and the KMT (which was technically still in effect). Zhou was finally only released after the intervention of a representative of the Twenty-sixth Army, Zhao Shu, who was able to convince his commanders that the arrest of Zhou had been a mistake.\nFlight from Shanghai.\nFleeing Shanghai, Zhou made his way to Hankou (now part of Wuhan) and was a participant at the CCP's 5th National Congress there from 27 April to 9 May. At the end of the Congress, Zhou was elected to the Party's Central Committee, again heading the military department. After Chiang Kai-shek's suppression of the Communists, the Nationalist Party split in two, with the Nationalist Party's \"left-wing\" (led by Wang Jingwei) controlling the government in Hankou, and the party \"right-wing\" (led by Chiang Kai-shek) establishing a rival government in Nanjing. Still following Comintern instructions, the Communists remained as a \"bloc inside\" the Nationalist Party, hoping to continue expanding their influence through the Nationalists. After being attacked by a warlord friendly to Chiang, Wang's leftist government disintegrated later in May 1927, and Chiang's troops began an organized purge of Communists in territories formerly controlled by Wang. In mid-July Zhou was forced to go underground.\nPressured by their Comintern advisors, and themselves convinced that the \"revolutionary high tide\" had arrived, the Communists decided to launch a series of military revolts. The first of these was the Nanchang Revolt. Zhou was sent to oversee the event, but the moving figures seem to have been Tan Pingshan and Li Lisan, while the main military figures were Ye Ting and He Long. In military terms, the revolt was a disaster, with the Communists' forces decimated and scattered.\nZhou himself contracted malaria during the campaign and was secretly sent to Hong Kong for medical treatment by Nie Rongzhen and Ye Ting. After reaching Hong Kong, Zhou was disguised as a businessman named \"Li\" and entrusted to the care of local Communists. In a subsequent meeting of the CCP Central Committee, Zhou was blamed for the failure of the Nanchang campaign and temporarily demoted to being an alternate member of the Politburo.\nActivities during the Chinese Civil War.\nThe Sixth Party Congress.\nAfter the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, Zhou left China for the Soviet Union to attend the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Sixth National Party Congress in Moscow, in June\u2013July 1928. The Sixth Congress had to be held in Moscow because conditions in China were considered dangerous. KMT control was so tight that many Chinese delegates attending the Sixth Congress were forced to travel in disguise: Zhou himself was disguised as an antiquarian.\nAt the Sixth Congress, Zhou delivered a long speech insisting that conditions in China were unfavorable for immediate revolution, and that the main task of the CCP should be to develop revolutionary momentum by winning over the support of the masses in the countryside and establishing a Soviet regime in southern China, similar to the one that Mao Zedong and Zhu De were already establishing around Jiangxi. The Congress generally accepted Zhou's assessment as accurate. Xiang Zhongfa was made secretary general of the Party, but was soon found incapable of fulfilling his role, so Zhou emerged as the \"de facto\" leader of the CCP. Zhou was only thirty years old.\nDuring the Sixth Congress, Zhou was elected Director of the Central Committee Organization Department. His ally, Li Lisan, took over propaganda work. Zhou finally returned to China, after more than a year abroad, in 1929. At the Sixth Congress in Moscow, Zhou had given figures indicating that, by 1928, fewer than 32,000 union members remained who were loyal to the Communists, and that only ten percent of Party members were proletarians. By 1929, only three percent of the Party were proletarians.\nIn early 1930, Zhou began to disagree with the timing of Li Lisan's strategy of favoring rich peasants and concentrating military forces for attacks on urban centers. Zhou did not openly break with these more orthodox notions, and even tried to implement them later, in 1931, in Jiangxi. When the Soviet agent Pavel Mif arrived in Shanghai to lead the Comintern in China in December 1930, Mif criticized Li's strategy as \"left adventurism\", and criticized Zhou for compromising with Li. Zhou \"acknowledged\" his mistakes in compromising with Li in January 1931 and offered to resign from the Politburo, but was retained while other senior CCP leaders, including Li Lisan and Qu Qiubai, were removed. As Mao later recognized, Mif understood that Zhou's services as Party leader were indispensable, and that Zhou would willingly cooperate with whoever was holding power.\nUnderground work: establishment.\nAfter arriving back in Shanghai in 1929, Zhou began to work underground, establishing and overseeing a network of independent Communist cells. Zhou's greatest danger in his underground work was the threat of being discovered by the KMT secret police, which had been established in 1928 with the specific mission of identifying and eliminating Communists. In order to avoid detection, Zhou and his wife changed residences at least once a month and used a variety of aliases. Zhou often disguised himself as a businessman, sometimes wearing a beard. Zhou was careful that only two or three people ever knew his whereabouts. Zhou disguised all urban Party offices, made sure that CCP offices never shared the same buildings when in the same city, and required all Party members to use passwords to identify one another. Zhou restricted all of his meetings to either before 7\u00a0am or after 7\u00a0pm. Zhou never used public transportation and avoided being seen in public places.\nIn November 1928, the CCP also established its own intelligence agency (the \"Special Service section of the Central Committee\", or \"Zhongyang Teke\" (), often abbreviated as \"Teke\"), which Zhou subsequently came to control. Zhou's chief lieutenants were Gu Shunzhang, who had strong ties to Chinese secret societies and became an alternate member of the Politburo, and Xiang Zhongfa. \"Teke\" had four operational sections: one for the protection and safety of Party members; one for intelligence gathering; one for facilitating internal communications; and one to conduct assassinations, a team that became known as the \"Red Squad\" ().\nZhou's main concern in running \"Teke\" was to establish an effective anti-espionage network within the KMT secret police. Within a short amount of time the head of \"Teke\"'s intelligence section, Chen Geng, succeeded in planting a large network of moles inside the Investigation Section of the Central Operations Department in Nanjing, which was the center of KMT intelligence. The three most successful agents used by Zhou to infiltrate the KMT secret police were Qian Zhuangfei, Li Kenong, and Hu Di, whom Zhou referred to as \"the three most distinguished intelligence workers of the Party\" in the 1930s. Agents planted within various KMT offices were later critical in the survival of the CCP, helping the Party escape Chiang's Encirclement Campaigns.\nKMT response to Zhou's intelligence work.\nIn late April 1931, Zhou's chief aide in security affairs, Gu Shunzhang, was arrested by the KMT in Wuhan. Gu was a former labor organizer with strong mafia connections and weak commitments to the CCP. Under threat of heavy torture, Gu gave the KMT secret police detailed accounts of underground CCP organizations in Wuhan, leading to the arrest and executions of over ten senior CCP leaders in the city. Gu offered to provide the KMT with details of CCP activities in Shanghai, but only if he could give the information directly to Chiang Kai-shek.\nOne of Zhou's agents working in Nanjing, Qian Zhuangfei, intercepted a telegram requesting further instructions from Nanjing on how to proceed, and abandoned his cover to personally warn Zhou of the impending crackdown. The two days before Gu arrived in Nanjing to meet with Chiang gave Zhou time to evacuate Party members and to change the communication codes used by \"Teke\", all of which were known to Gu. After meeting briefly with Chiang in Nanjing, Gu arrived in Shanghai and assisted the KMT secret police in raiding CCP offices and residences, capturing members who could not be evacuated in time. The summary executions of those suspected of Communist sympathies resulted in the largest death-toll since the Shanghai massacre of 1927.\nZhou's reaction to Gu's betrayal was extreme. More than fifteen members of Gu's family, some of whom worked for \"Teke\", were murdered by the Red Squad and buried in quiet residential areas of Shanghai. The Red Squad then assassinated Wang Bing, a leading member of the KMT secret police who was known for moving around Shanghai in rickshaws, without the protection of bodyguards. Most surviving CCP members were relocated to the Communist base in Jiangxi. Because most senior staff had become exposed by Gu, most of its best agents were also relocated. Zhou's most senior aide not yet under suspicion, Pan Hannian, became \"Teke\"'s director.\nThe night before he was scheduled to leave Shanghai in June 1931, Xiang Zhongfa, who was one of Zhou's most senior agents, decided to spend the night in a hotel with his mistress, ignoring Zhou's warnings about the danger. In the morning, a KMT informant who had been trailing Xiang spotted him as he was leaving the hotel. Xiang was immediately arrested and imprisoned within the French Concession. Zhou attempted to prevent Xiang's expected extradition to KMT-controlled China by having his agents bribe the chief of police in the French Concession, but the KMT authorities appealed directly to the authorities of the French Concession, ensuring that the chief of police could not intervene. Zhou's hopes that Xiang would be transferred to Nanjing, giving him an opportunity to kidnap Xiang, also came to naught. The French agreed to transfer Xiang to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, under the command of General Xiong Shihui, who subjected Xiang to relentless torture and interrogation. Once he became convinced that Xiang had given his torturers all the information that they requested, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang to be executed.\nZhou Enlai later succeeded in secretly purchasing a copy of Xiang's interrogation records. The records showed that Xiang had disclosed everything to the KMT authorities before his execution, including the location of Zhou's residence. Another round of arrests and executions followed Xiang's capture, but Zhou and his wife were able to escape capture because they had abandoned their apartment on the morning of Xiang's arrest. After establishing a new Politburo Standing Committee in Shanghai, Zhou and his wife relocated to the Communist base in Jiangxi near the end of 1931. By the time Zhou left Shanghai, he was one of the most wanted men in China.\nThe Jiangxi Soviet.\nFollowing the failed Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings of 1927, the Communists began to focus on establishing a series of rural bases of operation in southern China. Even before moving to Jiangxi, Zhou had become involved in the politics of these bases. Mao, claiming the need to eliminate counterrevolutionaries and Anti-Bolsheviks operating within the CCP, began an ideological purge of the populace inside the Jiangxi Soviet. Zhou, perhaps due to his own success planting moles within various levels of the KMT, agreed that an organized campaign to uncover subversion was justified, and supported the campaign as de facto leader of the CCP.\nMao's efforts soon developed into a ruthless campaign driven by paranoia and aimed not only at KMT spies, but at anyone with an ideological outlook different from Mao's. Suspects were commonly tortured until they confessed to their crimes and accused others of crimes, and wives and relatives who inquired of those being tortured were themselves arrested and tortured even more severely. Mao's attempts to purge the Red Army of those who might potentially oppose him led Mao to accuse Chen Yi, the commander and political commissar of the Jiangxi Military Region, as a counterrevolutionary, provoking a violent reaction against Mao's persecutions that became known as the \"Futian Incident\" in January 1931. Mao was eventually successful in subduing the Red Army, reducing its numbers from forty thousand to less than ten thousand. The campaign continued throughout 1930 and 1931. Historians estimate the total number who died due to Mao's persecution in all base areas to be approximately one hundred thousand.\nThe entire campaign occurred while Zhou was still in Shanghai. Although he had supported the elimination of counterrevolutionaries, Zhou actively suppressed the campaign when he arrived in Jiangxi in December 1931, criticizing the \"excess, the panic, and the oversimplification\" practiced by local officials. After investigating those accused of anti-Bolshevism, and those persecuting them, Zhou submitted a report criticizing the campaign for focusing on the narrow persecution of anti-Maoists as anti-Bolsheviks, exaggerating the threat to the Party, and condemning the use of torture as an investigative technique. Zhou's resolution was passed and adopted on 7 January 1932, and the campaign gradually subsided.\nZhou moved to the Jiangxi base area and shook up the propaganda-oriented approach to revolution by demanding that the armed forces under Communist control actually be used to expand the base, rather than just to control and defend it. In December 1931, Zhou replaced Mao Zedong as Secretary of the First Front Army with Xiang Ying, and made himself political commissar of the Red Army, in place of Mao. Liu Bocheng, Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai all criticized Mao's tactics at the October 1932 Ningdu Conference.\nAfter moving to Jiangxi, Zhou met Mao for the first time since 1927, and began his long relationship with Mao as his superior. In the Ningdu conference, Mao was demoted to being a figurehead in the Soviet government. Zhou, who had come to appreciate Mao's strategies after the series of military failures waged by other Party leaders since 1927, defended Mao, but was unsuccessful. After achieving power, Mao later purged or demoted those who had opposed him in 1932, but remembered Zhou's defense of his policies.\nChiang's Encirclement Campaigns.\nIn early 1933, Bo Gu arrived with the German Comintern advisor Otto Braun and took control of party affairs. Zhou at this time, apparently with strong support from Party and military colleagues, reorganized and standardized the Red Army. Under Zhou, Bo, and Braun, the Red Army defeated four attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops. The military structure that led the Communists to victory was:\nChiang's fifth campaign, launched in September 1933, was much more difficult to contain. Chiang's new use of \"blockhouse tactics\" and larger numbers of troops allowed his army to advance steadily into Communist territory, and they succeeded in seizing several major Communist strongholds. Bo Gu and Otto Braun adopted orthodox tactics to respond to Chiang, and Zhou, although personally opposed to them, directed these. Following their subsequent defeat, he and other military leaders were blamed.\nAlthough Zhou's subsequently cautious military approach was distrusted by hardliners, he was again appointed to the position of vice chairman of the Military Commission. Zhou was accepted as leader largely because of his organizational talent and devotion to work, and because he had never shown any overt ambition to pursue supreme power within the Party. Within months, the continuing orthodox tactics of Bo and Braun led to a serious defeat for the Red Army, and forced the leaders of the CCP to seriously consider abandoning their bases in Jiangxi.\nThe Long March.\nAfter the decision to abandon Jiangxi was announced, Zhou was placed in charge of organizing and supervising the logistics of the Communist withdrawal. Making his plans in absolute secrecy and waiting till the last moment to inform even senior leaders of the group's movements, Zhou's objective was to break through the enemy encirclement with as few casualties as possible, and before Chiang's forces were able to completely occupy all Communist bases. It is not known what criteria were used to determine who would stay and who would go, but 16,000 troops and some of the Communists' most notable commanders at the time (including Xiang Ying, Chen Yi, Tan Zhenlin, and Qu Qiubai) were left to form a rear guard to divert the main force of Nationalist troops from noticing the Communists' general withdrawal.\nThe withdrawal of 84,000 soldiers and civilians began in early October 1934. Zhou's intelligence agents were successful in identifying a large section of Chiang's blockhouse lines that were manned by troops under General Chen Jitang, a Guangdong warlord who Zhou identified as being likely to prefer preserving the strength of his troops over fighting. Zhou sent Pan Hannian to negotiate for safe passage with General Chen, who subsequently allowed the Red Army to pass through the territory that he controlled without fighting.\nAfter passing through three of the four blockhouse fortifications needed to escape Chiang's encirclement, the Red Army was finally intercepted by regular Nationalist troops, and suffered heavy casualties. Of the 86,000 Communists who attempted to break out of Jiangxi, only 36,000 successfully escaped. This loss demoralized some Communist leaders (particularly Bo Gu and Otto Braun), but Zhou remained calm and retained his command.\nDuring the Communists' subsequent Long March, there were numerous high-level disputes over the direction that the Communists should take, and on the causes of the Red Army's defeats. During the power struggles that ensued, Zhou consistently backed Mao Zedong against the interests of Bo Gu and Otto Braun. Bo and Braun were later blamed for the Red Army's defeats, and were eventually removed from their positions of leadership. The Communists eventually succeeded in re-establishing a base in northern Shaanxi on 20 October 1935, arriving with only 8,000\u20139,000 remaining members.\nZhou's position within the CCP changed numerous times throughout the Long March. By the early 1930s, Zhou was recognized as the \"de facto\" leader of the CCP, and exercised superior influence over other members of the CCP even when sharing power with Bo and Braun. In the months following the January 1935 Zunyi Conference, in which Bo and Braun were removed from senior positions, Zhou mostly retained his position because he displayed a willingness to display responsibility, because his tactics in defeating Chiang's Fourth Encirclement Campaign were recognized as being successful, and because he supported Mao Zedong, who was gaining influence inside the Party: after the Zunyi Conference, Mao became Zhou's assistant. After the Communists reached Shaanxi and completed the Long March, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the CCP, while Zhou took a secondary position as vice-chairman. Mao and Zhou would retain their positions within the CCP until their deaths in 1976.\nZhou was unsuccessful in averting the public defection of Zhang Guotao, one of the founders of the CCP, to the KMT. Zhang was prepared to defect due to a disagreement with Mao Zedong over the implementation of the united front policy, and because he resented Mao's authoritarian leadership style. Zhou, with the aid of Wang Ming, Bo Gu and Li Kenong, intercepted Zhang after he arrived in Wuhan, and engaged in extensive negotiations through April 1938, in order to convince Zhang not to defect, but these negotiations were unsuccessful. In the end, Zhang refused to compromise and placed himself under the protection of the KMT secret police. On 18 April, the CCP Central Committee expelled Zhang from the Party, and Zhang himself issued a statement accusing the CCP of sabotaging efforts to resist the Japanese. The entire episode was a serious setback for Zhou's attempts to improve the prestige of the Party.\nThe Xi'an Incident.\nDuring the seventh congress of the Comintern, held in August 1936, Wang Ming issued an anti-Fascist manifesto, indicating that the CCP's previous policy of \"opposing Chiang Kai-shek and resisting Japan\" was to be replaced by a policy of \"uniting with Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan\". Zhou was instrumental in carrying out this policy. Zhou made contact with one of the most senior KMT commanders in the northwest, Zhang Xueliang. By 1935, Zhang was well known for his anti-Japanese sentiments and his doubts about Chiang's willingness to oppose the Japanese. Zhang's disposition made him easily influenced by Zhou's indications that the CCP would cooperate to fight against the Japanese.\nZhou established a \"northeast working committee\" for the purpose of promoting cooperation with Zhang. The committee worked to persuade Zhang's Northeast Army to unite with the Red Army to fight Japan and retake Manchuria. The committee also created new patriotic slogans, including \"Chinese must not fight Chinese\", to promote Zhou's goals. Using his network of secret contacts, Zhou arranged a meeting with Zhang in Yan'an, then controlled by Zhang's \"Northeast Army\".\nThe first meeting between Zhou and Zhang occurred inside a church on 7 April 1936. Zhang showed a great interest in ending the civil war, uniting the country, and fighting the Japanese, but warned that Chiang was firmly in control of the national government, and that these goals would be difficult to pursue without Chiang's cooperation. Both parties ended their meeting with an agreement to find a way to secretly work together. At the same time that Zhou was establishing secret contacts with Zhang, Chiang was growing suspicious of Zhang, and became increasingly dissatisfied with Zhang's inaction against the Communists. In order to deceive Chiang, Zhou and Zhang deployed mock military units in order to give the impression that the Northeast Army and the Red Army were engaged in battle.\nIn December 1936, Chiang Kai-shek flew to the Nationalist headquarters in Xi'an in order to test the loyalty of local KMT military forces under Marshal Zhang Xueliang, and to personally lead these forces in a final attack on Communist bases in Shaanxi, which Zhang had been ordered to destroy. Determined to force Chiang to direct China's forces against the Japanese (who had taken Zhang's territory of Manchuria and were preparing a broader invasion), on 12 December Zhang and his followers stormed Chiang's headquarters, killed most of his bodyguards, and seized the Generalissimo in what became known as the Xi'an Incident.\nReactions to Chiang's kidnapping in Yan'an were mixed. Some, including Mao Zedong and Zhu De, viewed it as an opportunity to have Chiang killed. Others, including Zhou Enlai and Zhang Wentian, saw it as an opportunity to achieve a united-front policy against the Japanese, which would strengthen the overall position of the CCP. Debate within Yan'an ended when a long telegram from Joseph Stalin arrived, urging the CCP to work towards Chiang's release, explaining that a united front was the best position from which to resist the Japanese, and that only Chiang had the prestige and authority to carry out such a plan.\nAfter initial communications with Zhang on the fate of Chiang, Zhou Enlai reached Xi'an on 16 December, on a plane specifically sent for him by Zhang Xueliang, as the chief Communist negotiator. At first, Chiang was opposed to negotiating with a CCP delegate, but withdrew his opposition when it became clear that his life and freedom were largely dependent on Communist goodwill towards him. On 24 December, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time that the two had seen each other since Zhou had left Whampoa over ten years earlier. Zhou began the conversation by saying, \"In the ten years since we have met, you seem to have aged very little.\" Chiang nodded and said: \"Enlai, you were my subordinate. You should do what I say.\" Zhou replied that if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang's command. By the end of this meeting, Chiang promised to end the civil war, to resist the Japanese together, and to invite Zhou to Nanjing for further talks.\nOn 25 December 1936, Zhang released Chiang and accompanied him to Nanjing. Subsequently, Zhang was court-martialed and sentenced to house arrest, and most of the officers who participated in the Xi'an Incident were executed. Although the KMT formally rejected collaboration with the CCP, Chiang ended active military activity against Communist bases in Yan'nan, implying that he had implicitly given his word to change the direction of his policies. Following the end of KMT attacks, the CCP was able to consolidate its territories and to prepare to resist the Japanese.\nAfter news arrived that Zhang had been betrayed and arrested by Chiang, Zhang's old officer corps became very agitated, and some of them murdered a Nationalist general, Wang Yizhe, who was seen as largely responsible for the military's lack of response. While Zhou was still in Xi'an, he himself was surrounded in his office by a number of Zhang's officers, who accused the Communists of instigating the Xi'an Incident and of betraying Zhang by convincing the general to travel to Nanjing. At gunpoint, they threatened to kill Zhou. Ever the diplomat, Zhou maintained his composure and eloquently defended his position. In the end, Zhou succeeded in calming the officers, and they departed, leaving him unharmed.\nIn a series of negotiations with the KMT that lasted until June 1937 (when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred), Zhou attempted to gain Zhang's release, but failed.\nActivities during World War II.\nPropaganda and intelligence in Wuhan.\nWhen the Nationalist capital of Nanjing fell to the Japanese on 13 December 1937, Zhou accompanied the Nationalist government to its temporary capital of Wuhan. As the chief representative of the CCP in the nominal KMT-CCP cooperation agreement, Zhou established and headed the official KMT-CCP liaison office. While running the liaison office, Zhou established the Yangtze Bureau of the Central Committee. Under cover of its association with the Eighth Route Army, Zhou used the Yangtze Bureau to conduct clandestine operations within southern China, secretly recruiting Communist operatives and establishing Party structures throughout KMT-controlled areas.\nIn August 1937, the CCP secretly issued orders to Zhou that his united front work was to focus on Communist infiltration and organization at all levels of the government and society. Zhou agreed to these orders, and applied his considerable organizational talents to completing them. Shortly after Zhou's arrival in Wuhan, he convinced the Nationalist government to approve and fund a Communist newspaper, the \"New China Daily\", justifying it as a tool to spread anti-Japanese propaganda. This newspaper became a major tool for spreading Communist propaganda, and the Nationalists later viewed its approval and funding as one of their \"biggest mistakes\".\nZhou was successful in organizing large numbers of Chinese intellectuals and artists to promote resistance against the Japanese. The largest propaganda event that Zhou staged was a week-long celebration in 1938, following the successful defense of Taierzhuang. In this event, between 400,000 and 500,000 people took part in parades, and a chorus of over 10,000 people sung songs of resistance. Fundraising efforts during the week raised over a million yuan. Zhou himself donated 240 yuan, his monthly salary as deputy director of the Political Department.\nWhile he was working in Wuhan, Zhou was the CCP's main contact person with the outside world, and worked hard to reverse the public perception of the Communists as a \"bandit organization\". Zhou established and maintained contacts with over forty foreign journalists and writers, including Edgar Snow, Agnes Smedley, Anna Louise Strong and Rewi Alley, many of whom became sympathetic to the Communist cause and wrote about their sympathies in foreign publications. In sympathy with his efforts to promote the CCP to the outside world, Zhou arranged for a Canadian medical team, headed by Norman Bethune, to travel to Yan'an, and assisted the Dutch film director Joris Ivens in producing a documentary, \"400 Million People\".\nMilitary strategy in Wuhan.\nIn January 1938, the Nationalist government appointed Zhou as the deputy director to the Political Department of the Military Committee, working directly under General Chen Cheng. As a senior Communist statesman holding the rank of lieutenant-general, Zhou was the only Communist to hold a high-level position within the Nationalist government. Zhou used his influence within the Military Committee to promote Nationalist generals that he believed were capable, and to promote cooperation with the Red Army.\nIn the Tai'erzhuang campaign, Zhou used his influence to ensure that the most capable Nationalist general available, Li Zongren be appointed overall commander, despite Chiang's reservations about Li's loyalty. When Chiang was hesitant to commit troops to the defense of Tai'erzhuang, Zhou convinced Chiang to do so by promising that the Communist Eighth Route Army would simultaneously attack the Japanese from the north, and that the New Fourth Army would sabotage the Tianjin-Pukou railroad, cutting off Japanese supplies. In the end, the defense of Tai'erzhuang was a major victory for the Nationalists, killing 20,000 Japanese soldiers and capturing a large quantity of supplies and equipment.\nAdoption of orphans.\nWhile serving as the CCP ambassador to the KMT, the childless Zhou met and befriended numerous orphans. While in Wuhan Zhou adopted a young girl, Sun Weishi, in 1937. Sun's mother had taken her to Wuhan after Sun's father was executed by the KMT in 1927, during the White Terror. Zhou came upon the sixteen-year-old Sun crying outside of the Eighth Route Army Liaison Office because she had been refused permission to travel to Yan'an, due to her youth and lack of political connections. After Zhou befriended and adopted her as his daughter, Sun was able to travel to Yan'an. She pursued a career in acting and direction, and later became the first female director of spoken drama (\"huaju\") in the PRC.\nZhou also adopted Sun's brother, Sun Yang. After accompanying Zhou to Yan'an, Sun Yang became Zhou's personal assistant. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sun Yang became the president of Renmin University.\nIn 1938, Zhou met and befriended another orphan, Li Peng. Li was only three when, in 1931, his father was also killed by the Kuomintang. Zhou subsequently looked after him in Yan'an. After the war, Zhou systematically groomed Li for leadership and sent him to be educated in energy-related engineering in Moscow. Zhou's placement of Li within the powerful energy bureaucracy shielded Li from Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, and Li's eventual rise to the level of Premier surprised no one.\nFlight to Chongqing.\nWhen the Japanese army approached Wuhan in the fall of 1938, the Nationalist Army engaged the Japanese in the surrounding regions for over four months, allowing the KMT to withdraw farther inland, to Chongqing, bringing with them important supplies, assets, and many refugees. While he was en route to Chongqing, Zhou was nearly killed in the \"fire of Changsha\", which lasted for three days, destroyed two thirds of the city, killed twenty thousand civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. This fire was deliberately caused by the retreating Nationalist army in order to prevent the city from falling to the Japanese. Due to an organizational error (it was claimed), the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city.\nAfter escaping from Changsha, Zhou took refuge in a Buddhist temple in a nearby village and organized the evacuation of the city. Zhou demanded that the causes of the fire be thoroughly investigated by authorities, that those responsible be punished, that reparations be given to the victims, that the city be thoroughly cleaned up, and that accommodations be provided for the homeless. In the end, the Nationalists blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them. Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nationwide loss of support for the KMT.\nEarly activities in Chongqing.\nZhou Enlai reached Chongqing in December 1938, and resumed the official and unofficial operations that he had been conducting in Wuhan in January 1938. Zhou's activities included those required by his formal positions within the Nationalist government, his running of two pro-Communist newspapers, and his covert efforts to form reliable intelligence networks and increase the popularity and organization of CCP organizations in southern China. At its peak, the staff working under him in both official and covert roles totaled several hundred people. After finding that his father, Zhou Shaogang, was unable to support himself, Zhou looked after his father in Chongqing until his father's death in 1942.\nSoon after arriving in Chongqing, Zhou successfully lobbied the Nationalist government to release Communist political prisoners. After their release, Zhou often assigned these former prisoners as agents to organize and lead Party organizations throughout southern China. The efforts of Zhou's covert activities were extremely successful, increasing CCP membership across southern China tenfold within months. Chiang was somewhat aware of these activities and introduced efforts to suppress them but was generally unsuccessful.\nIn July 1939, while in Yan'an to attend a series of Politburo meetings, Zhou had an accident horseback riding in which he fell and fractured his right elbow. Because there was little medical care available in Yan'an, Zhou traveled to Moscow for medical treatment, using the occasion to brief the Comintern on the status of the united front. Zhou arrived in Moscow too late to mend the fracture, and his right arm remained bent for the rest of his life. Joseph Stalin was so displeased with the CCP's refusal to work more closely with the Nationalists that he refused to see Zhou during his stay. Zhou's adopted daughter, Sun Weishi, accompanied Zhou to Moscow. She remained in Moscow after Zhou left in order to study for a career in theater.\nIntelligence work in Chongqing.\nOn 4 May 1939, the Politburo accepted Zhou's assessment that Zhou should focus his efforts on creating a network of secret CCP agents working covertly and for long periods. Communists were directed to join the KMT, if doing so would increase the ability of agents to infiltrate the KMT administrative, educational, economic, and military establishments. Under the cover of the Office of the Eighth Route Army (moved to a stately building on the outskirts of Chongqing), Zhou adopted a series of measures to expand the CCP intelligence network.\nBy the time that Zhou returned to Chongqing in May 1940, a serious rift had formed between the KMT and the CCP. Over the course of the next year, the relationship between the two parties degenerated into arrests and executions of Party members, covert attempts by agents of both sides to eliminate each other, propaganda efforts attacking each other, and major military clashes. The united front was officially abolished after the Anhui Incident in January 1941, when 9,000 Communist soldiers of the New Fourth Army were ambushed, and their commanders either killed or imprisoned by government troops.\nZhou responded to the rift between the KMT and CCP by directing Party leaders to conduct their operations more secretly. He maintained propaganda efforts via the newspapers that he directed and kept in close contact with foreign journalists and ambassadors. Zhou increased and improved CCP intelligence efforts within the KMT, Wang Jingwei's Nanjing government, and the Empire of Japan, recruiting, training, and organizing a large network of Communist spies. Yan Baohang, a secret Party member active in Chongqing diplomatic circles, informed Zhou that German dictator Adolf Hitler was planning to attack the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Under Zhou's signature, this information reached Stalin on 20 June, two days before Hitler attacked, though Stalin did not yet believe that Hitler would actually carry through with the attack.\nEconomic and diplomatic activities.\nDespite worsening relations with Chiang Kai-shek, Zhou operated openly in Chongqing, befriending Chinese and foreign visitors and staging public cultural activities, especially Chinese theater. Zhou cultivated a close personal friendship with General Feng Yuxiang, making it possible for Zhou to circulate freely among the officers of the Nationalist Army. Zhou befriended the General He Jifeng, and convinced He to secretly become a member of the CCP during an official visit to Yan'an. Zhou's intelligence agents penetrated the Sichuanese army of General Deng Xihou, resulting in Deng's secret agreement to supply ammunition to the Communist New Fourth Army. Zhou convinced another Sichuanese general, Li Wenhui, to covertly install a radio transmitter that facilitated secret communication between Yan'an and Chongqing. Zhou befriended Zhang Zhizhong and Nong Yun, commanders in the Yunnan armed forces, who became secret CCP members, agreed to cooperate with the CCP against Chiang Kai-shek, and established a clandestine radio station that broadcast Communist propaganda from the provincial government building in Kunming.\nZhou remained the primary CCP representative to the outside world during his time in Chongqing. Zhou and his aides Qiao Guanhua, Gong Peng and Wang Bingnan enjoyed receiving foreign visitors and made a favorable impression among American, British, Canadian, Russian, and other foreign diplomats. Zhou struck visitors as charming, urbane, hard-working, and living a very simple lifestyle. In 1941, Zhou received a visit from Ernest Hemingway and his wife, Martha Gellhorn. Gellhorn later wrote that she and Ernest were extremely impressed with Zhou (and extremely unimpressed with Chiang), and they became convinced that the Communists would take over China after meeting him.\nBecause Yan'an was incapable of funding Zhou's activities, Zhou partially funded his efforts through donations from sympathetic foreigners, overseas Chinese, and the China Defense League (supported by Sun Yat-sen's widow, Soong Ching-ling). Zhou also undertook to start and run a number of businesses throughout KMT- and Japanese- controlled China. Zhou's businesses grew to include several trading companies operating in several Chinese cities (primarily Chongqing and Hong Kong), a silk and satin store in Chongqing, an oil refinery, and factories for producing industrial materials, cloths, Western medicines, and other commodities.\nUnder Zhou, Communist businessmen made great profits in currency trading and commodity speculation, especially in American dollars and gold. Zhou's most lucrative business was generated by several opium plantations that Zhou established in remote areas. Although the CCP had been engaged in the eradication of opium smoking since its establishment, Zhou justified opium production and distribution in KMT-controlled areas by the huge profits generated for the CCP, and by the debilitating effects that opium addiction might have on KMT soldiers and government officials.\nRelationship with Mao Zedong.\nIn 1943, Zhou's relationship with Chiang Kai-shek deteriorated, and he returned permanently to Yan'an. By then, Mao Zedong had emerged as the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and was attempting to have his political theories (literally \"Mao Zedong Thought\") accepted as the Party's doctrine. Following his ascent to power, Mao organized a campaign to indoctrinate the members of the CCP. This campaign became the foundation of the Maoist personality cult that later dominated Chinese politics until the end of the Cultural Revolution.\nAfter returning to Yan'an, Zhou Enlai was strongly and excessively criticized in this campaign. Zhou was labelled, along with the generals Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, Ye Jianying, and Nie Rongzhen, as an \"empiricist\" because he had a history of cooperating with the Comintern and with Mao's enemy, Wang Ming. Mao publicly attacked Zhou as \"a collaborator and assistant of dogmatism... who belittled the study of Marxism-Leninism\". Mao and his allies then claimed that the CCP organizations that Zhou had established in southern China were in fact led by KMT secret agents, a charge which Zhou firmly denied, and which was only withdrawn after Mao became convinced of Zhou's loyalty in the latest period of the campaign.\nZhou defended himself by engaging in a long series of public reflections and self-criticisms, and he gave a number of speeches praising Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and giving his unconditional acceptance of Mao's leadership. He also joined Mao's allies in attacking Peng Shuzhi, Chen Duxiu, and Wang Ming, who Mao viewed as enemies. The persecution of Zhou Enlai distressed Moscow, and Georgi Dimitrov wrote a personal letter to Mao indicating that \"Zhou Enlai... must not be severed from the Party.\" In the end, Zhou's enthusiastic acknowledgement of his own faults, his praise for Mao's leadership, and his attacks on Mao's enemies eventually convinced Mao that Zhou's conversion to Maoism was genuine, a precondition for Zhou's political survival. By the seventh congress of the CCP in 1945, Mao was acknowledged as the overall leader of the CCP, and the dogma of Mao Zedong Thought was firmly entrenched among the Party's leadership.\nDiplomatic efforts with the United States.\nThe Dixie mission.\nAs United States began to plan for an invasion of Japan, which at that point they assumed would be based in China, American political and military leaders became eager to make contact with the Communists. In June 1944, Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly agreed to allow an American military observation group, known as the \"Dixie mission\", to travel to Yan'an. Mao and Zhou welcomed this mission and held numerous talks in the interests of gaining American aid. They pledged support for any future American military actions to attack the Japanese in China, and attempted to convince the Americans that the CCP was committed to a united KMT-CCP government. In a gesture of goodwill, communist guerrilla units were instructed to rescue downed American airmen. By the time the Americans left Yan'an, many had become convinced that the CCP was \"a party seeking orderly democratic growth towards socialism\", and the mission formally suggested greater cooperation between the CCP and the American military.\n1944\u20131945.\nIn 1944, Zhou wrote to General Joseph Stilwell, the American commander of the China Burma India Theater of World War II, attempting to convince Stilwell of the need for the Americans to supply the Communists, and of the Communist's desire for a united Chinese government after the war. Stilwell's open disenchantment with the Nationalist government in general, and with Chiang Kai-shek specifically, motivated President Franklin D. Roosevelt to remove him that same year, before Zhou's diplomacy could be effective. Stilwell's replacement, Patrick J. Hurley, was receptive to Zhou's appeals, but ultimately refused to align the American military with the CCP unless the Party made concessions to the KMT, which Mao and Zhou found unacceptable. Soon after Japan surrendered in 1945, Chiang invited Mao and Zhou to Chongqing to take part in an American-endorsed peace conference.\nThe Chongqing negotiations.\nThere was widespread apprehension in Yan'an that the invitation from Chiang was a trap, and that the Nationalists were planning to assassinate or imprison the two instead. Zhou took control over Mao's security detail, and his subsequent inspections of their plane and lodgings found nothing. Throughout the trip to Chongqing, Mao refused to enter his accommodations until they had been personally inspected by Zhou. Mao and Zhou traveled together to receptions, banquets, and other public gatherings, and Zhou introduced him to numerous local celebrities and statesmen that he had befriended during his earlier stay in Chongqing.\nDuring the forty-three days of negotiations, Mao and Chiang met eleven times to discuss the conditions of post-war China, while Zhou worked on confirming the details of the negotiations. In the end, the negotiations resolved nothing. Zhou's offer to withdraw the Red Army from southern China was ignored, and P.J. Hurley's ultimatum to incorporate the CCP into the KMT insulted Mao. After Mao returned to Yan'an on 10 October 1945, Zhou stayed behind to sort out the details of the conference's resolution. Zhou returned to Yan'an on 27 November 1945, when major skirmishes between the Communists and Nationalists made future negotiations pointless. Hurley himself subsequently announced his resignation, accusing members of the US embassy of undermining him and favoring the Communists.\nThe Marshall negotiations.\nAfter Harry S. Truman became President of the United States, he nominated General George C. Marshall as his special envoy to China on 15 December 1945. Marshall was charged with brokering a ceasefire between the CCP and KMT, and to influence both Mao and Chiang to abide by the Chongqing agreement, which both had signed. The top leadership within the CCP, including Zhou, viewed Marshall's nomination as a positive development, and hoped that Marshall would be a more flexible negotiator than Hurley had been. Zhou arrived in Chongqing to negotiate with Marshall on 22 December.\nThe first phase of talks went smoothly. Zhou represented the Communists, Marshall represented the Americans, and Zhang Qun (later replaced by Zhang Zhizhong) represented the KMT. In January 1946 both sides agreed to cease hostilities, and to reorganize their armies on the principle of separating the army from political parties. Zhou signed these agreements in the knowledge that neither side would be able to implement these changes. Chiang delivered a speech promising political freedom, local autonomy, free elections, and the release of political prisoners. Zhou welcomed Chiang's statements and expressed his opposition to civil war.\nThe leadership of the CCP viewed these agreements optimistically. On 27 January 1946 the CCP Secretariat appointed Zhou as one of eight leaders to participate in a future coalition government (other leaders included Mao, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De). It was suggested that Zhou be nominated as China's vice president. Mao expressed a desire to visit the United States, and Zhou received orders to manipulate Marshall in order to advance the peace process.\nMarshall's negotiations soon deteriorated, as neither the KMT nor the CCP were willing to sacrifice any of the advantages that they had gained, to depoliticize their armies, or to sacrifice any degree of autonomy in areas their side controlled. Military clashes in Manchuria became increasingly frequent in the spring and summer of 1946, eventually forcing Communist forces to retreat after a few major battles. Government armies increased their attacks in other parts of China.\nOn 3 May 1946, Zhou and his wife left Chongqing for Nanjing, where the Nationalist capital returned. Negotiations deteriorated, and on 9 October Zhou informed Marshall that he no longer had the confidence of the CCP. On 11 October Nationalist troops seized the Communist city of Zhangjiakou in northern China. Chiang, confident in his ability to defeat the Communists, called the National Assembly into session without the participation of the CCP and ordered it to draft a constitution on 15 November. On 16 November Zhou held a press conference, in which he condemned the KMT for \"tearing up the agreements from the political consultative conference\". On 19 November Zhou and the entire CCP delegation left Nanjing for Yan'an.\nResumption of Civil War.\nMilitary strategist and intelligence chief.\nFollowing the failure of negotiations, the Chinese Civil War resumed in earnest. Zhou turned his focus from diplomatic to military affairs, while retaining a senior interest in intelligence work. Zhou worked directly under Mao as his chief aide, as the vice chairman of the Military Commission of the Central Committee, and as the general chief of staff. As the head of the Urban Work Committee of the Central Committee, an agency established to coordinate work inside KMT-controlled areas, Zhou continued to direct underground activities.\nA superior force of Nationalist troops captured Yan'an in March 1947, but Zhou's intelligence agents (primarily Xiong Xianghui) were able to provide Yan'an's commanding general, Peng Dehuai, with details of the KMT army's troop strength, distribution, positions, air cover, and dates of deployment. This intelligence allowed Communist forces to avoid major battles and to engage Nationalist forces in a protracted campaign of guerrilla warfare that eventually led to Peng achieving a series of major victories. By February 1948 over half the KMT troops in the northwest were either defeated or exhausted. By January 1949, Communist forces seized Beijing and Tianjin and were firmly in control of north China.\nDiplomacy.\nOn 21 January 1949, Chiang stepped down as president of the Nationalist government and was succeeded by General Li Zongren. On 1 April 1949, Li began a series of peace negotiations with a six-member CCP delegation. The CCP delegates were led by Zhou Enlai, and the KMT delegates were led by Zhang Zhizhong.\nZhou began the negotiations by asking: \"Why did you go to Xikou (where Chiang had retired) to see Chiang Kai-shek before leaving Nanjing?\" Zhang responded that Chiang still had power, even though he had technically retired, and that his consent would be needed to finalize any agreement. Zhou responded that the CCP would not accept a bogus peace dictated by Chiang and asked whether Zhang had come with the necessary credentials to implement the terms desired by the CCP. Negotiations continued until 15 April, when Zhou produced a \"final version\" of a \"draft agreement for internal peace\", which was essentially an ultimatum to accept CCP demands. The KMT government did not respond after five days, signaling that it was not prepared to accept Zhou's demands.\nOn 21 April, Mao and Zhou issued an \"order to the army for country-wide advance\". PLA troops captured Nanjing on 23 April and captured Li's stronghold of Guangdong in October, forcing Li to go into exile in America. In December 1949, PLA troops captured Chengdu, the last KMT-controlled city on mainland China, forcing Chiang to evacuate to Taiwan.\nPRC diplomat and statesman.\nDiplomatic situation of the PRC in 1949.\nFollowing the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949, Zhou was appointed both Premier of the Government Administration Council (later replaced by the State Council) and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Through the coordination of these two offices and his position as a member of the five-man standing committee of the Politburo, Zhou became the architect of early PRC foreign policy, presenting China as a new, yet responsible member of the international community. Zhou was an experienced negotiator and was respected as a senior revolutionary within China. Zhou's inclusion of non-Communists in his cabinet was notable, with 47% of his ministers and half of his commissioners having no Communist affiliation.214\nBy the early 1950s, China's international influence was extremely low. By the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, China's pretensions of universalism had been shattered by a string of military defeats and incursions by Europeans and Japanese. By the end of Yuan Shikai's reign and the subsequent Warlord Era, China's international prestige had declined to \"almost nothing\". In World War II, China's effective role was sometimes questioned by other Allied leaders. The 1950\u20131953 Korean War greatly exacerbated China's international position by fixing the United States in a position of animosity, ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control and that the PRC would remain outside of the United Nations for the foreseeable future.\nZhou's earliest efforts to improve the prestige of the PRC involved recruiting prominent Chinese politicians, capitalists, intellectuals, and military leaders who were not technically affiliated with the CCP. Zhou was able to convince Zhang Zhizhong to accept a position inside the PRC in 1949, after Zhou's underground network successfully escorted Zhang's family to Beijing. All of the other members of the KMT delegation that Zhou had negotiated with in 1949 accepted similar terms.\nSun Yat-sen's widow, Soong Ching-ling, who was estranged from her family and who had opposed the KMT for many years, readily joined the PRC in 1949. Huang Yanpei, a prominent industrialist who had refused offers of a government post for many years, was persuaded to accept a position as vice premier in the new government. Fu Zuoyi, the KMT commander who had surrendered the Beijing garrison in 1948, was persuaded to join the PLA, and to accept a position as the minister of water conservation.\nDiplomacy with India.\nZhou's first diplomatic successes came as the result of successfully pursuing a warm relationship, based on mutual respect, with India's first post-independence prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Through his diplomacy, Zhou managed to persuade India to accept China's occupation of Tibet in 1950 and 1951. India was later persuaded to act as a neutral mediator between China and the United States during the many difficult phases of the negotiations settling the Korean War. Zhou helped to negotiate the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement and later formalized some of its components as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, a central concept in Chinese foreign policy.239\nDuring the 1962 Sino-Indian border conflict, Zhou ordered the withdrawal of the victorious Chinese forces to 10 kilometers behind the McMahon Line, the return of all captured weapons and equipment, and the burial of the Indian dead with full military honors. This decision was controversial within the PLA, but it pleased Mao. Zhou's \"extraordinary magnanimity\" provoked a split in the Indian military and government, weakening them and deterring further conflict with China.293\nThe Korean War.\nWhen the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, Zhou was in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA's 5.6\u00a0million soldiers, under the direction of the Central Committee. Zhou and Mao discussed the possibility of American intervention with Kim Il Sung in May and urged Kim to be cautious if he was to invade and conquer South Korea, but Kim refused to take these warnings seriously. On 28 June 1950, after the United States pushed through a UN resolution condemning North Korean aggression and sent the Seventh Fleet to \"neutralize\" the Taiwan Strait, Zhou criticized both the UN and US initiatives as \"armed aggression on Chinese territory.\"\nAlthough Kim's early success led him to predict that he would win the war by the end of August, Zhou and other Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. Zhou did not share Kim's confidence that the war would end quickly and became increasingly apprehensive that the United States would intervene. To counter the possibility of an American invasion into North Korea or China, Zhou secured a Soviet commitment to have the USSR support Chinese forces with air cover and deployed 260,000 Chinese soldiers along the North Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang, but they were strictly ordered not to move into North Korea or engage UN or USA forces unless they engaged themselves. Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in North Korea, to analyze the military situation there. Lei concluded that MacArthur would most likely attempt a landing at Incheon.\nOn 15 September 1950 MacArthur landed at Incheon, met little resistance, and captured Seoul on 25 September. Bombing raids destroyed most North Korean tanks and much of its artillery. North Korean troops, instead of withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated. On 30 September, Zhou warned the United States that \"the Chinese people will not tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they supinely tolerate seeing their neighbors being savagely invaded by imperialists.\"\nOn 1 October, on the first anniversary of the PRC, South Korean troops crossed the Thirty-Eighth Parallel into North Korea. Stalin refused to become directly involved in the war, and Kim sent a frantic appeal to Mao to reinforce his army. On 2 October, the Chinese leadership continued an emergency meeting at Zhongnanhai to discuss whether China should send military aid, and these talks continued until 6 October. At the meeting, Zhou was one of the few firm supporters of Mao's position that China should send military aid, regardless of the strength of American forces. With the endorsement of Peng Dehuai, the meeting concluded with a resolution to send military forces to Korea.\nIn order to enlist Stalin's support, Zhou traveled to Stalin's summer resort on the Black Sea on 10 October. Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the USSR's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations and no ground troops were to be sent. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace after an undisclosed period of time. Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951.\nImmediately on his return to Beijing on 18 October 1950, Zhou met with Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Gao Gang, and the group ordered the 200,000 Chinese troops along the border to enter North Korea, which they did on 25 October. After consulting with Stalin, on 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou the overall commander of the People's Volunteer Army, a special unit of the People's Liberation Army, China's armed forces that would intervene in the Korean War and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander of the PVA. Orders given by Zhou to the PVA were delivered in the name of the Central Military Commission.\nBy June 1951, the war had reached a stalemate around the Thirty-eighth Parallel, and the two sides agreed to negotiate an armistice. Zhou directed the truce talks, which began on 10 July. Zhou chose Li Kenong and Qiao Guanhua to head the Chinese negotiating team. The negotiations proceeded for two years before reaching a ceasefire agreement in July 1953, formally signed at Panmunjom.\nThe Korean War was Zhou's last military assignment. In 1952, Peng Dehuai succeeded Zhou in managing the Central Military Commission (which Zhou had headed since 1947). In 1956, after the eighth Party Congress, Zhou formally relinquished his post in the Military Commission and focused on his work in the Standing Committee, the State Council, and on foreign affairs.\nDiplomacy with China's communist neighbors.\nAfter Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Zhou left for Moscow and attended Stalin's funeral four days later. Mao, curiously, decided not to travel to Moscow, possibly because no senior Soviet politician had yet travelled to Beijing, or because Stalin had rejected an offer to meet with Mao in 1948 (nevertheless, a huge memorial service in honor of Stalin was held in Beijing's Tiananmen Square with Mao and hundreds of thousands more in attendance). While in Moscow, Zhou was notably received with considerable respect by Soviet officials, being permitted to stand with the USSR's new leaders\u2014Vyacheslav Molotov, Nikita Khrushchev, Georgy Malenkov, and Lavrentiy Beria\u2014instead of with the other \"foreign\" dignitaries who attended. With these four leaders, Zhou walked directly behind the gun carriage bearing Stalin's coffin. Zhou's diplomatic efforts on his travel to Moscow were rewarded shortly after when, in 1954, Khrushchev himself visited Beijing to take part in the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. Because Malenkov, Stalin's successor for the time being, was insecure in his position, Zhou was able to renegotiate some Sino-Soviet agreements on more favorable terms for China and begin negotiations on new economic and technological exchange agreements. Most notably, Zhou pushed for the transfer of Soviet nuclear technology to China.230\nThroughout the 1950s, Zhou worked to tighten economic and political relations between China and other Communist states, coordinating China's foreign policy with Soviet policies promoting solidarity among political allies. In 1952, Zhou signed an economic and cultural agreement with the Mongolian People's Republic, giving \"de facto\" recognition of the independence of what had been known as \"Outer Mongolia\" in Qing times. Zhou also worked to conclude an agreement with Kim Il Sung in order to help the postwar reconstruction of North Korea's economy. Pursuing the goals of peaceful diplomacy with China's neighbor, Zhou held amicable talks with Myanmar's prime minister, U Nu, and promoted China's efforts to send supplies to Ho Chi Minh's Vietnamese rebels known as the Vietminh.\nThe Geneva Conference.\nIn April 1954, Zhou traveled to Switzerland to attend the Geneva Conference, convened to settle the ongoing Franco-Vietnamese War. His patience and shrewdness were credited with assisting the major powers involved (the Soviets, French, Americans, and North Vietnamese) to iron out the agreement ending the war. According to the negotiated peace, French Indochina was to be partitioned into Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam. Elections were agreed to be called within two years to create a coalition government in a united Vietnam, and the Vietminh agreed to end their guerilla activities in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.\nDuring one early meeting in Geneva, Zhou found himself in the same room with the staunchly anticommunist American secretary of state, John Foster Dulles. After Zhou politely offered to shake his hand, Dulles rudely turned his back and walked out of the room, saying \"I cannot.\" Zhou was interpreted by onlookers as turning this moment of possible humiliation into a small victory by giving only a small, \"Gallic-style\" shrug to this behavior. Zhou was equally effective in countering Dulles' insistence that China not be given a seat at the sessions. Furthering the impression of Chinese urbanity and civility, Zhou had lunch with British actor Charlie Chaplin, who had been living in Switzerland since being blacklisted in the United States for his alleged socialist politics.\nThe Asian\u2013African Conference.\nIn 1955, Zhou was a prominent participant in the Asian\u2013African Conference held in Indonesia. The conference in Bandung was a meeting of twenty-nine African and Asian states, organized by Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and India, and was called largely to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or neocolonialism by either the United States or the Soviet Union in the Cold War. At the conference, Zhou skillfully gave the conference a neutral stance that made the United States appear as a serious threat to the peace and stability of the region. Zhou complained that, while China was working towards \"world peace and the progress of mankind\", \"aggressive circles\" within the United States were actively aiding the Nationalists in Taiwan and planning to rearm the Japanese. He was widely quoted for his remark that \"the population of Asia will never forget that the first atom bomb was exploded on Asian soil.\" With the support of its most prestigious participants, the conference produced a strong declaration in favor of peace, the abolition of nuclear arms, general arms reduction, and the principle of universal representation at the United Nations.\nOn his way to the Bandung conference, an assassination attempt was made against Zhou when a bomb was planted on the Air India plane \"Kashmir Princess\", chartered for Zhou's trip from Hong Kong to Jakarta. Zhou avoided the attempt when he changed planes at the last minute, but all 11 of the flight's other passengers were killed, with only three crew members surviving the crash. A recent study has blamed the attempt on \"one of the intelligence agencies of the KMT.\" Journalist Joseph Trento has also alleged that there was a second attempt on Zhou's life at the Bandung conference involving \"a bowl of rice poisoned with a slow-acting toxin.\"\nAccording to one account based on recent research, Zhou found out about the bomb on the \"Kashmir Princess\" after being warned of the plot by his own intelligence officers and did not attempt to stop it because he viewed those that died as disposable: international journalists and low-level cadres. After the crash, Zhou used the incident to warn the British about the KMT intelligence operatives active in Hong Kong and pressured Great Britain to disable the Nationalist intelligence network operating there (with himself playing a support role). He hoped that the incident would improve Britain's relationship with the PRC, and damage Britain's relationship with the ROC. The official explanation for Zhou's absence on the flight, however, remains that Zhou was forced to change his schedule due to having had surgery for appendicitis.\nAfter the Bandung conference, China's international political situation began to gradually improve. With the help of many of the nonaligned powers who had taken part in the conference, the US-backed position economically and politically boycotting the PRC began to erode, despite continuing American pressure to follow its direction. In 1971 the PRC gained China's seat at the United Nations.\nTour of Africa.\nFrom December 1963 until January 1964, Zhou made diplomatic visitations to all of the North African countries. On 15 December, Zhou met with President Nasser of Egypt in an effort to further relations between the countries. Then, on 21 December, Zhou visited Algeria. At their meeting, President Ahmed Ben Bella asked for a peaceful coexistence between the two nations. On 27 December, the Tunisian government announced it intended to recognize the Chinese Communist Government after planning with the Tunisian ambassador to have Zhou visit the country for 2 days in January. On 28 December, Zhou visited Morocco and met with King Hasan II. While unconfirmed, it is believed this meeting was more economic in nature, rather than attempting to garner support for communist China.\nIt is also said he planned on meeting with leaders in Mali, Guinea, and Ghana.\nPosition on Taiwan.\nWhen the PRC was founded on 1 October 1949, Zhou notified all governments that any countries wishing to have diplomatic contact with the PRC must end their relationship with the leaders of the former regime on Taiwan, and support the PRC's claim to China's seat in the United Nations. This was the first foreign policy document issued by the new government. By 1950, the PRC was able to gain diplomatic relationships with other communist countries and with thirteen non-communist countries, but talks with most Western governments were unsuccessful.\nZhou emerged from the Bandung conference with a reputation as a flexible and open-minded negotiator. Recognizing that the United States would back the \"de facto\" independence of ROC-controlled Taiwan with military force, Zhou persuaded his government to end the shelling of Kinmen and Matsu, and to search for a diplomatic alternative to the confrontation instead. In a formal announcement in May 1955, Zhou declared that the PRC would \"strive for the liberation of Taiwan by peaceful means so far as it is possible.\" Whenever the question of Taiwan was raised with foreign statesmen, Zhou argued that Taiwan was part of China, and that the resolution of the conflict with the Taiwan authorities was an internal matter.\nIn 1958 the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs was passed to Chen Yi, a general with little prior diplomatic experience. After Zhou resigned his office in Foreign Affairs, the PRC diplomatic corps was reduced dramatically. Some of the staff were transferred to various cultural and educational departments to replace leading cadres who had been labelled \"rightists\" and sent to work in labor camps.\nThe Shanghai communique.\nBy the early 1970s, Sino-American relations had begun to improve. Mao's workers in the petroleum industry, one of China's few growing economic sectors at the time, advised the chairman that, in order to consider growth at levels desired by the Party's leadership, large imports of American technology and technical expertise were essential. In January 1970, the Chinese invited the American ping-pong team to tour China, initiating an era of \"ping-pong diplomacy\".\nIn 1971, Zhou Enlai met secretly with President Nixon's security advisor, Henry Kissinger, who had flown to China to prepare for a meeting between Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong. During the course of these meetings, the United States agreed to allow the transfer of American money to China (presumably from relatives in the United States), to allow American-owned ships to conduct trade with China (under foreign flags), and to allow Chinese exports into the United States for the first time since the Korean War. At the time, these negotiations were considered so sensitive that they were concealed from the American public, the State Department, the American secretary of state, and all foreign governments.\nOn the morning of 21 February 1972, Richard Nixon arrived in Beijing, where he was greeted by Zhou, and later met with Mao Zedong. The diplomatic substance of Nixon's visit was resolved on 28 February, in the Shanghai Communique, which summarized both sides' positions without attempting to resolve them. The \"US side\" reaffirmed the American position that America's involvement in the ongoing Vietnam War did not constitute \"outside intervention\" in Vietnam's affairs, and restated its commitment to \"individual freedom\", and pledged continued support for South Korea. The \"Chinese Side\" stated that \"wherever there is oppression, there is resistance\", that \"all foreign troops should be withdrawn to their own countries\", and that Korea should be unified according to the demands of North Korea. Both sides agreed to disagree on the status of Taiwan. The closing sections of the Shanghai Communique encouraged further diplomatic, cultural, economic, journalistic, and scientific exchanges, and endorsed both sides' intentions to work towards \"the relaxation of tensions in Asia and the world.\" The resolutions of the Shanghai Communique represented a major policy shift for both the United States and China.\nThe Great Leap Forward.\nDuring the Sufan movement, Zhou tried to protect members of institutions he controlled, like the Academy of Sciences, by limiting the severity of the accusations made against them. However, he was not able to protect all of his allies. For example, Zhou's associate from the civil war, Pan Hannian, fell under suspicion due to his contacts with forces opposed to the communists during that time and was arrested.231In 1959, Zhou obtained Mao's permission to rehabilitate 40,000 \"rightist\" intellectuals.280\nIn 1958, Mao Zedong began the Great Leap Forward, aimed at increasing China's production levels in industry and agriculture with unrealistic targets. As a popular and practical administrator, Zhou maintained his position through the Leap. In 1959, he had his family's graveyard in Huai An demolished so that the land could be used for collective farming. Colleagues and relatives of Zhou said that he did this to set an example of integrity during difficult times.281 \nBy the early 1960s, Mao's prestige was not as high as it had once been. Mao's economic policies in the 1950s had failed, and he had developed a lifestyle that was increasingly out of touch with many of his oldest colleagues. The combination of his personal eccentricities and industrialization policy failures produced criticism from such veteran revolutionaries as Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and Zhou Enlai, who seemed less and less to share an enthusiasm for his vision of continuous revolutionary struggle.\nThe Cultural Revolution.\nInitial efforts of Mao and Lin.\nTo improve his image and power, Mao, with the help of Lin Biao, undertook a number of public propaganda efforts. Among the efforts of Mao and Lin to improve Mao's image in the early 1960s were Lin's publication of the \"Diary of Lei Feng\" and his compilation of \"Quotations from Chairman Mao\". The last and most successful of these efforts was the Cultural Revolution. At an initial planning session of the Party Central Committee, Zhou debated the proposed sixteen point program for the Cultural Revolution, leading to the alteration of at least ten of the points.324 While still in political favor, Zhou focused his efforts on the protection of scientists, academics, cultural workers, writers and artists. He ultimately was unable to protect the officials in most of the institutions under his control, but had some success protecting his friends and allies such as Nie Rongzhen and Guo Moruo.\nWhatever its other causes, the Cultural Revolution, declared in 1966, was overtly pro-Maoist, and gave Mao the power and influence to purge the Party of his political enemies at the highest levels of government. Along with closing China's schools and universities, it exhorted of young Chinese to destroy old buildings, temples, and art, and to attack their \"revisionist\" teachers, school administrators, party leaders, and parents. After the Cultural Revolution was announced, many of the most senior members of the CCP who had shared Zhou's hesitation in following Mao's direction, including President Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, were removed from their posts almost immediately; they, along with their families, were subjected to mass criticism and humiliation.\nPolitical survival.\nSoon after they had been removed, Zhou argued that President Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping \"should be allowed to come back to work\", but this was opposed by Mao, Lin Biao, Kang Sheng and Chen Boda. Chen Boda even suggested that Zhou himself might be \"considered counter-revolutionary\" if he did not toe the Maoist line. Following the threats that he would share in the fate of his comrades if he did not support Mao, Zhou ceased his criticisms and began to work more closely with the chairman and his clique.\nZhou gave his backing to the establishment of radical Red Guard organizations in October 1966 and joined Chen Boda and Jiang Qing against what they considered \"leftist\" and \"rightist\" Red Guard factions. This opened the way for attacks on Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Tao Zhu in December 1966 and January 1967. By September 1968, Zhou candidly described his strategy for political survival to Japanese LDP parliamentarians visiting Beijing: \"one's personal opinions should advance or beat a retreat according to the direction of the majority.\" When he was accused of being less than enthusiastic in following Mao's leadership, he accused himself of \"poor understanding\" of Mao's theories, giving the appearance of compromising with forces that he secretly loathed and referred to in private as his \"inferno\". Following the logic of political survival, Zhou worked to aid Mao, and restricted his criticisms to private conversations.\nThroughout the next decade, Mao largely developed policies while Zhou carried them out, attempting to moderate some of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, such as preventing Beijing from being renamed \"East Is Red City\" () and the Chinese guardian lions in front of Tiananmen Square from being replaced with statues of Mao. Using Mao's authority, Zhou drew up lists of people to be protected from persecution, including Puyi and his family, the National Peoples Congress Standing Committee, the heads of the non-Communist parties, the judges of the Supreme Court and former Nationalist generals such as Cai Tingkai and Fu Tsoyi. He was also able to protect some people who were in more serious danger of persecution by having them hospitalized at 301 Hospital, where sympathetic staff could keep them out of reach of the Red Guards. Zhou also ordered a PLA battalion to guard the Forbidden City and protect its traditional artifacts from vandalism and destruction by Red Guards. Zhou detested the \"yangbanxi.\"167 Despite his best efforts, the inability to prevent many of the events of the Cultural Revolution were a great blow to Zhou. Over the last decade of his life, Zhou's ability to implement Mao's policies and keep the nation afloat during periods of adversity was so great that his practical importance alone was sufficient to save him (with Mao's assistance) whenever Zhou became politically threatened. At the latest stages of the Cultural Revolution, in 1975, Zhou pushed for the \"Four Modernizations\" in order to undo the damage caused by Mao's policies.\nAlthough Zhou initially escaped direct persecution, he was not able to save many of those closest to him from having their lives destroyed by the Cultural Revolution. Sun Weishi, Zhou's adopted daughter, died in 1968 after seven months of torture, imprisonment, and rape by Maoist Red Guards. In 1968, Jiang also had his adopted son (Sun Yang) tortured and murdered by Red Guards. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Sun's plays were re-staged as a way of criticizing the Gang of Four, whom many thought were responsible for her death. \nDuring the later stages of the Cultural Revolution, Zhou became a target of political campaigns orchestrated by Chairman Mao and the Gang of Four. The \"Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius\" campaign of 1973 and 1974 was directed at Premier Zhou because he was viewed as one of the Gang's primary political opponents. In 1975, Zhou's enemies initiated a campaign named \"Criticizing Song Jiang, Evaluating \"the Water Margin\"\", which encouraged the use of Zhou as an example of a political loser.\nDeath.\nIllness and death.\nAccording to a biography of Zhou by Gao Wenqian, a former researcher at the CPC's Party Documents Research Office, Zhou was first diagnosed with bladder cancer in November 1972. Zhou's medical team reported that with treatment, he had a high chance of recovery; however, medical treatment for the highest-ranking party members had to be approved by Mao. Mao ordered that Zhou and his wife should not be told of the diagnosis, no surgery should be performed, and no further examinations should be given.\nAccording to Ji Chaozhu, Zhou Enlai's personal interpreter, Henry Kissinger offered to send cancer specialists from the United States to treat Zhou, but that offer was eventually refused. By 1974, Zhou was experiencing significant bleeding in his urine. After pressure by other Chinese leaders who had learned of Zhou's condition, Mao finally ordered a surgical operation to be performed in June 1974, but the bleeding returned a few months later, indicating metastasis of the cancer into other organs. A series of operations over the next year and a half failed to check the progress of the cancer. Zhou continued to conduct work during his stays in the hospital, with Deng Xiaoping, as the First Deputy Premier, handling most of the important State Council matters. His last major public appearance was at the first meeting of the 4th National People's Congress on 13 January 1975, where he presented the government's work report. He then fell out of the public eye for more medical treatment. Zhou Enlai died from cancer at 09:57 on 8 January 1976, aged 77.\nMao's response.\nAfter Zhou's death, Mao issued no statements acknowledging Zhou's achievements or contributions and sent no condolences to Zhou's widow, herself a senior Party leader. Mao forbade his staff from wearing black mourning armbands. Whether or not Mao would have attended Zhou's funeral, which was held in the Great Hall of the People, remains in question as Mao himself was in very poor health and unable to do so in any event. Mao did, however, have a wreath sent to the funeral.\nMao attacked a proposal to have Zhou publicly declared a great Marxist, and rejected a request that he make a brief appearance at Zhou's funeral, instructing his nephew, Mao Yuanxin, to explain that he could not attend because doing so would be seen as a public admission that he was being forced to \"rethink the Cultural Revolution\", as Zhou's later years had been closely associated with reversing and moderating its excesses. Mao worried that public expressions of mourning would later be directed against him and his policies and backed the \"five nos\" campaign (see below) to suppress public expressions of mourning for Zhou after the late Premier's death.\nMemorial.\nWhatever Mao's opinion of Zhou may have been, there was general mourning among the public. Foreign correspondents reported that Beijing, shortly after Zhou's death, looked like a ghost town. There was no burial ceremony, as Zhou had willed his ashes to be scattered across the hills and rivers of his hometown, rather than stored in a ceremonial mausoleum. With Zhou gone, it became clear how the Chinese people had revered him, and how they had viewed him as a symbol of stability in an otherwise chaotic period of history. Zhou's death also brought condolences from nations around the world.\nVice-Premier Deng Xiaoping delivered the eulogy at Zhou's state funeral on 15 January 1976. Although much of his speech echoed the wording of an official statement by the Central Committee immediately following Zhou's death or consisted of a meticulous description of Zhou's remarkable political career, near the end of the eulogy he offered a personal tribute to Zhou's character, speaking from the heart while observing the rhetoric demanded of ceremonial state occasions. Referring to Zhou, Deng stated that:\nHe was open and aboveboard, paid attention to the interests of the whole, observed Party discipline, was strict in \"dissecting\" himself and good at uniting the mass of cadres, and upheld the unity and solidarity of the Party. He maintained broad and close ties with the masses and showed boundless warmheartedness towards all comrades and the people... We should learn from his fine style \u2013 being modest and prudent, unassuming and approachable, setting an example by his conduct, and living in a plain and hard-working way. We should follow his example of adhering to the proletarian style and opposing the bourgeois style of life\nSpence believed this statement was interpreted at the time as a subtle criticism of Mao and the other leaders of the Cultural Revolution, who could not possibly be viewed or praised as being \"open and aboveboard\", \"good at uniting the mass of cadres\", for displaying \"warmheartedness\", or for modesty, prudence, or approachability. Regardless of Deng's intentions, the Gang of Four, and later Hua Guofeng, increased the persecution of Deng shortly after he delivered this eulogy.\nSuppression of public mourning.\nAfter Zhou's single official memorial ceremony on 15 January, Zhou's political enemies within the Party officially prohibited any further displays of public mourning. The most notorious regulations prohibiting Zhou from being honored were the poorly observed and poorly enforced \"five nos\": no wearing black armbands, no mourning wreaths, no mourning halls, no memorial activities, and no handing out photos of Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (who was strongly associated with Zhou in public perception), and the prohibition against publicly mourning Zhou became associated with each other shortly after Zhou's death, leading to popular discontent against Mao and his apparent successors (notably Hua Guofeng and the Gang of Four).\nOfficial attempts to enforce the \"five nos\" included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating his achievements. On 25 March 1976, a leading Shanghai newspaper, \"Wenhui Bao\", published an article stating that Zhou was \"the capitalist roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power\". This and other propaganda efforts to attack Zhou's image only strengthened the public's attachment to Zhou's memory. Between March and April 1976, a forged document circulated in Nanjing that claimed itself to be Zhou Enlai's last will. It attacked Jiang Qing and praised Deng Xiaoping and was met with increased propaganda efforts by the government.\nThe Tiananmen incident.\nWithin several months after the death of Zhou, one of the most extraordinary spontaneous events in the history of the PRC occurred. On 4 April 1976, at the eve of China's annual Qingming Festival, in which Chinese traditionally pay homage to their deceased ancestors, thousands of people gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the life and death of Zhou Enlai. On this occasion, the people of Beijing honored Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument. The most obvious purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan were also attacked for their alleged evil actions against the Premier. A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao himself, and his Cultural Revolution.\nUp to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on 4 April. First-hand observations of the events in Tiananmen Square on 4 April report that all levels of society, from the poorest peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over the treatment of Zhou, revolt against Mao and his policies, apprehension for China's future, and defiance of those who would seek to punish the public for commemorating Zhou's memory. There is nothing to suggest that events were coordinated from any position of leadership: it was a spontaneous demonstration reflecting widespread public sentiment. Deng Xiaoping was notably absent, and he instructed his children to avoid being seen at the square.\nOn the morning of 5 April, crowds gathering around the memorial arrived to discover that it had been completely removed by the police during the night, angering them. Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a violent riot, in which police cars were set on fire and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square.\nBy 6:00 pm, most of the crowd had dispersed, but a small group remained until 10:00 pm, when a security force entered Tiananmen Square and arrested them. (The reported figure of those arrested was 388 people but was rumored to be far higher.) Many of those arrested were later sentenced to \"people's trial\" at Peking University or were sentenced to prison work camps. Incidents similar to those which occurred in Beijing on 4 and 5 April occurred in Zhengzhou, Kunming, Taiyuan, Changchun, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. Possibly because of his close association with Zhou, Deng Xiaoping was formally stripped of all positions \"inside and outside the Party\" on 7 April, following this \"Tiananmen Incident\".\nAfter ousting Hua Guofeng and assuming control of China in 1980, Deng Xiaoping released those arrested in the Tiananmen Incident as part of a broader effort to reverse the effects of the Cultural Revolution.\nLegacy.\nBy the end of his lifetime, Zhou was widely viewed as representing moderation and justice in Chinese popular culture. Since his death, Zhou Enlai has been regarded as a skilled negotiator fluent in foreign languages, a master of policy implementation, a devoted revolutionary, and a pragmatic statesman with an unusual attentiveness to detail and nuance. He was also known for his tireless and dedicated work ethic, and his unusual charm and poise in public. Zhou's political behavior should be viewed in light of his political philosophy as well as his personality. To a large extent, Zhou epitomized the paradox inherent in a Communist politician with traditional Chinese upbringing: at once conservative and radical, pragmatic and ideological, possessed of a belief in order and harmony as well as a faith, which he developed very gradually over time, in the progressive power of rebellion and revolution.\nThough a firm believer in the Communist ideal on which the People's Republic was founded, Zhou is widely credited to have moderated the excesses of Mao's radical policies within the limits of his power. It has been assumed that he successfully protected several imperial and religious sites of cultural significance (such as the Potala Palace in Lhasa and Forbidden City in Beijing) from the Red Guards, and shielded many top-level leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, as well as many officials, academics and artists from purges. Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying Zhou was \"sometimes forced to act against his conscience in order to minimize the damage\" stemming from Mao's policies.\nWhile many earlier Chinese leaders today have been subjected to criticism inside China, Zhou's image has remained positive and respected among contemporary Chinese. Many Chinese continue to venerate Zhou as possibly the most humane leader of the 20th century, and the CPC today promotes Zhou as a dedicated and self-sacrificing leader who remains a symbol of the Communist Party. Even historians who list Mao's faults generally attribute the opposite qualities to Zhou: Zhou was cultured and educated whereas Mao was crude and simple; Zhou was consistent whereas Mao was unstable; Zhou was stoic whereas Mao was paranoid. Following the death of Mao, Chinese press emphasized in particular his consultative, logical, realistic, and cool-headed leadership style.\nHowever, recent academic criticism of Zhou has focused on his late relationship with Mao, and his political activities during the Cultural Revolution, arguing that the relationship between Zhou and Mao may have been more complex than is commonly portrayed. Zhou has been depicted as unconditionally submissive and extremely loyal to Mao and his allies, going out of his way to support or permit the persecution of friends and relatives in order to avoid facing political condemnation himself. After the founding of the PRC, Zhou was unable or unwilling to protect the former spies that he had employed in the Chinese Civil War and the Second World War, who were persecuted for their wartime contacts with the enemies of the CCP. Early in the Cultural Revolution, he told Jiang Qing \"From now on you make all the decisions, and I'll make sure they're carried out,\" and publicly declared that his old comrade, Liu Shaoqi, \"deserved to die\" for opposing Mao. In the effort to avoid being persecuted for opposing Mao, Zhou passively accepted the political persecution of many others, including his own brother Zhou Enshou.\nA popular saying within China once compared Zhou to a \"budaoweng\" (a tumbler), which can imply that he was a political opportunist. Li Zhisui, then one of Mao's personal physicians, characterized Zhou as such and was severely critical of Zhou in his book \"The Private Life of Chairman Mao\", describing him as \"Mao's slave, absolutely obsequiously obedient... Everything he did, he did to be loyal to Mao. Neither he nor [Deng Yingchao] had a shred of independent thought\". Li also described Mao's contradictory relationship with Zhou as one where he demanded total loyalty, \"but because Zhou was so subservient and loyal, Mao held [Zhou] in contempt\". Some observers have criticized him as being too diplomatic: avoiding clear stands in complex political situations and instead becoming ideologically elusive, ambiguous, and enigmatic. Several explanations have been offered to explain his elusiveness. Dick Wilson, the former chief editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review, writes that Zhou's only option \"was to go on pretending to support the [Cultural Revolution] movement, while endeavoring to deflect its successes, blunt its mischief and stanch the wounds it was inflicting.\" This explanation for Zhou's elusiveness was also widely accepted by many Chinese after his death. Wilson also writes that Zhou \"would have been hounded out of his position of influence, removed from control of the Government\" were he to \"make a stand and demand that Mao call off the campaign or bring the Red Guards to heel.\"\nZhou's involvement in the Cultural Revolution is thus defended by many on the grounds that he had no choice other than political martyrdom. Due to his influence and political ability, the entire government may have collapsed without his cooperation. Given the political circumstances of the last decade of Zhou's life, it is unlikely that he would have survived a purge without cultivating the support of Mao through active assistance.\nZhou received a great deal of praise from American statesmen who met him in 1971. Henry Kissinger wrote that he had been extremely impressed with Zhou's intelligence and character, describing him as \"equally at home in philosophy, reminiscence, historical analysis, tactical probes, humorous repartee... [and] could display an extraordinary personal graciousness.\" Kissinger called Zhou \"one of the two or three most impressive men I have ever met,\" stating that \"his commands of facts, in particular his knowledge of American events and, for that matter, of my own background, was stunning.\" In his memoirs, Richard Nixon stated that he was impressed with Zhou's exceptional \"brilliance and dynamism\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Mao dominated any gathering; Zhou suffused it. Mao's passion strove to overwhelm opposition; Zhou's intellect would seek to persuade or outmaneuver it. Mao was sardonic; Zhou penetrating. Mao thought of himself as a philosopher; Zhou saw his role as an administrator or a negotiator. Mao was eager to accelerate history; Zhou was content to exploit its currents.\"\n\u2014Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, \"On China\" (2011)\nAfter coming to power, Deng Xiaoping may have overemphasized Zhou Enlai's achievements to distance the Communist Party from Mao's Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, both of which had seriously weakened the Party's prestige. Deng observed that Mao's disastrous policies could no longer represent the Party's finest hour, but that the legacy and character of Zhou Enlai could. Furthermore, Deng received credit for enacting successful economic policies that Zhou initially proposed. By actively associating itself with an already popular Zhou Enlai, Zhou's legacy may have been used (and possibly distorted) as a political tool of the Party after his death.\nZhou remains a widely commemorated figure in China today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Zhou ordered his hometown of Huai'an not to transform his house into a memorial and not to keep up the Zhou family tombs. These orders were respected within Zhou's lifetime, but today his family home and traditional family school have been restored, and are visited by a large number of tourists every year. In 1998, Huai'an, in order to commemorate Zhou's one hundredth birthday, opened a vast commemorative park with a museum dedicated to his life. The park includes a reproduction of Xihuating, Zhou's living and working quarters in Beijing.\nThe city of Tianjin has established a museum to Zhou and his wife Deng Yingchao, and the city of Nanjing has erected a memorial commemorating Communist negotiations in 1946 with the Nationalist government which features a bronze statue of Zhou. Stamps commemorating the first anniversary of Zhou's death were issued in 1977, and in 1998 to commemorate his 100th birthday.\nThe 2013 historical drama film \"The Story of Zhou Enlai\" features the trip of Zhou Enlai in May 1961 during the Great Leap Forward, when he investigated the rural situation in Huaxi of Guiyang and a former revolutionary base Boyan Township of Hebei.\nIn popular culture.\nChinese actor Sun Weimin has frequently portrayed Zhou on screen, including in films \"The Founding of a Republic\" (2009) and \"Mao Zedong 1949\" (2019), and the television series \"Diplomatic Situation\" (2019), among others.\nTwo rock songs refer to Zhou. In their 1969 song \"How-Hi-the-Li,\" composed by bassist Ric Grech, Family, in a satire of political figures, ask \"if Mr. Chou En-Lai, he gets high / With all the tea in China.\" Zhou is one of many world figures mentioned in Billy Joel's 1989 song \"We Didn't Start the Fire.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Duala belongs to the Bantu language family, in a subgroup called Sawabantu. It is a tonal language with subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order. Maho (2009) treats Duala as a cluster of five languages: Duala proper, Bodiman, Oli (Ewodi, Wuri), Pongo and Mongo. He also notes a Duala-based pidgin named \"Jo\".\nHistory.\nThe origins of Duala come from the migrations of the Duala people during the sixteenth century from the Congo River Basin to the coastal areas of southern Cameroon. While it is a Bantu language, Guthrie estimates that it has only retained as little as 14% of the roots of Proto-Bantu.\nAlfred Saker, a British missionary and linguist, completed the first translation of the Bible into Duala in 1870. After the German colonization of Cameroon in 1885, the Basel Mission promoted Duala as a lingua franca in southern Cameroon with support from the German authorities. In particular, Julius von Soden, the Governor of Cameroon in the 1880s, supported Duala as a recognized lingua franca in the colony, although he maintained that German should be the language of instruction in schools for brighter pupils. In 1903, the Basel missionaries launched a monthly journal titled Mul\u00e9e Ng\u00e9a.\nThe missionaries' focus on using Duala in areas that did not natively speak it was viewed as dangerous by colonial officials, as they feared the practice would lead to ethnic conflict by elevating Duala to a prestige language. Since Duala was also being used by the missionaries in their schools, it was difficult for Cameroonians to become educated and obtain business, teaching, or government positions without knowledge of the language. This reinforced German officials' fears of the Duala ethnic group gaining too much power. Therefore, upon becoming Governor of Cameroon, Jesko von Puttkamer decided to suppress Duala and other local languages, such as Ewe in Togoland, and promote German in the colony instead. Puttkamer blamed the Protestant missionaries for the lack of German-language use in Cameroon, and pressured them to stop using Duala in their schools and official communications. In 1897, he began pressuring them to switch to German, and later praised the Catholic missionaries in the territory for using German.\nIn 1910, Governor Theodor Seitz issued an ordinance establishing governmental control over all educational establishments in the colony, including those run by missionaries. The ordinance enforced the use of German in schools and forbade the use of all other European languages. It also limited the use of Duala by missionaries to the traditional lands of the Duala people in order to prevent the spread of the language, as the German government wanted to prevent communication between local groups in the case of a revolution.\nAfter World War I, eastern Cameroon was mandated by the League of Nations to France and western Cameroon was mandated to the United Kingdom. The French government ordered that only French could be used in schools in 1920. The British allowed the use of Duala by missionaries and schools, but English-medium schools became the norm due to the colonial governmental influence and the lack of written materials in Duala. By the 1950s, this meant that Cameroonians were using English as an instructional language and Duala as a \"church\" language, even if Duala was not their mother tongue. Through the 1960s and 1970s, as Cameroon gained independence, Duala remained in use only in religious and informal contexts, as the missionaries continued to use it and develop Duala texts for religious use.\nUsage.\nUniversity programs in the cities of Yaound\u00e9 and Douala, as well as many local lyc\u00e9es, offer classes in Duala and other local languages. Duala is also used on an unofficial ad hoc basis in other schools as a medium of primary instruction to facilitate understanding. The television channel Dan Broadcasting System airs programs in Duala. However, it has been observed that attempts to introduce Duala and other local languages into schools have received some resistance from locals, as they do not view it as helpful for socio-economic development.\nPopular culture.\nThe song \"Soul Makossa\", as well as pop songs that repeated its lyrics, internationally popularized the Duala word for \"(I) dance\", \"makossa\". The song \"Alane\" by artist Wes Madiko is sung in Duala and reached the #1 chart position in at least 10 European countries.\nPhonology.\nConsonants.\nSounds /b, d, \u1d50b, \u207fd/ are heard as implosives [\u0253, \u0257], [\u1d50\u0253, \u207f\u0257] when before close vowels /i, u/.\n[r] is heard as a variant of /l/ in loanwords.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50449", "revid": "34515925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50449", "title": "The Economist", "text": "British news and current affairs journal\nThe Economist is a British news and current affairs journal published in a weekly print magazine format and daily on digital platforms. Variously referred to as a magazine and a newspaper, it publishes stories on topics that include economics, business, geopolitics, technology and culture. Mostly written and edited in London, it has other editorial offices in the United States and in major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The publication prominently features data journalism, and has a focus on interpretive analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.\nFounded in 1843, \"The Economist\" was first circulated by Scottish economist James Wilson to muster support for abolishing the British Corn Laws (1815\u20131846), a system of import tariffs. Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into political economy and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is recognisable by its fire engine red masthead (nameplate) and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with no byline, in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. It is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, \"1843\", and a variety of podcasts, films, and books. It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK.\nThe editorial stance of \"The Economist\" primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably economic liberalism. It has supported radical centrism, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions economic liberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. Its extensive use of word play and high subscription price has linked the paper with a high-income elite readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations. In line with this, it claims to have an influential readership of prominent business leaders and policy-makers.\nHistory.\n\"The Economist\" was founded by the British businessman and banker James Wilson in 1843, to advance the repeal of the Corn Laws, a system of import tariffs. A prospectus for the newspaper from 5 August 1843 enumerated thirteen areas of coverage that its editors wanted the publication to focus on:\nWilson described it as taking part in \"a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress\", a phrase which still appears on its imprint (US: masthead) as the publication's mission. It has long been respected as \"one of the most competent and subtle Western periodicals on public affairs\". It was cited by Karl Marx in his formulation of socialist theory because Marx felt the publication epitomised the interests of the bourgeoisie. He wrote that \"the London \"Economist\", the European organ of the aristocracy of finance, described most strikingly the attitude of this class.\" In 1915, revolutionary Vladimir Lenin referred to \"The Economist\" as a \"journal that speaks for British millionaires\". Additionally, Lenin stated that \"The Economist\" held a \"bourgeois-pacifist\" position and supported peace out of fear of revolution.\nIn the currency disputes of the mid-nineteenth century, the journal sided with the Banking School against the Currency School. It criticised the Bank Charter Act 1844 which restricted the amount of bank notes that the Bank of England could issue on the basis of Currency School policy encouraged by Lord Overstone, that eventually developed into monetarism. It blamed the 1857 financial crisis in Britain on 'a certain class of \"doctrinaires\"' who 'refer every commercial crisis and its disastrous consequences to \"excessive issues of bank notes\". It identified the causes of the financial crisis as variations in interest rates and a build-up of excess financial capital leading to unwise investments.\nIn 1920, the paper's circulation rose to 6,170. In 1934, it underwent its first major redesign. The current fire engine red nameplate was created by Reynolds Stone in 1959. In 1971, \"The Economist\" changed its large broadsheet format into a smaller magazine-style perfect-bound formatting. In 1981 the publication introduced a North American edition after publishing the British edition since 1843; its circulation had increased more than tenfold by 2010. In January 2012, \"The Economist\" launched a new weekly section devoted exclusively to China, the first new country section since the introduction of one on the United States in 1942.\nIn 1991, James Fallows argued in \"The Washington Post\" that \"The Economist\" used editorial lines that contradicted the news stories they purported to highlight. In 1999, Andrew Sullivan complained in \"The New Republic\" that it uses \"marketing genius\" to make up for deficiencies in original reporting, resulting in \"a kind of \"Reader's Digest\"\" for America's corporate elite. \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"its writers rarely see a political or economic problem that cannot be solved by the trusted three-card trick of privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation\".\nIn 2005, the \"Chicago Tribune\" named it the best English-language paper noting its strength in international reporting where it does not feel moved to \"cover a faraway land only at a time of unmitigated disaster\" and that it kept a wall between its reporting and its more conservative editorial policies. In 2008, Jon Meacham, former editor of \"Newsweek\" and a self-described \"fan\", criticised \"The Economist\"'s focus on analysis over original reporting. In 2012, \"The Economist\" was accused of hacking into the computer of Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, leading to his resignation as the chairman of the International Crimes Tribunal. In August 2015, Pearson sold its 50% stake in the newspaper to the Italian Agnelli family's investment company, Exor, for \u00a3469 million (US$531 million) and the paper re-acquired the remaining shares for \u00a3182 million ($206 million).\nFossil fuel advertising.\nAn investigation by the Intercept, the Nation and DeSmog found that \"The Economist\" is one of the leading media outlets that publishes advertising for the fossil fuel industry. Journalists who cover climate change for \"The Economist\" are concerned that conflicts of interest with the companies and industries that caused climate change and obstructed action will reduce the credibility of their reporting on climate change and cause readers to downplay the climate crisis.\nOrganisation.\n\"The Economist\" is a member of the Economist Group.\nShareholders.\n Pearson plc held a 50% shareholding via The Financial Times Limited until August 2015. At that time, Pearson sold their share in the Economist. The Agnelli family's Exor paid \u00a3287m to raise their stake from 4.7% to 43.4% while the Economist paid \u00a3182m for the balance of 5.04m shares which will be distributed to current shareholders. Aside from the Agnelli family, smaller shareholders in the company include Cadbury, Rothschild (21%), Schroder, Layton and other family interests as well as a number of staff and former staff shareholders. A board of trustees formally appoints the editor, who cannot be removed without its permission. The Economist Newspaper Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Economist Group. Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild was chairman of the company from 1972 to 1989.\nAlthough \"The Economist\" has a global emphasis and scope, about two-thirds of the 75 staff journalists are based in the London borough of Westminster. However, due to half of all subscribers originating in the United States, \"The Economist\" has core editorial offices and substantial operations in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington D.C.\nEditor.\nThe editor-in-chief, commonly known as simply \"the Editor\", of \"The Economist\" is charged with formulating the paper's editorial policies and overseeing corporate operations. Since its 1843 founding, the editors have been the following:\nNotes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTone and voice.\nAlthough it has many individual columns, by tradition and current practice the newspaper ensures a uniform voice\u2014aided by the anonymity of writers\u2014throughout its pages, as if most articles were written by a single author, which may be perceived to display dry, understated wit, and precise use of language. \"The Economist\"'s treatment of economics presumes a working familiarity with fundamental concepts of classical economics. For instance, it does not explain terms like invisible hand, macroeconomics, or demand curve, and may take just six or seven words to explain the theory of comparative advantage. Articles involving economics do not presume any formal training on the part of the reader and aim to be accessible to the educated layperson. It usually does not translate short French and German quotes or phrases but describes the business or nature of even well-known entities, writing, for example, \"Goldman Sachs, an investment bank\". \"The Economist\" is known for its extensive use of word play, including puns, allusions, and metaphors, as well as alliteration and assonance, especially in its headlines and captions. This can make it difficult to understand for those who are not native English speakers.\nWidely considered as a magazine\", The Economist\" has traditionally and historically persisted in referring to itself as a \"newspaper\", rather than a \"news magazine\", despite its switch from broadsheet to perfect-binding format in 1971. On its website the Economist itself clarifies: \"By the time the transformation from newspaper to magazine format had been completed, the habit of referring to ourselves as \"this newspaper\" had stuck.\"\nEditorial anonymity.\n\"The Economist\"'s articles often take a definite editorial stance and almost never carry a byline. Not even the name of the editor is printed in the issue. It is a long-standing tradition that an editor's only signed article during their tenure is written on the occasion of their departure from the position. The author of a piece is named in certain circumstances: when notable persons are invited to contribute opinion pieces; when journalists of \"The Economist\" compile special reports (previously known as surveys); for the Year in Review special edition; and to highlight a potential conflict of interest over a book review. The names of \"The Economist\" editors and correspondents can be located on the media directory pages of the website. Online blog pieces are signed with the initials of the writer and authors of print stories are allowed to note their authorship from their personal web sites. One anonymous writer of \"The Economist\" observed: \"This approach is not without its faults (we have four staff members with the initials 'J.P.', for example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view.\" According to one academic study, the anonymous ethos of the weekly has contributed to strengthening three areas for \"The Economist\": collective and consistent voice, talent and newsroom management, and brand strength.\nThe editors say this is necessary because \"collective voice and personality matter more than the identities of individual journalists\", and reflects \"a collaborative effort\". In most articles, authors refer to themselves as \"your correspondent\" or \"this reviewer\". The writers of the titled opinion columns tend to refer to themselves by the title (hence, a sentence in the \"Lexington\" column might read \"Lexington was informed...\"). American author and long-time reader Michael Lewis criticised the paper's editorial anonymity in 1991, labelling it a means to hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. Although individual articles are written anonymously, there is no secrecy over who the writers are, as they are listed on \"The Economist\"'s website, which also provides summaries of their careers and academic qualifications. In 2009, Lewis included multiple \"Economist\" articles in his anthology about the 2008 financial crisis, \"\".\nJohn Ralston Saul describes \"The Economist\" as a newspaper that \"hides the names of the journalists who write its articles in order to create the illusion that they dispense disinterested truth rather than opinion. This sales technique, reminiscent of pre-Reformation Catholicism, is not surprising in a publication named after the social science most given to wild guesses and imaginary facts presented in the guise of inevitability and exactitude. That it is the Bible of the corporate executive indicates to what extent received wisdom is the daily bread of a managerial civilization.\"\nFeatures.\n\"The Economist\"'s primary focus is world events, politics and business, but it also runs regular sections on science and technology as well as books and the arts. Approximately every two weeks, the publication includes an in-depth special report (previously called surveys) on a given topic. The five main categories are Countries and Regions, Business, Finance and Economics, Science, and Technology. The newspaper goes to press on Thursdays, between 6\u00a0p.m. and 7\u00a0p.m. GMT, and is available at newsagents in many countries the next day. It is printed at seven sites around the world.\nSince July 2007, there has also been a complete audio edition of the paper available 9\u00a0pm London time on Thursdays. The audio version of \"The Economist\" is produced by the production company \"Talking Issues\". The company records the full text of the newspaper in MP3 format, including the extra pages in the UK edition. The weekly 130 MB download is free for subscribers and available for a fee for non-subscribers. The publication's writers adopt a tight style that seeks to include the maximum amount of information in a limited space. David G. Bradley, publisher of \"The Atlantic\", described the formula as \"a consistent world view expressed, consistently, in tight and engaging prose\".\nLetters.\n\"The Economist\" frequently receives letters from its readership in response to the previous week's edition. While it is known to feature letters from senior businesspeople, politicians, ambassadors, and spokespeople, the paper includes letters from typical readers as well. Well-written or witty responses from anyone are considered, and controversial issues frequently produce a torrent of letters. For example, the survey of corporate social responsibility, published January 2005, produced largely critical letters from Oxfam, the World Food Programme, United Nations Global Compact, the Chairman of BT Group, an ex-Director of Shell and the UK Institute of Directors.\nIn an effort to foster diversity of thought, \"The Economist\" routinely publishes letters that openly criticize the paper's articles and stance. After \"The Economist\" ran a critique of Amnesty International in its issue dated 24 March 2007, its letters page ran a reply from Amnesty, as well as several other letters in support of the organisation, including one from the head of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Rebuttals from officials within regimes such as the Singapore government are routinely printed, to comply with local right-of-reply laws without compromising editorial independence.\nLetters published in the paper are typically between 150 and 200 words long and had the now-discontinued salutation 'Sir' from 1843 to 2015. In the latter year, upon the appointment of Zanny Minton Beddoes, the first female editor, the salutation was dismissed; letters have since had no salutation. Prior to a change in procedure, all responses to online articles were published in \"The Inbox\".\nColumns.\nThe publication runs several opinion columns whose names reflect their topic:\n\"TQ\".\nEvery three months, \"The Economist\" publishes a technology report called \"Technology Quarterly\", or simply, \"TQ\", a special section focusing on recent trends and developments in science and technology. The feature is also known to intertwine \"economic matters with a technology\". The \"TQ\" often carries a theme, such as quantum computing or cloud storage, and assembles an assortment of articles around the common subject.\n\"1843\".\nIn September 2007, \"The Economist\" launched a sister lifestyle magazine under the title \"Intelligent Life\" as a quarterly publication. At its inauguration it was billed as for \"the arts, style, food, wine, cars, travel and anything else under the sun, as long as it's interesting\". The magazine focuses on analysing the \"insights and predictions for the luxury landscape\" across the world. Approximately ten years later, in March 2016, the newspaper's parent company, Economist Group, rebranded the lifestyle magazine as \"1843\", in honour of the paper's founding year. It has since remained at six issues per year and carries the motto \"Stories of An Extraordinary World\". Unlike \"The Economist\", the author's names appear next to their articles in \"1843\".\n\"1843\" features contributions from \"Economist\" journalists as well as writers around the world and photography commissioned for each issue. It is seen as a market competitor to \"The Wall Street Journal\"'s \"WSJ.\" and the \"Financial Times\"' \"FT Magazine\". Since its March 2016 relaunch, it has been edited by Rosie Blau, a former correspondent for \"The Economist\".\nIn May 2020 it was announced that the \"1843 magazine\" would move to a digital-only format.\n\"The World Ahead\".\nThe paper also produces two annual reviews and predictive reports titled \"The World In [Year]\" and \"The World If [Year]\" as part of their \"The World Ahead\" franchise. In both features, the newspaper publishes a review of the social, cultural, economic and political events that have shaped the year and will continue to influence the immediate future. The issue was described by the American think tank Brookings Institution as \"\"The Economist\"'s annual [150-page] exercise in forecasting\". Translated versions of \"The World In [Year]\" are distributed, e.g. by Jang Group in Pakistan (Urdu) en by Roularta in Flanders (Dutch).\nCountry of the Year.\nIn 2013, \"The Economist\" began awarding a 'Country of the Year' in its annual Christmas special editions. Selected by the newspaper, this award recognises the country that was 'most improved' over the preceding year.\nBooks.\nIn addition to publishing its main newspaper, lifestyle magazine, and special features, \"The Economist\" also produces books with topics overlapping with that of its newspaper. The weekly also publishes a series of technical manuals (or guides) as an offshoot of its explanatory journalism. Some of these books serve as collections of articles and columns the paper produces. Often columnists from the newspaper write technical manuals on their topic of expertise; for example, Philip Coggan, a finance correspondent, authored \"The Economist Guide to Hedge Funds\" (2011).\nThe paper publishes book reviews in every issue, with a large collective review in their year-end (holiday) issue \u2013 published as \"\"The Economist\"'s Books of the Year\". Additionally, the paper has its own in-house stylebook rather than following an industry-wide writing style template. All \"Economist\" writing, and publications follow \"The Economist Style Guide\", in various editions.\nWriting competitions.\n\"The Economist\" sponsors a wide array of writing competitions and prizes throughout the year for readers. In 1999, \"The Economist\" organised a global futurist writing competition, The World in 2050. Co-sponsored by Royal Dutch/Shell, the competition included a first prize of US$20,000 and publication in \"The Economist\"'s annual flagship publication, \"The World In\". Over 3,000 entries from around the world were submitted via a website set up for the purpose and at various Royal Dutch Shell offices worldwide. The judging panel included Bill Emmott, Esther Dyson, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, and Matt Ridley.\nIn the summer of 2019, they launched the Open Future writing competition with an inaugural youth essay-writing prompt about climate change. During this competition the paper accepted a submission from an artificially-intelligent computer writing program.\nPodcasts.\nSince 2006, \"The Economist\" has produced several podcast series. The podcasts currently in production include:\nAdditionally, \"The Economist\" has produced several limited-run podcast series, such as \"The Prince\" (on Xi Jinping), \"Next Year in Moscow\" (on Russian emigrants and dissidents following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine), \"Boss Class\" (on business management) and \"Scam Inc\", an 8-part series about the growing business and impact of scams.\nIn September 2023, \"The Economist\" announced the launch of Economist Podcasts+, a paid subscription service for its podcast offerings.\nEspresso news app.\nIn 2014 \"The Economist\" launched its short-form news app Espresso. The product offers a daily briefing from the editors, published every day of the week except Sunday. The app is available to paid subscribers and as a separate subscription.\nData journalism.\nThe presence of data journalism in \"The Economist\" can be traced to its founding year in 1843. Initially, the weekly published basic international trade figures and tables. The paper first included a graphical model in 1847\u2014a letter featuring an illustration of various coin sizes\u2014and its first non-epistolary chart\u2014a tree map visualising the size of coal fields in America and England\u2014was included in November 1854. This early adoption of data-based articles was estimated to be \"a 100 years before the field's modern emergence\" by \"Data Journalism.com.\" Its transition from broadsheet to magazine-style formatting led to the adoption of coloured graphs, first in fire-engine-red during the 1980s and then in a thematic blue in 2001. \"The\" \"Economist\"'s editors and readers developed a taste for more data-driven stories throughout the 2000s. Starting in the late-2000s, the paper began to publish more and more articles that centred solely on charts, some of which were published online every weekday. These \"daily charts\" are typically followed by a short, 500-word explanation. In September 2009, \"The Economist\" launched a Twitter account for their Data Team.\nIn 2015, the data-journalism department\u2014a dedicated team of data journalists, visualisers and interactive developers\u2014was created to head up the paper's data journalism efforts. The team's output soon included election forecasting models, covering the French presidential elections of 2017 and 2022 and the US presidential and congressional elections in 2020, among others. In late-2023, the data team advertised for a political data scientist to bolster its political forecasting efforts. In order to ensure transparency in the team's data collection and analysis \"The Economist\" maintains a corporate GitHub account to publicly disclose their models and software wherever possible. In October 2018, they introduced a \"Graphic Detail\" featuring large charts and maps in both their print and digital editions which ran until November 2023.\nIndexes.\nHistorically, the publication has also maintained a section of economic statistics, such as employment figures, economic growth, and interest rates. These statistical publications have been found to be seen as authoritative and decisive in British society. \"The Economist\" also publishes a variety of rankings seeking to position business schools and undergraduate universities among each other, respectively. In 2015, they published their first ranking of U.S. universities, focusing on comparable economic advantages. Their data for the rankings is sourced from the U.S. Department of Education and is calculated as a function of median earnings through regression analysis. Among others, the most well-known data indexes the weekly publishes are:\nOpinions.\nThe editorial stance of \"The Economist\" primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably, economic liberalism. Since its founding, it has supported radical centrism, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. \"The Economist\" typically champions neoliberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. When \"The Economist\" was founded, the term \"economism\" denoted what would today be termed \"economic liberalism\". The activist and journalist George Monbiot has described it as neoliberal while occasionally accepting the propositions of Keynesian economics where deemed more \"reasonable\". \"The Economist\" favours a carbon tax to fight global warming. According to one former editor, Bill Emmott, \"\"The Economist\"'s philosophy has always been liberal, not conservative\". Alongside other publications such as \"The Guardian\", \"The Observer\" and \"The Independent\", it supports the United Kingdom becoming a republic.\nIndividual contributors take diverse views. \"The Economist\" favours the support, through central banks, of banks and other important corporations. This principle can, in a much more limited form, be traced back to Walter Bagehot, the third editor of \"The Economist\", who argued that the Bank of England should support major banks that got into difficulties. Karl Marx deemed \"The Economist\" the \"European organ\" of \"the aristocracy of finance\". \"The Economist\" has also supported liberal causes on social issues such as recognition of gay marriages, legalisation of drugs, criticises the U.S. tax model, and seems to support some government regulation on health issues, such as smoking in public, as well as bans on smacking children. \"The Economist\" consistently favours guest worker programmes, parental choice of school, and amnesties, and once published an \"obituary\" of God. \"The Economist\" also has a long record of supporting gun control. In 2021, it was criticized for publishing an \"anti-transgender screed\". In 2019, The Economist received backlash for suggesting that transgender people should be sterilized. It subsequently apologized for this statement.\nIn British general elections, \"The Economist\" has endorsed the Labour Party (in 2005 and 2024), the Conservative Party (in 2010 and 2015), and the Liberal Democrats (in 2017 and 2019), and supported both Republican and Democratic candidates in the United States. \"The Economist\" put its stance this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What, besides free trade and free markets, does \"The Economist\" believe in? \"It is to the Radicals that \"The Economist\" still likes to think of itself as belonging. The extreme centre is the paper's historical position\". That is as true today as when Crowther [Geoffrey, \"Economist\" editor 1938\u20131956] said it in 1955. \"The Economist\" considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It has supported the Americans in Vietnam. But it has also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton, and espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well as\u2014more recently\u2014gun control and gay marriage.\nIn 2008, \"The Economist\" commented that Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the president of Argentina at the time, was \"Dashing hopes of change, Argentina's new president is leading her country into economic peril and social conflict\". \"The Economist\" also called for Bill Clinton's impeachment, as well as for Donald Rumsfeld's resignation after the emergence of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. Although \"The Economist\" initially gave vigorous support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, it later called the operation \"bungled from the start\" and criticised the \"almost criminal negligence\" of the Bush Administration's handling of the Iraq War, while maintaining in 2007 that pulling out in the short term would be irresponsible. In an editorial marking its 175th anniversary, \"The Economist\" criticised adherents to liberalism for becoming too inclined to protect the political status quo rather than pursue reform. It called on liberals to return to advocating for bold political, economic and social reforms: protecting free markets, land and tax reform in the tradition of Georgism, open immigration, a rethink of the social contract with more emphasis on education, and a revival of liberal internationalism.\nCirculation.\nEach of \"The Economist\" issues' official date range is from Saturday to the following Friday. \"The Economist\" posts each week's new content online at approximately 21:00 Thursday evening UK time, ahead of the official publication date. From July to December 2019, their average global print circulation was over 909,476, while combined with their digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. However, on a weekly average basis, the paper can reach up to 5.1 million readers, across their print and digital runs. Across their social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016.\nCirculation grew steadily in its early years. In 1844, it was 1,800, 3,800 in 1850 and had risen to 4,300 by 1854. In 1877, the publication's circulation was 3,700, and in 1920 it had risen to 6,000. Circulation increased rapidly after 1945, reaching 100,000 by 1970. Circulation is audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC). From around 30,000 in 1960 it has risen to near 1 million by 2000 and by 2016 to about 1.3\u00a0million. Approximately half of all sales (54%) originate in the United States with sales in the United Kingdom making 14% of the total and continental Europe 19%. Of its American readers, two out of three earn more than $100,000 a year. \"The Economist\" has sales, both by subscription and at newsagents, in over 200 countries. \"The Economist\" once boasted about its limited circulation. In the early 1990s it used the slogan \"\"The Economist\" \u2013 not read by millions of people\". Geoffrey Crowther, a former editor, wrote: \"Never in the history of journalism has so much been read for so long by so few.\"\nCensorship.\nSections of \"The Economist\" criticising authoritarian regimes are frequently removed from the paper by the authorities in those countries. On 15 June 2006, Iran banned the sale of \"The Economist\" when it published a map labelling the Persian Gulf simply as Gulf\u2014a choice that derives its political significance from the Persian Gulf naming dispute. In 29 May 2025, Reuters reported that Vietnam had banned the May 24 issue featuring the president T\u00f4 L\u00e2m that described him as \"an ambitious leader who emerged \"from the security state\" and who \"must turn himself into a reformer\" to adjust the country's economic model and make it richer\".\nIn a separate incident, the government of Zimbabwe went further and imprisoned \"The Economist\"'s correspondent there, Andrew Meldrum. The government charged him with violating a statute on \"publishing untruth\" for writing that a woman was decapitated by supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Patriotic Front party. The decapitation claim was retracted, and allegedly fabricated by the woman's husband. The correspondent was later acquitted, only to receive a deportation order. On 19 August 2013, \"The Economist\" disclosed that the Missouri Department of Corrections had censored its issue of 29 June 2013. According to the letter sent by the department, prisoners were not allowed to receive the issue because \"1. it constitutes a threat to the security or discipline of the institution; 2. may facilitate or encourage criminal activity; or 3. may interfere with the rehabilitation of an offender\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His fall from power marked the end of the German Empire as well as the Hohenzollern dynasty's 500-year rule over Prussia and its predecessor state, Brandenburg.\nBorn during the reign of his granduncle Frederick William IV of Prussia, Wilhelm was the son of Prince Frederick William and Victoria, Princess Royal. Through his mother, he was the eldest of the 42 grandchildren of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. In March 1888, Wilhelm's father, Frederick William, ascended the German and Prussian thrones as Frederick III. Frederick died just 99 days later, and his son succeeded him as Wilhelm II.\nIn March 1890, the young Kaiser dismissed longtime Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and assumed direct control over his nation's policies, embarking on a \"New Course\" to cement Germany's status as a leading world power. Over the course of his reign, the German colonial empire acquired new territories in China and the Pacific (such as Jiaozhou Bay, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands) and became Europe's largest manufacturer. However, Wilhelm often undermined such progress by making tactless and threatening statements towards other countries without first consulting his ministers. Likewise, his regime did much to alienate itself from other great powers by initiating a massive naval build-up, contesting French control of Morocco, and building a railway through Baghdad that challenged Britain's dominion in the Persian Gulf. By the second decade of the 20th century, Germany could rely only on significantly weaker nations such as Austria-Hungary and the declining Ottoman Empire as allies.\nDespite strengthening Germany's position as a great power by building a powerful navy as well as promoting scientific innovation within its borders, Kaiser Wilhelm's public pronouncements and erratic foreign policy greatly antagonized the international community and are considered by many to have contributed to the fall of the German Empire. In 1914, his diplomatic brinksmanship culminated in Germany's guarantee of military support to Austria-Hungary during the July Crisis which plunged all of Europe into World War I. A lax wartime leader, Wilhelm left virtually all decision-making regarding strategy and organisation of the war effort to the German Supreme Army Command. By August 1916, this broad delegation of power gave rise to a \"de facto\" military dictatorship that dominated the country's policies for the rest of the conflict. Despite emerging victorious over Russia and obtaining significant territorial gains in Eastern Europe, Germany was forced to relinquish all its conquests after a decisive defeat on the Western Front in the autumn of 1918.\nLosing the support of his country's military and many of his subjects, Wilhelm was forced to abdicate during the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 which converted Germany into an unstable democratic state known as the Weimar Republic. Wilhelm subsequently fled to exile in the Netherlands, where he remained during its occupation by Nazi Germany in 1940 before dying there in 1941.\nEarly life.\nWilhelm was born in Berlin on 27 January 1859\u2014at the Crown Prince's Palace\u2014to Victoria, Princess Royal (\"Vicky\") and Prince Frederick William of Prussia (\"Fritz\", the future Frederick III). His mother, Vicky, was the eldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. At the time of Wilhelm's birth, his granduncle Frederick William IV was king of Prussia. Frederick William IV had been left permanently incapacitated by a series of strokes, and his younger brother Wilhelm, the young prince's grandfather, was acting as regent. Prince Wilhelm was the oldest of the 42 grandchildren of his maternal grandparents (Queen Victoria and Prince Albert). Upon the death of Frederick William IV in January 1861, Wilhelm's namesake grandfather became king, and the two-year-old Wilhelm became second in the line of succession to the Prussian throne. After 1871, Wilhelm also became second in the line to the newly created German Empire, which, according to the constitution of the German Empire, was ruled by the Prussian king. At the time of his birth, he was also sixth in the line of succession to the British throne, after his maternal uncles and his mother.\nTraumatic birth.\nShortly before midnight on 26 January 1859, Princess Vicky experienced labour pains, followed by her water breaking, after which August Wegner, the family's personal physician, was summoned. Upon examining Vicky, Wegner realised the infant was in the breech position; gynaecologist Eduard Arnold Martin was then sent for, arriving at the palace at 10 am on 27 January. After administering ipecac and prescribing a mild dose of chloroform, which was administered by Vicky's personal physician Sir James Clark, Martin advised Fritz the unborn child's life was endangered. As mild anaesthesia did not alleviate her extreme labour pains, resulting in her \"horrible screams and wails\", Clark finally administered full anaesthesia. Observing her contractions to be insufficiently strong, Martin administered a dose of ergot extract, and at 2:45 pm saw the infant's buttocks emerging from the birth canal but noticed the pulse in the umbilical cord was weak and intermittent. Despite this dangerous sign, Martin ordered a further heavy dose of chloroform, so he could better manipulate the infant. Observing the infant's legs to be raised upwards, and his left arm likewise raised upwards and behind his head, Martin \"carefully eased out the Prince's legs\". Due to the \"narrowness of the birth canal\", he then forcibly pulled the left arm downwards, tearing the brachial plexus, then continued to grasp the left arm to rotate the infant's trunk and free the right arm, likely exacerbating the injury. After completing the delivery, and despite realising the newborn prince was hypoxic, Martin turned his attention to the unconscious Vicky. Noticing after some minutes that the newborn remained silent, Martin and the midwife Fr\u00e4ulein Stahl worked frantically to revive the prince; finally, despite the disapproval of those present, Stahl spanked the newborn vigorously until \"a weak cry escaped his pale lips\".\nModern medical assessments have concluded Wilhelm's hypoxic state at birth, due to the breech delivery and the heavy dosage of chloroform, left him with minimal to mild brain damage, which manifested itself in his subsequent hyperactive and erratic behaviour, limited attention span and impaired social abilities. The brachial plexus injury resulted in Erb's palsy, which left Wilhelm with a withered left arm about shorter than his right. He tried with some success to conceal this; many photographs show him holding a pair of white gloves in his left hand to make the arm seem longer. In others, he holds his left hand with his right, has his disabled arm on the hilt of a sword, or holds a cane to give the illusion of a useful limb posed at a dignified angle. Historians have suggested that this disability affected his emotional development.\nEarly years.\nIn 1863, Wilhelm was taken to England to be present at the wedding of his uncle Bertie and Princess Alexandra of Denmark (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra). Wilhelm attended the ceremony in a Highland costume, complete with a small toy dirk. During the ceremony, the four-year-old became restless. His 18-year-old uncle Prince Alfred, charged with keeping an eye on him, told him to be quiet, but Wilhelm drew his dirk and threatened Alfred. When Alfred attempted to subdue him by force, Wilhelm bit him on the leg. His grandmother, Queen Victoria, missed seeing the fracas; to her Wilhelm remained \"a clever, dear, good little child, the great favourite of my beloved Vicky\".\nVicky was obsessed with her son's damaged arm, blaming herself for the child's handicap, and insisted that he become a good rider. The thought that Wilhelm, as heir to the throne, should not be able to ride was intolerable to her. Riding lessons began when Wilhelm was eight and were a matter of endurance for him. Over and over, the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces. He fell off time after time but, despite his tears, was set on its back again. After weeks of this, he was finally able to maintain his balance.\nWilhelm, from six years of age, was tutored and heavily influenced by the 39-year-old teacher Georg Ernst Hinzpeter. \"Hinzpeter\", he later wrote, \"was really a good fellow. Whether he was the right tutor for me, I dare not decide. The torments inflicted on me, in this pony riding, must be attributed to my mother.\"\nAs a teenager, Wilhelm was educated at Kassel at the Friedrichsgymnasium. In January 1877, Wilhelm finished high school and on his eighteenth birthday received as a present from his grandmother the Order of the Garter. After Kassel, he spent four terms at the University of Bonn, studying law and politics. He became a member of the exclusive \"Corps Borussia Bonn\". Wilhelm possessed a quick intelligence, but this was often overshadowed by a cantankerous temper.\nAs a scion of the royal house of Hohenzollern, Wilhelm was exposed from an early age to the military society of the Prussian aristocracy. This had a major impact on him, and in maturity Wilhelm was seldom seen out of uniform. The hyper-masculine military culture of Prussia in this period did much to frame his political ideals and personal relationships.\nWilhelm was in awe of his father, whose status as a hero of the wars of unification was largely responsible for the young Wilhelm's attitude, as were the circumstances in which he was raised; close emotional contact between father and son was not encouraged. Later, as he came into contact with the Crown Prince's political opponents, Wilhelm came to adopt more ambivalent feelings toward his father, perceiving the influence of Wilhelm's mother over a figure who should have been possessed of masculine independence and strength. Wilhelm also idolised his grandfather, Wilhelm I, and he was instrumental in later attempts to foster a cult of the first German Emperor as \"Wilhelm the Great\". However, he had a distant relationship with his mother.\nWilhelm resisted attempts by his parents, especially his mother, to educate him in a spirit of British liberalism. Instead, he agreed with his tutors' support of autocratic rule, and gradually became thoroughly 'Prussianized' under their influence. He thus became alienated from his parents, suspecting them of putting Britain's interests first. The German Emperor, Wilhelm I, watched as his grandson, guided principally by the Crown Princess Victoria, grew to manhood. When Wilhelm was nearing 21, the Emperor decided it was time his grandson should begin the military phase of his preparation for the throne. He was assigned as a lieutenant to the First Regiment of Foot Guards, stationed at Potsdam. \"In the Guards,\" Wilhelm said, \"I really found my family, my friends, my interests\u2014everything of which I had up to that time had to do without.\" As a boy and a student, his manner had been polite and agreeable; as an officer, he began to strut and speak brusquely in the tone he deemed appropriate for a Prussian officer.\nWhen Wilhelm was in his early twenties, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck tried to separate him from his parents, who opposed Bismarck and his policies, with some success. Bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance. Wilhelm thus developed a dysfunctional relationship with his parents, but especially with his English mother. In an outburst in April 1889, Wilhelm angrily implied that \"an English doctor killed my father, and an English doctor crippled my arm\u2014which is the fault of my mother\", who allowed no German physicians to attend to herself or her immediate family.\nAs a young man, Wilhelm fell in love with one of his maternal first cousins, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse-Darmstadt. She turned him down, and in time, married into the Russian imperial family. In 1880 Wilhelm became engaged to Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, known as \"Dona\". The couple married on 27 February 1881, and their marriage lasted 40 years until her death in 1921. Between 1882 and 1892, Augusta bore Wilhelm seven children, six sons and a daughter.\nBeginning in 1884, Bismarck began advocating that Kaiser Wilhelm send his grandson on diplomatic missions, a privilege denied to the Crown Prince. That year, Prince Wilhelm was sent to the court of Tsar Alexander III of Russia in St. Petersburg to attend the coming-of-age ceremony of the 16-year-old Tsarevich Nicholas. Wilhelm's behaviour did little to ingratiate himself to the tsar. Two years later, Kaiser Wilhelm I took Prince Wilhelm on a trip to meet with Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary. In 1886, also, thanks to Herbert von Bismarck, the son of the Chancellor, Prince Wilhelm began to be trained twice a week at the Foreign Ministry.\nAccession.\nKaiser Wilhelm I died in Berlin on 9 March 1888, and Prince Wilhelm's father ascended the throne as Frederick III. He was already experiencing an incurable throat cancer and spent all 99 days of his reign fighting the disease before dying. On 15 June of that same year, his 29-year-old son succeeded him as German Emperor and King of Prussia.\nAlthough in his youth he had been a great admirer of Otto von Bismarck, Wilhelm's characteristic impatience soon brought him into conflict with the \"Iron Chancellor\", the dominant figure in the foundation of his empire. The new Emperor opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy, preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to protect Germany's \"place in the sun\". Furthermore, the young Emperor had come to the throne, unlike his grandfather, determined to rule as well as reign. While the imperial constitution vested executive power in the monarch, Wilhelm I had been content to leave day-to-day administration to Bismarck. Early conflicts between Wilhelm II and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men. Bismarck had believed that Wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated, and he showed escalating disrespect for Wilhelm's favored policy objectives in the late 1880s. The final split between monarch and statesman occurred soon after an attempt by Bismarck to implement far-reaching anti-Socialist laws in early 1890.\nDismissal of Bismarck.\nAccording to adherents of the \"Bismarck myth\", the young Kaiser rejected the Iron Chancellor's allegedly \"peaceful foreign policy\" and instead plotted with senior generals to work \"in favour of a war of aggression\". Bismarck himself once complained to an aide, \"That young man wants war with Russia, and would like to draw his sword straight away if he could. I shall not be a party to it.\"\nBut the origin of Bismarck's dismissal lies in home affairs. After gaining an absolute majority in the Reichstag he formed the \"Kartell\", a coalition government of the German Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party. They favoured making the anti-Socialist laws permanent, with one exception: giving the German police the power, similarly to the Tsarist Okhrana, to expel alleged Socialist agitators from their homes by decree and into internal exile. Even Old Liberal statesman Eugen Richter, the author of the famous 1891 dystopian novel \"Pictures of the Socialistic Future\", opposed banning the Social Democratic Party outright and said: \"I fear Social Democracy more under this law than without it\". The \"Kartell\" split over this issue and the law was not passed.\nAs the debate continued, Wilhelm became more and more interested in the social problems being exploited in the propaganda of the Socialists, especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in 1889. He routinely disagreed with Bismarck during Cabinet meetings. Bismarck, in turn, sharply disagreed with Wilhelm's pro-labor union policies and worked to circumvent them. Bismarck, feeling unappreciated by the young Emperor and by his ambitious advisors, once refused to co-sign a proclamation regarding the protection of industrial workers, as was required by the German Constitution, and prevented it from being made law. While Bismarck had previously sponsored landmark social security legislation, by 1889\u201390, he had become violently opposed to the rise of organized labor. In particular, he was opposed to wage increases, improving working conditions, and regulating labour relations.\nThe final break between the Iron Chancellor and the Kaiser came when Bismarck initiated discussions with the opposition to form a new parliamentary majority without consulting with Wilhelm first. The \"Kartell\", the shifting coalition government that Bismarck had been able to maintain since 1867, had finally lost its majority of seats in the Reichstag due to the Anti-Socialist Laws fiasco. The remaining powers in the Reichstag were the Catholic Centre Party and the Conservative Party.\nIn most parliamentary systems, the head of government depends upon the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to maintain a majority of supporters. In a constitutional monarchy, however, the Chancellor is required to meet regularly with the monarch to explain his or her policies and intentions within the Government. A Chancellor in a constitutional monarchy also cannot afford to make an enemy of the monarch, who represents the only real check and balance against a Chancellor's otherwise absolute power. This is because a constitutional monarch has plenty of means at his or her disposal of quietly blocking a Chancellor's policy objectives and is one of the only people who can forcibly remove an overly ambitious Chancellor from power. For these reasons, the last Kaiser believed that he had every right to be informed \"before\" Bismarck began coalition talks with the Opposition.\nIn a deeply ironic moment, a mere decade after demonizing all members of the Catholic Church in Germany as (, \"traitors to the Empire\") during the \"Kulturkampf\", Bismarck decided to start coalition talks with the all-Catholic Centre Party. He invited that party's leader in the Reichstag, Baron Ludwig von Windthorst, to meet with him and begin the negotiations. The Kaiser, who always had a warm relationship with Baron von Windthorst, whose decades long defence of German Catholics, Poles, Jews, and other minorities against the Iron Chancellor have since attracted comparisons to Irish nationalist statesmen Daniel O'Connell and Charles Stewart Parnell, was furious to hear about Bismarck's plans for coalition talks with the Centre Party only after they had already begun.\nAfter a heated argument at Bismarck's estate over the latter's alleged disrespect for the Imperial Family, Wilhelm stormed out. Bismarck, forced for the first time in his career into a crisis that he could not twist to his own advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying the Monarchy's involvement in both foreign and domestic policy. The letter was published only after Bismarck's death.\nIn later years, Bismarck created the \"Bismarck myth\"; the view (which some historians have argued was confirmed by subsequent events) that Wilhelm II's successful demand for Bismarck's resignation destroyed any chance Imperial Germany ever had of stable government and international peace. According to this view, what Wilhelm termed \"The New Course\" is characterised as Germany's ship of state going dangerously off course, leading directly to the carnage of the First and Second World Wars.\nAccording to Bismarck apologists, in foreign policy the Iron Chancellor had achieved a fragile balance of interests between Germany, France and Russia. Peace was allegedly at hand and Bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against Britain (regarding the German colonial empire) and especially against Russia. With Bismarck's dismissal, the Russians allegedly expected a reversal of policy in Berlin, so they quickly negotiated a military alliance with the Third French Republic, beginning a process that by 1914 largely isolated Germany.\nIn contrast, historian Modris Eksteins has argued that Bismarck's dismissal was actually \"long overdue\". According to Eksteins, the Iron Chancellor, in his need for a scapegoat, had demonized Classical Liberals in the 1860s, Roman Catholics in the 1870s, and Socialists in the 1880s with the highly successful and often repeated refrain, \"The Reich is in danger.\" Therefore, in order to divide and rule, Bismarck ultimately left the German people even more divided in 1890 than they had ever been before 1871.\nIn interviews with C.L. Sulzberger for the book \"The Fall of Eagles\", Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, grandson and heir of Kaiser Wilhelm II, further commented, \"Bismarck was certainly our greatest statesman, but he had very bad manners and he became increasingly overbearing with age. Frankly, I don't think his dismissal by my grandfather was a great tragedy. Russia was already on the other side because of the Berlin Congress of 1878. Had Bismarck stayed he would not have helped. He already wanted to abolish all the reforms that had been introduced. He was aspiring to establish a kind of Shogunate and hoped to treat our family in the same way the Japanese shoguns treated the Japanese emperors isolated in Kyoto. My grandfather had no choice but to dismiss him.\"\nWilhelm in control.\nThe New Course.\nBismarck was succeeded as Chancellor of Germany and Minister-President of Prussia by Leo von Caprivi. At the opening of the Reichstag on 6 May 1890, the Kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer. In 1891, the Reichstag passed the Workers Protection Acts, which improved working conditions, protected women and children and regulated labour relations.\nCaprivi in turn was replaced by Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst in 1894. Following the dismissal of Hohenlohe in 1900, Wilhelm appointed the man whom he regarded as \"his own Bismarck\", Bernhard von B\u00fclow.\nIn appointing Caprivi and then Hohenlohe, Wilhelm was embarking upon what is known to history as \"the New Course\", in which he hoped to exert decisive influence in the government of the empire. There is debate amongst historians as to the precise degree to which Wilhelm succeeded in implementing \"personal rule\" in this era, but what is clear is the very different dynamic which existed between the Crown and its chief political servant (the Chancellor) in the \"Wilhelmine Era\". These chancellors were senior civil servants and not seasoned politician-statesmen like Bismarck. Wilhelm wanted to preclude the emergence of another Iron Chancellor, whom he ultimately detested as being \"a boorish old killjoy\" who had not permitted any minister to see the Emperor except in his presence, keeping a stranglehold on effective political power. Upon his enforced retirement and until his dying day, Bismarck became a bitter critic of Wilhelm's policies, but without gaining the support of a majority within the Reichstag there was little chance of Bismarck exerting a decisive influence on policy.\nIn the early twentieth century, Wilhelm began to concentrate upon his real agenda: the creation of a German Navy that would rival that of Britain and enable Germany to declare itself a world power. The last Kaiser ordered the high command of the armed forces to read United States Navy Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan's book, \"The Influence of Sea Power upon History\", and spent hours drawing sketches of the ships that he dreamed of having built. B\u00fclow and Bethmann Hollweg, his loyal chancellors, looked after domestic affairs, while Wilhelm obliviously began to spread alarm in the chancelleries of Europe with his increasingly eccentric and ill-advised statements on foreign affairs.\nPromoter of arts and sciences.\nWilhelm enthusiastically promoted the arts and sciences, as well as public education and social welfare. He sponsored the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the promotion of scientific research; it was funded by wealthy private donors and by the state and comprised a number of research institutes in both pure and applied sciences. The Prussian Academy of Sciences was unable to avoid the Kaiser's pressure and lost some of its autonomy when it was forced to incorporate new programs in engineering, and award new fellowships in engineering sciences as a result of a gift from the Kaiser in 1900.\nWilhelm supported the modernisers as they tried to reform the Prussian system of secondary education, which was rigidly traditional, elitist, politically authoritarian, and unchanged by the progress in the natural sciences. As hereditary Protector of the Order of Saint John, he offered encouragement to the Christian order's attempts to place German medicine at the forefront of modern medical practice through its system of hospitals, nursing sisterhood and nursing schools, and nursing homes throughout the German Empire. Wilhelm continued as Protector of the Order even after 1918, as the position was in essence attached to the head of the House of Hohenzollern.\nPersonality.\nHistorians have frequently stressed the role of Wilhelm's personality in shaping his reign. Thus, Thomas Nipperdey concludes he was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...gifted, with a quick understanding, sometimes brilliant, with a taste for the modern,\u2014technology, industry, science\u2014but at the same time superficial, hasty, restless, unable to relax, without any deeper level of seriousness, without any desire for hard work or drive to see things through to the end, without any sense of sobriety, for balance and boundaries, or even for reality and real problems, uncontrollable and scarcely capable of learning from experience, desperate for applause and success,\u2014as Bismarck said early on in his life, he wanted every day to be his birthday\u2014romantic, sentimental and theatrical, unsure and arrogant, with an immeasurably exaggerated self-confidence and desire to show off, a juvenile cadet, who never took the tone of the officers' mess out of his voice, and brashly wanted to play the part of the supreme warlord, full of panicky fear of a monotonous life without any diversions, and yet aimless, pathological in his hatred against his English mother.\nHistorian David Fromkin states that Wilhelm had a love\u2013hate relationship with Britain. According to Fromkin,\n\"From the outset, the half-German side of him was at war with the half-English side. He was wildly jealous of the British, desiring to be British and to be better at being British than the British were, while at the same time hating them and resenting them because he never could be fully accepted by them\".\nLanger et al. (1968) emphasise the negative international consequences of Wilhelm's erratic personality:\n\"He believed in force, and the 'survival of the fittest' in domestic as well as foreign politics\u00a0... William was not lacking in intelligence, but he did lack stability, disguising his deep insecurities by swagger and tough talk. He frequently fell into depressions and hysterics\u00a0... William's personal instability was reflected in vacillations of policy. His actions, at home as well as abroad, lacked guidance, and therefore often bewildered or infuriated public opinion. He was not so much concerned with gaining specific objectives, as had been the case with Bismarck, as with asserting his will. This trait in the ruler of the leading Continental power was one of the main causes of the uneasiness prevailing in Europe at the turn-of-the-century\".\nRelationships with foreign relatives.\nAs a grandchild of Queen Victoria, Wilhelm was a first cousin of King George V of the United Kingdom, as well as of queens Marie of Romania, Maud of Norway, Victoria Eugenie of Spain and Empress Alexandra of Russia. In 1889, Wilhelm's younger sister Sophia married Constantine, Crown Prince of Greece. Wilhelm was infuriated by his sister's conversion from Lutheranism to Greek Orthodoxy; upon her marriage, he attempted to ban her from entering Germany.\nWilhelm's most contentious relationships were with his British relations. He craved the acceptance of his grandmother, Queen Victoria, and of the rest of her family. Despite the fact that his grandmother treated him with courtesy and tact, his other relatives largely denied him acceptance. He had an especially bad relationship with his uncle Bertie (later Edward VII). Between 1888 and 1901, Wilhelm resented Bertie, who despite being the heir apparent to the British throne, treated Wilhelm not as a reigning monarch, but merely as another nephew. In turn, Wilhelm often snubbed his uncle, whom he referred to as \"the old peacock\" and lorded his position as emperor over him. Beginning in the 1890s, Wilhelm made visits to England for Cowes Week on the Isle of Wight and often competed against his uncle in the yacht races. Bertie's wife, Alexandra, also disliked Wilhelm. Even though Wilhelm had not been on the throne at the time, Alexandra felt anger over the Prussian seizure of Schleswig-Holstein from her native Denmark in the 1860s, and was also annoyed over Wilhelm's treatment of his mother. Despite his poor relations with his English relatives, when he received news that Queen Victoria was dying at Osborne House in January 1901, Wilhelm travelled to England and was at her bedside when she died, and he remained for the funeral. He also was present at the funeral of King Edward VII in 1910.\nIn 1913, Wilhelm hosted a lavish wedding in Berlin for his only daughter, Victoria Louise. Among the guests at the wedding were his cousins Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and King George V of the United Kingdom, and George's wife, Queen Mary.\nForeign affairs.\nGerman foreign policy under Wilhelm II was faced with a number of significant problems. Perhaps the most apparent was that Wilhelm was an impatient man, subjective in his reactions and affected strongly by sentiment and impulse. He was personally ill-equipped to steer German foreign policy along a rational course. There were a number of examples, such as the Kruger telegram of 1896 in which Wilhelm congratulated President Paul Kruger for preventing the Transvaal Republic from being annexed by the British Empire during the Jameson Raid.\nBritish public opinion had been quite favourable towards the Kaiser in his first twelve years on the throne, but it turned sour in the late 1890s. During the First World War, he became the central target of British anti-German propaganda and the personification of a hated enemy.\nWilhelm exploited fears of a yellow peril trying to interest other European rulers in the perils they faced by invading China; few other leaders paid attention. Wilhelm also used the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War to try to incite fear in the west of the yellow peril that they faced by a resurgent Imperial Japan, which Wilhelm claimed would ally with China to overrun the conventional European Powers. Wilhelm also invested in strengthening the German colonial empire in Africa and the Pacific, but few became profitable and all were lost during the First World War. In South West Africa (now Namibia), a native revolt against German rule led to the Herero and Nama genocide, although Wilhelm eventually ordered it to be stopped and recalled its mastermind General Lothar von Trotha.\nOne of the few times when Wilhelm succeeded in personal diplomacy was when in 1900, he supported the morganatic marriage of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria to Countess Sophie Chotek, and helped negotiate an end to the opposition to the wedding by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.\nA domestic triumph for Wilhelm was when his daughter Victoria Louise married the Duke of Brunswick in 1913; this helped heal the rift between the House of Hanover and the House of Hohenzollern that had followed Bismarck's invasion and annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover in 1866.\nPolitical visits to the Ottoman Empire.\nIn his first visit to Constantinople in 1889, Wilhelm secured the sale of German-made rifles to the Ottoman Army. Later on, he had his second political visit to the Ottoman Empire as a guest of Sultan Abdulhamid II. The Kaiser started his journey to the Ottoman Eyalets with Constantinople on 16 October 1898; then he went by yacht to Haifa on 25 October. After visiting Jerusalem and Bethlehem, the Kaiser went back to Jaffa to embark to Beirut, where he took the train passing Aley and Zahl\u00e9 to reach Damascus on 7 November. While visiting the Mausoleum of Saladin the following day, the Kaiser made a speech:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the face of all the courtesies extended to us here, I feel that I must thank you, in my name as well as that of the Empress, for them, for the hearty reception given us in all the towns and cities we have touched, and particularly for the splendid welcome extended to us by this city of Damascus. Deeply moved by this imposing spectacle, and likewise by the consciousness of standing on the spot where held sway one of the most chivalrous rulers of all times, the great Sultan Saladin, a knight sans peur et sans reproche, who often taught his adversaries the right conception of knighthood, I seize with joy the opportunity to render thanks, above all to the Sultan Abdul Hamid for his hospitality. May the Sultan rest assured, and also the three hundred million Mohammedans scattered over the globe and revering in him their caliph, that the German Emperor will be and remain at all times their friend.\u2014\u200a\nOn 10 November, Wilhelm went to visit Baalbek before heading to Beirut to board his ship back home on 12 November. In his second visit, Wilhelm secured a promise for German companies to construct the Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway, and had the German Fountain constructed in Constantinople to commemorate his journey.\nHis third visit was on 15 October 1917, as the guest of Sultan Mehmed V.\nHun speech of 1900.\nThe Boxer Rebellion, an anti-foreign uprising in China, was put down in 1900 by an international force known as the Eight-Nation Alliance. The Kaiser's farewell address to departing German soldiers commanded them, in the spirit of the Huns, to be merciless in battle. Wilhelm's fiery rhetoric clearly expressed his vision for Germany as one of the great powers. There were two versions of the speech. The German Foreign Office issued an edited version, making sure to omit one particularly incendiary paragraph that they regarded as diplomatically embarrassing. The edited version was this:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Great overseas tasks have fallen to the new German Empire, tasks far greater than many of my countrymen expected. The German Empire has, by its very character, the obligation to assist its citizens if they are being set upon in foreign lands.\u00a0... A great task awaits you [in China]: you are to revenge the grievous injustice that has been done. The Chinese have overturned the law of nations; they have mocked the sacredness of the envoy, the duties of hospitality in a way unheard of in world history. It is all the more outrageous that this crime has been committed by a nation that takes pride in its ancient culture. Show the old Prussian virtue. Present yourselves as Christians in the cheerful endurance of suffering. May honor and glory follow your banners and arms. Give the whole world an example of manliness and discipline.\nYou know full well that you are to fight against a cunning, brave, well-armed, and cruel enemy. When you encounter him, know this: no quarter will be given. Prisoners will not be taken. Exercise your arms such that for a thousand years no Chinese will dare to look cross-eyed at a German. Maintain discipline. May God's blessing be with you, the prayers of an entire nation and my good wishes go with you, each and every one. Open the way to civilization once and for all! Now you may depart! Farewell, comrades!\nThe official version omitted the following passage from which the speech derives its name:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe term \"Hun\" later became the favoured epithet of Allied anti-German war propaganda during the First World War.\nAssassination attempt.\nOn 6 March 1901, during a visit to Bremen, in an apparent assassination attempt Wilhelm was struck in the face by a sharp iron object thrown at him. The assailant, identified as Johann-Dietrich Weiland, was adjudged to be insane. The Kaiser was riding in a coach to the railway station when the incident happened at 10:10 pm, and the object thrown \"afterward proved to be a fishplate\". The German Emperor was left with a deep wound, an inch and a half long, below his left eye; the Chief of the Naval Ministry would note later, \"On the temple or in the eye the blow could have been devastating. The wonder of it is that our All-Gracious Lord felt neither the object flying at him nor, in the rain, the copiously flowing blood; it was those around him who drew his attention to it at first.\" Despite rumors in the press that the Kaiser had sunk into a depression, he would say in a speech at the end of the month, \"nothing is more false than to pretend that my sanity has suffered in some way. I am exactly the same as I was; I have become neither elegiac nor melancholic... everything stays the same.\"\nEulenberg Scandal.\nIn the years 1906\u20131909, Socialist journalist Maximilian Harden published accusations of homosexual activity involving ministers, courtiers, army officers, and Wilhelm's closest friend and advisor, Prince Philipp zu Eulenberg. According to Robert K. Massie:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Homosexuality was officially repressed in Germany.\u00a0... It was a criminal offense, punishable by prison, although the law was rarely invoked or enforced. Still, the very accusation could stir moral outrage and bring social ruin. This was especially true at the highest levels of Society.\nThe result was years of highly publicized scandals, trials, resignations, and suicides. Harden, like some in the upper echelons of the military and Foreign Office, resented Eulenberg's approval of the Anglo-French Entente, and also his encouragement of Wilhelm to rule personally. The scandal led to Wilhelm experiencing a nervous breakdown, and the removal of Eulenberg and others of his circle from the court. The view that Wilhelm was a deeply repressed homosexual is increasingly supported by scholars: certainly, he never came to terms with his feelings for Eulenberg. Historians have linked the Eulenberg scandal to a fundamental shift in German policy that heightened its military aggressiveness and ultimately contributed to World War I.\nMoroccan Crisis.\nOne of Wilhelm's diplomatic blunders sparked the Moroccan Crisis of 1905. He made a spectacular visit to Tangier, in Morocco on 31 March 1905. He conferred with representatives of Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco. The Kaiser proceeded to tour the city on the back of a white horse. The Kaiser declared he had come to support the sovereignty of the Sultan\u2014a statement which amounted to a provocative challenge to French influence in Morocco. The Sultan subsequently rejected a set of French-proposed governmental reforms and invited major world powers to a conference that advised him on necessary reforms.\nThe Kaiser's presence was seen as an assertion of German interests in Morocco, in opposition to those of France. In his speech, he even made remarks in favour of Moroccan independence, and this led to friction with France, which was expanding its colonial interests in Morocco, and to the Algeciras Conference, which served largely to further isolate Germany in Europe.\n\"Daily Telegraph\" Affair.\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" Affair of 1908 involved the publication in Germany of an article from the British newspaper that included a series of wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks. Wilhelm had viewed the article, which was based on discussions he had had with Colonel Edward Stuart-Wortley in 1907, as an opportunity to promote his views on Anglo-German friendship, but due to the content and emotional tone of many of his statements, he ended up further alienating not only the British but also the French, Russians and Japanese. He was quoted as saying that he was among the minority of Germans friendly to Britain; that during the Second Boer War, he had rebuffed the French and Russians when they asked Germany to help them \"not only to save the Boer Republics, but also to humiliate England to the dust\"\"\"; and that the German naval buildup was targeted against the Japanese, not Britain. One especially memorable quotation from the article was, \"You English are mad, mad, mad as March hares\" because they refused to see his friendly intentions. The effect in Germany was quite significant, with serious calls to modify the constitution to limit the emperor's powers. The \"Daily Telegraph\" crisis deeply wounded Wilhelm's previously unimpaired self-confidence, and he experienced a severe bout of depression. He kept a low profile for many months after the scandal broke, although in July 1909 he took the opportunity to force the resignation of the chancellor, Prince von B\u00fclow, whose defence of him in the Reichstag had been aimed primarily at shifting blame from himself for not stopping the publication of the article. As a result of the scandal, Wilhelm had less influence in domestic and foreign policy for the remainder of his reign than he had previously exercised.\nNaval arms race with Britain.\nNothing Wilhelm did in the international arena was of more influence than his decision to pursue a policy of massive naval construction. A powerful navy was Wilhelm's pet project. He had inherited from his mother a love of the British Royal Navy, which was at that time the world's largest. He once confided to his uncle, the Prince of Wales, that his dream was to have a \"fleet of my own some day\". Wilhelm's frustration over his fleet's poor showing at the Fleet Review at his grandmother's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, combined with his inability to exert German influence in South Africa following the dispatch of the Kruger telegram, led to Wilhelm taking definitive steps toward the construction of a fleet to rival that of his British cousins. Wilhelm called on the services of the dynamic naval officer Alfred von Tirpitz, whom he appointed to the head of the Imperial Naval Office in 1897.\nThe new admiral had conceived of what came to be known as the \"Risk Theory\" or the Tirpitz Plan, by which Germany could force Britain to accede to German demands in the international arena through the threat posed by a powerful battlefleet concentrated in the North Sea. Tirpitz enjoyed Wilhelm's full support in his advocacy of successive naval bills of 1897 and 1900, by which the German navy was built up to contend with that of the British Empire. Naval expansion under the Fleet Acts eventually led to severe financial strains in Germany by 1914, as by 1906 Wilhelm had committed his navy to construction of the much larger, more expensive dreadnought type of battleship. The British depended on naval superiority and its response was to make Germany its most feared enemy.\nIn addition to the expansion of the fleet, the Kiel Canal was opened in 1895, enabling faster movements between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. In 1889 Wilhelm reorganised top-level control of the navy by creating a Naval Cabinet () equivalent to the German Imperial Military Cabinet which had previously functioned in the same capacity for both the army and navy. The Head of the Naval Cabinet was responsible for promotions, appointments, administration, and issuing orders to naval forces. Captain Gustav von Senden-Bibran was appointed as the first head and remained so until 1906. The existing Imperial admiralty was abolished, and its responsibilities divided between two organisations. A new position was created, equivalent to the supreme commander of the army: the Chief of the High Command of the Admiralty, or , was responsible for ship deployments, strategy and tactics. Vice-Admiral Max von der Goltz was appointed in 1889 and remained in post until 1895. Construction and maintenance of ships and obtaining supplies was the responsibility of the State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office (Reichsmarineamt), responsible to the Imperial Chancellor and advising the on naval matters. The first appointee was Rear Admiral Karl Eduard Heusner, followed shortly by Rear Admiral Friedrich von Hollmann from 1890 to 1897. Each of these three heads of department reported separately to Wilhelm.\nWorld War I.\nHistorians typically argue that Wilhelm was largely confined to ceremonial duties during the war\u2014there were innumerable parades to review and honours to award. \"The man who in peace had believed himself omnipotent became in war a 'shadow Kaiser', out of sight, neglected, and relegated to the sidelines.\"\nThe Sarajevo crisis.\nWilhelm was a friend of Franz Ferdinand, and he was deeply shocked by his assassination on 28 June 1914. Wilhelm offered to support Austria-Hungary in crushing the Black Hand, the secret organisation that had plotted the killing, and even sanctioned the use of force by Austria against the perceived source of the movement\u2014Serbia (this is often called \"the blank cheque\"). He wanted to remain in Berlin until the crisis was resolved, but his courtiers persuaded him instead to go on his annual cruise of the North Sea on 6 July 1914. Wilhelm made erratic attempts to stay on top of the crisis via telegram, and when the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum was delivered to Serbia, he hurried back to Berlin. He reached Berlin on 28 July, read a copy of the Serbian reply, and wrote on it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A brilliant solution\u2014and in barely 48 hours! This is more than could have been expected. A great moral victory for Vienna; but with it every pretext for war falls to the ground, and [the Ambassador] Giesl had better have stayed quietly at Belgrade. On this document, I should never have given orders for mobilisation.\nUnknown to the Emperor, Austro-Hungarian ministers and generals had already convinced the 83-year-old Franz Joseph I to sign a declaration of war against Serbia. As a direct consequence, Russia began a general mobilisation to attack Austria in defence of Serbia.\nJuly 1914.\nOn the night of 30 July 1914, when handed a document stating that Russia would not cancel its mobilisation, Wilhelm wrote a lengthy commentary containing these observations:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For I no longer have any doubt that England, Russia and France have agreed among themselves\u2014knowing that our treaty obligations compel us to support Austria\u2014to use the Austro-Serb conflict as a pretext for waging a war of annihilation against us ... Our dilemma over keeping faith with the old and honourable Emperor has been exploited to create a situation which gives England the excuse she has been seeking to annihilate us with a spurious appearance of justice on the pretext that she is helping France and maintaining the well-known Balance of Power in Europe, i.e., playing off all European States for her own benefit against us.\nMore recent British authors state that Wilhelm II really declared, \"Ruthlessness and weakness will start the most terrifying war of the world, whose purpose is to destroy Germany. Because there can no longer be any doubts, England, France and Russia have conspired themselves together to fight an annihilation war against us\".\nWhen it became clear that Germany would experience a war on two fronts and that Britain would enter the war if Germany attacked France through neutral Belgium, the panic-stricken Wilhelm attempted to redirect the main attack against Russia. When Helmuth von Moltke (the younger) (who had chosen the old plan from 1905, made by General von Schlieffen for the possibility of German war on two fronts) told him that this was impossible, Wilhelm said: \"Your uncle would have given me a different answer!\" Wilhelm is also reported to have said, \"To think that George and Nicky should have played me false! If my grandmother had been alive, she would never have allowed it.\" In the original Schlieffen Plan, Germany would attack the (supposed) weaker enemy first, meaning France. The plan supposed that it would take a long time before Russia was ready for war. Defeating France had been easy for Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. At the 1914 border between France and Germany, an attack at this more southern part of France could be stopped by the French fortress along the border. However, Wilhelm II stopped any invasion of the Netherlands.\nEarly War.\nOn 1 August 1914 (Saturday), Wilhelm II made a war speech in front of a great crowd. On Monday, he motored back to Berlin from Potsdam and issued an imperial order to convene the Reichstag the next day.\nOn 19 August 1914, Wilhelm II predicted that Germany would win the war. He said, \"I am firmly confident that, with the help of God, the bravery of the German Army and Navy and the unquenchable unanimity of the German people during those hours of danger, victory will crown our cause.\"\nShadow-Kaiser.\nWilhelm's role in wartime was one of ever-decreasing power as he increasingly handled awards ceremonies and honorific duties. The high command continued with its strategy even when it was clear that the Schlieffen plan had failed. By 1916, the Empire had effectively become a military dictatorship under the control of Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff. Increasingly cut off from reality and the political decision-making process, Wilhelm vacillated between defeatism and dreams of victory, depending upon the fortunes of his armies. Nevertheless, Wilhelm still retained the ultimate authority in matters of political appointment, and it was only after his consent had been gained that major changes to the high command could be brought about. Wilhelm was in favour of the dismissal of Colonel General Helmuth von Moltke in September 1914 and his replacement by General Erich von Falkenhayn. In 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided that Bethman-Hollweg was no longer acceptable to them as Chancellor and called upon the Kaiser to appoint somebody else. When asked whom they would accept, Ludendorff recommended Georg Michaelis, a nonentity whom he barely knew. Despite this, the Kaiser accepted the suggestion. Upon hearing in July 1917 that his cousin George V had changed the name of the British royal house to Windsor, Wilhelm remarked that he planned to see Shakespeare's play \"The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\". The Kaiser's support base collapsed completely in October\u2013November 1918 in the military, the civilian government, and in German public opinion, as President Woodrow Wilson made it very clear that the monarchy must be overthrown before an end of the war could take place. That year also saw Wilhelm sickened during the worldwide Spanish flu outbreak, though he survived.\nAbdication and exile.\nWilhelm was at the Imperial Army headquarters in Spa, Belgium, when the uprisings in Berlin and other centres took him by surprise in late 1918. Mutiny among the ranks of his beloved Kaiserliche Marine, the imperial navy, profoundly shocked him. After the outbreak of the German Revolution, Wilhelm could not make up his mind whether to abdicate. Up to that point, he accepted that he would likely have to give up the imperial crown, but still hoped to retain the Prussian kingship. He believed that as ruler of two-thirds of Germany, he would still be a key player in any new system. However, this was impossible under the imperial constitution. Wilhelm thought he ruled as emperor in a personal union with Prussia. In truth, the constitution defined the empire as a confederation of states under the permanent presidency of Prussia. The imperial crown was thus tied to the Prussian crown, meaning that Wilhelm could not renounce one crown without renouncing the other.\nWilhelm's hope of retaining at least one of his crowns was revealed as unrealistic when, in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest, Chancellor Prince Max of Baden announced Wilhelm's abdication of both titles on 9 November 1918. Prince Max himself was forced to resign later the same day, when it became clear that only Friedrich Ebert, leader of the SPD, could effectively exert control. Later that day, one of Ebert's secretaries of state (ministers), Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann, proclaimed Germany a republic.\nWilhelm accepted this \"fait accompli\" only after Ludendorff's replacement, General Wilhelm Groener, had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under Hindenburg's command, but would certainly not fight for Wilhelm's throne. The monarchy's last and strongest support had been broken, and finally even Hindenburg, himself a lifelong monarchist, was obliged, after polling his generals, to advise the Emperor to give up the crown. On 10 November, Wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the neutral Netherlands. Upon the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles in early 1919, Article 227 expressly provided for the prosecution of Wilhelm \"for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties\", but the Dutch government refused to extradite him. King George V wrote that he looked on his cousin as \"the greatest criminal in history\" but opposed Prime Minister David Lloyd George's proposal to \"hang the Kaiser\". There was little zeal in Britain to prosecute. On 1 January 1920, it was stated in official circles in London that Great Britain would \"welcome refusal by Holland to deliver the former kaiser for trial,\" and it was hinted that this had been conveyed to the Dutch government through diplomatic channels:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Punishment of the former kaiser and other German war criminals is worrying Great Britain little, it was said. As a matter of form, however, the British and French governments were expected to request Holland for the former kaiser's extradition. Holland, it was said, will refuse on the ground of constitutional provisions covering the case and then the matter will be dropped. The request for extradition will not be based on genuine desire on the part of British officials to bring the kaiser to trial, according to authoritative information, but is considered necessary formality to 'save the face' of politicians who promised to see that Wilhelm was punished for his crimes.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson of the United States opposed extradition, arguing that prosecuting Wilhelm would destabilise international order and lose the peace.\nWilhelm first settled in Amerongen, where on 28 November he issued a belated statement of abdication from both the Prussian and imperial thrones, thus formally ending the Hohenzollerns' 500-year rule over Prussia and its predecessor state, Brandenburg. Finally accepting the reality that he had lost both of his crowns for good, he gave up his rights to \"the throne of Prussia and to the German Imperial throne connected therewith\". He also released his soldiers and officials in both Prussia and the empire from their oath of loyalty to him. He purchased a country house in the municipality of Doorn, known as Huis Doorn, and moved in on 15 May 1920. This was to be his home for the remainder of his life. The Weimar Republic allowed Wilhelm to remove twenty-three railway wagons of furniture, twenty-seven containing packages of all sorts, one bearing a car and another a boat, from the New Palace at Potsdam.\nLife in exile.\nIn 1922, Wilhelm published the first volume of his memoirs\u2014a very slim volume that insisted he was not guilty of initiating the Great War, and defended his conduct throughout his reign, especially in matters of foreign policy. For the remaining twenty years of his life, he entertained guests (often of some standing) and kept himself updated on events in Europe. He grew a beard and allowed his famous moustache to droop, adopting a style very similar to that of his cousins King George V and Tsar Nicholas II. He also learned the Dutch language. Wilhelm had developed a penchant for archaeology while residing at the Corfu Achilleion, excavating at the site of the Temple of Artemis in Corfu, a passion he retained in his exile. He had bought the former Greek residence of Empress Elisabeth after her murder in 1898. He also sketched plans for grand buildings and battleships when he was bored. In exile, one of Wilhelm's greatest passions was hunting, and he killed thousands of animals, both beast and bird. Much of his time was spent chopping wood and thousands of trees were chopped down during his stay at Doorn.\nWealth.\nWilhelm II was seen as the richest man in Germany before 1914. After his abdication he retained substantial wealth. It was reported that at least 60 railway wagons were needed to carry his furniture, art, porcelain and silver from Germany to the Netherlands. The Kaiser retained substantial cash reserves as well as several palaces. After 1945, the Hohenzollerns' forests, farms, factories and palaces in what became East Germany were expropriated and thousands of artworks were subsumed into state-owned museums.\nViews on Nazism.\nIn the early 1930s, Wilhelm apparently hoped that the successes of the Nazi Party would stimulate interest in a restoration of the House of Hohenzollern, with his eldest grandson as the new Kaiser. His second wife, Hermine, actively petitioned the Nazi government on her husband's behalf. However, Adolf Hitler, despite being a veteran of the Imperial German Army during the First World War, felt nothing but contempt for the man he blamed for Germany's greatest defeat, and the petitions were ignored. Though he played host to Hermann G\u00f6ring at Doorn on at least one occasion, Wilhelm learned to distrust Hitler. Hearing of the murder of the wife of former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher during the Night of the Long Knives, Wilhelm said, \"We have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!\"\nWilhelm was also appalled at the Kristallnacht of 9\u201310 November 1938, saying \"I have just made my views clear to Auwi [August Wilhelm, Wilhelm's fourth son] in the presence of his brothers. He had the nerve to say that he agreed with the Jewish pogroms and understood why they had come about. When I told him that any decent man would describe these actions as gangsterisms, he appeared totally indifferent. He is completely lost to our family\". Wilhelm also stated, \"For the first time, I am ashamed to be a German\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There's a man alone, without family, without children, without God\u00a0[...] He builds legions, but he doesn't build a nation. A nation is created by families, a religion, traditions: it is made up out of the hearts of mothers, the wisdom of fathers, the joy and the exuberance of children\u00a0[...] For a few months I was inclined to believe in National Socialism. I thought of it as a necessary fever. And I was gratified to see that there were, associated with it for a time, some of the wisest and most outstanding Germans. But these, one by one, he has got rid of, or even killed\u00a0... Papen, Schleicher, Neurath \u2013 and even Blomberg. He has left nothing but a bunch of shirted gangsters! [...] This man could bring home victories to our people each year, without bringing them either glory or (danger). But of our Germany, which was a nation of poets and musicians, of artists and soldiers, he has made a nation of hysterics and hermits, engulfed in a mob and led by a thousand liars or fanatics.\u2014\u200a\nIn the wake of the German victory over Poland in September 1939, Wilhelm's adjutant, Wilhelm von Dommes, wrote on his behalf to Hitler, stating that the House of Hohenzollern \"remained loyal\" and noted that nine Prussian Princes (one son and eight grandchildren) were stationed at the front, concluding \"because of the special circumstances that require residence in a neutral foreign country, His Majesty must personally decline to make the aforementioned comment. The Emperor has therefore charged me with making a communication.\" Wilhelm greatly admired the success which the Wehrmacht was able to achieve in the opening months of the Second World War, and personally sent Hitler a congratulatory telegram when the Netherlands surrendered in May 1940: \"My F\u00fchrer, I congratulate you and hope that under your marvellous leadership the German monarchy will be restored completely.\" Unimpressed, Hitler commented to Heinz Linge, his valet, \"What an idiot!\"\nUpon the fall of Paris a month later, Wilhelm sent another telegram: \"Under the deeply moving impression of France's capitulation I congratulate you and all the German armed forces on the God-given prodigious victory with the words of Kaiser Wilhelm the Great of the year 1870: 'What a turn of events through God's dispensation!' All German hearts are filled with the chorale of Leuthen, which the victors of Leuthen, the soldiers of the Great King sang: 'Now thank we all our God!'\" In a letter to his daughter Victoria Louise, Duchess of Brunswick, he wrote triumphantly, \"Thus is the pernicious \"Entente Cordiale\" of Uncle Edward VII brought to nought.\" In a September 1940 letter to an American journalist, Wilhelm praised Germany's rapid early conquests as \"a succession of miracles\", but remarked also that \"the brilliant leading Generals in this war came from \"My\" school, they fought under my command in the World War as lieutenants, captains and young majors. Educated by Schlieffen they put the plans he had worked out under me into practice along the same lines as we did in 1914.\"\nAfter the German conquest of the Netherlands in 1940, the aging Wilhelm retired completely from public life. In May 1940, Wilhelm declined an offer from Winston Churchill of asylum in Great Britain, preferring to die at Huis Doorn.\nAnti-English, antisemitic, and anti-Freemason views.\nDuring his last year at Doorn, Wilhelm believed that Germany was still the land of monarchy and Christianity, while England was the land of classical liberalism and therefore of Satan and the Antichrist. He argued that the English nobility were \"Freemasons thoroughly infected by Juda\". Wilhelm asserted that the \"British people must be \"liberated\" from \"Antichrist Juda\". We must drive Juda out of England just as he has been chased out of the Continent.\"\nHe also believed a conspiracy theory that Anglo-American Freemasonry and the Jews had caused both world wars, and were aiming for a world empire financed by British and American gold, but that \"Juda's plan has been smashed to pieces and they themselves swept out of the European Continent!\" Continental Europe was now, Wilhelm wrote, \"consolidating and closing itself off from British influences after the elimination of the British and the Jews!\" The result would be a \"U.S. of Europe!\" In a 1940 letter to his sister Princess Margaret, Wilhelm wrote: \"The hand of God is creating a new world &amp; working \u00a0... We are becoming the U.S. of Europe under German leadership, a united European Continent.\" He added: \"The Jews [are] being thrust out of their nefarious positions in all countries, whom they have driven to hostility for centuries.\"\nAlso, in 1940 came what would have been his mother's 100th birthday. Despite their very troubled relationship, Wilhelm wrote to a friend, \"Today the 100th birthday of my mother! No notice is taken of it at home! No 'Memorial Service' or\u00a0... committee to remember her marvellous work for the\u00a0... welfare of our German people\u00a0... Nobody of the new generation knows anything about her.\"\nDeath.\nWilhelm died of a pulmonary embolism in Doorn, Netherlands, on 4 June 1941, at the age of 82, just weeks before the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. Despite his personal resentment and animosity toward the monarchy, Hitler wanted to bring the Kaiser's body back to Berlin for a state funeral, as Hitler felt that such a funeral, with himself acting in the role of heir apparent to the throne, would be useful to exploit for propaganda. However, Wilhelm's orders that his body was not to return to Germany unless the monarchy was first restored were then revealed and were grudgingly respected. The Nazi occupation authorities arranged for a small military funeral, with a few hundred people present. The mourners included Field Marshal August von Mackensen, fully dressed in his old Imperial Hussars uniform, former World War I Office of Naval Intelligence field agent Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, Colonel General Curt Haase, World War I flying ace turned \"Wehrmachtbefehlshaber\" for the Netherlands General Friedrich Christiansen, and \"Reichskommissar\" for the Netherlands Arthur Seyss-Inquart, along with a few other military advisers. However, Kaiser Wilhelm's insistence that the swastika and Nazi Party regalia not be displayed at his funeral was ignored, as is seen in the photographs of the funeral taken by a Dutch photographer.\nWilhelm was buried in a mausoleum upon the grounds of Huis Doorn, which has since become a place of pilgrimage for German monarchists, who gather there every year on the anniversary of his death to pay their homage to the last German Emperor.\nHistoriography.\nThree trends have characterised the writing about Wilhelm. First, the court-inspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero, often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the Kaiser's own memoirs. Second, there came those who judged Wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position, a ruler too reckless to deal with power. Third, after 1950, later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early 20th century and attempted an objective portrayal of Wilhelm and his rule.\nOn 8 June 1913, a year before the First World War began, \"The New York Times\" published a special supplement devoted to the 25th anniversary of the Kaiser's accession. The banner headline read: \"Kaiser, 25 Years a Ruler, Hailed as Chief Peacemaker\". The accompanying story called him \"the greatest factor for peace that our time can show\", and credited Wilhelm with frequently rescuing Europe from the brink of war. Until the late 1950s, Germany under the last Kaiser was depicted by most historians as an almost absolute monarchy. Partly, however, this was a deliberate deception by German civil servants and elected officials. For example, former President Theodore Roosevelt believed the Kaiser was in control of German foreign policy because Hermann Speck von Sternburg, the German ambassador in Washington and a personal friend of Roosevelt, presented to the President messages from Chancellor von B\u00fclow as though they were messages from the Kaiser. Later historians downplayed his role, arguing that senior officials regularly learned to work around the Kaiser's back. More recently, historian John C. G. R\u00f6hl has portrayed Wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of Imperial Germany. Thus, the argument is still made that the Kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of both naval and colonialist expansion that caused the deterioration of Germany's relations with Britain before 1914.\nMarriages and issue.\nWilhelm and his first wife, Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, were married on 27 February 1881. They had seven children:\nEmpress Augusta, known affectionately as \"Dona\", was a constant companion to Wilhelm, and her death from a heart attack on 11 April 1921 was a devastating blow. It also came less than a year after their son Joachim committed suicide.\nRemarriage.\nThe following January, Wilhelm received a birthday greeting from a son of the late Prince Johann George Ludwig Ferdinand August Wilhelm of Sch\u00f6naich-Carolath. The 63-year-old Wilhelm invited the boy and his mother, Princess Hermine Reuss of Greiz, to Doorn. Wilhelm found 35-year-old Hermine very attractive, and greatly enjoyed her company. The couple were wed in Doorn on 5 November 1922 despite the objections of Wilhelm's monarchist supporters and his children. Hermine's daughter, Princess Henriette, married the late Prince Joachim's son, Karl Franz Josef, in 1940, but divorced in 1946. Hermine remained a constant companion to the aging former emperor until his death.\nReligion.\nOwn views.\nIn accordance with his role as the King of Prussia, Emperor Wilhelm II was a Lutheran member of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces. It was a United Protestant denomination, bringing together Reformed and Lutheran believers.\nAttitude towards Islam.\nWilhelm II was on friendly terms with the Muslim world. He described himself as a \"friend\" to \"300 million Mohammedans\". Following his trip to Constantinople (which he visited three times\u2014an unbeaten record for any European monarch) in 1898, Wilhelm II wrote to Nicholas II that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If I had come there without any religion at all, I certainly would have turned Mohammedan!\nIn response to the political competition between the Christian sects to build bigger and grander churches and monuments which made the sects appear idolatrous and turned Muslims away from the Christian message.\nAntisemitism.\nWilhelm's biographer Lamar Cecil identified Wilhelm's \"curious but well-developed anti-Semitism\", noting that in 1888 a friend of Wilhelm \"declared that the young Kaiser's dislike of his Hebrew subjects, one rooted in a perception that they possessed an overweening influence in Germany, was so strong that it could not be overcome\".\nCecil concludes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wilhelm never changed, and throughout his life he believed that Jews were perversely responsible, largely through their prominence in the Berlin press and in leftist political movements, for encouraging opposition to his rule. For individual Jews, ranging from rich businessmen and major art collectors to purveyors of elegant goods in Berlin stores, he had considerable esteem, but he prevented Jewish citizens from having careers in the army and the diplomatic corps and frequently used abusive language against them.\nAt the height of German military intervention against the Red Army during the Russian Civil War in 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm also suggested a similar campaign against the \"Jew-Bolsheviks\" who were slaughtering the Baltic German nobility in the Baltic states, citing the example of what Turks had done to the Ottoman Armenians just a few years earlier.\nOn 2 December 1919, Wilhelm wrote to Mackensen, denouncing the November Revolution of 1918 and his own forced abdication as the \"deepest, most disgusting shame ever perpetrated by a person in history, the Germans have done to themselves\u00a0... egged on and misled by the tribe of Judah\u00a0... Let no German ever forget this, nor rest until these parasites have been destroyed and exterminated from German soil!\" Wilhelm advocated a \"regular international all-worlds pogrom \u00e0 la Russe\" as \"the best cure\" and further believed that Jews were a \"nuisance that humanity must get rid of some way or other. I believe the best thing would be gas!\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

He is best known as a member of The Goodies and a regular panellist on \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\".\nEarly life and education.\nGarden was born on 18 February 1943 in Aberdeen, Scotland, and raised in Preston, Lancashire, England, only son (with a daughter) of Robert Symon Garden (1910\u20131982), an eminent orthopaedic surgeon who created the Garden classification of hip fractures, and his wife Janet Ann (n\u00e9e McHardy). R. S. Garden's parents, John and Elizabeth, farmed at Macduff, Banff and Buchan, Aberdeenshire. Garden was educated at Repton School, and studied medicine at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he joined the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club and served as its president in 1964, while also performing in the 1964 Footlights revue, \"Stuff What Dreams Are Made Of\" at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\nGarden qualified in medicine but has never practised. Asked how he justified making jokes rather than saving lives, he answered:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I don't think I would have done it as well. It's an interesting question \u2013 whether you've contributed more to the vast store of human enjoyment by doing comedy or by being a doctor, but the answer for me is that I don't think I would have been as successful or as happy being a doctor.\nCareer.\nRadio.\nGarden was co-writer and performer in the BBC radio comedy sketch show \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\" in the late 1960s. Garden was studying medicine during the first few series of the show, this commitment making cast membership difficult for him during the third series as he was following a midwifery course in Plymouth. However, he continued sending in scripts for the radio show by mail, and he rejoined the cast upon his return to his medical studies in London. On several occasions, his medical qualifications are lampooned in the show; in the 25th Anniversary Show, David Hatch asks him if he is still a writer. Garden: \"Here's something I wrote this morning\". Hatch: \"It's a prescription\". \"Yes,\" says Garden, \"but it's a funny one...\"\nGarden was a permanent panellist on the long-running BBC Radio improvisation show \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\", in a cast which included Tim Brooke-Taylor, for almost fifty years. He also starred in and co-wrote, with Barry Cryer, \"You'll Have Had Your Tea\", a direct spin-off of ISIHAC, and has contributed to several books from the series including guides to the game Mornington Crescent.\nGarden wrote for and appeared with Barry Cryer and Alison Steadman in the 1989 BBC radio comedy sketch show \"The Long Hot Satsuma\". Garden had a role in Paul B. Davies' 2000 radio play \"Spy Nozy and the Poets\". In 2001 and 2002, Garden wrote for and appeared in the BBC radio comedy sketch show \"The Right Time\", along with Eleanor Bron, Paula Wilcox, Clive Swift, Roger Blake and Neil Innes. He was also script editor for \"The Hudson and Pepperdine Show\".\nGarden is chair of the spoof radio game show \"Beat the Kids\". He has also appeared on the UK version of the improvisation television series \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\", which has a similar format. He was a co-writer of the BBC Radio 4 comedy \"Giles Wemmbley-Hogg Goes Off\", and in 2006, Garden co-devised and appeared on the BBC Radio 4 comedy quiz show \"The Unbelievable Truth\". He also appeared in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series One, created by David Quantick.\nIn 2003, Garden wrote the Radio 4 sitcom \"About a Dog\", based on an original idea by Debbie Barham, with a second series in 2007.\nGarden has appeared in several of Big Finish's \"Doctor Who\" audio dramas. In \"Bang-Bang-a-Boom!\" he plays Professor Fassbinder, a parody of Victor Bergman in \"\". In \"Max Warp\" he plays TV presenter Geoffrey Vantage, parodying \"Top Gear\" presenter Jeremy Clarkson. He also plays Abbot Thelonious (an alias of the Meddling Monk) in the Eighth Doctor audio play \"The Book of Kells\" in 2010, and subsequently returns as a recurring antagonist to the Eighth Doctor as the Monk (a role previously played on television by Peter Butterworth).\nTelevision.\nGarden's best known television work is freeform sitcom \"The Goodies\", which he wrote and performed along with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Bill Oddie from 1970 to 1982. The three appeared in the Amnesty International show \"A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)\" (during which they sang their hit song \"Funky Gibbon\"). Garden and Bill Oddie co-wrote many episodes of the television sitcom \"Doctor in the House\", including most of the first series episodes, and all of the second series episodes - as well as co-writing episodes of the subsequent \"Doctor at Large\" and \"Doctor in Charge\" series. Garden was co-writer and performer in the sketch show \"Twice a Fortnight\" with Bill Oddie, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Jonathan Lynn, and also sketch show \"Broaden Your Mind\" with Tim Brooke-Taylor, with Bill Oddie joining the cast for the second series.\nIn 1982 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a six-part science fiction sitcom called \"Astronauts\" for Central which was shown on ITV. The show was set in an international space station in the near future.\nGarden was the voice of the title character in \"Bananaman\" (1983), in addition to General Blight and Maurice of the Heavy Mob in the children's animated television comedy series, which also featured the rest of the Goodies team. The series parodied comic book super-heroes. Later, Garden wrote for the sitcom \"Surgical Spirit\" (1994). Graeme Garden has also presented three series of the BBC's health magazine \"Bodymatters\".\nGarden appeared in the political sitcom \"Yes Minister\", in the role of Commander Forrest of the Special Branch in the episode \"The Death List\". He also appeared as a television presenter in the \"Doctor in the House\" episode \"Doctor on the Box\".\nHe was a regular team captain on the political satire game show \"If I Ruled the World\". Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode and during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time \"The Goodies\" episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to refute this statement, and replied, \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\"\nIn 2004, Garden and Brooke-Taylor were co-presenters of Channel 4's daytime game show \"Beat the Nation\", in which they indulged in usual game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. It was notable for its use of a \"laugh track\" instead of a studio audience. Garden has hosted the quiz game \"Tell the Truth\" and presented a series of history programmes, \"A Sense of the Past\" for Yorkshire Television.\nGarden writes and directs for the corporate video company Video Arts, famous for its training films starring John Cleese.\nStage appearances.\nGarden has a successful stage career, and has acted in several National Theatre productions, as well as London's West End. He has also acted in several BBC Radio 4 comedy drama series, and television drama including \"Peak Practice\" and \"Holby City\". Garden appeared with Tim Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production \"The Unvarnished Truth\".\nHe wrote several pantomimes for The Theatre Chipping Norton during the 1980s. \nIn 1986 he appeared in a production of \"An Inspector Calls\" by J B Priestley at the Royal Exchange, Manchester.\nGarden wrote a play called \"The Pocket Orchestra\" which ran in London in 2006. In August 2006, Garden and Brooke-Taylor joined up to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe in a show which looked back with some nostalgia to their work with the Goodies and in light entertainment.\nPersonal life.\nGarden lives in Oxfordshire with his wife Emma, with whom he has a son, Tom. Garden also has a daughter, Sally, and a son, John, from his previous marriage to Mary Elizabeth Wheatley Grice. His son John \"JJ\" Garden is the occasional keyboardist for the music group Scissor Sisters, and shares songwriting credit on the song \"The Other Side\" from their 2006 album \"Ta-Dah\".\nIn 2002, Garden suffered an episode of the condition known as Bell's palsy, where the muscles on one side of the face become paralysed. He was able to continue his work commitments and eventually made a full recovery after some months.\nGarden was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to light entertainment alongside his late comedy partner Tim Brooke-Taylor.\nGarden is a patron of the disability charity ENRYCH \u2013 formerly Ryder-Cheshire Volunteers. The charity works to enable adults with a physical disability to enjoy culture, leisure, learning and sporting opportunities through partnership with a volunteer.\nBibliography.\nAn incomplete list includes:\nCo-written with the other members of The Goodies:\nPoetry:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "50455", "revid": "39707640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50455", "title": "The Song Remains the Same (film)", "text": "1976 Led Zeppelin concert film\nThe Song Remains the Same is a 1976 concert film featuring the English rock band Led Zeppelin. The filming took place during the summer of 1973, during three nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City, with additional footage shot at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. The film premiered three years later on 20 October 1976 at Cinema I in New York, on 21 October 1976 at the Fox Wilshire Theater in Beverly Hills, and at Warner West End Cinema in London two weeks later. It was accompanied by a soundtrack album of the same name.\nPromotional materials stated that the film was \"the band's special way of giving their millions of friends what they had been clamouring for\u00a0\u2013 a personal and private tour of Led Zeppelin. For the first time the world has a front row seat on Led Zeppelin.\"\nFans drove up ticket sales, but many reviewers \u2013 as well as band members Robert Plant and John Paul Jones \u2013 disliked the film at the time of its initial release (1976), although in subsequent years critics warmed up to the movie and it now receives mostly favourable ratings from the public.\nA standard DVD of the film was released on 31 December 1999. A reissue of the film, including previously unreleased footage as a bonus, was released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc on 20 November 2007, by Warner Home Video.\nBackground.\nSince late 1969, Led Zeppelin had been planning on filming one of their live performances for a projected movie documentary of the band. The group's manager, Peter Grant, believed that they would be better served by the big screen than by television, because he regarded the sound quality of the latter as unsatisfactory. In 1970, Grant arranged for the 9 January Royal Albert Hall performance to be filmed by \"In Concert\" and \"Top of the Pops\" producer and director Stanley Dorfman, and Peter Whitehead, for a proposed hour-long special for TV distribution, which was reported by \"Record Mirror\" in late January had been sold to American TV. However the band supplied a pulse feed off their mixing desk for the editing purposes but were not sufficiently happy with their performance to release the full soundtrack for use in the film. It was agreed with Dorfman that the concert would form part of a larger documentary project including the band's performance at the Bath Festival on 28 June, which was filmed by Whitehead. However, Whitehead filmed the entire Zeppelin set in Bath at the incorrect exposure and it was unusable, so the project was shelved.\" The Royal Albert Hall footage was later remastered and featured on the 2003 release \"Led Zeppelin DVD\".\nOn the morning of 20 July 1973, during the band's concert tour of the US, Peter Grant made contact with American-born director Joe Massot. Massot was already known to Grant as he and his wife had moved into a house in Berkshire in 1970, where they made friends with their neighbours, Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page and his girlfriend Charlotte Martin. Grant had previously turned down offers by Massot to make a film of the band, but with the huge success of the band's current tour, Grant changed his mind and offered him the job of director. As Grant recalled:\nIt all started in the Sheraton Hotel, Boston. We'd talked about a film for years and Jimmy had known Joe Massot was interested\u00a0\u2013 so we called them and over they came. It was all very quickly arranged.\nMassot hurriedly assembled a crew in time for Led Zeppelin's last leg of the tour starting on 23 July 1973, in Baltimore. He subsequently filmed the group's three concert performances at Madison Square Garden on the nights of 27, 28, and 29 July 1973. The film was entirely financed by the band and shot on 35mm with a 24-track quadraphonic sound recording.\nOriginal filming.\nThe plans to film the shows at Madison Square Garden were threatened when the local trades union tried to block the British film crew from working. After the band's attorneys negotiated with the union, the crew was allowed to film the concerts.\nThe footage of the band arriving at the airport in their private jet airliner, \"The Starship\", and travelling in the motorcade to the concert was filmed in Pittsburgh, before their show at Three Rivers Stadium on 24 July 1973.\nFor the band's three New York performances, two band members, Robert Plant and John Bonham, wore the same clothes to facilitate seamless editing of the film, but John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page wore different sets of attire on some of the nights, which created continuity problems. Page is seen wearing a different dragon suit in \"Rock and Roll\" and the \"Celebration Day\" remaster which was not an editing error; Page wore a new outfit for those shows which came with a heavy jacket, and he took it off after three songs. In an interview from 1997, Jones said that the reason he did not wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on those nights and was told no. \"I'd think 'not to worry, I'll save the shirt I wore the previous night for the next filming'. Then what would happen is that I'd get onstage and see the cameras ready to roll.\" Grant stated \"It turned out to be traumatic to say the least. They filmed three nights at the Garden and never got one complete take of 'Whole Lotta Love'.\"\nAs Led Zeppelin's popularity soared throughout the 1970s, Peter Grant became increasingly notorious for being brutally protective of his band and their finances; \"The Song Remains the Same\" captures one such exchange between him and a concert promoter. When Warner Bros. approved the film, they did so with the proviso that expletives would be 'bleeped' out. Peter Clifton took the optical print and removed the words, and the film was given an appropriate rating. However, on every other print, the words were retained and were fully audible.\nIn the scene where Peter Grant is driven to the police station to be questioned about the theft from the safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel, he has his arm outside the police car. According to an interview conducted in 1989, he explained the reason he was not handcuffed was that the policeman driving the car used to be a drummer in a semi-professional band which had supported the Yardbirds on one of its US college tours in the late-1960s. Grant had at the time been manager of the Yardbirds. The money stolen from the safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel was never recovered, and while no one has ever been charged, it is alleged that a staff member of the hotel quit their job and fled to Jamaica soon after the theft. Scenes of young fans attempting to buy tickets, an unruly fan being ejected by security, and Grant berating the promoter for receiving kickbacks were all shot at the Baltimore Civic Center on 23 July 1973. Grant purportedly recommended the \"Dazed and Confused\" sequence wherein the camera zooms into Page's eyes and cuts to the scene. Some unused backstage shots filmed at Baltimore and at Pittsburgh later found their way into the promotional video for \"Travelling Riverside Blues\", released in 1990.\nSubsequent filming and release.\nDissatisfied with the progress of the film, Grant had Massot removed from the project and Australian director Peter Clifton was hired in his place in early 1974. Massot was offered a few thousand pounds in compensation. Peter Grant later sent someone to Massot's house to collect the film. However, Massot had hidden the film elsewhere and so instead an expensive editing machine owned by Massot was taken as collateral. Massot served a writ, leading to a period of stalemate which was finally broken when Grant and Led Zeppelin's lawyer Steve Weiss agreed to pay Massot the money he was owed, after which he delivered the film to the band. Massot was not invited to attend the premiere of the film at New York but he attended anyway, buying a ticket from a ticket tout outside the theatre.\nClifton, realising that there were crucial holes in the concert footage, suggested that the entire show be recreated at Shepperton Studios in August 1974, on a mock-up of the Madison Square Garden stage. Gerry Harrison, who worked with Peter Clifton at the Shepperton Studios film shoot stated that \"the band mimed only the missing parts of the film.\"\nWhen it was agreed that the band would meet at Shepperton Studios for filming, Jones had recently had his hair cut short, so he had to wear a wig.\nIn the May 2008 issue of \"Uncut\", Page recalled the events surrounding the shooting of additional footage at Shepperton Studios:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I'm sort of miming at Shepperton to what I'd played at Madison Square Garden, but of course, although I've got a rough approximation of what I was playing from night to night, it's not exact. So the film that came out in the '70s is a bit warts-and-all.\nA plan to shoot additional footage on the band's Autumn 1975 US tour was abandoned due to Plant's car crash in Rhodes, Greece.\nIn 1976 a midnight screening of the film was organised by Atlantic Records before its release, at which label president Ahmet Ertegun reportedly fell asleep.\n\"The Song Remains the Same\" was finally completed by early 1976, 18 months behind schedule and over-budget. Peter Grant later quipped \"It was the most expensive home movie ever made\". It grossed $200,000 in its first week at the box office.\nCritical reaction and popularity.\nFor its New York premiere, Cinema I was equipped with a quadrophonic sound system hired from Showco in Dallas. For the West Coast premieres, no such audio boosting was employed. These premieres, along with the London premiere, were attended by the members of the band.\nThe film performed well at the box office, grossing an estimated $10 million by 1977. Despite this, the film was reviewed negatively by critics for its perceived amateurish production and self-indulgent content, with the fantasy sequences in particular receiving some of the harshest criticism. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where the band had not performed live for over two years as a result of being in tax exile. The band were thus unable to promote themselves at home, leaving them out of the public spotlight.\nHowever, among fans the film has retained its popularity. Until the release of \"Led Zeppelin DVD\" in 2003, \"The Song Remains the Same\" was the only official live visual document that was accessible to followers of the band. It became a cult favourite at late-night movie houses, and its subsequent release on video and then DVD has ensured a growing base of fans.\nSome members of the band regard the performances filmed at Madison Square Garden as merely average for the time, coming as they did at the end of a long and exhausting tour, but nonetheless representative of the generally high standard of the band's live performances during this era. In an interview he gave with \"New Musical Express\" in November 1976, Page stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Song Remains The Same\" is not a great film, but there's no point in making excuses. It's just a reasonably honest statement of where we were at that particular time. It's very difficult for me to watch it now, but I'd like to see it in a year's time just to see how it stands up.\nPage ultimately included footage from this series of concerts in 2003's \"Led Zeppelin DVD\".\nOther members of the band were less favourable, with Jones calling the film \"a massive compromise\" and Plant denouncing it as \"a load of bollocks.\"\nThe film has been viewed as an interesting historical document that captures the band near the peak of their popularity, showcasing the excesses of the music and show business industries in the 1970s. In a \"Mojo\" magazine review published after the film's 2007 reissue, James McNair gave the film four out of five stars and wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The good news is that Jimmy Page and fellow production wunderkind Kevin Shirley have been meticulous as regards quality control. The three-night, July 1973 stint at Madison square garden that fuelled the film's original soundtrack has been plundered afresh ... In truth, 2003's DVD package houses better live performances, but if you want to catch Zeppelin in all their preposterous, 'because we can' glory, The Song Remains ... is the one.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 40% rating based on 40 reviews with the consensus: \"While its concert segments are presented with a whole lotta love, \"The Song Remains the Same\" gets trampled underfoot with its dull fantasy segments and middling insights into the band.\"\nPersonnel.\nLed Zeppelin\nAdditional personnel\n2007 reissue.\nOn 20 November 2007, Warner Home Video released a new DVD edition of \"The Song Remains The Same\" for the first time with all fifteen songs from the original Madison Square Garden concerts.\nThis coincided with the reissue of the accompanying soundtrack to the film, available on CD. The DVD features newly remixed and fully remastered sound, 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound from original master tracks, and includes more than 40\u00a0minutes of added bonus material, including never-before-released performance footage of \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" and \"Celebration Day\", plus performances of \"Misty Mountain Hop\" and \"The Ocean\", a rare 1976 BBC interview with Robert Plant and Peter Grant, vintage TV footage from the Drake Hotel robbery during the New York concert stand, and a Cameron Crowe radio show. This version was released on standard DVDs as well as Blu-ray and HD DVD.\nA Collector's Edition box set including a T-shirt with the original album cover, placards from the New York shows, and several glossy photographs was released as well.\nDue to legal complications, the band decided not to change the video portion of the original movie for the rerelease. Instead, sound engineer Kevin Shirley created an entirely new mix of the three 1973 Madison Square Garden concerts so that the audio portion of the film would better match the on-screen visuals. The audio on the new CD release is nearly identical to the soundtrack of the new DVD release. One difference is that the songs included on the CDs that were not featured in the original movie are included as bonus tracks on the DVD.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a collection of rejected and live tracks from various sessions during the band's twelve-year career. The album was released on 26 November 1982, almost two years after the group had officially disbanded following the death of drummer John Bonham. In 2015, a remastered version of the entire album with two discs of additional material was released.\nBackground.\nThe fifth Swan Song Records album for the band, \"Coda\" was released to honour contractual commitments to Atlantic Records and also to cover tax demands on previous monies earned. It cleared away nearly all of the leftover tracks from the various studio sessions of the 1960s and 1970s. The album was a collection of eight tracks spanning the length of Zeppelin's twelve-year history. Atlantic counted the release as a studio album, as Swan Song had owed the label a final studio album from the band. According to Martin Popoff, \"there's conjecture that Jimmy [Page] called 'We're Gonna Groove' a studio track and 'I Can't Quit You Baby' a rehearsal track because Swan Song owed Atlantic one more studio album specifically.\"\nGuitarist Jimmy Page explained that part of the reasoning for the album's release related to the popularity of unofficial Led Zeppelin recordings, which continued to be circulated by fans: \"\"Coda\" was released, basically, because there was so much bootleg stuff out. We thought, \"Well, if there's that much interest, then we may as well put the rest of our studio stuff out\". As John Paul Jones recalled: \"Basically there wasn't a lot of Zeppelin tracks that didn't go out. We used everything.\"\nThe word \"coda\", meaning a passage that ends a musical piece following the main body, was therefore chosen as the title.\nSongs.\nSide one\n\"We're Gonna Groove\" is a Ben E. King cover (original title is \"Groovin'\") that opens the album. Most of the track was recorded live at a concert held at the Royal Albert Hall in January 1970 while Page added new guitar parts to the recording. The unedited version can be heard in the complete recording of the original Royal Albert Hall concert of 9 January 1970. The original album notes incorrectly state that the track was recorded at Morgan Studios in June 1969. This song was used to open a number of concerts on the band's early 1970 tours and was originally intended to be recorded for inclusion on \"Led Zeppelin II\".\n\"Poor Tom\" is an outtake from \"Led Zeppelin III\", having been recorded at sessions held at Olympic Studios in June 1970.\n\"Walter's Walk\", a reject from \"Houses of the Holy\", was recorded at sessions during April and May 1972.\n\"I Can't Quit You Baby\" is taken from the same January 1970 concert as \"We're Gonna Groove\" but was listed as a taped rehearsal in the original liner notes. The recording was edited to remove the crowd noise as well as the beginning and ending of the song. The crowd sounds were muted on the multi-track mixdown, as was done with \"We're Gonna Groove\".\nSide two\nSide two contains three outtakes from the band's previous album \"In Through the Out Door\", plus a Bonham drum solo.\nThe uptempo \"Ozone Baby\" and the rock 'n' roll styled \"Darlene\" were recorded at that album's sessions at Polar Studios, Stockholm, in November 1978.\n\"Bonzo's Montreux\" was recorded at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland, in September 1976. The track was conceived as a showcase for Bonham's drumming, to which Page added various electronic effects, including a harmonizer. \nThe song was never performed live at Led Zeppelin concerts, however, Bonham performed parts of the composition during \"Moby Dick\" in 1977. In a contemporary review of \"Coda\", Kurt Loder of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the track a positive review, praising Bonham's \"drum orchestra\" and the electronic effects added by Page. Loder further described the track as being \"true to the spirit of Sandy Nelson, and thus vestigially nifty at the very least.\"\n\"Wearing and Tearing\" was recorded at Polar in November 1978. It was written as a reaction to punk, and to show that Led Zeppelin could compete with new bands. The track was scheduled to be issued as a promotional single for the audience at the 1979 Knebworth Festival, headlined by Led Zeppelin, but the record was cancelled at the last minute. The song was first performed live at the 1990 Silver Clef Awards Festival at Knebworth by Plant's band with Page guesting.\nOther tracks\nThe 1993 compact disc edition has four additional tracks from the box sets, \"Led Zeppelin Boxed Set\" (1990) and \"Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2\" (1993), the previously unreleased \"Travelling Riverside Blues\", \"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\" and the \"Immigrant Song\" b-side \"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\" from the former box set and the previously unreleased \"Baby Come On Home\" from the latter box set.\nIn 2015, a remastered version of the entire album with two discs of additional material appeared.\nCover.\nThe album cover was designed by Hipgnosis, the fifth album cover the design group designed for Led Zeppelin. It was also the last album cover Hipgnosis designed before disbanding in 1983. The main four letters CODA are from an alphabet typeface design called \"Neon Slim\" designed by Bernard Allum in 1978.\nCritical reception.\nReviewing for \"Rolling Stone\" in 1983, Kurt Loder hailed \"Coda\" as \"a resounding farewell\" and a \"marvel of compression, deftly tracing the Zeppelin decade with eight powerful, previously unreleased tracks, and no unnecessary elaboration\". Robert Christgau wrote in his \"Consumer Guide\" column for \"The Village Voice\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They really were pretty great, and these eight outtakes\u2014three from their elephantine blues phase, three from their unintentional swan song\u2014aren't where to start discovering why. But despite the calculated clumsiness of the beginnings and the incomplete orchestrations of the end, everything here but the John Bonham Drum Orchestra would convince a disinterested party\u2014a Martian, say. Jimmy Page provides a protean solo on \"I Can't Quit You Baby\" and jumbo riffs throughout.\nAccording to Julian Marszalek of \"The Quietus\", however, \"\"Coda\" has always been regarded as the band's weakest release. Made up of eight tracks that spanned Led Zeppelin's lifetime, it refused to flow as an album. Devoid of a coherent narrative, it felt tossed together to make up for contractual obligations.\" In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said while it did not include all of the band's notable non-album recordings, it offered \"a good snapshot of much of what made Led Zeppelin a great band\" and featured mostly \"hard-charging rock &amp; roll\", including \"Ozone Baby\", \"Darlene\", and \"Wearing and Tearing\": \"rockers that alternately cut loose, groove, and menace\".\nLed Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant reflected on the album as follows: \"When Coda was discussed, I really had\u2014I don't know, I'd just kind of had enough of the whole thing. If you start playing for something other than just kudos and money, then that should be part of the motive all the way through. And when Bonzo died, it's the only reason to start staying actively involved with Led Zeppelin.\"\n2015 reissue.\nA remastered version of \"Coda\", along with \"Presence\" and \"In Through the Out Door,\" was reissued on 31 July 2015. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard CD edition, a deluxe three-CD edition, a standard LP version, a deluxe three-LP version, a super deluxe three-CD plus three-LP version with a hardback book, and as high resolution 24-bit/96k digital downloads. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes and previously unreleased songs, \"If It Keeps On Raining\", \"Sugar Mama\", \"Four Hands\", \"St. Tristan's Sword\", and \"Desire\". The reissue was released with an altered colour version of the original album's artwork as its bonus disc's cover.\nThe reissue was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 8 reviews. In \"Rolling Stone\", David Fricke said it is \"the unlikely closing triumph in Page's series of deluxe Zeppelin reissues: a dynamic pocket history in rarities, across three discs with 15 bonus tracks, of his band's epic-blues achievement\". \"Pitchfork\" journalist Mark Richardson was less impressed by the bonus disc, believing \"there is nothing particularly noteworthy about the 'Bombay Orchestra' tracks\".\nTrack listing.\nOriginal release.\nAll tracks written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, except where noted.\nAll tracks produced by Jimmy Page, except for \"Travelling Riverside Blues\", produced by John Walters, and \"White Summer\"/\"Black Mountain Side\" produced by Jeff Griffin.\nDeluxe edition bonus discs.\nThe CD edition mistakenly lists the running time of \"Bring It On Home\" (rough mix) as 4:19, which matches the duration of the finished version on \"Led Zeppelin II\", not the intended time for the rough mix.\nPersonnel.\nLed Zeppelin\nProduction\nReferences.\nReferences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50460", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50460", "title": "Winchester College", "text": "Public school in Winchester, England\nWinchester College is an English public school (a long-established fee-charging boarding school for pupils aged 13\u201318) with some provision for day attendees, in Winchester, Hampshire, England. It was founded by William of Wykeham in 1382 as a feeder school for New College, Oxford, and has existed in its present location ever since. It is the oldest of the nine schools considered by the Clarendon Commission. The school has begun a transition to become co-educational, and has accepted male and female day pupils from September 2022, having previously been a boys' boarding school for over 600 years.\nThe school was founded to provide an education for 70 scholars. Gradually numbers rose, a choir of 16 \"quiristers\" being added alongside paying pupils known as \"commoners\". Numbers expanded greatly in the 1860s with the addition of ten boarding houses. The scholars continue to live in the school's medieval buildings, which consist of two courtyards, a chapel, and a cloisters. A Wren-style classroom building named \"School\" was added in the 17th century. An art school (\"museum\"), science school, and music school were added at the turn of the 20th century. A war cloister was built as a memorial in 1924.\nThe school has maintained traditions including its mascot, the Trusty Servant; a set of \"notions\" forming a sort of private language; and a school song, \"Domum\". Its headmasters have included the bishops William Waynflete in the 15th century and George Ridding in the 19th century. Former pupils are known as Old Wykehamists.\nHistory.\nFoundation and early years.\nWinchester College was founded in 1382 by William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester and Chancellor to both Edward III and Richard II, in part because of the lack of trained priests following the Black Death. Winchester was to act as a feeder school to New College, also founded by Wykeham. According to its 1382 charter and final statutes (1400), the school is called in Latin (\"St Mary's College, near Winchester\"), or (\"The College of the Blessed Mary of Winchester, near Winchester\"). The first 70 \"poor scholars\" entered the school in 1394. In the early 15th century the specific requirement was that scholars come from families where the income was less than five marks sterling (\u00a33 6s 8d) \"per annum\"; in comparison, the contemporary reasonable living for a yeoman was \u00a35 \"per annum\".\nOther innovations at Winchester included enforcing discipline through the pupils themselves, using prefects. Discipline was in any case meant to be less harsh than was common in medieval schools, at least as the statutes read. Winchester was also unusual in giving education to boys aged 12\u201318, as universities would accept students within this age range. These features, including the double foundation, formed the model for Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, some 50 years later. Eton and Winchester formed a close partnership at that time. At first only a small number of pupils other than scholars were admitted; by the 15th century the school had around 100 pupils in total, nominally the 70 scholars, 16 choirboys known as \"quiristers\", and the rest \"commoners\". Demand for places for commoners was high, and though at first restricted, numbers gradually rose.\nEarly modern period.\nAs the college was a religious as well as educational establishment, it was threatened with closure during Henry VIII's reign. A statute to this effect was drawn up in 1545, which was only halted by his death. Edward VI swiftly reversed direction. Edward made provision for worship and Bible readings to be made in English rather than Latin. In the early modern period, under Henry, Edward, Elizabeth and James, royal visits were accompanied by presentations of Latin and a small amount of Greek occasional poetry, composed by the pupils. Elizabeth also granted an exemption to allow Winchester, Eton and elsewhere to conduct their religious services in Latin, to help pupils to improve their skills in the language.\nVictorian era to present.\nFrom the 1860s, ten boarding houses, each for up to sixty pupils, were added, greatly increasing the school's capacity. By 2020, the number of pupils had risen to 690. From 2022, the school has accepted day pupils in the Sixth Form, including girls. In 2025 the College merged with The Pilgrims' School.\nBuildings.\nThe college consists of an assemblage of buildings from medieval times to the present day. There are 94 listed buildings, set in grounds of some 250 acres, of which 100 acres are water meadows, 52 acres are playing fields, and 11 acres are formal gardens; the area includes St Catherine's Hill. The medieval buildings, representing most of the original foundation from the school's opening in 1394, include Outer Gate and Outer Court, Chamber Court, the chapel, and the Cloisters. These are built in flint with limestone facings and slate roofs. The chapel retains its original wooden fan-vaulted ceiling, designed by Hugh Herland, carpenter to Richard II. Little of the original medieval glass, designed by Thomas Glazier, survives, as it was scattered in the 1820s, but some is now housed in Thurburn's Chantry, at the back of the chapel, and in Fromond's Chantry, inside the Cloisters. The \"School\" building was constructed in 1683\u20131687 in Wren style, with a statue of the founder above the door by C. G. Cibber. The school was greatly extended in the 19th century with the addition of boarding houses for \"commoners\", paying pupils, as opposed to the scholars who continued to live in the medieval College. At the turn of the 20th century, a Music School, \"Museum\" (art school), and Science School, all architect-designed, were added. A hall big enough for the enlarged school, New Hall, was opened in 1961, accommodating the oak panelling removed from the Chapel in the 1874 refurbishment. In 1924, a War Cloister was constructed; it now serves as a memorial of the Wykehamists killed in the two World Wars. Visitors may tour areas such as Chamber Court, the chapel, College Hall, the Cloisters, School and Museum, for a fee.\nAccommodation.\nCollege.\nThe seventy scholars live in the original buildings, known as \"College\". The scholars are known as \"Collegemen\", and the schoolmaster in charge of them is called the Master in College. Collegemen wear black gowns, following the founding traditions of the school. Collegemen enjoy certain privileges compared to the Commoners, such as having open fires and being allowed to walk across Meads, the walled sports field outside School.\nBoarding houses.\nEvery pupil at Winchester, apart from the Scholars, lives in a boarding house, chosen or allocated when applying to Winchester. It is here that he studies, eats and sleeps. Each house is presided over by a housemaster (who takes on the role in addition to teaching duties), assisted by house tutors. Houses compete against each other in school sports. Each house has an official name, usually based on the family name of the first housemaster, which is used mainly as a postal address. Each house also has an informal name, usually based on the name or nickname of an early housemaster. Each house also has a letter, in the order of their founding, to act as an abbreviation, especially on laundry tags. A member of a house is described by the informal name of the house with \"-ite\" suffixed, as \"a Furleyite\", \"a Toyeite\", \"a Cookite\" and so on. College does not have an informal name, although the abbreviation \"Coll\" is sometimes used; \"X\" (meaning, not one of the boarding houses) was originally used only on laundry tags.\nAcademic.\nAdmission.\nWinchester is considered one of the most prestigious schools in the world. It has its own entrance examination, and does not use Common Entrance like other major public schools. Those wishing to enter a Commoner House make their arrangements with the relevant housemaster some two years before sitting the exam, usually sitting a test set by the housemaster and an interview. Those applying to College do not take the normal entrance examination but instead sit a separate, harder, exam called \"Election\": successful candidates may obtain, according to their performance, a scholarship, an exhibition or a Headmaster's nomination to join a Commoner House. Admission to College was historically coupled to remission of fees, but this has ceased; instead, means-tested bursaries ranging from 5% to 100% of the school fee are provided, according to need. From 2022, Winchester admitted girls into the 6th form (year 12) as day pupils, with girls boarding from 2026. For 2023/24, the fee is \u00a349,152 per annum (\u00a316,384 per term) for boarding pupils and \u00a336,369 per annum (\u00a312,123 per term) for day pupils.\nStructure.\nIn addition to normal lessons, all boys throughout the school are required to attend a class called Division (known as \"Div\") which explores parts of history, literature, and politics that do not lead to external examinations; its purpose is to ensure a broad education.\nFrom year 9, pupils study for at least nine GCSE and IGCSEs. Every pupil studies English, mathematics, Latin, French or German, and at least two sciences at this level, as well as \"Div\". Pupils then study three A-levels, \"Div\", and an Extended Project Qualification.\nResults.\nWinchester College is particularly known for its academic rigour. \nIn 2023 at A-Level, 79.6% of student results were graded A*-A, with 42.4% at A*. At GCSE, 88.4% of results were graded 7 or higher, with 73.1% of grades being 8 or 9, and 50.5% of all grades achieving the top grade of 9. In the same year, 17% of pupils secured places at Oxbridge, while notable US destinations included Harvard, Columbia, UPenn, and Chicago.\nBetween 2010 and 2018, an average of 33% of leavers obtained places at Oxford or Cambridge.\nActivities.\nSport.\nWinchester College has its own game, Winchester College football (also known as \"Win: Co: Fo:\" or \"Winkies\"), played only at Winchester. It is played in the spring term with a competition between the school's houses; it is largely managed by the boys.\nA distinctive Winchester version of fives resembles Rugby fives but with a buttress on the court. The buttress enables a skilful player to cause the ball to ricochet in an unexpected direction.\nThe school has an active rowing club called the Winchester College Boat Club which is based on the River Itchen. The club is affiliated to British Rowing (boat code WIN) and was twice winner of the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup (in 1949 and 1954) at the Henley Royal Regatta.\nRivalry \u2014 particularly sporting \u2014 between Winchester and Eton has existed for centuries.\nCombined Cadet Force.\nPupils of the school in their second year are currently required to serve in the college's Combined Cadet Force.\nThe organisation was founded in 1860 as \"The Winchester College Rifle Volunteer Corps\" by various boys in their top year as a result of the perceived threat of Napoleon III after the Orsini plot, and remained entirely autonomous until it was taken over by the Second Master in 1868. It was enrolled as a Cadet Corps in the 1st Hants Volunteer Battalion. In 1908, the Officer Training Corps was established, and by 1914, through the request of the War Office that Senior Cadets be given appropriate training for the war effort, almost every student became involved in the Corps, though it was never explicitly compulsory. In the Second World War, it was renamed as \"The Junior Training Corps\", though its function was still to prepare boys for Officer responsibilities. Montgomery remarked on inspecting the Corps in 1946 that there was \"latent leadership in all ranks\". In 1948, the \"Junior Training Corps\" became known as the \"Combined Cadet Force\" (CCF) which incorporated RAF and RN sections. In 1963, \"Alternative Service Activities\" were introduced for boys who did not want to join the CCF. Pupils were made eligible to opt out of the CCF at the end of their second year after starting at the beginning of the year: this is still the school's policy.\nMusic.\nWinchester offers extensive opportunities for musical development, with two-thirds of pupils playing at least one instrument. The school has a music school and numerous practice rooms, and a variety of choirs, ensembles, and orchestras. The chapel choir has existed since the school's foundation. Music and choral scholarships fund free tuition for candidates proficient in multiple instruments at grade 6 level or above.\nTraditions.\n\"The Trusty Servant\": the school mascot.\nThe Trusty Servant is an emblematic figure in a painting at Winchester College, that serves as the school's unofficial mascot and the name of its alumni magazine. A painting of \"The Trusty Servant\" and accompanying verses both devised by the poet John Hoskins in 1579 hangs outside the college kitchen. The current version was painted by William Cave the Younger in 1809. The painting depicts a mythical creature with the body of a man, the head of a pig, with its snout closed with a padlock, the ears of an ass, the feet of a stag, and tools in his left hand. The verses are on the virtues that pupils of the college were supposed to have. The college arms are shown in the background of the painting.\n\"Notions\": the school language.\nA \"notion\" is a specialised term peculiar to Winchester College. The word notion is also used to describe traditions unique to the school. An example of a notion is \"toytime\", meaning homework, from the notion \"toys\", a wooden cubicle that serves as a pupil's workspace in a communal room, known as \"mugging hall\" in Commoner Houses or a \"chamber\" in College.\n\"Manners makyth man\": the school motto.\nSince the foundation, Winchester College has had numerous words and phrases directly associated with it, including its motto, its graces, and a prayer. A grace is read before and after every lunch and formal meal in College Hall. Two separate graces are traditionally sung during Election, the scholarship process.\n\"Manners makyth man\"\n\u2013 Motto of Winchester College, New College, Oxford, and the founder of the two colleges, William of Wykeham\nThe Latin grace before meals in College goes:\nThe Latin grace after meals in College goes:\n\"Domum\": the school song.\nThe school song is entitled \"Domum\" and is sung at the end of the summer term, known as Cloister Time. The origin of the song is unknown; it was described as \"an old tradition\" in the 1773 \"History and Antiquities of Winchester\". \nThe traditional tune was composed by John Reading. A new tune, by Malcolm Archer, was officially adopted by the school in about 2007.\nAccording to legend, the text was written in the 17th century by a pupil who was confined for misconduct during the Whitsun holidays. (In one account, he was tied to a pillar.) It is said that he carved the words on the bark of a tree, which was thereafter called \"Domum Tree\", and cast himself into Logie (the river running through the school grounds). There is still a \"Domum Cottage\" in that area. The author of the text apparently wrongly treated \"domum\" as a neuter noun.\nA \"Domum Dinner\" is held at the end of the summer term for leavers. It was formerly restricted to those former scholars of Winchester who were also scholars of New College, and distinguished guests. Until the reforms of the 19th century, there were three successive Election Dinners held during Election Week, culminating in a Domum Ball. Originally these festivities occurred around Whitsun, as suggested by references in the song to early summer such as \"See the year, the meadow, smiling\" and \"Now the swallow seeks her dwelling\".\nInfluence.\nWinchester's approach to education was influential on later schools. It was unusual in the medieval period in giving education to boys aged 12\u201318, as universities would accept students within this age range. The age range, the double foundation with New College, Oxford, and the approach to discipline formed the model for Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, some 50 years later.\nPupils of the school have appeared in many works of fiction: the school itself rather less often. The figure of Sir Humphrey Appleby in the TV series \"Yes Minister\" is among the best-known Old Wykehamists in fiction.\nAs with other prominent public schools, a locomotive of the Southern Railway V Class was named after Winchester College. The second of the class, No. 901 \"Winchester\" was constructed by Southern at the nearby Eastleigh Works; it entered service in 1930.\nHeadmasters.\nThe headmasters of Winchester College from the 14th century onwards are:\nNotable alumni.\nCurrent pupils of Winchester College are known as Wykehamists, in memory of the school's founder, William of Wykeham; former pupils are known as Old Wykehamists, or amongst themselves as Old Woks. \nFictional Old Wykehamists appear in over 50 novels, starting with Tobias Smollett's eponymous \"Peregrine Pickle\" in 1751.\nControversies.\nIn 1872, under the headmaster George Ridding, \"tunding\", beatings given by a prefect (a senior pupil), using a ground-ash across the shoulders, were still permitted. The matter became a national scandal, known as \"the Tunding Row\", when \"an overzealous Senior Commoner Prefect\" beat a pupil for refusing to attend a notions test. Ridding made matters worse by trying to defend the action. He eventually limited the prefects' power to beat, and forbade notions tests as a \"disgraceful innovation\".\nIn the 1970s and 80s, the college permitted a Christian Forum \u2013 later described as \"cult-like\" \u2013 to operate on college grounds, giving John Smyth access to pupils. He carried out sadomasochistic abuse on several of them at his nearby house in Morestead. Smyth was a leader of the evangelical Christian Iwerne camps, where abuse also took place. He was assisted in this by former Winchester pupil Simon Doggart. The college and the Iwerne Trust became aware of these allegations in 1982, but neither reported them to the police. Smyth was warned off and moved to Zimbabwe and then South Africa, where abuse continued. An independent review, commissioned by the college, was published in January 2022, alongside the Makin Review by the Church of England and a review by the Titus Trust (which succeeded the Iwerne Trust).\nIn 2005, Winchester College was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools found guilty of running an unlawful price-fixing cartel by the Office of Fair Trading. As a penalty, the schools paid for a trust fund to benefit the affected pupils. Winchester College, like Eton, received a fifty per cent reduction in its penalty in return for its full cooperation.\nIn 2017 Winchester College suspended its Head of Art History for providing students with information about questions on an upcoming public exam. The headmaster of Winchester confirmed that the school had treated the matter \"very seriously\" and that no boy was responsible for the \"exam irregularity\". The information was widely distributed, resulting in their papers being disallowed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, by Iran to the west, by the Soviet Union to the north, and by China to the northeast. Established by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) following the Saur Revolution in April 1978, it came to rely heavily on the Soviet Union for financial and military assistance and was therefore widely considered to be a Soviet satellite state. The PDPA's rise to power is seen as the beginning of the ongoing Afghan conflict, and the majority of the country's years in existence were marked by the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. It collapsed by the end of the First Afghan Civil War in April 1992, having lasted only four months after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nThe PDPA began ruling Afghanistan after ousting the unelected autocrat Mohammad Daoud Khan, who had become president by leading the 1973 Afghan coup d'\u00e9tat; he was succeeded by Nur Muhammad Taraki as the head of state and government on 30 April 1978. Both Taraki and his successor Hafizullah Amin, who had organized the Saur Revolution as the General Secretary of the PDPA, introduced several contentious reforms during their time in office, such as land and marriage reforms and an enforced policy of de-Islamization vis-\u00e0-vis the promotion of socialism. Amin, in particular, built upon Khan's reforms with even more radical legislation for Afghanistan's conservative Muslim society, such as universal education and equal rights for women. Soon afterwards, a power struggle began between two PDPA factions: the hardline Khalq, led by Taraki and Amin; and the moderate Parcham, led by Babrak Karmal. The Khalqists eventually emerged victorious and subsequently purged the bulk of the Parchamite ranks, while also exiling most of the prominent Parcham leaders to the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.\nFollowing the Khalq\u2013Parcham conflict, a power struggle arose within the Khalq faction itself, as Taraki and Amin increasingly contested each other's influence. Amin gained the upper hand among the Khalqists and later had Taraki killed on his orders. Due to his earlier reforms, however, Amin's rule proved to be unpopular throughout most of Afghanistan, with the country's emerging instability prompting the Soviet government to begin planning for a direct military intervention in favour of the Parchamites. On 27 December 1979, the Soviet Union launched Operation Storm-333, assaulting the Tajbeg Palace in Kabul and assassinating Amin, who was then replaced by Karmal. The Karmal era, which lasted from 1979 to 1986, was marked by the height of the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. As the Soviet and Afghan militaries fought against the Afghan mujahideen, which had been bolstered by military aid from the Muslim world and the Western Bloc, the country rapidly destabilized, resulting in widespread civilian casualties and the creation of millions of refugees, most of whom fled to Pakistan and Iran. In April 1980, the \"Fundamental Principles\" (comprising a constitution) were introduced by Karmal's administration, and several non-PDPA members were allowed into the government to broaden the country's support base. However, these policies ultimately failed to bring peace to Afghanistan, and in 1986, Karmal was succeeded by Mohammad Najibullah.\nNajibullah pursued a policy known as National Reconciliation: a new constitution was introduced in 1987 and democratic elections were held in 1988, though they were boycotted by the mujahideen. After almost a decade of warfare, the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in February 1989, but continued to back the PDPA, which was facing mounting resistance from the opposition. By 1990, another constitution was introduced, stating that Afghanistan's true nature was that of an Islamic republic and transforming the PDPA into the Watan Party. On the military front, the government still proved to be capable of performing in open combat, as demonstrated in the Battle of Jalalabad. However, with growing internal difficulties, such as the 1990 Khalqist coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the Najibullah government was unable to sustain itself and ultimately lost the First Afghan Civil War in April 1992, which, in turn, triggered the Second Afghan Civil War. Afghanistan eventually transitioned to an Islamic Republic which remained from 2004 to 2021.\nHistory.\nSaur Revolution and Taraki: 1978\u20131979.\nMohammad Daoud Khan, the President of the Republic of Afghanistan from 1973 to 1978, was ousted during the Saur Revolution (April Revolution) following the death of Mir Akbar Khyber, a Parchamite politician from the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), who died under mysterious circumstances. Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, was the coup's chief architect. Nur Muhammad Taraki, the leader of the Khalqists, was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and retained his post as General Secretary of the PDPA Central Committee. Under him was Babrak Karmal, the leader of the Parcham faction, as Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Amin as Council of Ministers deputy chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar as Council of Ministers deputy chairman. The appointment of Karmal, Amin and Watanjar as Council of Ministers deputy chairmen proved unstable, and it led to three different governments being established within the government; the Khalq faction was answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar.\nThe first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to military officers who participated in the Saur Revolution. Amin, who previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, altered his position; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists (they implied that the Parchamites had ridden the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution). To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism. On 27 June, three months after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting. The meeting decided that the Khalqists had the exclusive right to formulate and decide policy, which left the Parchamites impotent. Karmal was exiled. Later, a coup planned by the Parchamites and led by Karmal was discovered by the Khalqist leadership, prompting a swift reaction; a purge of Parchamites began. Parchamite ambassadors were recalled, but few returned; for instance, Karmal and Mohammad Najibullah stayed in their respective countries.\nDuring Taraki's rule, an unpopular land reform was introduced, leading to the requisitioning of land by the government without compensation; it disrupted lines of credit and led to some crop buyers boycotting beneficiaries of the reform, causing agricultural harvests to plummet and rising discontent amongst Afghans. When Taraki realized the degree of popular dissatisfaction with the reform he began to curtail the policy. Afghanistan's long history of resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control further undermined his authority. Consequently, much of the land reform did not get implemented nationwide. In the months following the coup, Taraki and other party leaders initiated other policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. The strength of the anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the Afghan Civil War.\nAmin and the Soviet intervention: 1979.\nWhile Amin and Taraki had a very close relationship at the beginning, the relationship soon deteriorated. Amin, who had helped to create a personality cult centered on Taraki, soon became disgusted with the shape it took and with Taraki, who had begun to believe in his own brilliance. Taraki began dismissing Amin's suggestions, fostering in Amin a deep sense of resentment. As their relationship turned increasingly sour, a power struggle developed between them for control of the Afghan Army. Following the 1979 Herat uprising, the Revolutionary Council and the PDPA Politburo established the Homeland Higher Defence Council. Taraki was elected its chairman, while Amin became its deputy. Amin's appointment, and the acquisition of the premiership (as Chairman of the Council of Ministers), was not a step further up the ladder as one might assume; due to constitutional reforms, Amin's new offices were more or less powerless. There was a failed assassination attempt led by the Gang of Four, which consisted of Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy, Sherjan Mazdoryar and Assadullah Sarwari. This assassination attempt prompted Amin to conspire against Taraki, and when Taraki returned from a trip to Havana, he was ousted, and later suffocated on Amin's orders.\nDuring his 104 days in power, Amin became committed to establishing a collective leadership. When Taraki was ousted, Amin promised \"from now on there will be no one-man government...\". Prior to the Soviet intervention, the PDPA executed between 1,000 and 27,000 people, mostly at Pul-e-Charkhi prison. Between 17,000 and 25,000 people were arrested during Taraki's and Amin's rules combined. Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of the Afghan Armed Forces deteriorated under Amin; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan Army decreased from 100,000, in the immediate aftermath of the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem was that the KGB had penetrated the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy. While his position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc were agitating for his removal. Babrak Karmal, the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Assadullah Sarwari wanted to exact revenge on Amin.\nMeantime in the Soviet Union, the Special Commission of the Politburo on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov, Andrei Gromyko, Dmitriy Ustinov and Boris Ponomarev, wanted to end the impression that the Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policies. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, telling Leonid Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capability to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.\nAmin remained trustful of the Soviet Union until the very end, despite the deterioration of official relations with the Soviet Union. When the Afghan intelligence service handed Amin a report that the Soviet Union would invade the country and topple him, Amin claimed the report was a product of imperialism. His view can be explained by the fact that the Soviet Union, after several months, decided to send troops into Afghanistan. Contrary to normal Western beliefs, Amin was informed of the Soviet decision to send troops into Afghanistan. Amin was killed by Soviet forces on 27 December 1979.\nKarmal era: 1979\u20131986.\nKarmal ascended to power following Amin's assassination. On 27 December Radio Kabul broadcast Karmal's pre-recorded speech, which stated \"Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed, his accomplices \u2013 the primitive executioners, usurpers and murderers of tens of thousand of our fellow countrymen \u2013 fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters, children and old people...\". On 1 January Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Alexei Kosygin, the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, congratulated Karmal on his \"election\" as leader, before any Afghan state or party organ had elected him to anything.\nWhen he came to power, Karmal promised an end to executions, the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections, the creation of a constitution, the legalisation of parties other than the PDPA, and respect for individual and personal property. Prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general amnesty. He even promised that a coalition government was going to be established that was not going to espouse socialism. At the same time, he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic, military and political assistance. Even if Karmal indeed wanted all this, it would be impossible to put it into practice in the presence of the Soviet Union. Most Afghans mistrusted the government at this time. Many still remembered that Karmal had said he would protect private capital in 1978, a promise later proven to be a lie.\nWhen a political solution failed, the Afghan government and the Soviet military decided to solve the conflict militarily. The change from a political to a military solution came gradually. It began in January 1981: Karmal doubled wages for military personnel, issued several promotions, and one general and thirteen colonels were decorated. The draft age was lowered, the obligatory length of military duty was extended, and the age for reservists was increased to thirty-five years of age. In June, Assadullah Sarwari lost his seat in the PDPA Politburo, and in his place were appointed Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, a former tank commander and the then Minister of Communications, Major General Mohammad Rafi, the Minister of Defence and KHAD Chairman Mohammad Najibullah. These measures were introduced due to the collapse of the army; before the invasion the army could field 100,000 troops, after the invasion only 25,000. Desertion was pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often led them to flee to the opposition. To better organise the military, seven military zones were established, each with its own Defence Council. The Defence Council was established at the national, provincial and district level to devolve powers to the local PDPA. It is estimated that the Afghan government spent as much as 40 percent of government revenue on defence.\nKarmal was forced to resign from his post as PDPA General Secretary in May 1986, due to increasing pressure from the Soviet leadership, and was succeeded by Najibullah, the former Minister of State Security. He continued to have influence in the upper echelons of the party and state until he was forced to resign from his post of Revolutionary Council Chairman in November 1986, being succeeded by Haji Mohammad Chamkani, who was not a PDPA member.\nNajibullah and Soviet withdrawal: 1986\u20131989.\nIn September 1986 the National Compromise Commission (NCC) was established on the orders of Najibullah. The NCC's goal was to contact counter-revolutionaries \"in order to complete the Saur Revolution in its new phase.\" An estimated 40,000 rebels were contacted by the government. At the end of 1986, Najibullah called for a six-month ceasefire and talks between the various opposition forces, as part of his policy of National Reconciliation. The discussions, if fruitful, would have led to the establishment of a coalition government and be the end of the PDPA's monopoly on power. The programme failed, but the government was able to recruit disillusioned mujahideen fighters as government militias. The National Reconciliation did lead an increasing number of urban dwellers to support his rule, and to the stabilisation of the Afghan defence forces.\nWhile Najibullah may have been the \"de jure\" leader of Afghanistan, Soviet advisers still did most of the work after Najibullah took power. As Gorbachev remarked \"We're still doing everything ourselves... That's all our people know how to do. They've tied Najibullah hand and foot.\" Fikryat Tabeev, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, was accused of acting like a Governor General by Gorbachev, and he was recalled from Afghanistan in July 1986. But while Gorbachev called for the end of Soviet management of Afghanistan, he could not resist doing some managing himself. At a Soviet Politburo meeting, Gorbachev said, \"It's difficult to build a new building out of old material... I hope to God that we haven't made a mistake with Najibullah.\" As time would prove, Najibullah's aims were the opposite of the Soviet Union's; Najibullah was opposed to a Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union wanted a withdrawal. This was understandable, since it was thought that the Afghan military was on the brink of dissolution. Najibullah thought his only means of survival was to retain the Soviet presence. In July 1986 six Soviet regiments, up to 15,000 troops, were withdrawn from Afghanistan. The aim of this early withdrawal was, according to Gorbachev, to show the world that the Soviet leadership was serious about leaving Afghanistan. The Soviets told the United States Government that they were planning to withdraw, but the United States Government didn't believe it. When Gorbachev met with Ronald Reagan during his visit the United States, Reagan called, bizarrely, for the dissolution of the Afghan Military.\nOn 14 April the Afghan and Pakistani governments signed the 1988 Geneva Accords, and the Soviet Union and the United States signed as guarantors; the treaty specifically stated that the Soviet military had to withdraw from Afghanistan by 15 February 1989. During a Politburo meeting Eduard Shevardnadze said \"We will leave the country in a deplorable situation\", and talked further about economic collapse, and the need to keep at least 10,000 to 15,000 troops in Afghanistan. Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, supported this position. This stance, if implemented, would be a betrayal of the Geneva Accords just signed. Najibullah was against any type of Soviet withdrawal. A few Soviet troops remained after the Soviet withdrawal; for instance, parachutists who protected the Soviet embassy staff, military advisors and special forces and reconnaissance troops still operated in the \"outlying provinces\", especially along the Afghan\u2013Soviet border.\nFall: 1989\u20131992.\nPakistan, under Zia ul-Haq, continued to support the Afghan mujahideen even though it was a contravention of the Geneva Accords. At the beginning most observers expected the Najibullah government to collapse immediately, and to be replaced with an Islamic fundamentalist government. Following the Soviet withdrawal the morale of the Afghan Military was said to have actually increased. The Central Intelligence Agency stated in a report, that the new government would be ambivalent, or even worse hostile, towards the United States. Almost immediately after the Soviet withdrawal, the Battle of Jalalabad was fought between Afghan government forces and the mujahideen; the government forces, to the surprise of many, repulsed the attack and won the battle. This trend would not continue, and by the summer of 1990, the Afghan government forces were on the defensive again. By the beginning of 1991, the government controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, the eleven-year Siege of Khost had ended in a mujahideen victory and the morale of the Afghan military slumped. In 1991 a coup led by members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to remove Gorbachev failed resulting in the removal of many Soviet politicians and military officers that favored continuing aid to the Homeland Party government in Kabul. The last Soviet aid came in October, with all Russian aid being cut by the new President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin in January 1992. Correctly fearing that a Mujahedeen victory could lead to the new government backing Islamists against the former Soviet Central Asian republics, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan provided food aid to the Najibullah government. The end of weapon exports however led to an inability to equip the estimated 170 thousand strong militias Najibullah set up through his reconciliation policies.\nIn March 1992, Najibullah offered his government's immediate resignation, and following an agreement with the United Nations (UN), his government was replaced by an interim government. In mid-April Najibullah accepted a UN plan to hand power to a seven-man council. A few days later, on 14 April, Najibullah was forced to resign by 4 of his generals, because of the loss of Bagram airbase and the town of Charikar. Abdul Rahim Hatef became acting head of state following Najibullah's resignation. Najibullah, not long before Kabul's fall, appealed to the UN for amnesty, which he was granted. But Najibullah was hindered by Abdul Rashid Dostum from escaping; instead, Najibullah sought haven in the local UN headquarters in Kabul. The war in Afghanistan did not end with Najibullah's ouster, and continued until the final fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021. Kabul would suffer destruction following Najibullah's resignation as many factions fought for control.\nPolitics.\nPolitical system.\nThe People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan described the Saur Revolution as a democratic revolution signifying \"a victory of the honourable working people of Afghanistan\" and the \"manifestation of the real will and interests of workers, peasants and toilers.\" While the idea of moving Afghanistan toward socialism was proclaimed, completing the task was seen as an arduous road. Thus, Afghanistan's foreign minister commented that Afghanistan was a democratic but not yet socialist republic, while a member of the Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan predicted that \"Afghanistan will not see socialism in my lifetime\" in an interview with a British journalist in 1981.\nAfghanistan was considered by the Soviet Union as a state with a socialist orientation. The Soviets, in mid-1979, initially proclaimed Afghanistan as not merely a progressive ally, but a fully fledged member of the socialist community of nations. In contrast, later Soviet rhetoric invariably referred to the Saur Revolution as a democratic turn, but stopped short of recognizing a socialist society.\nUnder Hafizullah Amin, a commission working on a new constitution was established. There were 65 members of this commission, and they came from all walks of life. Due to his death, his constitution was never finished. In April 1980, under Babrak Karmal, the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan were made law. The constitution was devoid of any references to socialism or communism, and instead laid emphasis on independence, Islam and liberal democracy. Religion was to be respected, the exception being when religion threatened the security of society. The Fundamental Principles were, in many ways, similar to Mohammad Daoud Khan's 1977 constitution. While official ideology was de-emphasized, the PDPA did not lose its monopoly on power, and the Revolutionary Council continued to be ruled through its Presidium, the majority of Presidium members were from the PDPA Politburo. The Karmal government was \"a new evolutionary phase of the great Saur Revolution.\" The Fundamental Principles was not implemented in practice, and it was replaced by the 1987 constitution in a \"loya jirga\" under Muhammad Najibullah but did not have support of opposition parties. Islamic principles were embedded in the 1987 constitution. For instance, Article 2 of the constitution stated that Islam was the state religion, and Article 73 stated that the head of state had to be born into a Muslim Afghan family. In 1990, the 1987 constitution was amended to state that Afghanistan was an Islamic republic, and the last references to communism were removed. Article 1 of the amended constitution said that Afghanistan was an \"independent, unitary and Islamic state.\"\nThe 1987 constitution liberalized the political landscape in areas under government control. Political parties could be established as long as they opposed colonialism, imperialism, neo-colonialism, Zionism, racial discrimination, apartheid, and fascism. The Revolutionary Council was abolished, and replaced by the National Assembly of Afghanistan, a democratically elected parliament. The government announced its willingness to share power, and form a coalition government. The new parliament was bicameral, and consisted of a Senate (Sena) and a House of Representatives (Wolesi Jirga). The president was to be indirectly elected to a 7-year term. A parliamentary election was held in 1988. The PDPA won 46 seats in the House of Representatives and controlled the government with support from the National Front, which won 45 seats, and from various newly recognized left-wing parties, which had won a total of 24 seats. Although the election was boycotted by the Mujahideen, the government left 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as a small number of seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerrillas would end their armed struggle and participate in the government. The only armed opposition party to make peace with the government was Hizbollah, a small Shi'a party not to be confused with the bigger party in Iran.\nThe Council of Ministers was the Afghan cabinet, and its chairman was the head of government. It was the most important government body in PDPA Afghanistan, and it ran the governmental ministries. The Council of Ministers was responsible to the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council, and after the adoption of the 1987 constitution, to the President and House of Representatives. There seems to have been a deliberate power-sharing between the two bodies; few Presidium members were ministers. It was the PDPA (perhaps with the involvement of the Soviets) which appointed and decided the membership of the Council of Ministers. An Afghan dissident who had previously worked in the office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers reported that all topics up for discussion in the Council of Ministers had to be approved by the Soviets. Under Karmal, the Khalqist's were purged and replaced by the Parcham majority in the Council of Ministers. Of the 24 members of the Council of Ministers under Karmal's chairmanship, only four were Khalqists.\nPeople's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.\nThe PDPA constitution was written during the party's First Congress in 1965. The constitution regulated all party activities and modelled itself after the Leninist party model; the party was based on the principles of democratic centralism and Marxism\u2013Leninism was the party's official ideology. In theory, the Central Committee of the PDPA ruled Afghanistan by electing the members to the Revolutionary Council, Secretariat, and the Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, the key decision-making bodies of state and party. After the Soviet intervention, the powers of the PDPA decreased because of the government's increased unpopularity amongst the masses. Soviet advisers took over nearly all aspects of Afghan administration; according to critics, the Afghans became the advisors and the Soviet became the advised. The Soviet intervention had forced Karmal upon the party and state. While trying to portray the new government as a Khalq\u2013Parcham coalition, most members (the majority of whom were Khalqists), saw through the lies. At the time of the Parchamite takeover of the state and party, an estimated 80 percent of military officers were Khalqists.\nIn the party's history, only two congresses were held; the founding congress in 1965 and the Second Congress in June 1990, which transformed the PDPA into the Watan Party, which has survived to this today in the shape of the Democratic Watan Party. The Second Congress renamed the party and tried to revitalise it by admitting to past mistakes and evolving ideologically. The policy of national reconciliation was given a major ideologically role, since the party now looked for a peaceful solution to the conflict; class struggle was still emphasised. The party also decided to support and further develop the market economy in Afghanistan.\nFactions.\nThroughout PDPA history there were also other factions, such as the Kar faction led by Dastagir Panjsheri, who later became a Khalqist, and Settam-e-Melli formed and led by Tahir Badakhshi. The Settam-e-Melli was a part of the insurgency against the PDPA government. In 1979, a Settam-e-Melli group killed Adolph Dubs, the United States Ambassador to Afghanistan. Ideologically Settam-e-Melli was very close to the Khalqist faction, but Settam-e-Melli opposed what they saw as the Khalq faction's \"Pashtun chauvinism.\" Settam-e-Melli followed the ideology of Maoism. When Karmal ascended to power, the Settamites relationship with the government improved, mostly due to Karmal's former good relationship with Badakhshi, who was killed by government forces in 1979. In 1983, Bashir Baghlani, a Settam-e-Melli member, was appointed Minister of Justice.\nNational Front.\nKarmal had first mentioned the possibility of establishing a \"broad national front\" in March 1980, but given the situation the country was in, the campaign for the establishment of such an organisation began only in January 1981. A \"spontaneous\" demonstration in support of establishing such an organisation was held that month. The first pre-front institution to be established was a tribal jirga in May 1981 by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. This jirga later became a member of the front. The National Fatherland Front (NFF) held its founding congress in June 1981, after being postponed on several occasions. The founding congress, which was planned to last four days, lasted only one. Within one month of its founding, 27 senior members had been assassinated by the mujahideen. Due to this, the organisation took time to establish itself; its first Provincial Committee was established in November, and its first jirga in December. It was not until 1983 that the NFF became an active, and important organisation. The aim of the NFF was to establish a pro-PDPA organisation for those who did not support the PDPA ideologically.\nIts first leader was Salah Mohammad Zeary, a prominent politician within the PDPA. Zeary's selection had wider implications: the PDPA dominated all NFF activities. Officially, the NFF had amassed 700,000 members after its founding, which later increased to one million. The majority of its members were already members of affiliated organisations, such as the Women's Council, the Democratic Youth Organisation and the trade unions, all of which were controlled by the PDPA. The membership numbers were in any case inflated. In 1984 the NFF had 67,000 members, and in 1986 its membership peaked at 112,209. In 1985 Zeary stepped down as NFF leader, and was succeeded by Abdul Rahim Hatef, who was not a member of the PDPA. The ascension of Hatef proved more successful, and in 1985\u201386 the NFF succeeded in recruiting several \"good Muslims\". The NFF was renamed the National Front in 1987.\nSymbols: flag and emblem.\nOn 19 October 1978 the PDPA government introduced a new flag, a red flag with a yellow seal, and it was similar to the flags of the Soviet Central Asian republics. The new flag stirred popular resentment, as many Afghans saw it as proof of the PDPA government's attempt to introduce state atheism. It was shown to the public for the first time in an official rally in Kabul. The red flag introduced under Taraki was replaced in 1980, shortly after the Soviet intervention, to the more traditional colours black, red and green. The PDPA flag, which was red with a yellow seal, was retained to emphasise the difference between the party and state to the Afghan people. The red star, the book and communist symbols in general, were removed from the flag in 1987 under Najibullah.\nThe new emblem, which replaced Daoud's eagle emblem, was introduced together with the flag in 1978. When Karmal introduced a new emblem in 1980, he said \"it is from the pulpit that thousands of the faithful are led to the right path.\" The book depicted in the emblem (and the flag) was generally considered to be \"Das Kapital\", a work by Karl Marx, and not the \"Quran\", the central Islamic text. The last emblem was introduced in 1987 by the Najibullah government. This emblem was, in contrast to the previous ones, influenced by Islam. The Red Star and \"Das Kapital\" were removed from the emblem (and the flag). The emblem depicted the mihrab, the minbar and the shahada, an Islamic creed.\nEconomy.\nTaraki's Government initiated a land reform on 1 January 1979, which attempted to limit the amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the rural population while weakening the power of the bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.\nContrary to government expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans. When Taraki realized the degree of popular dissatisfaction with the reform he quickly abandoned the policy. However, the land reform was gradually implemented under the later Karmal administration, although the proportion of land area affected by the reform is unclear.\nDuring the civil war, and the ensuing Soviet\u2013Afghan War, most of the country's infrastructure was destroyed, and normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The gross national product (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport were disrupted along with the loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159,7 billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The most dominant form of economic activity was the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounted for 63 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labour force worked in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labour force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had improved in the pre-communist administration of Mohammed Daoud Khan; the surplus decreased and became a deficit by 1982, which reached minus $US70.3 million. The only economic activity that grew substantially during Karmal's rule was export and import.\nNajibullah continued Karmal's economic policies. The augmenting of links with the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union continued, as did bilateral trade. He also encouraged the development of the private sector in industry. The Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan, which was introduced in January 1986, continued until March 1991, one year before the government's fall. According to the plan, the economy, which had grown less than 2 percent annually until 1985, would grow 25 percent under the plan. Industry would grow 28 percent, agriculture 14\u201316 percent, domestic trade by 150 percent and foreign trade by 15 percent. None of these predictions were successful, and economic growth continued at 2%. The 1990 constitution gave attention to the private sector. Article 20 covered the establishment of private firms, and Article 25 encouraged foreign investment in the private sector.\nMilitary.\nCommand and officer corps.\nThe military's chain of command began with the Supreme Commander, who also held the posts of PDPA General Secretary and head of state. The order of precedence continued with the Minister of National Defense, the Deputy Minister of National Defence, Chief of General Staff, Chief of Army Operations, Air and Air Defence Commander and ended with the Chief of Intelligence.\nOf the 8,000 strong officer corps in 1978, between 600 and 800 were communists. An estimated 40 to 45 percent of these officers were educated in the Soviet Union, and of them, between 5 and 10 percent were members of the PDPA or communists. By the time of the Soviet intervention, the officer corps had decreased to 1,100 members. This decrease can be explained by the number of purges centered on the armed forces. The purge of the military began immediately after the PDPA took power. According to Mohammad Ayub Osmani, an officer who defected to the enemy, of the 282 Afghan officers who attended the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy in Moscow, an estimated 126 were executed by the authorities. Most of the officer corps, during the Soviet war and the ensuing civil war, were new recruits. The majority of officers were Khalqists, but after the Parchamites' ascension to power, Khalqists held no position of significance. The Parchamites, who were the minority, held the positions of power. Of the 1,100 large officer corps, only an estimated 200 were party members. According to Abdul Qadir, one-fifth of military personnel were party members, which meant that, if the military stood at 47,000, 9,000 were members of the PDPA. This number was, according to J. Bruce Amtstutz, an exaggeration.\nBranches.\nArmy.\nThe strength of the Afghan Army was greatly weakened during the early stages of PDPA rule. One of the main reasons for the small size was that the Soviet military were afraid the Afghan army would defect \"en masse\" to the enemy if total personnel increased. There were several sympathisers of the mujahideen within the Afghan Armed Forces. Even so, there were several elite units under the command of the Afghan army, such as the 37th, 38th, 444th, 466th, 666th, 84th, 85th Commando Brigades. Additionally, there could have also been a possible 344th Commando Brigade in 1980.\nThe 26th Airborne Battalion was created from the 242nd and 455th Commando Battalions after the Saur Revolution. They were deemed politically unreliable, and on 5 August 1979, they (along with soldiers from the 444th Commando Brigade) initiated a rebellion against the PDPA government, the Bala Hissar uprising. As a result of the rebellion, the 26th Airborne Battalion was transformed into the 37th Commando Brigade. The Commando Brigades were, in contrast, considered reliable and were used as mobile strike forces until they sustained excessive casualties. After sustaining these casualties, the Commando Brigades were turned into battalions. The airborne capabilities of the Afghan commando brigades would cease in 1988, during the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the 666th Commando Brigade would be entirely decimated during the Battle of Khost in 1991.\nIn 1980, the DRA also introduced three special forces battalions, one for each of the army corps. The 203rd Special Purpose Battalion was tied to the 1st Central Army Corps in Kabul, the 213th Special Purpose Battalion was tied to the 2nd Army Corps in Kandahar and the 230th Special Purpose Battalion was tied to the 3rd Army Corps in Gardez.\nMost soldiers were recruited for a three-year term, later extended to four-year terms in 1984. Each year, the Afghan army lost an estimated 15,000 soldiers, 10,000 from desertion and 5,000 from casualties sustained in battle. Everyone between 19 and 39 was eligible for conscription, the only exceptions were certain party members, or party members in certain tasks, Afghans who studied abroad, mostly in the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union, and one-child families or low earners. Unfortunately for the government, most people tried to evade conscription. So the government was forced to send army or police gangs to recruit civilians to service. Even so, some people carried fake papers so they could evade conscription. A side effect of the lack of recruits was that veterans were forced into longer service, or re-recruited. Of the 60 people who graduated from Kabul University in 1982, (few male Afghans attended Kabul University between 1980 and 1983), 15 of them fled to Pakistan or began working for the mujahideen. The army's approach to conscription was carrot-and-stick. This policy was partially successful, and each year the government managed to induce 10,000 to 18,000 into the army. A general amnesty was announced in 1980 to army draft deserters from previous administrations. In 1982, students who served in the military, and graduated 10th grade in high school, would pass 11th and 12th grade and be given a scholarship. People who were conscripted after the 12th grade, could, after military service, attend whichever higher education facility they wanted. To stop army desertions, soldiers were quickly promoted to higher ranks.\nThe army consisted of 14 divisions, of these 11 were infantry and another three were armored, which were part of three military corps. While an infantry division was supposed to be composed of 4,000 to 8,000 men, between 1980 and 1983 a division normally mustered between 2,000 and 2,500. The strength of armored divisions in contrast were maintained, and stood at 4,000. During the Soviet war, the Afghan army used light weapons, and used neglected equipment. During the counter-insurgency, heavy equipment, tanks and artillery were most of the time, but not always, used and fired by Soviet soldiers. A problem faced the Afghan government, and the Soviet military\u2014the degeneration of training for new military recruits; new recruits were being rushed into service, because the Afghan government and the Soviet military feared a total collapse of the government. Western analysts expected the Afghan Army to lose the Battle of Jalalabad, but contrary to their expectations, managed to repel the Mujahideen and Pakistani forces (who had the intention of establishing an interim government in Nangarhar Province by initially blowing up the Jalalabad Dam) and maintain control of the city. In April 1990, the DRA Armed Forces further proved their ability to fight without direct Soviet assistance when they successfully assaulted a fortified complex in Paghman. The Afghan Army, spearheaded by Junbish-i-Mili, the militia led by Abdul Rashid Dostum, were able to clear mujahideen entrenchments with constant assaults and heavy bombardment from the Afghan Air Force and heavy artillery regiments that lasted until June.\nAir Force.\nAs with the army, the majority of officers in the Afghan Air Force were Khalqists, but Parchamites held all the senior positions. Many in the Air Force were given education and training in the Soviet Union. The Air Force had throughout its history always been smaller than the Army. The Afghan Air Force was considered the most loyal element of the Communist regime. Following the Soviet intervention, the Soviets grounded the Air Force. Afghans were not allowed in security zones at Afghan airports by the Soviets. Afghans were generally not allowed to fly the airplanes of the Afghan Air Force, but the Soviets could. Afghan helicopters were assigned to tasks considered non-sensitive by the Soviets, and the majority of Air Force personnel were not told about missions beforehand, because the Soviets were afraid that they would contact the enemy. In Afghan helicopter flights a Soviet adviser was always present, and commanded the Afghan pilot who flew the helicopter.\nAmong the fixed-wing aircraft in use were MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters, Su-7, Su-17, and Su-22 fighter-bombers, IL-28 bombers and An-2, An-24 and An-26 transport aircraft. MI-2, MI-4, MI-8, MI-24 and MI-35 helicopters were used by the Air Force. Other Soviet equipment and weapons were used by the government. The Czech L-39 jet trainers were the only non-Soviet equipment. The IL-28 bombers remained in very limited service, with their roles mostly being replaced by the Su-17 and Su-22 MiG-17s remained grounded by the end of the 1980s with the more modern MiG-21s taking on the mantle.\nParamilitary and Militia forces.\nThe Ministry of Interior Affairs, a Khalqist stronghold, controlled the Sarandoy, or officially, the \"Defenders of the Revolution\", which was a militarized Gendarmerie force. The Ministry of Tribes and Frontiers controlled, until 1983 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence, the frontier troops and the tribal militia. According to the Afghan government, the Sarandoy mustered an estimated 115,000 males at its peak. Those who worked in the Sarandoy were paid 162 dollars a month, a wage which was higher than that of Deputy Minister of National Defence before the Saur Revolution. However, the militia was less disciplined than the regular Afghan Army and were sometimes described as ruthless thugs. KhAD also had their own paramilitary forces and elite units. KhAD ran a program of creating tribal militias. Notable militias include that of General Abdul Jabar Qahraman's Helmand and Paktia militia, General Ismatullah Muslim Achakzai Kandahar Militia and General Abdul Rashid Dostum's Junbish Militia.\nDemographics.\nEducation.\nDuring communist rule, the PDPA government reformed the education system; education was stressed for both sexes, and widespread literacy programmes were set up. By 1988, women made up 40 percent of the doctors and 60 percent of the teachers at Kabul University; 440,000 female students were enrolled in different educational institutions and 80,000 more in literacy programs. In addition to introducing mass literacy campaigns for women and men, the PDPA agenda included: massive land reform program; the abolition of bride price; and raising the marriage age to 16 for girls and to 18 for boys.\nHowever, the mullahs and tribal chiefs in the interiors viewed compulsory education, especially for women, as going against the grain of tradition, as anti-religious, and as a challenge to male authority. This resulted in an increase in shootings of women in Western clothes, killing of PDPA reformers in rural areas, and general harassment of women social workers.\nDespite improvements, a large percentage of the population remained illiterate. Beginning with the Soviet intervention in 1979, successive wars virtually destroyed the nation's education system. Most teachers fled during the wars to neighboring countries.\nRefugees.\nAfghan refugees are Afghan nationals who have fled their country as a result of the ongoing Afghan conflict. An estimated 6 million people have fled the country, most to neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, making it the largest producer of refugees in the world. Many of these refugees would later be the basis for the Taliban movement.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It also ensured that the Protestant minority in France would have a measure of religious and political freedom, and helped to establish France as a more tolerant and pluralistic society. However, the Edict was eventually revoked by King Louis XIV in 1685, leading to a mass exodus of Huguenots from France and a loss of talent and resources for the country.\nIn this edict, Henry aimed primarily to promote civil unity. The edict separated civil from religious unity, treated some Protestants for the first time as more than mere schismatics and heretics and opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering a general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field, even for the state, and to bring grievances directly to the king. It successfully marked the end of the French Wars of Religion, which had afflicted France during the second half of the 16th century.\nThe Edict of St. Germain, promulgated 36 years earlier by Catherine de M\u00e9dici, had granted limited tolerance to Huguenots but was overtaken by events, as it was not formally registered until after the Massacre of Vassy on 1 March 1562, which triggered the first of the French Wars of Religion.\nThe Edict of Fontainebleau, which revoked the Edict of Nantes in October 1685, was promulgated by Louis XIV, the grandson of Henry IV. This act drove an exodus of Protestants and increased the hostility of Protestant nations bordering France.\nBackground.\nThe edict aimed primarily to end the longrunning French Wars of Religion.\nKing Henry IV also had personal reasons for supporting the edict. Prior to assuming the throne in 1589, he had espoused Protestantism, and he remained sympathetic to the Protestant cause. It was widely believed that he converted to Catholicism in 1593 only to secure his position as king. The edict succeeded in restoring peace and internal unity to France but pleased neither party. Catholics rejected the apparent recognition of Protestantism as a permanent element in French society and still hoped to enforce religious uniformity. Protestants aspired to full parity with Catholics, which the edict did not provide. George A. Rothrock wrote : \"Toleration in France was a royal notion, and the religious settlement was dependent upon the continued support of the crown\".\nRe-establishing royal authority in France required internal peace, which was based on limited toleration enforced by the crown. Since royal troops could not be everywhere, Huguenots needed to be granted strictly-limited possibilities of self-defense.\nTerms.\nThe Edict of Nantes that Henry IV signed had four basic texts, including a main text made up of 92 articles that was largely based on unsuccessful peace treaties signed during the recent wars. The edict also included 56 \"particular\" (secret) articles dealing with Protestant rights and obligations. For example, the French state guaranteed protection of French Protestants travelling abroad from the Inquisition. \"This crucifies me\", protested Pope Clement VIII upon hearing of the edict. The last two parts consisted of \"brevets\" (letters patent), which contained the military clauses and pastoral clauses. Both brevets were withdrawn in 1629 by Louis XIII after a final religious civil war.\nThe two letters patent supplementing the edict granted the Protestants safe havens (\"places de s\u00fbret\u00e9\"), which were military strongholds such as La Rochelle, in support of which the king paid 180,000 \u00e9cus a year, along with a further 150 emergency forts (\"places de refuge\"), to be maintained at the Huguenots' own expense. Such an act of toleration was unusual in Western Europe, where standard practice forced subjects to follow the religion of their ruler under the application of the principle of \"cuius regio, eius religio\".\nThe edict granted religious toleration to the Protestant Huguenots, who had been waging a long and bloody struggle for their rights in France. The main contents were:\nThe edict also upheld Catholicism's position as the established religion of France. Protestants gained no exemption from paying the tithe and had to respect Catholic holidays and restrictions regarding marriage. The authorities limited Protestant freedom of worship to specified geographic areas. The edict dealt only with Protestant and Catholic coexistence and made no mention of Jews or Muslims, who were offered temporary asylum in France when the Marranos and Moriscos were expelled from Spain.\nThe original document that promulgated the edict has disappeared. The \"Archives Nationales\" in Paris preserves only the text of a shorter document modified by concessions extracted from the King by the clergy and the Parlement of Paris, which delayed ten months before finally signing and setting seals to the document in 1599. A copy of the first edict, sent for safekeeping to the Protestant Geneva, survives. The provincial parlements resisted the edict. The most recalcitrant of them was the Parlement of Rouen, which unreservedly registered the edict only in 1609.\nThe location of the signing is uncertain. The edict itself stated merely that it was \"given at Nantes, in the month of April, in the year of Our Lord one thousand five hundred and ninety-eight\". By the late 19th century the Catholic tradition cited the signing in the Maison des Tourelles, the home of the prosperous Spanish trader Andr\u00e9 Ruiz, which was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War.\nRevocation.\nThe Edict remained unaltered in effect, registered by the \"parlements\" as \"fundamental and irrevocable law\", with the exception of the \"brevets,\" which had been granted for a period of eight years, and were renewed by Henry in 1606 and in 1611 by Marie de' Medicis, who confirmed the Edict within a week of the assassination of Henry, stilling Protestant fears of another St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. The subsidies had been reduced by degrees, as Henry gained more control of the nation. By the Peace of Montpellier in 1622, concluding a Huguenot revolt in Languedoc, the fortified Protestant towns were reduced to two, La Rochelle and Montauban. The \"brevets\" were entirely withdrawn in 1629, by Louis XIII, following the Siege of La Rochelle, in which Cardinal Richelieu blockaded the city for fourteen months.\nDuring the remainder of Louis XIII's reign, and especially during the minority of Louis XIV, the implementation of the Edict varied year by year, voiced in declarations and orders, and in case decisions in the Council, fluctuating according to the tides of domestic politics and the relations of France with powers abroad.\nIn October 1685, Louis XIV, the grandson of Henry IV, renounced the Edict and declared Protestantism illegal with the Edict of Fontainebleau. This act, commonly called the \"'revocation of the Edict of Nantes\",' had very damaging results for France. While the wars of religion did not re-ignite, intense persecution of Protestants took place. All Protestant ministers were given two weeks to leave the country unless they converted to Catholicism and all other Protestants were prohibited from leaving the country. In spite of the prohibition, the renewed persecution \u2013 including many examples of torture \u2013 caused as many as 400,000 to flee France at risk of their lives. Most moved to Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic, Switzerland, South Africa and the new French colonies and the Thirteen Colonies in North America. Some moved to Denmark, where the city of Fredericia, laid waste after the Swedish conquest in 1656, needed new settlers and a specific clause in the city ordinance allowed Protestants other than Lutheran to live in the city. This exodus deprived France of many of its most skilled and industrious individuals, some of whom thereafter aided France's rivals in the Netherlands and in England. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes also further damaged the perception of Louis XIV abroad, making the Protestant nations bordering France more hostile to his regime. Upon the revocation of the edict, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg issued the Edict of Potsdam, which encouraged Protestants to come to Brandenburg-Prussia.\nFreedom to worship and civil rights for non-Catholics in France were not restored until the signing of the Edict of Versailles, also known as the Edict of Tolerance, by Louis XVI 102 years later, on 7 November 1787. This edict was enacted by parlement two months later, less than two years before the end of the Ancien R\u00e9gime and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789 would fully eliminate religious discrimination in France.\nTranslation of selected passages.\nThese are the principal and most salient provisions of the edict as promulgated in Nantes, Brittany, probably on 30 April 1598:\n&lt;poem&gt;Henri, by the grace of God king of France and of Navarre, to all to whom these presents come, greeting:\nAmong the infinite benefits which it has pleased God to heap upon us, the most signal and precious is his granting us the strength and ability to withstand the fearful disorders and troubles which prevailed on our advent in this kingdom. The realm was so torn by innumerable factions and sects that the most legitimate of all the parties was fewest in numbers. God has given us strength to stand out against this storm; we have finally surmounted the waves and made our port of safety,\u2014peace for our state. For which his be the glory all in all, and ours a free recognition of his grace in making use of our instrumentality in the good work... We implore and await from the Divine Goodness the same protection and favor which he has ever granted to this kingdom from the beginning...\nWe have, by this perpetual and irrevocable edict, established and proclaimed and do establish and proclaim:\nI. First, that the recollection of everything done by one party or the other between March, 1585, and our accession to the crown, and during all the preceding period of troubles, remain obliterated and forgotten, as if no such things had ever happened...\nIII. We ordain that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion shall be restored and re\u00ebstablished in all places and localities of this our kingdom and countries subject to our sway, where the exercise of the same has been interrupted, in order that it may be peaceably and freely exercised, without any trouble or hindrance; forbidding very expressly all persons, of whatsoever estate, quality, or condition, from troubling, molesting, or disturbing ecclesiastics in the celebration of divine service, in the enjoyment or collection of tithes, fruits, or revenues of their benefices, and all other rights and dues belonging to them; and that all those who during the troubles have taken possession of churches, houses, goods or revenues, belonging to the said ecclesiastics, shall surrender to them entire possession and peaceable enjoyment of such rights, liberties, and sureties as they had before they were deprived of them...\nVI. And in order to leave no occasion for troubles or differences between our subjects, we have permitted, and herewith permit, those of the said religion called Reformed to live and abide in all the cities and places of this our kingdom and countries of our sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences, ... upon condition that they comport themselves in other respects according to that which is contained in this our present edict.\nVII. It is permitted to all lords, gentlemen, and other persons making profession of the said religion called Reformed, holding the right of high justice [or a certain feudal tenure], to exercise the said religion in their houses...\nIX. We also permit those of the said religion to make and continue the exercise of the same in all villages and places of our dominion where it was established by them and publicly enjoyed several and divers times in the year 1597, up to the end of the month of August, notwithstanding all decrees and judgments to the contrary...\nXIII. We very expressly forbid to all those of the said religion its exercise, either in respect to ministry, regulation, discipline, or the public instruction of children, or otherwise, in this our kingdom and lands of our dominion, otherwise than in the places permitted and granted by the present edict.\nXIV. It is forbidden as well to perform any function of the said religion in our court or retinue, or in our lands and territories beyond the mountains, or in our city of Paris, or within five leagues of the said city...\nXVIII. We also forbid all our subjects, of whatever quality and condition, from carrying off by force or persuasion, against the will of their parents, the children of the said religion, in order to cause them to be baptized or confirmed in the Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church; and the same is forbidden to those of the said religion called Reformed, upon penalty of being punished with especial severity...\nXXI. Books concerning the said religion called Reformed may not be printed and publicly sold, except in cities and places where the public exercise of the said religion is permitted.\nXXII. We ordain that there shall be no difference or distinction made in respect to the said religion, in receiving pupils to be instructed in universities, colleges, and schools; nor in receiving the sick and poor into hospitals, retreats, and public charities.&lt;/poem&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nThe source followed by most modern historians is the Huguenot refugee \u00c9lie Benoist's \"Histoire de l'\u00e9dit de Nantes\", 3 vols.

The parasites are transmitted by sandflies of the genus \"Phlebotomus\" in the Old World, and of the genus \"Lutzomyia\" in the New World. There are 53 species and about 20 of them are responsible for human infections. They are transmitted by around 100 species of sandflies. The primary hosts are vertebrates. They commonly infect hyraxes, canids, rodents, and humans.\nHistory.\nMembers of an ancient genus of \"Leishmania\"-like parasites, \"Paleoleishmania\", have been detected in fossilized sand flies dating back to the early Cretaceous period. The first written reference to the conspicuous symptoms of cutaneous leishmaniasis surfaced in the Paleotropics within oriental texts dating back to the 7th century BC (allegedly transcribed from sources several hundred years older, between 1500 and 2000 BC). Due to its broad and persistent prevalence throughout antiquity as a mysterious disease of diverse symptomatic outcomes, leishmaniasis has been dubbed with various names ranging from \"white leprosy\" to \"black fever\". Some of these names suggest links to negative cultural beliefs or mythology, which still feed into the social stigmatization of leishmaniasis today.\nIn India, both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis are caused by \"Leishmania donovani\". The first records of cutaneous leishmaniasis in India were from British medical officers in the early 19th century. The disease was by then known as \"oriental sore\" or \"Delhi boil\"; while the visceral form was variously called \"Burdwan [after the city Burdwan] fever\", \"kala azar\" (black fever), or \"Dumdum [a city in West Bengal] fever\".\nThe causative parasite for the disease was identified in 1901 as a concurrent finding by William Boog Leishman and Charles Donovan. They independently visualised microscopic single-celled parasites (later called Leishman-Donovan bodies) living within the cells of infected human organs. The parasitic genus would later be classed as trypanosomatid protozoans under the phylogenetic designation, \"Leishmania donovani\". Several species have since been classified and grouped under two major subgenera i.e. \"Leishmania Viannia\" (generally located in the Neotropics) or \"Leishmania Leishmania\" (generally located in the Paleotropics, with the major exception of the \"L. mexicana\" subgroup).\nEpidemiology.\n\"Leishmania\" currently affects 6 million people in 98 countries. About 0.9\u20131.6 million new cases occur each year, and 21 species are known to cause disease in humans: it is considered a zoonosis.\nStructure.\n\"Leishmania\" species are unicellular eukaryotes having a well-defined nucleus and other cell organelles including kinetoplasts and flagella. Depending on the stage of their life cycle, they exist in two structural variants, as: \nEvolution.\nThe details of the evolution of this genus are debated, but \"Leishmania\" apparently evolved from an ancestral trypanosome lineage. The oldest lineage is that of the Bodonidae, followed by \"Trypanosoma brucei\", the latter being confined to the African continent. \"Trypanosoma cruzi\" groups with trypanosomes from bats, South American mammals, and kangaroos suggest an origin in the Southern Hemisphere. These clades are only distantly related.\nThe remaining clades in this tree are \"Blastocrithidia\", \"Herpetomonas\", and \"Phytomonas\". The four genera \"Leptomonas\", \"Crithidia\", \"Leishmania\", and \"Endotrypanum\" form the terminal branches, suggesting a relatively recent origin. Several of these genera may be polyphyletic and may need further division.\nThe origins of genus \"Leishmania\" itself are unclear. One theory proposes an African origin, with migration to the Americas. Another proposes migration from the Americas to the Old World via the Bering Strait land bridge around 15 million years ago. A third theory proposes a Palearctic origin. Such migrations would entail subsequent migration of vector and reservoir or successive adaptations along the way. A more recent migration is that of \"L. infantum\" from Mediterranean countries to Latin America (known as \"L. chagasi\"), since European colonization of the New World, where the parasites picked up their current New World vectors in their respective ecosystems. This is the cause of the epidemics now evident. One recent New World epidemic concerns foxhounds in the USA.\nAlthough it was suggested that \"Leishmania\" might have evolved in the Neotropics, this is probably true for species belonging to the subgenera \"Viannia\" and \"Endotrypanum\". However, there is evidence that the primary evolution of the subgenera \"Leishmania\" and \"Sauroleishmania\" is the Old World. While the \"Mundinia\" species appear to be more universal in their evolution. One theory is that different lineages became isolated geographically during different periods and it is this that gave rise to this evolutionary mosaicism. But there is no doubt that the Leishmaniinae are a monophyletic group.\nA large data set analysis suggests that \"Leishmania\" evolved 90 to 100 million years ago in Gondwana. The reptile infecting species originated in mammalian clades.\n\"Sauroleishmania\" species were originally defined on the basis that they infected reptiles (lizards) rather than mammals. Based on molecular evidences, they have been moved to subgenus status within \"Leishmania\". This subgenus probably evolved from a group that originally infected mammals.\nTaxonomy.\n53 species are recognised in this genus. The status of several of these is disputed, so the final number may differ. At least 20 species infect humans. To make things more complex, hybrids might be involved, as it has been reported in Brazil with a hybrid between \"Leishmania (V.) guyanensis\" and \"Leishmania (V.) shawi shawi\".\nThe genus is presently divided into 4 subgenera: \"Leishmania\", \"Sauroleishmania\", \"Mundinia\" and \"Viannia\". The division into the two subgenera (\"Leishmania\" and \"Viannia\") was made by Lainson and Shaw in 1987 on the basis of their location within the insect gut. The species in the \"Viannia\" subgenus develop in the hind gut: \"L. (V.) braziliensis\" has been proposed as the type species for this subgenus. This division has been confirmed by all subsequent studies. Shaw, Camargo and Teixeira created the subgenus \"Mundinia\" while revising Leishmaniinae in 2016.\n\"Endotrypanum\" is closely related to \"Leishmania\". Some \"Endotypanum\" species are unique in that they infect the erythrocytes of their hosts (sloths). All species are confined to Central and South America. \"E. colombiensis\" infections have been found in man.\n\"Sauroleishmania\" was originally described by Ranquein 1973 as a separate genus, but molecular studies suggest this is actually a subgenus rather than a separate genus.\nThe proposed division of the \"Leishmania\" into \"Euleishmania\" and \"Paraleishmania\" groups in 2000 emphasized the deep phylogenic distance between parasites, some of which had been named as \"Leishmania\" species. The \"Euleishmania\" included species currently placed in the subgenera \"Leishmania\", \"Sauroleishmania\", \"Mundinia\" and \"Viannia\". The proposed \"Paraleishmania\" included species of \"Endotypanum,\" \"Leishmamnia\"-\"L. colomubensis\", \"L. herreri\", \"L. hertigi\"and \"L. deanei\" and \"L. equatorensis\". In a recent revision these species were given different generic status.\nFour subgenera of \"Leishmania\" are now recognised - \"Leishmania\", \"Sauroleishmania\", \"Viannia\" and \"Mundinia\" (the \"L. enriettii\" complex). The genus \"Endotrypanum\" and \"Porcisia\" belong to the \"Paraleishmania\".\nThere are four \"Mundinia\" species - \"L. (Mundinia) enriettii\", \"L. (Mundinia) martiniquensis\", \"L. (Mundinia) macropodum\", and \"L. (Mundinia) orientalis,\" which is found in Thailand.\n\"L. archibaldi\"'s specific status is unsettled but it is closely related to \"L. donovani\".\n\"L. herreri\" belongs to the genus \"Endotypanum\" rather than to \"Leishmania\".\n\"L. donovani\" and \"L. infantum\" are closely related.\nNotes.\nThe selenoenzyme \"Seltryp\" appears to be unique to this order. It has been removed from the subgenus \"Viannia\".\n\"L. deanei\" and \"L. hertigi\", both of which infect porcupines have been moved to the genus \"Porcisia.\"\nClassification.\nSubgenus Leishmania Ross, 1903 sensu Saf'janova, 1982\nSubgenus Mundinia Shaw,Camargo and Teixeira 2016\nSubgenus Sauroleishmania Ranque, 1973 sensu Saf'janova, 1982\n\u2191 Species described as \"Sauroleishmania\". Their development is not like other members of the subgenus and so their taxonomic position is doubtful.\nSubgenus Viannia Lainson &amp; Shaw 1987\nRelated genera.\nThe relationships between \"Leishmania\" and other genera such as \"Endotrypanum\", \"Novymonas\", \"Porcisia\", and \"Zelonia\" is presently unclear as they are closely related. \"Endotrypanum colombiensis\", formerly known as \"Leishmania colombiensis,\" has been associated with both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Venezuela.\nGenus Endotrypanum\nGenus Novymonas Kostygov and Yurchenko 2016 \nGenus Porcisia Shaw, Camargo and Teixeira, 2016\nGenus Zelonia Shaw, Camargo and Teixeira, 2016\nBiochemistry and cell biology.\nThe biochemistry and cell biology of \"Leishmania\" is similar to that of other kinetoplastids. They share the same main morphological features: a single flagellum which has an invagination - the flagellar pocket - at its base; a kinetoplast, which is found in the single mitochondrion; and a subpelicular array of microtubules, which make up the main part of the cytoskeleton.\nLipophosphoglycan coat.\n\"Leishmania\" possesses a lipophosphoglycan coat over the outside of the cell. Lipophosphoglycan is a trigger for toll-like receptor 2, a signalling receptor involved in triggering an innate immune response in mammals.\nThe precise structure of lipophosphoglycan varies depending on the species and lifecycle stage of the parasite. The glycan component is particularly variable and different lipophosphoglycan variants can be used as a molecular marker for different lifecycle stages. Lectins, a group of proteins which bind different glycans, are often used to detect these lipophosphoglycan variants. For example, peanut agglutinin binds a particular lipophosphoglycan found on the surface of the infective form of \"L. major\".\nLipophosphoglycan is used by the parasite to promote its survival in the host and the mechanisms by which the parasite does this center around modulating the immune response of the host. This is vital, as the \"Leishmania\" parasites live within macrophages and need to prevent the macrophages from killing them. Lipophosphoglycan has a role in resisting the complement system, inhibiting the oxidative burst response, inducing an inflammation response and preventing natural killer T cells recognising that the macrophage is infected with the \"Leishmania\" parasite.\nIntracellular mechanism of infection.\nIn order to avoid destruction by the immune system and thrive, the \"Leishmania\" 'hides' inside its host's cells. This location enables it to avoid the action of the humoral immune response (because the pathogen is safely inside a cell and outside the open bloodstream), and furthermore it may prevent the immune system from destroying its host through nondanger surface signals which discourage apoptosis. The primary cell types \"Leishmania\" infiltrates are phagocytotic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages.\nUsually, a phagocytotic immune cell like a macrophage will ingest a pathogen within an enclosed endosome and then fill this endosome with enzymes which digest the pathogen. However, in the case of \"Leishmania\", these enzymes have no effect, allowing the parasite to multiply rapidly. This uninhibited growth of parasites eventually overwhelms the host macrophage or other immune cell, causing it to die.\nTransmitted by the sandfly, the protozoan parasites of \"L. major\" may switch the strategy of the first immune defense from eating/inflammation/killing to eating/no inflammation/no killing of their host phagocyte and corrupt it for their own benefit. They use the willingly phagocytosing polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs) rigorously as a tricky hideout, where they proliferate unrecognized from the immune system and enter the long-lived macrophages to establish a \"hidden\" infection.\nUptake and survival.\nUpon microbial infection, PMNs move out from the bloodstream through the vessels' endothelial layer, to the site of the infected tissue (dermal tissue after fly bite). They immediately initiate the first immune response and phagocytize the invader by recognition of foreign and activating surfaces on the parasite. Activated PMN secrete chemokines, IL-8 particularly, to attract further granulocytes and stimulate phagocytosis. Further, \"L. major\" increases the secretion of IL-8 by PMNs. This mechanism is observed during infection with other obligate intracellular parasites, as well. For microbes like these, multiple intracellular survival mechanisms exist. Surprisingly, the coinjection of apoptotic and viable pathogens causes by far a more fulminate course of disease than injection of only viable parasites. When the anti-inflammatory signal phosphatidylserine usually found on apoptotic cells, is exposed on the surface of dead parasites, \"L. major\" switches off the oxidative burst, thereby preventing killing and degradation of the viable pathogen.\nIn the case of \"Leishmania\", progeny are not generated in PMNs, but in this way they can survive and persist untangled in the primary site of infection. The promastigote forms also release \"Leishmania\" chemotactic factor (LCF) to actively recruit neutrophils, but not other leukocytes, for instance monocytes or NK cells. In addition to that, the production of interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3)-inducible protein 10 (IP10) by PMNs is blocked in attendance of \"Leishmania\", what involves the shut down of inflammatory and protective immune response by NK and Th1 cell recruitment. The pathogens stay viable during phagocytosis since their primary hosts, the PMNs, expose apoptotic cell-associated molecular pattern (ACAMP) signaling \"no pathogen\".\nPersistency and attraction.\nThe lifespan of neutrophil granulocytes is quite short. They circulate in bloodstream for about 6 to 10 hours after leaving bone marrow, whereupon they undergo spontaneous apoptosis. Microbial pathogens have been reported to influence cellular apoptosis by different strategies. Obviously because of the inhibition of caspase3-activation, \"L. major\" can induce the delay of neutrophils apoptosis and extend their lifespan for at least 2\u20133 days. The fact of extended lifespan is very beneficial for the development of infection because the final host cells for these parasites are macrophages, which normally migrate to the sites of infection within two or three days. The pathogens are not dronish; instead they take over the command at the primary site of infection. They induce the production by PMNs of the chemokines MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 (macrophage inflammatory protein) to recruit macrophages.\nAn important factor in prolonging infection is the inhibition of the adaptive immune system. This occurs especially during the intercellular phases, when amastigotes search for new macrophages to infect and are more susceptible to immune responses. Nearly all types of phagocytes are targeted. For example, mincle has been shown to be targeted by \"L. major\". Interaction between mincle and a protein released by the parasite results in a weakened immune response in dendritic cells.\nSilent phagocytosis theory.\nTo save the integrity of the surrounding tissue from the toxic cell components and proteolytic enzymes contained in neutrophils, the apoptotic PMNs are silently cleared by macrophages. Dying PMNs expose the \"eat me\"-signal phosphatidylserine which is transferred to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis. By reason of delayed apoptosis, the parasites that persist in PMNs are taken up into macrophages, employing an absolutely physiological and nonphlogistic process. The strategy of this \"silent phagocytosis\" has the following advantages for the parasite:\nHowever, studies have shown this is unlikely, as the pathogens are seen to leave apoptotic cells and no evidence is known of macrophage uptake by this method.\nMolecular biology.\nAn important aspect of the \"Leishmania\" protozoan is its glycoconjugate layer of lipophosphoglycan (LPG). This is held together with a phosphoinositide membrane anchor, and has a tripartite structure consisting of a lipid domain, a neutral hexasaccharide, and a phosphorylated galactose-mannose, with a termination in a neutral cap. Not only do these parasites develop postphlebotomus digestion, but it is also thought to be essential to oxidative bursts, thus allowing passage for infection. Characteristics of intracellular digestion include an endosome fusing with a lysosome, releasing acid hydrolases which degrade DNA, RNA, proteins and carbohydrates.\nGenomics.\nThe genomes of four \"Leishmania\" species (\"L. major\", \"L. infantum\", \"L. donovani\" and \"L. braziliensis\") have been sequenced, revealing more than 8300 protein-coding and 900 RNA genes. Almost 40% of protein-coding genes fall into 662 families containing between two and 500 members. Most of the smaller gene families are tandem arrays of one to three genes, while the larger gene families are often dispersed in tandem arrays at different loci throughout the genome. Each of the 35 or 36 chromosomes is organized into a small number of gene clusters of tens-to-hundreds of genes on the same DNA strand. These clusters can be organized in head-to-head (divergent) or tail-to-tail (convergent) fashion, with the latter often separated by tRNA, rRNA and/or snRNA genes. Transcription of protein-coding genes initiates bidirectionally in the divergent strand-switch regions between gene clusters and extends polycistronically through each gene cluster before terminating in the strand-switch region separating convergent clusters. \"Leishmania\" telomeres are usually relatively small, consisting of a few different types of repeat sequence. Evidence can be found for recombination between several different groups of telomeres. The \"L. major\" and \"L. infantum\" genomes contain only about 50 copies of inactive degenerated \"Ingi\"/L1Tc-related elements (DIREs), while \"L. braziliensis\" also contains several telomere-associated transposable elements and spliced leader-associated retroelements. The \"Leishmania\" genomes share a conserved core proteome of about 6200 genes with the related trypanosomatids \"Trypanosoma brucei\" and \"Trypanosoma cruzi\", but around 1000 \"Leishmania\"-specific genes are known, which are mostly randomly distributed throughout the genome. Relatively few (about 200) species-specific differences in gene content exist between the three sequenced \"Leishmania\" genomes, but about 8% of the genes appear to be evolving at different rates between the three species, indicative of different selective pressures that could be related to disease pathology. About 65% of protein-coding genes currently lack functional assignment.\n\"Leishmania\" species produce several different heat shock proteins. These include Hsp83, a homolog of Hsp90. A regulatory element in the 3' UTR of Hsp83 controls translation of Hsp83 in a temperature-sensitive manner. This region forms a stable RNA structure which melts at higher temperatures.\nGenomic instability.\n\"Leishmania\" lacks of promoter-dependent regulation, so its genomic regulation is at post-transcriptional level through copy number variations (CNV) of transcripts, a mechanism capable of controlling the abundance of these transcripts according to the situation in which the organism finds itself. These processes cause a great susceptibility to genomic instability in the parasite. This involves epistatic interactions between genes, which drive these changes in gene expression, leading to compensatory mechanisms in the \"Leishmania\" genome that result in the adaptive evolution of the parasite.\nDuring the research carried out by Giovanni Bussotti and collaborators at the Pasteur Institute, belonging to the University of Paris, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of \"Leishmania donovani\" identified CNVs in 14% of the coding regions and in 4% of the non-coding regions. In addition, an experimental evolution study (EE Approach) was performed on L. donovani amastigotes obtained from clinical cases of hamsters. By extracting these amastigotes from infected organisms and culturing them in vitro for 36 weeks (3800 generations), it was demonstrated how genomic instability in this parasite is capable of adapting to complicated situations, such as in vitro culture.\nAn 11kb deletion was detected in the gene coding for Ld1S_360735700, a NIMA-related kinase with key functions in the correct progression of mitosis. With the advancement of in vitro culture generations the loss of the kinase becomes more notorious, decreasing growth rate of the parasite, but the genomic instability of Leishmania manages, through compensatory mechanisms, to attenuate this reduction in growth so that the in vitro culture is maintained. First, as an adaptation of the culture to the loss of this kinase, it was detected an increase in the expression of another orthologous kinase (Ld1S_360735800) whose coding region is adjacent to that of the lost kinase. Secondly, a reduction in the expression of 23 transcripts related to flagellar biogenesis was observed. So adaptation in Leishmania leads the parasite to eliminate flagellar movement from its needs, since it is not necessary in in vitro culture, preserving the energy invested in this movement to increase the growth rate and compensating the loss of the kinase.\nFinally, coamplification of ribosomal protein clusters, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and nucleolar small RNA (snoRNA) was observed. Increased expression of these clusters leads to increased ribosomal biogenesis and protein biosynthesis. This is most evident in the case of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA), for which amplification of a large cluster of 15 snoRNAs was observed on chromosome 33. The function of these nucleic acids is methylation and inclusion of pseudouridine in ribosomes. In this case, an increase in these modifications was observed in the large subunits of the ribosomes of individuals in culture, specifically in the PTC (peptidyl transferase center) and in the mRNA entry tunnel to the ribosome for protein synthesis. These changes lead to an increase in ribosomal biogenesis, resulting in increased protein synthesis and growth rate.\nIn conclusion, the loss of the kinase is compensated by the genomic instability of \"Leishmania donovani\" by increasing the expression of another orthologous kinase, decreasing flagellar biogenesis and increasing ribosomal biogenesis. These compensations result in the growth rate of the culture being as less affected as possible by the initial loss of the kinase, and the parasite is perfectly adapted to the in vitro culture, which is not its natural habitat.\nSexual reproduction.\nA microbial pathogen's reproductive system is one of the basic biologic processes that condition the microorganism's ecology and disease spread. In 2009 Akopyants et al. demonstrated that \"L. major\" has a sexual cycle, including a meiotic process. Hybrid progeny are formed that have full genomic complements from both parents. Mating only occurs in the sand fly vector, and hybrids can be transmitted to the mammalian host by sand fly bite. In \"L. braziliensis\" matings in nature are predominantly between related individuals resulting in extreme inbreeding. The rate of outcrossing between different strains of \"Leishmania\" in the sand fly vector depends on the frequency of co-infection. Such outcrossing events appear to be rare in \"L. major\" and \"L. donovani\".\n\"L. infantum\" produces proteins BRCA1 and RAD51 that interact with each other to promote homologous recombinational repair. These proteins play a key role in meiosis. Thus, meiotic events provide the adaptive advantage of efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages even when they do not lead to outcrossing\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its close relatives include the onion, shallot, leek, chives, Welsh onion, and Chinese onion. Garlic is native to central and south Asia, stretching from the Black Sea through the southern Caucasus, northeastern Iran, and the Hindu Kush; it also grows wild in parts of Mediterranean Europe. There are two subspecies and hundreds of varieties of garlic.\nGarlic has been used for thousands of years as a seasoning, culinary ingredient, and traditional medical remedy. It was known in many ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians, Egyptians, Jews, Romans, and Chinese, and remains significant in many cuisines and folk treatments, especially across the Mediterranean and Asia. Garlic propagates in a variety of climates and conditions and is produced globally; China is by far the largest producer, accounting for over two thirds (73%) of the world's supply in 2021.\nDescription.\nGarlic is a perennial flowering plant that is native to Central Asia, South Asia and northeastern Iran. It grows from a bulb, with a tall, erect flowering stem that reaches up to . The leaf blade is flat, linear, solid, and approximately wide, with an acute apex. The plant may produce pink to purple flowers from July to September in the Northern Hemisphere. The bulb has a strong odor and is typically made up of 10 to 20 cloves. The cloves close to the center are symmetrical, and those surrounding the center can be asymmetrical. Each clove is enclosed in an inner sheathing leaf surrounded by layers of outer sheathing leaves. If garlic is planted at the proper time and depth, it can be grown as far north as Alaska. It produces hermaphroditic flowers. It is pollinated by butterflies, moths, and other insects.\nChemistry.\nFresh or crushed garlic yields the sulfur-containing compounds allicin, ajoene, diallyl polysulfides, vinyldithiins, and \"S\"-allylcysteine, as well as enzymes, saponins, flavonoids, and Maillard reaction products when cooked, which are not sulfur-containing compounds.\nThe phytochemicals responsible for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol). The resultant compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time.\nAmong alliums, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or leeks. Although many humans enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant.\nA large number of sulfur compounds contribute to the smell and taste of garlic. Allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the \"hot\" sensation of raw garlic. This chemical opens thermo-transient receptor potential channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness. Allicin, along with its decomposition products diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic, with other allicin-derived compounds, such as vinyldithiins and ajoene.\nTaxonomy.\nIdentification of the wild progenitor of common garlic is difficult due to the sterility of its many cultivars, which limits the ability to cross test with wild relatives. Genetically and morphologically, garlic is most similar to the wild species \"Allium longicuspis\", which grows in central and southwestern Asia. However, because \"A. longicuspis\" is also mostly sterile, it is doubtful that it is the ancestor of \"A. sativum\". Other candidates that have been suggested include \"A. tuncelianum\", \"A. macrochaetum\", and \"A. truncatum\", all of which are native to the Middle East.\n\"Allium sativum\" grows in the wild in areas where it has become naturalized. The \"wild garlic\", \"crow garlic\", and \"field garlic\" of Britain are members of the species \"A. ursinum\", \"A. vineale\", and \"A. oleraceum\", respectively. In North America, \"A. vineale\" (known as \"wild garlic\" or \"crow garlic\") and \"Allium canadense\" (known as \"meadow garlic\", \"wild garlic\", or \"wild onion\") are common weeds in fields. So-called elephant garlic is actually a wild leek (\"A. ampeloprasum\") and not a true garlic. Single clove garlic (also called pearl or solo garlic) originated in the Yunnan province of China.\nSubspecies and varieties.\nThere are two subspecies of \"A. sativum\", ten major groups of varieties, and hundreds of varieties, or cultivars.\nThere are at least 120 cultivars originating from Central Asia, making it the main center of garlic biodiversity.\nSome garlics have protected status in the UK and the EU, including:\nEtymology.\nThe word \"garlic\" derives from Old English, \"garl\u0113ac\", meaning \"gar\" (spear) and leek, as a 'spear-shaped leek'.\nEcology.\nGarlic plants are usually hardy and not affected by many pests or diseases. Garlic plants are said to repel rabbits and moles. The California Department of Food and Agriculture conducts a certification program to assure freedom from nematode and white rot disease caused by \"Stromatinia cepivora\", two pathogens that can both destroy a crop and remain in the soil indefinitely once introduced. Garlic may also suffer from pink root, a typically non-fatal disease that stunts the roots and turns them pink or red; or leek rust, which usually appears as bright orange spots. The larvae of the leek moth attack garlic by mining into the leaves or bulbs.\nBotrytis neck and bulb rot is a disease of onion, garlic, leek and shallot. \"Botrytis allii\" and \"Botrytis aclada\" cause this disease in onion and \"Botrytis porri\" causes it in garlic. According to the University of California,Initial symptoms usually begin at the neck, where affected tissue softens, becomes water-soaked, and turns brown. In a humid atmosphere, a gray and feltlike growth (where spores are produced) appears on rotting scales, and mycelia may develop between scales. Dark-brown-to-black sclerotia (the resting bodies of the pathogen) may eventually develop in the neck or between scales.\nCultivation.\nGarlic is easy to cultivate and may grow year-round in mild climates. While sexual propagation of garlic is possible, nearly all of the garlic in cultivation is propagated asexually by planting individual cloves in the ground. \nIn colder climates, cloves are best planted about six weeks before the soil freezes. The goal is to have the bulbs produce only roots and no shoots above the ground.\nHarvest is in late spring or early summer.\nGarlic plants can be grown closely together, leaving enough space for the bulbs to mature, and are easily grown in containers of sufficient depth. Garlic does well in loose, dry, well-drained soils in sunny locations, and is hardy throughout USDA climate zones 4\u20139. When selecting garlic for planting, it is important to pick large bulbs from which to separate cloves. Large cloves, along with proper spacing in the planting bed, will also increase bulb size. Garlic plants prefer to grow in a soil with a high organic material content, but are capable of growing in a wide range of soil conditions and pH levels.\nThere are different varieties of garlic, most notably split into the subspecies of hardneck garlic and softneck garlic. The latitude where the garlic is grown affects the choice of type, as garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hardneck garlic is generally grown in cooler climates and produces relatively large cloves, whereas softneck garlic is generally grown closer to the equator and produces small, tightly packed cloves.\nGarlic scapes are removed to focus all the garlic's energy into bulb growth. The scapes can be eaten raw or cooked.\nPropagation.\nThe method of propagating garlic from planting cloves is called division. Asexual propagation of garlic for production purposes requires cool temperatures that can vary depending on the cultivar. Hardneck varieties require long cold temperature exposure whereas softneck varieties thrive in milder climates. This cold climate is required for the process of vernalization, a form of stratification of the cloves necessary for the development of multiple-clove bulbs. Solo garlic is the result of garlic grown without the process of vernalization.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2023, world production of garlic was 29 million tonnes, with China accounting for 72% of the total (table).\nAdverse effects and toxicology.\nThe scent of garlic is known to linger upon the human body and cause bad breath (halitosis) and body odor. This is caused by allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). AMS is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds; from the blood it travels to the lungs (and from there to the mouth, causing garlic breath) and skin, where it is exuded through skin pores. Since digestion takes several hours, and release of AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time. Washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell. Studies have shown sipping milk at the same time as consuming garlic can significantly neutralize bad breath. Mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than drinking milk afterward. Plain water, mushrooms, and basil may also reduce the odor; the mix of fat and water found in milk, however, was the most effective. Garlic breath is allegedly alleviated by eating fresh parsley.\nAbundant sulfur compounds in garlic are also responsible for turning garlic green or blue during pickling and cooking. Under these conditions (\"i.e.\", acidity, heat) the sulfur-containing compound alliin reacts with common amino acids to make pyrroles, clusters of carbon-nitrogen rings. These rings can be linked together into polypyrrole molecules. Ring structures absorb particular wavelengths of light and thus appear colored. The two-pyrrole molecule looks red, the three-pyrrole molecule looks blue, and the four-pyrrole molecule looks green (like chlorophyll, a tetrapyrrole). Like chlorophyll, the pyrrole pigments are safe to eat. Upon cutting, similar to a color change in onion caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds, garlic can turn green.\nThe green, dry \"folds\" in the center of the garlic clove are especially pungent. The sulfur compound allicin, produced by crushing or chewing fresh garlic, produces other sulfur compounds: ajoene, allyl polysulfides, and vinyldithiins. Aged garlic lacks allicin, but may have some activity due to the presence of S-allylcysteine.\nSome people suffer from allergies to garlic and other species of \"Allium\". Symptoms can include irritable bowel, diarrhea, mouth and throat ulcerations, nausea, breathing difficulties, and, in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Garlic-sensitive people show positive tests to diallyl disulfide, allylpropyldisulfide, allylmercaptan, and allicin, all of which are present in garlic. People who suffer from garlic allergies are often sensitive to many other plants, including onions, chives, leeks, shallots, garden lilies, ginger, and bananas.\nSeveral reports of serious burns resulting from garlic being applied topically for various purposes, including naturopathic uses and acne treatment, indicate care must be taken for these uses, usually testing a small area of skin using a low concentration of garlic. On the basis of numerous reports of such burns, including burns to children, topical use of raw garlic, as well as insertion of raw garlic into body cavities, is discouraged. In particular, topical application of raw garlic to young children is not advisable.\nThe side effects of long-term garlic supplementation are largely unknown. Possible side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort, sweating, dizziness, allergic reactions, bleeding, and menstrual irregularities.\nSome breastfeeding mothers have found, after consuming garlic, that their babies can be slow to feed, and have noted a garlic odor coming from them. Conversely an experiment showed, \"infants were attached to the breast for longer periods of time and sucked more when the milk smelled like garlic\".\nIf higher-than-recommended doses of garlic are taken with anticoagulant medications, this can lead to a higher risk of bleeding. Garlic may interact with warfarin, saquinavir, antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, the quinolone family of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, and hypoglycemic drugs, as well as other medications. The American Veterinary Medical Association considers garlic to be toxic to pets.\nUses.\nBecause of sulfur compounds circulating in blood, consumed garlic may act as a mosquito repellent, although there is no scientific evidence of its efficacy.\nNutrition.\nIn the typical serving size of 1\u20133 cloves (3\u20139 grams), raw garlic provides no significant nutritional value, with the content of all essential nutrients below 10% of the Daily Value (DV). In a reference amount of , raw garlic contains some micronutrients in rich amounts (20% or more of the DV), including vitamins B6 (73% DV) and C (35% DV), and the dietary mineral, manganese (73% DV). Per 100 gram serving, raw garlic is a moderate source (10\u201319% DV) of the B vitamins, thiamin and pantothenic acid, as well as the dietary minerals, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc.\nThe composition of raw garlic is 59% water, 33% carbohydrates, 6% protein, 2% dietary fiber, and less than 1% fat.\nCulinary.\nGarlic is widely used around the world for its pungent flavor as a seasoning or condiment.\nThe garlic plant's bulb is the most commonly used part of the plant. With the exception of the single clove types, garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves. Garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes. They have a characteristic pungent, spicy flavor that mellows and sweetens considerably with cooking. The distinctive aroma is mainly due to organosulfur compounds including allicin present in fresh garlic cloves and ajoene which forms when they are crushed or chopped. A further metabolite allyl methyl sulfide is responsible for garlic breath.\nOther parts of the garlic plant are also edible. The leaves and flowers (bulbils) on the head (spathe) are sometimes eaten. They are milder in flavor than the bulbs, and are most often consumed while immature and still tender. Immature garlic is sometimes pulled, rather like a scallion, and sold as \"green garlic\". When green garlic is allowed to grow past the \"scallion\" stage, but not permitted to fully mature, it may produce a garlic \"round\", a bulb like a boiling onion, but not separated into cloves like a mature bulb.\nGreen garlic imparts a garlic flavor and aroma in food, minus the spiciness. Green garlic is often chopped and stir-fried or cooked in soup or hot pot in Southeast Asian (i.e. Vietnamese, Thai, Myanmar, Lao, Cambodian, Singaporean), and Chinese cookery, and is very abundant and low-priced. Additionally, the immature flower stalks (scapes) of the hardneck are sometimes marketed for uses similar to asparagus in stir-fries.\nInedible or rarely eaten parts of the garlic plant include the \"skin\" covering each clove and root cluster. The papery, protective layers of \"skin\" over various parts of the plant are generally discarded during preparation for most culinary uses, though in Korea immature whole heads are sometimes prepared with the tender skins intact. The root cluster attached to the basal plate of the bulb is the only part not typically considered palatable in any form.\nAn alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling olive oil (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and roast them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove. In Korea, heads of garlic are heated over the course of several weeks; the resulting product, called black garlic, is sweet and syrupy, and is used in the US, Europe and Australia, either produced domestically or imported.\nGarlic may be applied to different kinds of bread, usually in a medium of butter or oil, to create a variety of classic dishes, such as garlic bread, garlic toast, bruschetta, crostini, and canap\u00e9. The flavor varies in intensity and aroma with the different cooking methods. It is often paired with onion, tomato, or ginger.\nImmature scapes are tender and edible. They are also known as \"garlic spears\", \"stems\", or \"tops\". Scapes generally have a milder taste than the cloves. They are often used in stir frying or braised like asparagus. Garlic leaves are a popular vegetable in many parts of Asia. The leaves are cut, cleaned, and then stir-fried with eggs, meat, or vegetables.\nGarlic powder is made from dehydrated garlic and can be used as a substitute for fresh garlic, though the taste is not quite the same. Garlic salt combines garlic powder with table salt.\nRegions.\nGarlic is a fundamental component in many or most dishes of various regions, including eastern Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, northern Africa, southern Europe, Eastern Europe and parts of Latin America. Latin American seasonings, particularly, use garlic in sofritos and mofongos.\nOils can be flavored with garlic cloves. These infused oils are used to season all categories of vegetables, meats, breads, and pasta. Garlic, along with fish sauce, chopped fresh chilis, lime juice, sugar, and water, is a basic essential item in dipping fish sauce, a highly used dipping sauce condiment used in Indochina. In East and Southeast Asia, chili oil with garlic is a popular dipping sauce, especially for meat and seafood. Tuong ot toi Viet Nam (Vietnam chili garlic sauce) is a highly popular condiment and dip across North America and Asia.\nIn some cuisines, the young bulbs are pickled for three to six weeks in a mixture of sugar, salt, and spices. In eastern Europe, the shoots are pickled and eaten as an appetizer. Laba garlic, prepared by soaking garlic in vinegar, is a type of pickled garlic served with dumplings in northern China to celebrate the Chinese New Year.\nGarlic is essential in Middle Eastern and Arabic cooking, with its presence in many food items. In the Levant, garlic is traditionally crushed together with olive oil, and occasionally salt, to create a Middle Eastern garlic sauce called Toum (\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0645; meaning \"garlic\" in Arabic). While not exclusively served with meats, toum is commonly paired with chicken or other meat dishes such as shawarma. Garlic is also a key component in some hummus varieties, an Arabic dip composed of chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and salt.\nLightly smoked garlic is used in British and other European cuisine. It is particularly prized for stuffing poultry and game, and in soups and stews.\nEmulsifying garlic with olive oil produces \"aioli\". Garlic, oil, and a chunky base produce \"skordalia\". Crushed garlic, oil, and water produce a strong flavored sauce, mujdei. Blending garlic, almond, oil, and soaked bread produces \"ajoblanco\". \"Tzatziki\", yogurt mixed with garlic and salt, is a common sauce in Eastern Mediterranean cuisines.\nCulinary history.\nNumerous cuneiform records show that garlic has been cultivated in Mesopotamia for at least 4,000 years. The use of garlic in China and Egypt also dates back thousands of years. Well-preserved garlic was found in the tomb of Tutankhamun (c. 1325 ). It was consumed by ancient Greek and Roman soldiers, sailors, and rural classes (Virgil, \"Eclogues\" ii. 11), and, according to Pliny the Elder (\"Natural History\" xix. 32), by the African peasantry. Garlic was placed by the ancient Greeks on the piles of stones at crossroads, as a supper for Hecate (Theophrastus, \"Characters, The Superstitious Man\"). In classical antiquity, garlic was a highly favored food among Jews, to the extent that the \"Mishnah\" uses the nickname \"garlic eaters\" (\"Mishnah\", \"Nedarim\" 3:10).\nGarlic was rare in traditional English cuisine (though it is said to have been grown in England before 1548) but has been a common ingredient in Mediterranean Europe. Translations of the c.\u20091300 Assize of Weights and Measures, an English statute generally dated to the 13th century, indicate a passage as dealing with standardized units of garlic production, sale, and taxation\u2014the hundred of 15 ropes of 15 heads each\u2014but the Latin version of the text may refer to herring rather than garlic.\nStorage.\nDomestically, garlic is stored warm [above 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F)] and dry to keep it dormant (to inhibit sprouting). It is traditionally hung; softneck varieties are often braided in strands called plaits or . Peeled cloves may be stored in wine or vinegar in the refrigerator. Commercially, garlic is stored at 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), in a dry, low-humidity environment. Garlic will keep longer if the tops remain attached.\nGarlic is often kept in oil to produce flavored oil; however, the practice requires measures to be taken to prevent the garlic from spoiling which may include rancidity and growth of \"Clostridium botulinum\". Acidification with a mild solution of vinegar minimizes bacterial growth. Refrigeration does not assure the safety of garlic kept in oil, requiring use within one month to avoid bacterial spoilage. Garlic is also dried at low temperatures, to preserve the enzymatic activity and sold and kept as garlic granules, and can be rehydrated to reactivate it.\nStored garlic can be affected by \"Penicillium\" decay known as \"blue mold\" (or \"green mold\" in some locales), especially in high humidity. Infection may first appear as soft or water-soaked spots, followed by white patches (of mycelium) which turn blue or green with sporulation. As sporulation and germination are delayed at low temperature, and at \u22124\u00a0\u00b0C are inhibited entirely, in refrigerated cloves one may only see the white mycelium during early stages. \"Penicillium hirsutum\" and \"Penicillium allii\" are two of the predominant species identified in blue mold.\nMedical research.\nCardiovascular.\nAs of 2016, clinical research found that consuming garlic produces only a small reduction in blood pressure (4 mmHg), and there is no clear long-term effect on hypertension, cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. A 2016 meta-analysis indicated there was no effect of garlic consumption on blood levels of lipoprotein(a), a biomarker of atherosclerosis.\nBecause garlic might reduce platelet aggregation, people taking anticoagulant medication are cautioned about consuming garlic.\nCancer.\nTwo reviews found no effect of consuming garlic on colorectal cancer. A 2016 meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies found a moderate inverse association between garlic intake and some cancers of the upper digestive tract.\nCommon cold.\nA 2014 review found insufficient evidence to determine the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. Other reviews concluded a similar absence of high-quality evidence for garlic having a significant effect on the common cold.\nFolk medicine.\nGarlic has been used for traditional medicine in diverse cultures such as in Korea, Egypt, Japan, China, Rome, and Greece. In his \"Natural History\", Pliny gave a list of conditions in which garlic was considered beneficial (\"N.H.\" xx. 23). Galen, writing in the second century, eulogized garlic as the \"rustic's theriac\" (cure-all) (see F. Adams' \"Paulus Aegineta\", p.\u00a099). Alexander Neckam, a writer of the 12th century (see Wright's edition of his works, p.\u00a0473, 1863), discussed it as a palliative for the heat of the sun in field labor. In the 17th century, Thomas Sydenham valued it as an application in confluent smallpox, and William Cullen's \"Materia Medica\" of 1789 found some dropsies cured by it alone.\nOther uses.\nThe sticky juice within the bulb cloves is used as an adhesive in mending glass and porcelain. An environmentally benign garlic-derived polysulfide product is approved for use in the European Union (under Annex 1 of 91/414) and the UK as a nematicide and insecticide, including for use in the control of cabbage root fly and red mite in poultry.\nIn culture.\nGarlic is present in the folklore of many cultures. In Europe, many cultures have used garlic for protection or white magic, perhaps owing to its reputation in folk medicine. Central European folk beliefs considered garlic a powerful ward against demons, werewolves, and vampires. To ward off vampires, garlic could be worn, hung in windows, or rubbed on chimneys and keyholes.\nIn the foundation myth of the ancient Korean kingdom of Gojoseon, eating nothing but 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of Korean mugwort for 100 days let a bear be transformed into a woman.\nThe Hebrew Bible recounts that during their journey in the wilderness, the Israelites yearned for garlic among other foods they had eaten in Egypt (\"Numbers\", 11:5). Rabbinic literature attributes to Ezra the teaching that consuming garlic on Shabbat nights promotes intimacy, \"because it brings in love and brings out lust.\" (\"Jerusalem Talmud\", \"Megillah\", 75:1).\nIn celebration of Nowruz (Persian calendar New Year), garlic is one of the essential items in a ('seven things beginning with \"S\"') table, a traditional New Year's display: the name for garlic in Persian is (), which begins with (, , ) the Perso-Arabic letter corresponding to \"S\".\nIn Islam, it is recommended not to eat raw garlic prior to going to the mosque. This is based on several hadith.\nSome Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists and sects in China and Vietnam avoid eating onions, garlic, scallions, chives and leeks, which are known as \"Wu hun\" (, 'the five forbidden pungent vegetables').\nBecause of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the \"stinking rose\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50473", "revid": "36398665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50473", "title": "Gargoyle", "text": "Exterior building sculpture\nIn architecture, and specifically Gothic architecture, a gargoyle () is a carved or formed grotesque with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building, thereby preventing it from running down masonry walls and eroding the mortar between. Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize potential damage from rainstorms. A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth. Gargoyles are usually elongated fantastical animals because their length determines how far water is directed from the wall. When Gothic flying buttresses were used, aqueducts were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls.\nEtymology.\nThe term originates from the French \"gargouille\" (Old French \"gargoule\" (1294) \"conduit for waterflow\"), composed of the onomatopoeic root \"garg-\" and the Old French \"goule\" \"animal mouth, throat\", which remained dialectal or is otherwise known as the \"gullet\"; \"gullet\" is itself from Old French \"golet\", diminutive form of \"gole\" (older spelling of \"goule\") cf. Latin \"gula\" \"gullet, throat, palate, mouth\", \"gurgulio\" and similar words derived from the root \"gurg-\" / \"garg-\" \"to swallow\", which represented the \"gurgling\" sound of water (e.g., Portuguese and Spanish \"garganta,\" \"throat\"; but \"g\u00e1rgola\" \"gargoyle\" is from Old French). It is also connected to the French verb \"gargariser\", which shares the \"garg-\" root with the verb \"gargle\", from Old French too and is likely imitative in origin. The Italian word for gargoyle is \"doccione\" or \"gronda sporgente,\" an architecturally precise phrase which means \"protruding gutter\". Italian also uses \"gargolla\" or \"garguglia\", borrowed from Old French and French, when it has a grotesque shape.\nWhen not constructed as a waterspout and only serving an ornamental or artistic function, the technical term for such a sculpture is a grotesque, chimera, or boss. There are also regional variations, such as the hunky punk. Just as with bosses and chimeras, gargoyles are said to protect what they guard, such as a church, from any evil or harmful spirits.\nLegend of the Gargouille.\nA French legend that sprang up around the name of St. Romanus (; fl. c.\u2009631\u2013641 AD), the former chancellor of the Merovingian king Chlothar II who was made bishop of Rouen, relates how he delivered the country around Rouen from a monster called \"Gargouille\" or \"Goji\". La Gargouille is said to have been the typical dragon with bat-like wings, a long neck, and the ability to breathe fire from its mouth. Multiple versions of the story are given, either that St. Romanus subdued the creature with a crucifix, or he captured the creature with the help of the only volunteer, a condemned man. In each, the monster is led back to Rouen and burned, but its head and neck would not burn due to being tempered by its own fire breath. The head was then mounted on the walls of the newly built church to scare off evil spirits, and used for protection. In commemoration of St. Romain, the Archbishops of Rouen were granted the right to set a prisoner free on the day that the reliquary of the saint was carried in procession (see details at Rouen).\nHistory.\nThe term \"gargoyle\" is most often applied to medieval work, but throughout all ages, some means of water diversion, when not conveyed in gutters, was adopted. In ancient Egyptian architecture, gargoyles showed little variation, typically in the form of a lion's head. Similar lion-mouthed water spouts were also seen on Greek temples, carved or modelled in the marble or terracotta cymatium of the cornice. An excellent example of this are the 39 remaining lion-headed water spouts on the Temple of Zeus. Originally, it had 102 gargoyles or spouts, but due to the heavy weight (they were crafted from marble), many snapped off and had to be replaced.\nMany medieval cathedrals included gargoyles and chimeras. According to French architect and author Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, himself one of the great producers of gargoyles in the 19th century, the earliest known medieval gargoyles appear on Laon Cathedral (c. 1200\u20131220). One of the more famous examples is the gargoyles of Notre-Dame de Paris, which dons 54 chimeras crowded around the railings of the cathedral that came to be in the 1843 restoration project. Although most have grotesque features, the term gargoyle has come to include all types of images. Some gargoyles were depicted as monks, or combinations of real animals and people, many of which were humorous. Unusual animal mixtures, or chimeras, did not act as rainspouts and are more properly called grotesques. They serve as ornamentation but are now popularly called gargoyles.\nBoth ornamented and unornamented waterspouts projecting from roofs at parapet level were a common device used to shed rainwater from buildings until the early 18th century. From that time, more and more buildings used drainpipes to carry the water from the guttering roof to the ground and only very few buildings using gargoyles were constructed. This was because some people found them frightening, and sometimes heavy ones fell off, causing damage. The London Building Act 1724 (11 Geo. 1. c. 28), passed by the Parliament of Great Britain made the use of downpipes compulsory in all new construction.\nPurpose.\nThere are divided ideas as to the purpose of adding gargoyles to religious structures. Some state that gargoyles were meant to illustrate evil and sin, while others have posited that grotesques in architecture were apotropaic devices. In the 12th century, before the use of gargoyles as rain spouts, St. Bernard of Clairvaux was famous for speaking out against gargoyles carved on the walls of his monastery's cloister: St. Bernard emphasizes the absurdity of the beastly figures, pointing out their strange combinations of bodily parts. St. Bernard was a Cistercian, meaning he was unimpressed by the more ornate and expressive decoration used in any given cathedral or church. Because of this, he was repulsed by gargoyles and found them insulting to the church.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhile the theory that gargoyles were spiritual devices made to ward off devilish evil was very widely known and accepted, other schools of thoughts have developed over time. For example, in the case of gargoyles unattributable to any one or two animals, some say that they were simply the product of pagan mythology passed down through generations in the medium of fireside tales. Akin to the leading catholic theory but slightly different, some suggest that gargoyles were meant not to intimidate evil spirits or demons, but humans. It is said that at the gateway of the city of Amiens, France, two gargoyles stood guard, and anyone with bad intentions toward the city and its people would be spewed with acid before being able to enter. On the contrary, the king of Amiens would be showered with coins with every return.\nOther gargoyles were meant to strike fear into the heart of the pious, specifically those that were anthropomorphized. Gargoyles that were mostly human but had animalistic attributes, like the harpy or cynocephaly were meant to represent the torturous fate of sinners. Some gargoyles were purely decoration, like the monkey in the courtyard of the palace of Jacques C\u0153ur in Bourges, France. This stylistic choice was supposedly a nod to C\u0153r's exotic and adventurous lifestyle, as monkeys are a species not native to France.\nIt is most likely that gargoyles meant all of these things depending on where and when they were made, and it shouldn't be the objective of the viewer to pin one purpose to the entirety of gargoyles. According to Lester Burbank Bridaham, writing in \"Gargoyles, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture\", \"There is much symbolism in the sculpture of the Gothic period; but we must be wary of reading in too much meaning.\"\nAnimals.\nThe ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans all used animal-shaped waterspouts. During the 12th Century, when gargoyles appeared in Europe, the Roman Catholic Church was growing stronger and converting many new people. Most of the population at this time was illiterate, so images were very important to convey ideas. Many early gargoyles depicted some version of a dragon, especially in France. In addition to serving as spouts for water, the gaping mouths of these gargoyles evoked the fearsome destructiveness of these legendary beasts, reminding the laity of the need for the church's protection. The reason why many gargoyles are depicted as these dragon-looking, unidentifiable monsters is because it is said the founding bishops of churches would rid their respective towns of these kinds of beasts.\nHuman qualities were sometimes ascribed to specific animals\u2014that is, the animals were anthropomorphized. This was especially common for pagans, and using these ideas helped conversion to Catholicism. Some animals (such as the rhinoceros and the hippopotamus) were unknown in western Europe during the Middle Ages, so gargoyles of these species (such as the ones at Laon Cathedral) are modern gargoyles and therefore did not have symbolic meaning in medieval times.\nThe Lion was the most prominent figure for animal gargoyles, likely due to their frequent appearances in other medieval art and even art in antiquity. Lions became a symbol of Christ and, therefore, were said to have the same characteristics as Christ. Supposedly, the lion's tail had the power to erase its tracks, and because of this could elude the devil. The lioness was said to give birth to dead cubs, which would resurrect 3 days later, like Jesus Christ. Among these divine attributes, lions were generally believed to be virtuous in a multitude of ways, such as being extremely loyal and in control of their emotions\nHumanization.\nDepictions of humans in gargoyle and grotesque figures were later developments from the animalistic or beastly examples one is likely more familiar with, and were almost a natural progression in subject matter for the statues. Humans gargoyles were often comedic and depicted in bawdy positions, some leaning over the ledge they're perched on to vomit or defecate off of. The orifice that rainwater would come out of would imply that it was vomit or fecal matter. Alike the aforementioned gargoyles akin to the monstrous races, many human gargoyles would represent the common acts of certain sinners, such as a prostitute or moneylender. Some gargoyles depict those who are guilty of what one would call a social sin. A woman who is reading for example, as women were not expected and often shunned for attempting to engage in literature.\nSince the initial idea behind the brutish and frightening gargoyle in the 12th century was to ward off evil, it's hard to believe that these later humorous and sarcastic figures served the same purpose. Instead it's often hypothesized that many human gargoyles were meant to be criticisms of the common church attendee, a mirror into one's own sin or wrongdoings used for introspection. Others believe, however, that the change to human characteristics in gargoyles created a sense of familiarity and relatability in the eyes of the everyday Church-goer.\nThe furthest evolution of human gargoyles and grotesques would be the corbel head. Extremely realistic, corbel heads were the most impressive works by stone carvers as they best depicted human facial structure and emotion. Corbel heads were not exclusive to any particular kind of person, and represented a fair array of social classes, however, it was very common for them to be mocking the clergy. Corbel heads were often in places that couldn't be seen by anyone on the ground looking up at the corresponding cathedral, in fact, the corbel heads of Reims Cathedral were only recently discovered in the early 20th century when photographers were permitted to scale the buildings. Because of their frequently hidden locations, corbel heads were likely sites of practice for stone carvers, a place obscured by the public eye where they can work on their craft. This along with the suspected frustration of stone artisans due to disproportionate compensation from the clergy, lead some to think that stone cutters created the obnoxious, tongue-out, mouth-pulling faces as a way to mock the clergy.\nInfluence on the Western World.\nAlthough gargoyles were exclusive to Europe for the longest time, their intrigue still attracted those a continent away. Gargoyles can be found in the columns of the Harvard Law School building, fitting for its Gothic architecture. These along with grotesques built at Princeton College were sculpted by Gutzon Borglum. George B. Post was responsible for the frequent use of grotesques on multiple New York City buildings. His architectural works consisted of the multiple grotesques scattered across the multiple buildings of the College of the City of New York and four corbel heads that can be found under a balcony at the National Arts Club Building, Gramercy Park South in New York City. Other important figures in the American implementation of gargoyles and grotesques consist of E.F Guilbert, who had the construction of various gargoyles on the Newark Manuel Training School represents the several aspects of the curriculum, as well as John Russell Pope, who carved several grotesques of varying distinct human expressions from wood at Deepdale, Long Island, a personal estate of the Vanderbilt family.John Taylor Arms educated the American Public of gargoyles through his own etchings of various gargoyles found across Europe. Some instances include etchings of the gargoyles at Notre Dame Cathedral and Amiens Cathedral. his works were regarded as incredibly accurate in portraying the emotion in the expression of the original gargoyles."}

She was a member of the R&amp;B girl group TLC, alongside Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins and Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas. Besides rapping and singing on TLC recordings, Lopes was the creative force behind the group, receiving more co-writing credits than the other members. She also designed some of their outfits and the stage for their FanMail Tour and contributed to the group's image, album titles, artworks, and music videos. Through her work with TLC, Lopes won four Grammy Awards.\nDuring her brief solo career, Lopes scored two US top 10 singles with \"Not Tonight\" and \"U Know What's Up\", as well as one UK number-one single with \"Never Be the Same Again\", the latter a collaboration with Melanie C of the English girl group Spice Girls. She also produced another girl group, Blaque, who scored a platinum album and two US top 10 hits. Lopes remains the only member of TLC to have released a solo album.\nIn 2002, Lopes was killed in a car crash in Honduras while volunteering at a children's development center. Lopes lost control of her rental SUV when she swerved to avoid a truck. She was the only one not wearing a seatbelt; four other passengers were injured enough to require hospitalization. The documentary \"The Last Days of Left Eye\" was released and aired on VH1 in May 2007.\nEarly life.\nLisa Nicole Lopes was born on May 27, 1971, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Wanda (n\u00e9e Andino), a seamstress, and Ronald Lopes Sr., a US Army staff sergeant. Lisa has a younger brother, Ronald Jr., and a younger sister, Raina (nicknamed Reigndrop). Lopes said her father was \"very strict, very domineering\" and that he treated the family like they were in \"boot camp\". He was also a \"talented musician\" who played the harmonica, clarinet, piano, and saxophone.\nLopes' parents separated when she was still in school, and her paternal grandmother raised her during the later years of her childhood. She began playing with a toy piano at five years old, and later composed her own songs. By age 10, Lopes formed the musical trio The Lopes Kids with her siblings, with whom she performed gospel songs at local events and churches. She attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls. In an interview with \"The Independent\", Lopes said that at 14 she was moved after hearing the Queen Latifah and Monie Love song \"Ladies First\".\nCareer.\n1990\u20131999: TLC.\nIn late 1990, Lopes moved to Atlanta to dance in an artist's music video. TLC originally started as a female trio called '2nd Nature', with T-Boz, Left Eye and Crystal. The group was renamed TLC, derived from the first initials of its members at the time: Tionne Watkins, Lisa Lopes and Crystal Jones. Things did not work out with Jones, and TLC's manager Perri \"Pebbles\" Reid brought in Damian Dame backup dancer Rozonda Thomas as a third member of the group. To preserve the band's original name, Thomas needed a name starting with C, which is how she became \"Chilli\", a name chosen by Lopes. Watkins became T-Boz, derived from the first letter of her first name and \"Boz\" (slang for \"boss\"). Lopes was renamed \"Left Eye\" after a compliment from her friend, speculated to be New Edition member Michael Bivins, who once told her he was attracted to her because of her left eye, which was more slanted than her right eye. Lopes emphasized her nickname by wearing a pair of glasses with the right lens covered by a condom in keeping with the group's support of safe sex, wearing a black stripe under her left eye, and eventually getting her left eyebrow pierced.\nThe group debuted in 1992 with the album \"Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip\". With four hit singles, it sold six million copies worldwide, leading to the group becoming a household name. Shortly afterwards, Lopes began dating Atlanta Falcons football player Andre Rison, and the two soon moved in together in Rison's upscale double-story home. Their relationship was allegedly filled with violent moments, and Lopes filed an assault charge against Rison on September 2, 1993. Lopes had a battle with alcohol at the time, having started drinking at the age of fifteen. After another fight between the couple, in the early morning hours of June 9, 1994, Lopes tossed numerous pairs of Rison's newly purchased sneakers into a bathtub and lit them on fire. The fiberglass bathtub quickly melted and set the structural frame of the house on fire. Lopes and Rison had had a fight previously because she caught Rison in bed with another woman. Lopes had thrown numerous teddy bears Rison had bought her into the tub and lit them on fire. Rison then had the damaged marble tub replaced with a cheaper fiberglass model, which went up in flames immediately when she set the shoes on fire. Lopes was arrested and indicted on charges of first-degree arson; she was sentenced to five years of probation and a $10,000 fine. Rison eventually reconciled with Lopes, and they continued dating on and off for seven years.\nShortly after, \"CrazySexyCool\" was released, selling over 23 million copies worldwide. However, Lopes' stint in rehab had led to her only having limited input in the writing and recording of the album. After the release of \"CrazySexyCool\", Lopes was a featured artist for the first time on \"How Do You Like It?\" a song by Keith Sweat in 1994. Later in 1995, Lopes recorded a well-received verse to the rap version of \"Freedom\" of the soundtrack from the Black Panther-based docudrama \"Panther\" with fellow female hip-hop artists such as Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Patra, Yo-Yo, Salt 'n' Pepa and Meshell Ndegeocello. In 1997, Lopes was featured on the remix to Lil' Kim's \"Not Tonight\", alongside Missy Elliott, Angie Martinez and Da Brat. The single earned all artists a nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1998 Grammy Awards. TLC's third album, \"FanMail\", was released in 1999 and sold over 14 million copies worldwide. The album's title was named by Lopes as a tribute to TLC's loyal fans and the sleeve contained the names of hundreds of fans screen names as a \"thank you\".\nDuring and after the release of \"FanMail\", Lopes made it known to the press on multiple occasions that she felt that she was unable to express herself in TLC fully. Her contributions to songs had been reduced to periodic eight-bar raps, and there were several songs in which she had no vocals. Studio session singers such as Debra Killings often sang background vocals for the group's songs. In the May 1999 issue of \"Vibe\" magazine, Lopes said, \"I've graduated from this era. I cannot stand 100 percent behind this TLC project and the music that is supposed to represent me.\" In response to Lopes' comments, Watkins and Thomas stated to \"Entertainment Weekly\" that Lopes \"doesn't respect the whole group\" and \"Left Eye is only concerned with Left Eye.\" In response, Lopes sent a reply through \"Entertainment Weekly\" issuing a \"challenge\" to Watkins and Thomas to release solo albums and let the fans decide the winner of TLC. Not only would it be entertaining, but more importantly, the three albums would fulfill their contractual obligations and end their deal with LaFace Records:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I challenge Tionne Watkins (T-Boz) and Rozonda Thomas (Chilli) to an album entitled \"The Challenge\"... a 3-CD set that contains three solo albums. Each [album]... will be due to the record label by October 1, 2000... I also challenge Dallas 'The Manipulator' Austin to produce all of the material and do it at a fraction of his normal rate. As I think about it, I'm sure LaFace would not mind throwing in a $1.5 million prize for the winner.\nWatkins and Thomas were unconvinced by the strategy behind 'The Challenge' and declined to take up the offer, though Lopes remained firm in her support for the idea. Things were heated between the band for some time, with Thomas speaking out against Lopes, calling her antics \"selfish\", \"evil\", and \"heartless\". TLC then addressed these struggles by saying that they are very much like sisters who have their disagreements every now and then as Lopes explained, \"It's deeper than a working relationship. We have feelings for each other, which is why we get so mad at each other. I usually say that you cannot hate someone unless you love them. So, we love each other. That's the problem.\"\n1998\u20132002: Solo career.\nIn 1998, Lopes hosted the short-lived MTV series \"The Cut\", in which a list of aspiring pop stars, rappers, and rock bands competed against each other in front of judges. The show's winner, which ended up being a male-female rap duo named Silky, was promised a record deal and funding to produce a music video, which would then enter MTV's heavy rotation. A then-unknown Anastacia finished in third place, but ended up securing a record deal after Lopes and the show's three judges were impressed by her performance.\nLopes created Left Eye Productions to discover new talent. She mentored the R&amp;B trio Blaque, and helped them secure a record deal with Columbia Records. Their self-titled debut album was executive-produced by Lopes, who also made a cameo appearance in their music video \"808\" and also rapped in their second music video \"I Do\". Lopes was also developing and promoting another new band called Egypt. They worked with Lopes on her second album under her new nickname, N.I.N.A., meaning New Identity Not Applicable. She was also featured on Method Man's second album \"\" on the song \"Cradle Rock\".\nIn 2000, Lopes became a featured rapper on several singles, including Spice Girls Melanie C's \"Never Be the Same Again\", which topped the charts in 35 countries, including the United Kingdom. She was also featured on \"U Know What's Up\", the first single from Donell Jones' second album, \"Where I Wanna Be\", and she rapped a verse in \"Space Cowboy\" with NSYNC on their 2000 album, \"No Strings Attached\". On October 4, 2000, Lopes co-hosted the UK's MOBO Awards with Trevor Nelson, where she also performed \"U Know What's Up\" with Jones. She also collaborated on \"Gimme Some\" by Toni Braxton for her 2000 album \"The Heat\". She had previously featured on Keith Sweat's song \"How Do You Like It?\". In 2001, she appeared in a commercial for the fashion brand Gap. In July 2001, Lopes appeared on the singers' edition of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" along with Joey McIntyre, Tyrese, Nick Lachey, and Lee Ann Womack. She dropped the $125,000 question and won $32,000 for her charity. After her death in 2002, the episode she appeared in was shown in dedication to her.\nIn 2008, Lopes' family opened UNI Studios, which she had created for the purpose of recording solo projects, to the public. Her brother Ronald is the general manager of the studio. Lopes had a dream of making new artists able to record music at a low cost, in a high-end studio at her house. Her family continues to operate it and fill it with new equipment.\n\"Supernova\".\nLopes spent much of her free time after the conclusion of TLC's first headlining tour, the FanMail Tour, recording her debut solo album, \"Supernova\". It includes a song titled \"A New Star is Born\", which is dedicated to her late father. She told MTV News:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That track is dedicated to all those that have loved ones that have passed away. It's saying that there is no such thing as death. We can call it transforming for a lack of better words, but as scientists would say, 'Every atom that was once a star is now in you.' It's in your body. So, in the song I pretty much go along with that idea. ... I don't care what happens or what people think about death, it doesn't matter. We all share the same space.\nOther tracks covered other personal issues, including her tumultuous relationship with Rison. Among the album's 13 tracks was also a posthumous duet with Tupac Shakur that was assembled from the large cache of unreleased recordings done prior to his murder in 1996. Initially scheduled for release on a date to coincide with the 11th anniversary of her grandfather's death, Arista Records decided to delay and then cancel the American release. The album was eventually released in August 2001 in different foreign countries. The Japanese import includes a bonus track called \"Friends\", which would later be sampled for \"Give It to Me While It's Hot\" on TLC's fourth album \"3D\".\nN.I.N.A..\nAfter numerous talks with Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, Lopes severed her solo deal with Arista (despite remaining signed to the label as a member of TLC) and signed with Knight's Death Row Records in January 2002, intending to record a second solo album under the pseudonym \"N.I.N.A.\" (New Identity Not Applicable). She had discussions about recording with David Bowie for the project, whom she was also trying to get involved with the fourth TLC album. The project was also planned to include collaborations with Ray J along with close friend Missy Elliott. After Lopes' death in April 2002, Death Row Records still had plans to complete and release the album (unfinished at the time of Lopes' death) in October 2002, but the album was cancelled for unknown reasons. Several tracks from the album were leaked online featuring artists from Tha Row Records. Lopes's unreleased songs were also sampled by TLC for their fourth album \"3D\" after she died. Another track, \"Too Street 4 T.V\" (featuring Danny Boy), was released on the soundtrack to the 2003 film \"Dysfunktional Family\".\n2008\u20132012: \"Eye Legacy\".\nIn 2008, Lopes' family decided to work with producers at Surefire Music Group to create a posthumous album in her honor, \"Eye Legacy\". Originally set to be released October 28, 2008, the release date was pushed back to November 11, then to January 27, 2009. The song 'Neva Will Eye Eva' and \"Crank It\", both feature and were co-produced by Lopes' sister Raina \"Reigndrop\" Lopes. The first official single from the album, \"Let's Just Do It\", was released on January 13, 2009, and features Missy Elliott and TLC. The second official single, \"Block Party\", features Lil Mama. The album largely consists of reworked versions of tracks from the \"Supernova\" album. In November 2009, \"Forever... The EP\" was released which contained international bonus tracks not used on the \"Eye Legacy\" album. The EP was only available to download.\nIn 2012, on the eve of the tenth anniversary of her death, \"Fantasies\", an unreleased track by Bootleg featuring Lopes, was uploaded to SoundCloud.\nPersonal life.\nLopes was often vocal about her personal life and difficult past. She came from an abusive, alcoholic background and struggled with alcoholism herself. These issues became headline news in 1994, when she was arrested for setting fire to Andre Rison's sneakers in a bathtub; the fire ultimately spread to the mansion they shared and destroyed it. She claimed that Rison had beaten her after a night out, and she set fire to his shoes to get back at him, but burning down the house was an accident. Lopes later revealed that she did not have a lot of freedom within the relationship and that Rison abused her emotionally and physically; she said that she released her frustrations about the relationship on the night of the fire.\nLopes was sentenced to five years' probation and therapy at a halfway house, and was unable to shake the incident from her reputation. Lopes revealed in \"The Last Days of Left Eye\" that her meeting with a struggling mother in rehab left a big impression on her. She subsequently adopted the woman's 8-year-old daughter. She had adopted a 12-year-old boy ten years prior.\nLopes had several tattoos. Most prominent was a large eagle on her left arm, which she said represented freedom. Later, she added the number \"80\" around the eagle, which was Rison's NFL number while in Atlanta. She also had a tattoo of a moon with a face on her foot in reference to Rison's nickname, \"Bad Moon\". On her upper right arm was a large tattoo of the name \"Parron\" for her late stepbrother who died in a boating accident, arching over a large tattoo of a pierced heart. Her smallest tattoo was on her left earlobe and consisted of an arrow pointing to her left over the symbol of an eye, a reference to her nickname. Lopes struggled with self-harm and even carved the words \"hate\" and \"love\" into her arm with a razor.\nIn September 2000, Lopes was reported missing after failing to attend a family gathering and a major press conference in Las Vegas.\nRoughly two weeks before her own death, Lopes was a passenger in a traffic accident that resulted in the death of a 10-year-old Honduran boy. As reported in \"Philadelphia Weekly\", \"It is commonplace for people to walk the roads that wind through Honduras, and it's often difficult to see pedestrians.\" The boy, Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez, was following behind his brothers and sisters when he stepped off the median strip and was struck by a van driven by Stephanie, Lopes' personal assistant. Lopes' party stopped and loaded the boy into the car, and Lopes \"cradled the dying boy's bleeding head in her arms\" while \"someone gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as they rushed him to a nearby hospital.\" He died the next day. Lopes paid approximately $3,700 for his medical expenses and funeral, and she gave the family around $925 for any extra costs, although it was apparently agreed upon by the authorities and the boy's family that his death was an \"unforeseeable tragedy\" and no blame was placed on the driver of the van or Lopes. In the documentary \"The Last Days of Left Eye\", Lopes is shown choosing a casket for the child from a local funeral home. Earlier in the documentary, Lopes mentioned that she felt the presence of a \"spirit\" following her, and was struck by the fact that the child killed in the accident shared a similar last name, even thinking that the spirit may have made a mistake by taking his life instead of hers.\nDeath and funeral.\nOn April 25, 2002, Lopes was driving a rented Mitsubishi Montero SUV in La Ceiba, Honduras, when she swerved to avoid a truck then turned sharply to the left as she tried to avoid an oncoming car. The vehicle rolled several times after hitting two trees, throwing Lopes and three others out of the windows, and finally coming to rest in a ditch at the side of the road. She died instantly of \"fracture of the base of the cranium\" and \"open cerebral trauma\", and was the only person fatally injured in the crash. She was not wearing a seat belt. The collision was recorded on video from inside the vehicle because a documentary film was in progress.\nLopes' funeral was held at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Georgia, on May 2, 2002. Thousands of people attended. Engraved upon her casket were the lyrics to her portion of \"Waterfalls\", stating \"Dreams are hopeless aspirations, in hopes of coming true, believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you.\" Gospel duo Mary Mary sang their song \"Shackles (Praise You)\" at the funeral. Lopes was buried at Hillandale Memorial Gardens in Lithonia.\nLegacy.\nIn a statement to MTV, music producer Jermaine Dupri remembered Lopes: \"She was determined to be something in life. She was a true rock star. She didn't care about no press. She was the rock star out of the group. She was the one that would curse on TV. She had the tattoos. You could expect the unexpected. When you see Lisa, you could expect something from her. That's the gift she carried.\"\nLopes was in the process of setting up two educational centers for Honduran children. One was built on an 80-acre plot of land she called Camp YAC. The other center was called Creative Castle.\nIn 2003, shortly after Lopes' death, her family started the Lisa Lopes Foundation, a charitable group dedicated to providing neglected and abandoned youth with the resources necessary to increase their quality of life. Her spiritual motto was the one used for her foundation: \"Energy never dies... it just transforms.\" Her foundation went into various underdeveloped villages and gave new clothes to poor children and their families. In August 2007, the foundation hosted a charity auction, selling items donated by celebrities. It raised approximately $5,000 for the Hogar de Amor (\"Home of Love\"), an orphanage in Honduras. In 2012, the foundation began hosting an annual music festival, known as \"Left Eye Music Fest\", in Decatur, Georgia.\nIn January 2020, Lifetime aired an episode of \"Hopelessly In Love\", a docuseries that captures the relationships of the rich and famous, about Lopes and Rison's tumultuous relationship. It showcased the complexity of their relationship and how she ended up with a felony arson charge for burning down Rison's Atlanta mansion.\nPosthumous documentary.\nA documentary showing the final 27 days of Lopes' life, titled \"The Last Days of Left Eye\", premiered at the Atlanta Film Festival in April 2007, for an audience that included many of Lopes' contemporaries, including Monica, Ronnie DeVoe, 112, Big Boi, India.Arie, and Cee Lo Green. VH1 and VH1 Soul broadcast the documentary on May 19, 2007. Most of the footage was shot with a handheld camera, often in the form of diary entries filmed by Lopes while on a 30-day spiritual retreat in Honduras with sister Reigndrop, brother Ronald and members of the R&amp;B group Egypt. In these entries, she reflected on her personal life and career. A calmer side of her personality was on display, showing interests in numerology and yoga.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50477", "revid": "44313162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50477", "title": "Martial law", "text": "Imposition of direct military control or suspension of civil law by a government\nMartial law is the replacement of civilian government by military rule and the suspension of civilian legal processes for military powers. Martial law can continue for a specified amount of time, or indefinitely, and standard civil liberties may be suspended for as long as martial law continues. Most often, martial law is declared in times of war or emergencies such as civil unrest and natural disasters. Alternatively, martial law may be declared in instances of military coups d'\u00e9tat.\nOverview.\nDespite the fact that it has been declared frequently throughout history, martial law is still often described as largely elusive as a legal entity. Across history, the phrase \"martial law\" has been used to refer to a \"wide variety of actions, practices, or roles for the military\", and thus lacked (and currently lacks) a concrete definition. References to martial law date back to 1628 England, when Sir Matthew Hale described martial law as, \"no Law, but something indulged rather than allowed as a Law.\" Despite being centuries old, this quote remains true in many countries around the world today. Most often, the implementation of martial law arises from necessity rather than legal right, and while some countries have provisions explicitly permitting the use of martial law, many do not. For countries that do not explicitly permit the declaration of martial law, but where martial law has been declared, the legal justification for it is often the common law doctrine of necessity, or some variation of it.\nCommon law doctrine of necessity and martial law.\nOne legal theory most frequently associated with martial law is the common law doctrine of necessity. While many countries, the United States for example, do not have the explicit constitutional right to declare martial law, scholars often interpret the law of the United States to allow for the implementation of martial law in times of necessity. Countries such as Pakistan have famously implemented this rationale as well.\nUse.\nMartial law can be used by governments to enforce their rule over the public, as seen in multiple countries listed below. Such incidents may occur after a coup d'\u00e9tat (Thailand in 2006 and 2014, and Egypt in 2013); when threatened by popular protest (China, Tiananmen Square protests of 1989); to suppress political opposition (martial law in Poland in 1981); or to stabilize insurrections or perceived insurrections. Martial law may be declared in cases of major natural disasters; however, most countries use a different legal construct, such as a state of emergency.\nMartial law has also been imposed during conflicts, and in cases of occupations, where the absence of any other civil government provides for an unstable population. Examples of this form of military rule include post\u2013World War II reconstruction in Germany and Japan; the recovery and reconstruction of the former Confederate States of America during the Reconstruction Era in the United States of America following the American Civil War; and German occupation of northern France between 1871 and 1873 after the Treaty of Frankfurt ended the Franco-Prussian War. The British Empire commonly used martial law when insurgencies occurred in its colonies, such as the Arab Revolt in Palestine.\nTypically, the imposition of martial law accompanies curfews; the suspension of civil law, civil rights, and habeas corpus; and the application or extension of military law or military justice to civilians. Civilians defying martial law may be subjected to military tribunal (court-martial).\nBy country.\nArmenia.\nDuring the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan declared martial law.\nAustralia.\nThe Black War was a period of violent conflict between British colonists and Aboriginal Australians in Tasmania from the mid-1820s to 1832. With an escalation of violence in the late 1820s, Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur declared martial law in November 1828\u2014effectively providing legal immunity for killing Aboriginal people. It would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period of martial law in the history of the British colonies on the Australian continent. As of 2023[ [update]], martial law has never been declared since federation in 1901.\nAzerbaijan.\nDuring the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev declared martial law.\nBahrain.\nIn March 2011, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa declared martial law during an anti-government uprising, granting authority to the police and military to crack down on protesters. It was lifted on 1 June amid a continuing crackdown on the uprising.\nBangladesh.\nBangladesh has been under martial law several times. In the late 1970s after Mujib was assassinated, martial law was declared temporarily under Chief Martial Law administrators including Ziaur Rahman and Hussain Muhammad Ershad declared martial law in the early 1980s.\nCanada.\nThe \"War Measures Act\" was a Parliament of Canada statute that allowed the government to assume sweeping emergency powers, stopping short of martial law, i.e., the military did not administer justice, which remained in the hands of the courts. The act was invoked three times: during World War I, World War II, and the October Crisis of 1970. In 1988, the \"War Measures Act\" was replaced by the \"Emergencies Act\", which saw its first invocation in February 2022 amidst the Freedom Convoy protests.\nDuring the colonial era, martial law was proclaimed and applied in the territory of the Province of Quebec during the invasion of Canada by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War in 1775\u20131776. It was also applied twice in the Province of Lower Canada during the 1837\u20131838 insurrections. On 5 December, following the events of November 1837, martial law was proclaimed in the district of Montreal by Governor Gosford, without the support of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. It was imposed until 27 April 1838. Martial law was proclaimed a second time on 4 November 1838, this time by acting Governor John Colborne, and was applied in the district of Montreal until 24 August 1839.\nChina.\nIn China, martial law in the Beiyang government could be dated back to the final year of the Qing dynasty. The outline of a 1908 draft constitution\u2014modeled on Japan's Meiji Constitution\u2014included provisions for martial law. The Provisional Government of the Republic of China promulgated the Provisional Constitution in March 1911, which authorized the President to declare martial law in times of emergency. The \"Martial Law Declaration Act\" were issued by the Nationalist Government later in 1920s and amended in 1940s. Following World War II, the island of Taiwan came back to China's control given the impending withdrawal of Japanese forces and colonial government. Martial law was declared first in 1947 in Taiwan Province after the February 28 incident, then again in 1949 as the Chinese Civil War was also raging across the country despite the democracy promised in the Constitution of the Republic of China (the central government refused to implement the constitution on Taiwan until after 1949).\nAfter the Nationalist-led central government of China lost control of the mainland to the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the perceived need to suppress Communist activities in Taiwan was utilised as a rationale for not lifting martial law until thirty-eight years later in 1987, just prior to the death of then President Chiang Ching-kuo. Taiwan's period of martial law was one of the longest in modern history, after that of Syria (1967\u20132011).\nMartial law was imposed in Beijing in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 by the Communist-ruled government on mainland China.\nEgypt.\nIn Egypt, states of emergency were in effect almost continuously from 1967 to 2021. A state of emergency gives military courts the power to try civilians and allows the government to detain for renewable 45-day periods and without court orders anyone deemed to be threatening state security. Public demonstrations are banned under the legislation.\nDuring Hosni Mubarak's presidency, parliament had renewed emergency laws every three years since they were imposed. The legislation was extended in 2003 and were due to expire at the end of May 2006; plans were in place to replace it with new anti-terrorism laws. After the Dahab bombings in April of that year, it was renewed for another two years. In May 2008 there was a further extension to June 2010. In May 2010, the state of emergency was further extended, albeit with a promise from the government to be applied only to 'Terrorism and Drugs' suspects. On 10 February 2011, during the uprising against his rule, Mubarak promised the deletion of the relevant constitutional article regarding the emergency law in an attempt to please the mass number of protesters that demanded him to resign. The following day, he stepped down and handed control of the country to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. It meant that the presidential executive powers, the parliamentary legislative powers and the judicial powers all transferred directly to the military system which may delegate powers back and forth to any civilian institution within its territory.\nThe military issued in its third announcement the \"end of the State of Emergency as soon as order is restored in Egypt\". Before martial law, the Egyptian parliament under the constitution had the civilian power to declare a state of emergency. When in martial law, the military gained all powers of the state, including to dissolve the parliament and suspend the constitution as it did in its fifth announcement. Under martial law, the only legal framework within the Egyptian territory was the numbered announcements from the military. These announcements could for instance order any civilian laws to come back into force. The military announcements (communiqu\u00e9s) were the \"de facto\" only constitution and legal framework for the Egyptian territory. It meant that all affairs of the state were bound by the Geneva Conventions.\nUnder the current president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a series of constitutional amendments passed in 2019 granted the military the authority to intervene in national politics to \"preserve the constitution and democracy, protect the basic principles of the state and its civil nature, and protect the people's rights and freedoms\". The armed forces were separately granted policing responsibilities to arrest civilians and \"protect public and vital facilities\".\nFinland.\nThe Preparedness Act (SDK 1552/2011, ) is a law in Finnish legislation, enacted in accordance with the constitutional procedure. The purpose of the Act is to give the authorities sufficient powers in times of war and other exceptional circumstances. During a state of defence (war), there is also the Defence Status Act, the provisions of which override the Preparedness Act. Together, the two laws form the Emergency Preparedness Act. The current Emergency Preparedness Act and its predecessor of the same name (1080/1991) were designed to replace the emergency provisions previously scattered over several different acts.\nIndia.\nThe sole mention of Martial Law in the Indian constitution is in Article 34 which gives Parliament the power to indemnify persons in respect of acts done in territories where martial law was in force and to legitimize such actions. But in the text itself, there is no mention of any grants of power to declare martial law. The Supreme Court of India in Puttaswamy v. Union of India declared that certain rights of life and liberty are natural rights, which cannot be curbed by the state, but also upheld the inherent right of issuing writs by courts. As the power of martial law is given through an Enabling Act of the Parliament, it is inherently subject to the above decision. \nDuring the British Raj, martial law was effectively declared in the Defense of India Act, 1915 and the Defense of India Act, 1939. It was also declared in most of the Punjab during 1919 as a response to tensions caused by the Amritsar Massacre. These tensions were caused due to the controversial Rowlatt Act.\nIndonesia.\nOn 18 May 2003, during a military activity in Aceh, under the order of the president, Indonesian Army Chief imposed martial law for a period of six months to eliminate Acehnese separatists.\nIran.\nOn 7 September 1978, in response to public demonstrations protesting the perceived government involvement in the death of the son of Ayatollah Khomeini, Mostafa Khomeini, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi appointed Chief of Army Staff General Gholam Ali Oveisi as the military governor of the capital city of Tehran. On 8 September, the government effectively declared martial law on the capital along with several other cities throughout the country, after which further protests erupted that lead to the army opening fire on a group of protesters in Tehran's Jaleh Square on the same day. Estimates on the number of casualties vary; However, according to Iranian human rights activist Emadeddin Baghi, the number of people killed was 88 of which 64 were gunned down in Jaleh Square. The day is often referred to as Black Friday. Unable to control the unrest, the Shah dissolved the civil government headed by Prime Minister Jafar Sharif-Emami on 6 November and appointed General Gholam Reza Azhari as the prime minister whom ultimately failed in his efforts to restore order to the country. As he was preparing to leave the country, the Shah dissolved the military government and appointed Shapour Bakhtiar, a reformist critic of his rule, as the new prime minister on 4 January 1979. Bakhtiar's government fell on 11 February and gave rise to the Islamic Republic and the creation of a new constitution.\nArticle 79 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran forbids the proclamation of martial law without the approval of the Islamic Consultative Assembly.\nIreland.\nIn 1916, during the Easter Rising, Lord Wimborne the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, declared martial law to maintain order in the streets of Dublin. This was later extended both in duration and geographical reach to the whole of the country with the consent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland government. Much of Ireland was declared under martial law by the British authorities during the Irish War of Independence. A large portion of Ireland was also under de facto martial law during the Irish Civil War.\nIn late July 1921 Lord Cave (House of Lords) ruled on an appeal that:\"...the military court, the validity of whose sentence was called into question, was a body possessing no statutory or common law authority...\". The Court of Chancery (Ireland) also ruled that the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 had superseded the power to declare martial law. Any sentences by military tribunals that were not in accordance with that Act were declared void.\nThe current Irish Constitution allows for martial law if the government declares a state of emergency; however capital punishment is prohibited in all circumstances, including a state of emergency.\nIsrael.\nMilitary administrative government was in effect from 1949 to 1966 over some geographical areas of Israel having large Arab populations, primarily the Negev, Galilee, and the Triangle. The residents of these areas were subject to martial law. The Israel Defense Forces enforced strict residency rules. Any Arab not registered in a census taken during November 1948 was deported. Permits from the military governor had to be procured to travel more than a given distance from a person's registered place of residence, and curfew, administrative detentions, and expulsions were common. Although the military administration was officially for geographical areas, and not people, its restrictions were seldom enforced on the Jewish residents of these areas. In the early 1950s, martial law ceased to be in effect for those Arab citizens living in predominantly Jewish cities of Jaffa, Ramla, and Lod, constituting a total of approximately 15% of the Arab population of Israel. But military rule remained in place on the remaining Arab population elsewhere within Israel until 1966.\nThis period is remembered for its extreme crackdown on political rights, as well as unaccountable military brutality. Most political and civil organization was prohibited. Flying of the Palestinian flag, as well as other expressions of Palestinian patriotism were prohibited. Furthermore, despite theoretical guarantee of full political rights, military government personnel frequently made threats against Arab citizens if they did not vote in elections for the candidates favored by the authorities. Perhaps the most commemorated incidence of military brutality in this time period was the Kafr Qasim massacre in 1956, in which the Israel Border Police killed 48 people (19 men, 6 women and 23 children aged 8\u201317) as they were returning home from work in the evening. The Israeli army had ordered that all Arab villages in the proximity of the Green Line be placed under curfew. However, this order came into effect before the residents of these localities, including residents of Kafr Qasim, were notified.\nFollowing the 1967 war, in which the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights in Syria, and the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, martial law over the Palestinian population as well as the Jordanian, Syrian, and Egyptian populations in these areas was put in place. In 1993, the Oslo I agreements facilitated limited self-rule for Palestinians under the Palestinian National Authority. Officially, only parts of Area C in the West Bank are under martial law.\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon war, martial law was declared by Defense Minister Amir Peretz over the north of the country. The Israel Defense Forces were granted the authority to issue instructions to civilians, and to close down offices, schools, camps and factories in cities considered under threat of attack, as well as to impose curfews on cities in the north.\nInstructions of the Home Front Command are obligatory under martial law, rather than merely recommended. The order signed by Peretz was in effect for 48 hours and was extended by the Cabinet and the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee over the war's duration.\nMauritius.\nMauritius is known as being a \"Westminster\" style of democracy but a peculiar system that was imposed in Mauritius during a period of civil unrest in 1968 as an emergency measure, has never been repealed and is still used by the police force there to this day. The system, which has no apparent foundation in the constitution of Mauritius, enables the police to arrest without having to demonstrate reasonable suspicion that a crime has been carried out but simply on the submission of \"provisional information\" to the magistrate. The accused is then placed on remand or bail and required to report to the police or the court on a regular basis, sometimes every day. There are examples of this system being used to intimidate or coerce individuals in civil litigations.\nMyanmar.\nOn 1 February 2021, democratically elected members of Myanmar, known as the National League for Democracy, were overthrown by Myanmar's military, called the Tatmadaw. This military placed their power in a military junta. Five days following the coup, factory workers around Yangon (a region in Myanmar) held protests against the coup regime. On 14 March, security forces killed upwards of sixty-five protestors in the town of Hlaingtharyar. As a result, the military junta declared martial law over the region of Yangon, including over the majority of industrial zones. As of 22 February 2023, Myanmar's military junta has declared martial law over a total of 50 townships in the regions of Chin, Kachin, Karen, Karenni, Mon States, Yangon and Mandalay. News reports indicate that since the military coup in February 2021, and the subsequent declaration of martial law in Myanmar regions, military tribunals have sentenced more than 100 people to death. Reports further indicate that a total of three townships in Myanmar's northwest reside under the \"executive and judicial jurisdiction of regional military commander Maj. Gen. Than Htike,\" who has since been sanctioned by the European Union for alleged human rights violations since Myanmar's declaration of martial law.\nPakistan.\nMartial law was declared in Pakistan on 7 October 1958, by President Iskander Mirza who then appointed General Muhammad Ayub Khan as the Chief Martial Law Administrator and Aziz Ahmad as Secretary General and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. However, three weeks later General Ayub\u2014who had been openly questioning the authority of the government before the imposition of martial law\u2014deposed Iskandar Mirza on 27 October 1958 and assumed the presidency that practically formalized the militarization of the political system in Pakistan. Four years later a new document, Constitution of 1962, was adopted. The second martial law was imposed on 25 March 1969 by Yahya Khan, when President Yahya Khan abrogated the Constitution of 1962 and Ayub Khan handed over power to the Army Commander-in-Chief, General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan. On assuming the presidency, General Yahya Khan acceded to popular demands by abolishing the one-unit system in West Pakistan and ordered general elections on the principle of one man one vote.\nThe civilian martial law was imposed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the first civilian to hold this post in Pakistan after the Bangladesh Liberation War. On 21 December 1971, Bhutto took this post as well as that of President. It was the first civilian martial law.\nThe third was imposed by the General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq on 5 July 1977. After several tumultuous years, which witnessed the secession of East Pakistan to form Bangladesh, politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto took over in 1971 as the first civilian martial law administrator in recent history, imposing selective martial law in areas hostile to his rule, such as the country's largest province, Balochistan. Following widespread civil disorder, General Zia overthrew Bhutto and imposed martial law in its totality on 5 July 1977, in a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat. Unstable areas were brought under control through indirect military action, such as Balochistan under Martial Law Governor, General Rahimuddin Khan. Civilian government resumed in 1988 following General Zia's death in an aircraft crash.\nOn 12 October 1999, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was dissolved, and the Army took control once more. A fourth martial law was imposed. General Pervez Musharraf took the title of Chief Executive until the President of Pakistan Rafiq Tarar resigned and General Musharraf became president. Elections were held in October 2002 and Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali became Prime Minister of Pakistan. Jamali's premiership was followed by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Shaukat Aziz. While the government was supposed to be run by an elected prime minister, there was a common understanding that important decisions were made by the President General Musharraf.\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf pointed out it as an emergency, not Martial Law. The Constitution, Parliament and Provincial Assemblies were suspended and Musharraf issued \"Proclamation of Emergency\" on 14 October 1999.\nOn 3 November 2007, President General Musharraf declared the state of emergency in the country which is claimed to be equivalent to the state of martial law as the constitution of Pakistan of 1973 was suspended, and the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court were fired.\nOn 12 November 2007, Musharraf issued some amendments in the Military Act, which gave the armed forces some additional powers.\nPhilippines.\nDuring the Second World War, President Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel placed the Philippines (then a client state of Imperial Japan) under martial law via Proclamation No. 29, dated 21 September 1944 and enforced the following day at 09:00 PST. Proclamation No. 30 was issued on 23 September, declaring the existence of a state of war between the Philippines and the United States and the United Kingdom, effective 10:00 that day.\nThe country was under martial law again from 1972 to 1981 under President Ferdinand Marcos. Proclamation No. 1081 (\"Proclaiming a State of Martial Law in the Philippines\") was signed on 21 September 1972 and came into force on 23 September. The official reason behind the declaration was to suppress increasing civil strife and the threat of a communist takeover, particularly after a series of bombings (including the Plaza Miranda bombing) and an assassination attempt on Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in Mandaluyong.\nThe policy of martial law was initially well received, but it eventually proved unpopular as the military's human rights abuses (e.g. use of torture in intelligence gathering, forced disappearances), along with the decadence and excess of the Marcos family and their allies, had emerged. Coupled with economic downturns, these factors fermented dissent in various sectors (e.g. the urban middle class) that crystallised with the assassination of jailed oppositionist Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983, and widespread fraud in the 1986 snap elections. These eventually led to the 1986 People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and forced him into exile in Hawaii where he died in 1989; his rival presidential candidate and Aquino's widow, Corazon, was installed as his successor.\nDuring this 9-year period, curfews were implemented as a safety measure. Majority of radio and television networks were suspended. Journalists who were accused of speaking against the government were taken as political prisoners, some of them to be physically abused and tortured by the authorities.\nOthers have stated that the implementation of Martial Law was taken advantage by the Marcos regime. Billion pesos worth of property and ill-gotten wealth was said to be acquired by Marcos' consort, First Lady Imelda Marcos. This alleged money laundering issue was brought back recently, particularly in the \"PiliPinas Debates 2016\" for the recently held Philippine Presidential Elections on May 9, 2016. Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., Marcos' son, ran for the vice presidency and lost.\nThere were rumours that President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was planning to impose martial law to end military \"coup d'etat\" plots, general civilian dissatisfaction, and criticism of her legitimacy arising from the dubious results of the 2004 presidential elections. Instead, a State of National Emergency was imposed in 2006 from 24 February to 3 March, in order to quash a coup attempt and quell protesters.\nOn 4 December 2009, President Arroyo officially placed the Province of Maguindanao under a state of martial law through Proclamation No. 1959. As with the last imposition, the declaration suspended the writ of habeas corpus in the province. The announcement came days after hundreds of government troops were sent to the province to raid the armories of the powerful Ampatuan clan. The Ampatuans were implicated in the massacre of 58 persons, including women from the rival Mangudadatu clan, human rights lawyers, and 31 media workers. Cited as one of the bloodiest incidents of political violence in Philippine history, the massacre was condemned worldwide as the worst loss of life of media professionals in one day.\nOn 23 May 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law throughout the main southern island of Mindanao, through Proclamation No. 216, due to the attack of Maute Group in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur. It was announced in a briefing in Moscow by Secretary Ernesto Abella, and was in effect until December 2019.\nPoland.\nMartial law was introduced in Polish People's Republic on 13 December 1981, by General Wojciech Jaruzelski to prevent the extraparliamentary opposition from gaining popularity and political power in the country. Thousands of people linked to the Solidarity Movement, including Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, were arbitrarily arrested and detained. Approximately 91 deaths are attributed to the martial law, including 9 miners shot by the police force during the pacification of striking Wujek Coal Mine. Curfews, censorship and food rationing were in place. A nationwide travel ban was imposed. The martial law was eventually lifted on 22 July 1983. Contemporary Polish society is divided in opinion on the necessity of introducing martial law in 1981. It is viewed by some as a lesser evil that was necessary to stop a potential Soviet military intervention as the Warsaw Pact, which Poland signed in 1955, enabled other Eastern Bloc countries to intervene if they believed that communism was in danger.\nRussian Federation.\nIn the Russian Federation recourse to martial law is governed by a document passed 30 January 2002 as No. 1-FKZ (1-\u0424\u041a\u0417).\nSouth Korea.\nIn October 1946, United States Army Military Government in Korea declared martial law as a result of the Daegu Riot. On 17 November 1948, President Syngman Rhee's regime proclaimed martial law in order to quell the Jeju uprising. On 19 April 1960, the Rhee government proclaimed martial law again in order to suppress the April Revolution.\nFollowing the 12\u00b712 Military Insurrection of 12 December 1979, General Chun Doo-hwan launched the Coup d'\u00e9tat of May Seventeenth in 1980 and forced the Cabinet to extend martial law nationwide, which set off the Gwangju Uprising of 18 May 1980.\nOn 3 December 2024, president Yoon Suk Yeol declared a state of emergency martial law to \"safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements\". However, on 4 December 2024 at 01:01 AM KST, 190 lawmakers who were present at the National Assembly voted unanimously to lift martial law. Martial law was formally lifted by president Yoon around 4:50\u00a0a.m.; martial law was in effect for about six hours.\nSwitzerland.\nThere are no provisions for martial law as such in Switzerland. Under the \"Army Law\" of 1995, the Army can be called upon by cantonal (state) authorities for assistance (\"Assistenzdienst\"). This regularly happens in the case of natural disasters or special protection requirements (e.g., for the World Economic Forum in Davos). This assistance generally requires parliamentary authorization, though, and takes place in the regular legal framework and under the civilian leadership of the cantonal authorities. On the other hand, the federal authorities are authorized to use the Army to enforce law and order when the Cantons no longer can or want to do so (\"Ordnungsdienst\"). With this came many significant points of reference. This power largely fell into disuse after World War II.\nSyria.\nThe martial law regime between the 1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat and 2011 is the longest ranging period of active martial law. Similar to other countries, martial law in Syria was established as a response to the declaration of a state of emergency. When on 8 March 1963, the Baath Party seized power, the prime minister of Syria, acting as the martial law governor, was granted extraordinary powers through his declaration of a state of emergency. Syrian laws enabled the martial law governor to place many restrictions on freedoms of individuals, such as with respect to \"meetings, residence, travel and passage in specific places or at particular times; to preventatively arrest anyone suspected of endangering public security and order; to authorize investigation of persons and places; and to delegate any person to perform any of these tasks\". However, the state of emergency declaration in Syria remained intact for nearly 50 consecutive years, prompting intervention and commentary from the international community.\nInternational bodies declared such an extended state of emergency as against international law. Specifically, it was held to be in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereinafter \"ICCPR\"), which Syria is a party to. Article 4 of the ICCPR \"limits the application of emergency laws to a time of 'public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed.' It further stipulates that the state parties to the ICCPR may derogate from their obligations under the treaty only 'to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law.'\"\nIn 2000, Syria responded to the allegations from the ICCPR, and countered that it was in compliance with the ICCPR in a report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. Syria justified this ongoing declaration of emergency through their concerns of ongoing threats of war by Israel.\nOn 28 July 2005, the United Nations responded: \"Noting with concern that the state of emergency declared some forty years ago is still in force and provides for many derogations in law or practice from the rights guaranteed under articles 9 14, 19, and 22, among others, of the Covenant, without any convincing explanation being given as to the relevance of these derogations to the conflict with Israel and as to the necessity of these derogations to meet the exigencies of the situation claimed to have been created by the conflict.\" In further response, Syria reiterated their position that the ongoing emergency declaration was due to a continued threat of war with Israel. Despite ongoing dialogue over a period of years between Syria, the ICCPR, and the United Nations, the declaration remained in effect for the next six years from the 2005 statement made by the United Nations advising of the invalidity of such an extensive state of emergency declaration.\nUltimately, after 48 years, in April 2011, President Bashar al-Assad ended Syria's state of emergency, thereby signaling the end of the longest martial law ruling in history. This came as a response to protests demanding freedom from the historically long police rule over Syria.\nTaiwan.\nMartial law was in force in Taiwan from 1949 to 1987, for a total of 38 consecutive years. Martial law in Taiwan refers to the periods in the history of Taiwan after World War II that are under the control by the Republic of China Armed Forces of the Kuomintang-led Government of the Republic of China regime. This qualified as \"the longest imposition of martial law by a regime anywhere in the world\" at that time, but has since been surpassed by Brunei and Syria.\nThailand.\nMartial law in Thailand derives statutory authority from the Act promulgated by King Vajiravudh following the abortive Palace Revolt of 1912, entitled \"Martial Law, B.E. 2457 (1914)\". Many coups have been attempted or succeeded since then, but the Act governing martial law, amended in 1942, 1944, 1959 and 1972, has remained essentially the same. On 19 September 2006, the Royal Thai Armed Forces declared martial law following a bloodless military coup in the Thai capital of Bangkok, declared while Prime Minister Shinawatra was in New York City to address the United Nations General Assembly. General Sonthi Boonyaratglin took the control of the government, and soon after handed the premiership to ex-Army Chief General Surayud. Sonthi himself is Chief of the Administrative Reform Council. At 3 am, on 20 May 2014, following seven months of civil and political unrest, Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha, declared martial law nationwide.\nThe nationwide martial law, which was imposed just prior to a coup staged by the army, was lifted on 1 April 2015, through an approval by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. However, it was replaced by a new security order; and the military retained sweeping powers.\nIn the country's Muslim-dominated south, martial law has been enforced amid ongoing conflict involving Islamic separatists. On 5 January 2004, the national government declared such in the provinces of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat; and on 3 November 2005, the same was imposed in two districts of Songkhla. Since 2025, there are plans to lift it in four districts of the first three border provinces; but these have been postponed due to increasing violent attacks.\nAmid worsening disputes with neighboring Cambodia, on 25 July 2025, a day after the fighting began near the border, the country's Border Defence Command declared martial law in the districts bordering Cambodia\u2014seven in Chanthaburi and one in Trat.\nTurkey.\nSince the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Turkish Armed Forces conducted three coups d'\u00e9tat and declared martial law. The first instance was established following the 1960 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat, which toppled down the Democrat Party government and executed its leaders. The second was established after the 1971 Turkish military memorandum for a short period of time to impose reforms to confront escalated domestic violence, which proved unsuccessful. As a result of conflicts between far-left and far-right groups in Turkey growing, martial law was established for the third time in 1978, followed by the 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat that was kept in place until 1983. The martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency in a limited number of provinces that lasted until November 2002. The Peace at Home Council's official statement in a broadcast on TRT during the 2016 coup attempt included a declaration of martial law.\nUkraine.\nThe restrictions from martial law were defined in a 2015 law \"On the Legal Regime of Martial Law\". The President decides on the declaration of martial law and then Verkhovna Rada must approve it.\nMartial law was first declared in Ukraine in 2018 and as a response to Russian hostilities. On 26 November 2018, lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada overwhelmingly backed President Petro Poroshenko's imposition of martial law along Ukraine's coastal regions and those bordering the Russian Federation and Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway state of Moldova which has Russian troops stationed in its territory, in response to the firing upon and seizure of Ukrainian naval ships by Russia near the Crimean Peninsula a day earlier. A total of 276 lawmakers in Kyiv backed the measure, which took effect on 28 November 2018 and automatically expired in 30 days.\nThis period of martial law was both intended to be, and ultimately was, limited in scope. Then-president Poroshenko proposed a 60-day martial law period, but ultimately a 30-day period of martial law was signed into effect. This period of martial law came to an end at its scheduled 30-day mark. This declaration was limited to specific areas of Ukraine, including territories along the Russia-Ukraine border, the Moldova-Ukraine border, the coasts of the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Azov \u2013 Kerch international waters.\nOn 24 February 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared martial law in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Then, on 15 March, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted the Law of Ukraine \"On Organizing Labor Relations under Martial Law\" which came into effect on 24 March 2022, and \"clarified relevant restrictions of the constitutional right and freedoms and set out special rules applicable to labor relations to replace the 'normal' rules of the Labour Code of Ukraine.\" Article 4(7) of the Law of Ukraine holds that the \"General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine shall direct, coordinate and control the activities of regional military administrations on defense, public safety, and order, and implement measures of martial law. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine shall direct, coordinate and control the regional military administrations regarding other issues.\"\nAs of November\u00a02023[ [update]], there have been ten extensions to the Ukrainian declaration of martial law. This has led to the 2023 legislative and 2024 presidential elections being delayed, due to elections not being allowed to be held in times of martial law.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, martial law has been declared for a state or other locality under various circumstances including after a direct foreign attack (Hawaii after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; New Orleans during the Battle of New Orleans); after a major disaster (Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871; San Francisco after the earthquake of 1906); and in response to chaos associated with protests and mob action (San Francisco during the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike; Montgomery, Alabama, following the mob actions against the Freedom Riders). It has also been declared by renegade local leaders seeking to avoid arrest or challenges to their authority (Nauvoo, Illinois by Joseph Smith during the Illinois Mormon War and Utah by Governor Brigham Young during the Utah War).\nThe martial law concept in the United States is closely tied with the right of \"habeas corpus\", which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend \"habeas corpus\" is related to the imposition of martial law. Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states, \"The Privilege of the Writ of \"Habeas Corpus\" shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" There have been many instances of the use of the military within the borders of the United States, such as during the Whiskey Rebellion and in the South during the Civil Rights Movement, but these acts are not tantamount to a declaration of martial law.\nIn United States law, martial law is limited by several court decisions handed down between the American Civil War and World War II. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which, depending on the circumstances, can forbid U.S. military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.(\u00a0https://, original at 20\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://)\nThe legality of the implementation of martial law was examined in 1866, in the court case \"Ex parte Milligan\", 71 U.S. 2 (1866). Through this case, the Supreme Court established that trying civilians in military tribunals was unconstitutional unless there were no civilian courts available. Today, the ability to declare martial law over the United States is not explicitly granted in the Constitution. Despite this, martial law has been declared at least 68 times in the United States.\nThere are two main schools of thought regarding the declaration of martial law. First, some scholars argue that the ability to declare martial law is a constitutional power vested in Congress, and in some cases of emergency, the President. The second school of thought believes that the power to declare martial law in the United States is not expressed in any law, but rather arises as a matter of necessity and in the interests of \"national self-preservation\". As it stands today, there is no explicit provision in the Constitution granting powers to any specific body of government to declare martial law.\nHistorically, martial law has been declared in response to national emergencies in the United States. In Hawaii, for example, martial law was instituted following the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Supreme Court evaluated the legality of declaring martial law in Hawaii in the court case \"Duncan v. Kahanamoku\", 327 U.S. 304 (1946). Here, the Supreme Court held that although Hawaii was not yet a state, the legality of declaring martial law must be analyzed as though Hawaii was one. As a result, the United States determined that the safety of the residents of Hawaii was their responsibility, and martial law was implemented throughout the Hawaiian Islands. \nIn June 1970, martial law was effected in the small university-town of Isla Vista, California next to the University of California at Santa Barbara at the acme of the 1969-1970 student protests against the Vietnam War. Student demonstrations had engendered aggressive police repression, which reached an apex when students burned down the Isla Vista Bank of America building. One student, Kevin Moran, who was working to put out the flames, was shot and killed by police. In response, Governor Ronald Reagan deployed the national guard in Isla Vista and effected a 6am to 6pm curfew. This set of events was one of the rare instances of full-scale martial law being effected in the United States outside of wartime.\nYugoslavia.\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars in 1991, a \"State of Direct War Threat\" was declared. Although forces from the whole SFRY were included in this conflict, martial law was never announced, but after secession, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina declared martial law. On 23 March 1999, a \"State of Direct War Threat\" was declared in Yugoslavia, following the possibility of NATO air-strikes. The day after strikes began, martial law was declared, which lasted until June 1999, although strikes ended on 10 June, following Kumanovo Treaty.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Van Meegeren became a national hero after World War II when it was revealed that he had sold a forged painting to \"Reichsmarschall\" Hermann G\u00f6ring during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.\nVan Meegeren attempted to make a career as an artist, but art critics dismissed his work. He decided to prove his talent by forging paintings from the Dutch Golden Age. Leading experts of the time accepted his paintings as genuine 17th-century works, including art collector Abraham Bredius.\nDuring World War II, G\u00f6ring purchased one of Van Meegeren's \"Vermeers\", which became one of his most prized possessions. Following the war, Van Meegeren was arrested on a charge of selling cultural property to the Nazis. Facing a possible death penalty, he confessed that the painting was a forgery, and was subsequently convicted and sentenced to one year in prison. However, he died less than two months later after suffering two heart attacks. A biography in 1967 estimated that Van Meegeren duped buyers out of more than US$30million, his victims including the Dutch government.\nEarly years.\nHan (diminutive for Henri or Henricus) van Meegeren was born 10 October 1889, the third of five children of Augusta Louisa Henrietta Camps and Hendrikus Johannes van Meegeren, a French and history teacher at the Kweekschool (training college for schoolteachers) in the provincial city of Deventer.\nWhile attending the Higher Burger School, Han met teacher and painter Bartus Korteling (1853\u20131930) who became his mentor. Korteling had been inspired by Johannes Vermeer and taught Van Meegeren Vermeer's techniques. Korteling had rejected the Impressionist movement and other modern trends as decadent, degenerate art, and his strong personal influence may have led Van Meegeren to do likewise.\nVan Meegeren's father did not share his son's love of art; he often forced Han to write a hundred times, \"I know nothing, I am nothing, I am capable of nothing.\" Instead, Han's father compelled him to study architecture at the Delft University of Technology in 1907. He received drawing and painting lessons, as well. He easily passed his preliminary examinations but never took the \"Ingenieurs\" (final) examination because he did not want to become an architect. He nevertheless proved to be an apt architect and designed the clubhouse for his rowing club in Delft, which still exists (see image).\nIn 1913, Van Meegeren gave up his architecture studies and concentrated on drawing and painting at the art school in The Hague. On 8 January 1913, he received the prestigious Gold Medal from the Technical University in Delft for his \"Study of the Interior of the Church of Saint Lawrence\" (Laurenskerk) in Rotterdam. The award was given every five years to an art student who created the best work, and was accompanied by a gold medal.\nOn 18 April 1912, Van Meegeren married fellow art student Anna de Voogt, who was pregnant with their first child. The couple initially lived with Anna's grandmother in Rijswijk, and their son Jacques Henri Emil van Meegeren was born there on 26 August 1912.\nCareer as a legitimate painter.\nIn 1914, Van Meegeren moved his family to Scheveningen and completed the diploma examination at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, which allowed him to teach. He took a position as the assistant to the Professor of Drawing and Art History. In March 1915, his daughter Pauline was born, later called Inez. To supplement his small salary of 75 guldens per month, Han sketched posters and painted pictures for Christmas cards, still-life, landscapes, and portraits for the commercial art trade. Many of these paintings are quite valuable today.\nVan Meegeren's first exhibition was held from April to May 1917 at the Kunstzaal Pictura in the Hague. In December 1919, he was accepted as a member by the Haagse Kunstkring, an exclusive society of writers and painters who met weekly on the premises of the Ridderzaal. Although he had been accepted, he was ultimately denied the position of chairman. He painted the tame roe deer belonging to Princess Juliana. The painting, \"Hertje\" (\"The Fawn\" or \"The Deer\"), was completed in 1921, and became popular in the Netherlands. He undertook numerous journeys to Belgium, France, Italy, and England, and acquired a name for himself as a portraitist, earning commissions from English and American socialites who spent their winter vacations on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. His clients were impressed by his understanding of the 17th-century techniques of the Dutch masters. Throughout his life, Van Meegeren signed his own paintings with his own signature.\nBy all accounts, infidelity was responsible for the breakup of Van Meegeren's marriage to Anna de Voogt; the couple divorced on 19 July 1923. Anna moved to Paris, where Van Meegeren visited his children from time to time. He dedicated himself to portraiture and began producing forgeries to increase his income.\nHe married actress Johanna Theresia Oerlemans, with whom he had been living for the previous three years, in Woerden in 1928. Johanna's stage name was Jo van Walraven. She had previously been married to art critic and journalist Dr. C H. de Boer (Carel de Boer). She brought their daughter Viola into the Van Meegeren household.\nRejection by the critics.\nVan Meegeren had become a well-known painter in the Netherlands with the success of \"Hertje\" (1921) and \"Straatzangers\" (1928). His first legitimate copies were painted in 1923, his \"Laughing Cavalier\" and \"Happy Smoker\", both in the style of Frans Hals. By 1928, the similarity of Van Meegeren's paintings to those of the Old Masters began to draw the reproach of Dutch art critics, who said that his talent was limited outside of copying other artists' work.\nOne critic wrote that he was \"a gifted technician who has made a sort of composite facsimile of the Renaissance school, he has every virtue except originality\". Van Meegeren responded in a series of aggressive articles in \"De Kemphaan\" (\"The Ruff\"), a monthly periodical published by Van Meegeren and journalist Jan Ubink from April 1928 until March 1930. Jonathan Lopez writes that Van Meegeren \"denounced modern painting as 'art-Bolshevism' in the articles, described its proponents as a 'slimy bunch of woman-haters and negro-lovers,' and invoked the image of 'a Jew with a handcart' as a symbol for the international art market\".\nVan Meegeren set out to prove to the art critics that he could more than \"copy\" the Dutch Masters; he would produce a work to rival theirs.\nThe \"perfect forgery\".\nIn 1932, Van Meegeren moved to the southern French village of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin with his wife. There he rented a furnished mansion called \"Primavera\" and set out to define the chemical and technical procedures that would be necessary to create his perfect forgeries. He bought authentic 17th-century canvases and mixed his own paints from raw materials (such as lapis lazuli, white lead, indigo, and cinnabar) using old formulas to ensure that they could pass as authentic. He made badger-hair paintbrushes similar to those that Vermeer was known to have used.\nHe came up with a way to use phenol formaldehyde (Bakelite) to make paints harden after application, making paintings appear 300 years old. Van Meegeren would first mix his paints with lilac oil, to stop the colours from fading or yellowing in heat. (This caused his studio to smell so strongly of lilacs that he kept a vase of fresh lilacs nearby so that visitors would not be suspicious.) Then, after completing a painting, he would bake it at to to harden the paint, and then roll a cylinder over it to increase cracking. Later, he would wash the painting in India ink which filled the cracks in black.\nIt took Van Meegeren six years to work out his techniques, but ultimately he was pleased with his work on both artistic and deceptive levels. Two of these trial paintings were painted as if by Vermeer: \"Lady Reading Music\", after the genuine paintings \"Woman in Blue Reading a Letter\" at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam; and \"Lady Playing Music\", after Vermeer's \"Woman With a Lute Near a Window\" hanging in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Van Meegeren did not sell these paintings; both are now at the Rijksmuseum.\nFollowing a journey to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Van Meegeren painted \"The Supper at Emmaus\". In 1934 Van Meegeren had bought a seventeenth-century mediocre Dutch painting, \"The Awakening of Lazarus\", and on this foundation he created his masterpiece \"\u00e0 la Vermeer\". The experts thought that Vermeer had studied in Italy, so Van Meegeren used the version of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio's \"Supper at Emmaus\", at Milan's Pinacoteca di Brera, as a model. He gave the painting to his friend, attorney C. A. Boon, telling him that it was a genuine Vermeer, and asked him to show it to art historian Abraham Bredius in Monaco. In October 1932, Bredius had already published an article about two recently discovered alleged Vermeer paintings, which he defined as \"Landscape\" and \"Man and Woman at a Spinet\". He said the former was a fake, and described it as \"a landscape of the eighteenth century into which had been imported scraps of the 'View of Delft'\" (mostly the Delft New Church's tower). He judged \"Man and Woman at a Spinet\", however, not only to be an \"authentic Vermeer\", but also \"very beautiful\", and \"one of the finest gems of the master's \u0153uvre\". In September 1937, Bredius examined \"The Supper at Emmaus\" and, writing in \"The Burlington Magazine\", he accepted it as a genuine Vermeer and praised it very highly as \"\"the\" masterpiece of Johannes Vermeer of Delft\". The evidence usually required, such as resilience of colours against chemical solutions, white lead analysis, X-ray images, and micro-spectroscopy of the colouring substances, confirmed it to be an authentic Vermeer.\nThe painting was purchased by The Rembrandt Society for fl.520,000 (\u20ac235,000 or about \u20ac4,640,000 today), with the aid of wealthy shipowner Willem van der Vorm, and donated to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. In 1938, the piece was highlighted in a special exhibition for Queen Wilhelmina's Jubilee at a Rotterdam museum, along with 450 Dutch old masters dating from 1400 to 1800. A. Feulner wrote in the \"Magazine for [the] History of Art\", \"In the rather isolated area in which the Vermeer picture hung, it was as quiet as in a chapel. The feeling of the consecration overflows on the visitors, although the picture has no ties to ritual or church\", and despite the presence of masterpieces of Rembrandt and Gr\u00fcnewald, it was defined as \"the spiritual centre\" of the whole exhibition.\nIn 1938, Van Meegeren moved to Nice, buying a 12-bedroom estate at Les Ar\u00e8nes de Cimiez with the proceeds from the sale of the painting. On the walls of the estate hung several genuine Old Masters. Two of his better forgeries were made here, \"Interior with Card Players\" and \"Interior with Drinkers\", both displaying the signature of Pieter de Hooch. During his time in Nice, he painted his \"Last Supper I\" in the style of Vermeer.\nHe returned to the Netherlands in September 1939 as the Second World War threatened. After a short stay in Amsterdam, he moved to the village of Laren in 1940. Throughout 1941, Van Meegeren issued his designs, which he published in 1942 as a large and luxurious book entitled \"Han van Meegeren: Teekeningen I (Drawings nr I)\". He also created several forgeries during this time, including \"The Head of Christ\", \"The Last Supper II\", \"The Blessing of Jacob\", \"The Adulteress\", and \"The Washing of the Feet\"\u2014all in the manner of Vermeer. On 18 December 1943, he divorced his wife, but this was only a formality; the couple remained together, but a large share of his capital was transferred to her accounts as a safeguard against the uncertainties of the war.\nIn December 1943, the Van Meegerens moved to the exclusive Keizersgracht 321 in Amsterdam. His forgeries had earned him between 5.5 and 7.5\u00a0million guilders (or about US$25\u201330\u00a0million today). He used this money to purchase a large amount of real estate, jewellery, and works of art, and to further his luxurious lifestyle. In a 1946 interview, he told Marie Louise Doudart de la Gr\u00e9e that he owned 52 houses and 15 country houses around Laren, among them \"grachtenhuizen\", mansions along Amsterdam's canals.\nHermann G\u00f6ring.\nIn 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, one of Van Meegeren's agents sold the Vermeer forgery \"Christ with the Adulteress\" to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl. Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery; as Van Meegeren's health declined, so did the quality of his work. He chain-smoked, drank heavily, and became addicted to morphine-laced sleeping pills. However, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage.\nNazi \"Reichsmarschall\" Hermann G\u00f6ring traded 137 looted paintings for \"Christ with the Adulteress\". On 25 August 1943, G\u00f6ring hid his collection of looted artwork, including \"Christ with the Adulteress\", in an Austrian salt mine, along with 6,750 other pieces of artwork looted by the Nazis. On 17 May 1945, Allied forces entered the salt mine and Captain Harry Anderson discovered the painting.\nIn May 1945, the Allied forces questioned Miedl regarding the newly discovered Vermeer. Based on Miedl's confession, the painting was traced back to Van Meegeren. On 29 May 1945, he was arrested and charged with fraud and aiding and abetting the enemy. He was remanded to the Weteringschans prison as an alleged Nazi collaborator and plunderer of Dutch cultural property, threatened by the authorities with the death penalty. He labored over his predicament, but eventually confessed to forging paintings attributed to Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch. He exclaimed, \"The painting in G\u00f6ring's hands is not, as you assume, a Vermeer of Delft, but a Van Meegeren! I painted the picture!\" It took some time to verify this, and Van Meegeren was detained for several months in the Headquarters of the Military Command at Herengracht 458 in Amsterdam.\nTo prove that the \"Vermeer\" sold to the Nazis was actually a Van Meegeren rather than a priceless Dutch treasure, Van Meegeren painted his last forgery between July and December 1945 watched by reporters and court-appointed witnesses: \"Jesus among the Doctors\", also called \"Young Christ in the Temple\", not a copy but in the style of Vermeer. After completing the painting, he was transferred to the fortress prison \"Blauwkapel\". Van Meegeren was released from prison in January or February 1946.\nTrial and prison sentence.\nThe trial of Han van Meegeren began on 29 October 1947 in Room 4 of the Regional Court in Amsterdam. The collaboration charges had been dropped, since the expert panel had found that the supposed Vermeer sold to Hermann G\u00f6ring had been a forgery and was, therefore, not the cultural property of the Netherlands. Public prosecutor H. A. Wassenbergh brought charges of forgery and fraud and demanded a sentence of two years in prison.\nThe court commissioned an international group of experts to address the authenticity of Van Meegeren's paintings. The commission included curators, professors, and doctors from the Netherlands, Belgium, and England, and was led by the director of the chemical laboratory at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Paul B. Coremans. The commission examined the eight paintings attributed to Vermeer and Frans Hals which Van Meegeren had identified as forgeries. With the help of the commission, Dr. Coremans was able to determine the chemical composition of Van Meegeren's paints.\nHe found that the paint contained the phenolformaldehyde resins Bakelite and Albertol, not invented until the 20th century, as paint hardeners; and a bottle had been found in Van Meegeren's studio. This proved that the paintings could not be genuine.\nThe commission also suggested that the dust in the craquelure was too homogeneous to be of natural origin. It appeared to come from India ink, which had accumulated even in areas that natural dirt or dust would never have reached. The paint had become so hard that alcohol, strong acids, and bases did not attack the surface, a clear indication that the surface had not been formed in a natural manner. The craquelure on the surface did not always match that in the ground layer, which would certainly have been the case with a natural craquelure. Thus, the test results obtained by the commission appeared to confirm that the works were forgeries created by Van Meegeren, but their authenticity continued to be debated by some of the experts until 1967 and 1977, when new investigative techniques were used to analyze the paintings (see below).\nOn 12 November 1947, the Fourth Chamber of the Amsterdam Regional Court found Han van Meegeren guilty of forgery and fraud, and sentenced him to one year in prison. The trial was widely covered in the media, and Van Meegeren became a folk hero.\nDeath.\nWhile waiting to be moved to prison, Van Meegeren returned to his home, where his health continued to decline. During this last month of his life, he strolled freely around his neighbourhood.\nVan Meegeren suffered a heart attack on 26 November 1947, the last day to appeal the ruling, and was rushed to the Valeriuskliniek, a hospital in Amsterdam, where he suffered a second heart attack on 29 December, and was pronounced dead on 30 December 1947, at the age of 58. Soon after his death, a plaster death mask was made, which was acquired by the Rijksmuseum in 2014. His family and several hundred of his friends attended his funeral at the Driehuis Westerveld Crematorium chapel. In 1948, his urn was buried in the general cemetery in the village of Diepenveen (municipality of Deventer).\nAftermath.\nAfter his death, the court ruled that Van Meegeren's estate be auctioned and the proceeds from his property and the sale of his counterfeits be used to refund the buyers of his works and to pay income taxes on the sale of his paintings. Van Meegeren had filed for bankruptcy in December 1945. On 5 and 6 September 1950, the contents of his Amsterdam house were auctioned, along with 738 other pieces of furniture and works of art, including numerous paintings by old and new masters from his private collection. The house was auctioned separately on 4 September.\nThe proceeds amounted to 123,000 guilders. Van Meegeren's unsigned \"The Last Supper\u00a0I\" was bought for 2,300 guilders, while \"Jesus among the Doctors\" (which Van Meegeren had painted while in detention) sold for 3,000 guilders (about US$800, or about US$7,000 today). Today the painting hangs in a Johannesburg church. The sale of the entire estate amounted to 242,000 guilders (about US$60,000, or about US$500,000 today).\nThroughout his trial and bankruptcy, Van Meegeren maintained that his second wife Jo had nothing to do with his forgeries. A large part of his considerable wealth had been transferred to her when they divorced, and the money would have been confiscated if she had been ruled to be an accomplice. Though some biographers believe she must have known the truth, her involvement was never proven and she was able to keep her substantial capital. Jo outlived her husband by many years, in luxury, until her death at the age of 91.\nM. Jean Decoen's objection.\nM. Jean Decoen, a Brussels art expert and restorer, stated in his 1951 book he believed \"The Supper at Emmaus\" and \"The Last Supper\u00a0II\" to be genuine Vermeers, and demanded that the paintings should again be examined. He also claimed that Van Meegeren used these paintings as a model for his forgeries. Daniel George Van Beuningen, the buyer of \"The Last Supper\u00a0II\", \"Interior with Drinkers\", and \"The Head of Christ\", demanded that Dr. Paul Coremans publicly admit that he had erred in his analysis. Coremans refused and Van Beuningen sued him, alleging that Coremans's wrongful branding of \"The Last Supper\u00a0II\" diminished the value of his \"Vermeer\" and asking for compensation of \u00a3500,000 (about US$1.3\u00a0million, or about US$10\u00a0million today).\nThe first trial in Brussels was won by Coremans, because the court adopted the same reasoning of the court ruling at Van Meegeren's trial. A second trial was delayed owing to van Beuningen's death on 29 May 1955. \nIn 1958 the court heard the case on behalf of van Beuningen's heirs. Coremans managed to give the definitive evidence of the forgeries by showing a photograph of a \"Hunting Scene\", attributed to A. Hondius, exactly the same scene which was visible with X-ray under the surface of the alleged Vermeer's \"Last Supper\". Moreover, Coremans brought a witness to the courtroom who confirmed that Van Meegeren bought the \"Hunt scene\" in 1940. The court found in favour of Coremans, and the findings of his commission were upheld.\nFurther investigations.\nIn 1967, the Artists Material Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh examined several of the \"Vermeers\" in their collection, under the direction of Robert Feller and Bernard Keisch. The examination confirmed that several of their paintings were in fact created using materials invented in the 20th century. They concluded that they could be Van Meegeren forgeries. The test results obtained by the Carnegie Mellon team are summarized below.\nHan van Meegeren knew that white lead was used during Vermeer's time, but he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade. In the 17th century, lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed both in isotope composition and in the content of trace elements. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing trace but significant quantities of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.\nForgeries in which modern lead or white lead pigment has been used can be recognized by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead that is part of the uranium-238 radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, Polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used.\nThe white lead in the painting \"The Supper at Emmaus\" had polonium-210 values of 8.5\u00b11.4 and radium-226 (part of the uranium-238 radioactive decay series) values of 0.8\u00b10.3. In contrast, the white lead found in Dutch paintings from 1600 to 1660 had polonium-210 values of 0.23\u00b10.27 and radium-226 values of 0.40\u00b10.47.\nIn 1977, another investigation was undertaken by the States forensic labs of the Netherlands using up-to-date techniques, including gas chromatography, to formally confirm the origin of six Van Meegeren forgeries that had been alleged to be genuine Vermeers, including the \"Emmaus\" and the \"Last Supper\". The conclusions of the 1946 commission were reaffirmed and upheld by the Dutch judicial system.\nIn 1998, A&amp;E ran a TV program called \"Scams, Schemes &amp; Scoundrels\" highlighting Van Meegeren's life and art forgeries, many of which had been confiscated as Nazi loot. The program was hosted by skeptic James Randi.\nIn July 2011, the BBC TV programme \"Fake or Fortune\" investigated a copy of Dirck van Baburen's \"The Procuress\" owned by the Courtauld Institute. Opinion had been divided as to whether it was a 17th-century studio work or a Van Meegeren fake. The programme used chemical analysis of the paint to show that it contained bakelite, proving that the painting was a 20th-century fake.\nLegacy.\nIn 2008, Harvard-educated art historian Jonathan Lopez published \"The Man Who Made Vermeers, Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han Van Meegeren\". His extensive research confirmed that Van Meegeren started to make forgeries, not so much because of feeling misunderstood and undervalued by art critics as some maintain, but for the income that it generated, which he needed to support his addictions and lavish lifestyle.\nVan Meegeren's father was said to have once told Van Meegeren, \"You are a cheat and always will be.\" Van Meegeren sent a signed copy of his own art book to Adolf Hitler, which turned up in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin complete with an inscription (in German): \"To my beloved F\u00fchrer in grateful tribute, from H. van Meegeren, Laren, North Holland, 1942\". He only admitted the signature was his own, although the entire inscription was by the same hand. He bought up homes of several departed Jewish families in Amsterdam and held lavish parties while much of the country was hungry. On the other hand, his brothers and sisters perceived him as loyal, generous, and affectionate, and he was always loving and helpful to his own children.\nVan Meegeren continued to paint after his arrest, signing his works with his own name. His new-found profile ensured quick sales of his new paintings, often selling at prices that were many times higher than before he had been unmasked as a forger. Van Meegeren also told the news media that he had \"an offer from a Manhattan gallery to come to the U.S. and paint portraits 'in the 17th-century manner' at US$6,000 a throw\".\nA Dutch opinion poll conducted in October 1947 placed Han van Meegeren's popularity second in the nation, behind only the Prime Minister's and slightly ahead of Prince Bernhard, the husband of Princess Juliana. The Dutch people viewed Van Meegeren as a cunning trickster who had successfully fooled the Dutch art experts and, more importantly, Hermann G\u00f6ring. In fact, according to a contemporary account, G\u00f6ring was informed that his \"Vermeer\" was actually a forgery and \"[G\u00f6ring] looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world\". Lopez, however, suggests G\u00f6ring may never have known the painting was a fake.\nLopez argued that Han van Meegeren's defence during his trial in Amsterdam was a masterpiece of trickery, forging his own personality into a true Dutchman eager to trick his critics and also the Dutch people by pretending that he sold his fake Vermeer to G\u00f6ring because he wanted to teach the Nazi a lesson. Van Meegeren remains one of the most ingenious art counterfeiters of the 20th century. After his trial, however, he declared, \"My triumph as a counterfeiter was my defeat as [a] creative artist.\"\nList of forgeries.\nKnown forgeries.\nList of known forgeries by Han van Meegeren (unless specified differently, they are after Vermeer):\nPosthumously, Van Meegeren's forgeries have been shown in exhibitions around the world, including exhibitions in Amsterdam (1952), Basel (1953), Z\u00fcrich (1953), Haarlem in the Kunsthandel de Boer (1958), London (1961), Rotterdam (1971), Minneapolis (1973), Essen (1976\u20131977), Berlin (1977), Slot Zeist (1985), New York (1987), Berkeley, CA (1990), Munich (1991), Rotterdam (1996), The Hague (1996) and more recently at the Haagse Kunstkring, The Hague (2004) and Stockholm (2004), and have thus been made broadly accessible to the public.\nPotential forgeries.\nIt is possible that other fakes hang in art collections all over the world.\u00a0 Jacques van Meegeren suggested that his father had created a number of other forgeries, during interviews with journalists regarding discussions with his father. Some of these possible forgeries include:\nOriginal artwork.\nVan Meegeren was a prolific artist and produced thousands of original paintings in a number of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th-century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the subject is drawn with rather odd features, and Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably his finest works.\nAmong his original works is his famous \"Deer\", pictured above. Other works include his prize-winning \"St. Laurens Cathedral\"; a \"Portrait of the actress Jo Oerlemans\" (his second wife); his \"Night Club\"; from the Roaring Twenties; the cheerful watercolor \"A Summer Day on the Beach\" and many others.\nThe forger, forged.\nVan Meegeren's own work rose in price after he had become known as a forger, and it consequently became worthwhile to fake his paintings, as well. Existing paintings obtained a signature \"H. van Meegeren\", or new pictures were made in his style and falsely signed. When Van Meegeren saw a fake like that, he ironically remarked that he would have adopted them if they had been good enough, but regrettably he had not yet seen one.\nLater, Han van Meegeren's son Jacques van Meegeren started to fake his father's work. He made paintings in his father's style \u2013 although of much lower quality \u2013 and was able to place a perfect signature on these imitations. Many fakes \u2013 both by Jacques and by others \u2013 are still on the market.\nIn media.\nIn 1961, Anton Walbrook played Han van Meegeren (renamed Han van Maasdijk) in the West End play \"Masterpiece\". Written by Larry Ward and Gordon Russell, it was performed at London's Royalty Theatre from 26 January to 25 February.\nHan van Meegeren was played by Guy Pearce in the movie \"The Last Vermeer\", which tells the story of the investigation into his sale of the painting \"Jesus and the Adulteress\" to Nazi officer Hermann G\u00f6ring.\" \"The movie was based on the book \"The Man Who Made Vermeers, Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han Van Meegeren\", by Jonathan Lopez.\"\"\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nList of Works\nSource\nHan van Meegeren biographies\nNovels about or inspired by Han van Meegeren\nFilms about or inspired by Han van Meegeren\nPlays inspired by Han van Meegeren"}

In the sense of \"flowing water\", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Floods are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding. Examples for human changes are land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees. Global environmental issues also influence causes of floods, namely climate change which causes an intensification of the water cycle and sea level rise. For example, climate change makes extreme weather events more frequent and stronger. This leads to more intense floods and increased flood risk.\nNatural types of floods include river flooding, groundwater flooding coastal flooding and urban flooding sometimes known as flash flooding. Tidal flooding may include elements of both river and coastal flooding processes in estuary areas. There is also the intentional flooding of land that would otherwise remain dry. This may take place for agricultural, military, or river-management purposes. For example, agricultural flooding may occur in preparing paddy fields for the growing of semi-aquatic rice in many countries. \nFlooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, sea or ocean. In these cases, the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries. Flooding may also occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground. This is called an \"areal flood\". The size of a lake or other body of water naturally varies with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt. Those changes in size are however not considered a flood unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.\nFloods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if these buildings are in the natural flood plains of rivers. People could avoid riverine flood damage by moving away from rivers. However, people in many countries have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile. Also, the rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry. \nFlooding can damage property and also lead to secondary impacts. These include in the short term an increased spread of waterborne diseases and vector-bourne diseases, for example those diseases transmitted by mosquitos. Flooding can also lead to long-term displacement of residents. Floods are an area of study of hydrology and hydraulic engineering. \nA large amount of the world's population lives in close proximity to major coastlines, while many major cities and agricultural areas are located near floodplains. There is significant risk for increased coastal and fluvial flooding due to changing climatic conditions. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTypes.\nAreal flooding.\nFloods can happen on flat or low-lying areas when water is supplied by rainfall or snowmelt more rapidly than it can either infiltrate or run off. The excess accumulates in place, sometimes to hazardous depths. Surface soil can become saturated, which effectively stops infiltration, where the water table is shallow, such as a floodplain, or from intense rain from one or a series of storms. Infiltration also is slow to negligible through frozen ground, rock, concrete, paving, or roofs. Areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in local depressions not connected to a stream channel, because the velocity of overland flow depends on the surface slope. Endorheic basins may experience areal flooding during periods when precipitation exceeds evaporation.\nRiver flooding.\nFloods occur in all types of river and stream channels, from the smallest ephemeral streams in humid zones to normally-dry channels in arid climates to the world's largest rivers. When overland flow occurs on tilled fields, it can result in a muddy flood where sediments are picked up by run off and carried as suspended matter or bed load. Localized flooding may be caused or exacerbated by drainage obstructions such as landslides, ice, debris, or beaver dams.\nSlow-rising floods most commonly occur in large rivers with large catchment areas. The increase in flow may be the result of sustained rainfall, rapid snow melt, monsoons, or tropical cyclones. However, large rivers may have rapid flooding events in areas with dry climates, since they may have large basins but small river channels, and rainfall can be very intense in smaller areas of those basins.\nIn extremely flat areas, such as the Red River Valley of the North in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Manitoba, a type of hybrid river/areal flooding can occur, known locally as \"overland flooding\". This is different from \"overland flow\" defined as \"surface runoff\". The Red River Valley is a former glacial lakebed, created by Lake Agassiz, and over a length of , the river course drops only , for an average slope of about 5 inches per mile (or 8.2 cm per kilometer). In this very large area, spring snowmelt happens at different rates in different places, and if winter snowfall was heavy, a fast snowmelt can push water out of the banks of a tributary river so that it moves overland, to a point further downstream in the river or completely to another streambed. Overland flooding can be devastating because it is unpredictable, it can occur very suddenly with surprising speed, and in such flat land it can run for miles. It is these qualities that set it apart from simple \"overland flow\". \nRapid flooding events, including flash floods, more often occur on smaller rivers, rivers with steep valleys, rivers that flow for much of their length over impermeable terrain, or normally-dry channels. The cause may be localized convective precipitation (intense thunderstorms) or sudden release from an upstream impoundment created behind a dam, landslide, or glacier. In one instance, a flash flood killed eight people enjoying the water on a Sunday afternoon at a popular waterfall in a narrow canyon. Without any observed rainfall, the flow rate increased from about in just one minute. Two larger floods occurred at the same site within a week, but no one was at the waterfall on those days. The deadly flood resulted from a thunderstorm over part of the drainage basin, where steep, bare rock slopes are common and the thin soil was already saturated. \nFlash floods are the most common flood type in normally-dry channels in arid zones, known as arroyos in the southwest United States and many other names elsewhere. In that setting, the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy stream bed. The leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows. As a result, the rising limb of the hydrograph becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream, until the flow rate is so great that the depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant.\nCoastal flooding.\nCoastal areas may be flooded by storm surges combining with high tides and large wave events at sea, resulting in waves over-topping flood defenses or in severe cases by tsunami or tropical cyclones. A storm surge, from either a tropical cyclone or an extratropical cyclone, falls within this category. A storm surge is \"an additional rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides\". Due to the effects of climate change (e.g. sea level rise and an increase in extreme weather events) and an increase in the population living in coastal areas, the damage caused by coastal flood events has intensified and more people are being affected.\nFlooding in estuaries is commonly caused by a combination of storm surges caused by winds and low barometric pressure and large waves meeting high upstream river flows.\nIntentional floods.\nThe intentional flooding of land that would otherwise remain dry may take place for agricultural, military or river-management purposes. This is a form of hydraulic engineering. Agricultural flooding may occur in preparing paddy fields for the growing of semi-aquatic rice in many countries.\nFlooding for river management may occur in the form of diverting flood waters in a river at flood stage upstream from areas that are considered more valuable than the areas that are sacrificed in this way. This may be done \"ad hoc\", or permanently, as in the so-called \"overlaten\" (literally \"let-overs\"), an intentionally lowered segment in Dutch riparian levees, like the \"Beerse Overlaat\" in the left levee of the Meuse between the villages of Gassel and Linden, North Brabant.\nMilitary inundation creates an obstacle in the field that is intended to impede the movement of the enemy. This may be done both for offensive and defensive purposes. Furthermore, in so far as the methods used are a form of hydraulic engineering, it may be useful to differentiate between controlled inundations and uncontrolled ones. Examples for controlled inundations include those in the Netherlands under the Dutch Republic and its successor states in that area and exemplified in the two Hollandic Water Lines, the Stelling van Amsterdam, the Frisian Water Line, the IJssel Line, the Peel-Raam Line, and the Grebbe line in that country. \nTo count as \"controlled\", a military inundation has to take the interests of the civilian population into account, by allowing them a timely evacuation, by making the inundation \"reversible\", and by making an attempt to minimize the adverse ecological impact of the inundation. That impact may also be adverse in a hydrogeological sense if the inundation lasts a long time.\nExamples for uncontrolled inundations are the second Siege of Leiden during the first part of the Eighty Years' War, the flooding of the Yser plain during the First World War, and the Inundation of Walcheren, and the Inundation of the Wieringermeer during the Second World War).\nCauses.\nFloods are caused by many factors or a combination of any of these generally prolonged heavy rainfall (locally concentrated or throughout a catchment area), highly accelerated snowmelt, severe winds over water, unusual high tides, tsunamis, or failure of dams, levees, retention ponds, or other structures that retained the water. Flooding can be exacerbated by increased amounts of impervious surface or by other natural hazards such as wildfires, which reduce the supply of vegetation that can absorb rainfall.\nDuring times of rain, some of the water is retained in ponds or soil, some is absorbed by grass and vegetation, some evaporates, and the rest travels over the land as surface runoff. Floods occur when ponds, lakes, riverbeds, soil, and vegetation cannot absorb all the water.\nThis has been exacerbated by human activities such as draining wetlands that naturally store large amounts of water and building paved surfaces that do not absorb any water. Water then runs off the land in quantities that cannot be carried within stream channels or retained in natural ponds, lakes, and human-made reservoirs. About 30 percent of all precipitation becomes runoff and that amount might be increased by water from melting snow.\nUpslope factors.\nRiver flooding is often caused by heavy rain, sometimes increased by melting snow. A flood that rises rapidly, with little or no warning, is called a flash flood. Flash floods usually result from intense rainfall over a relatively small area, or if the area was already saturated from previous precipitation.\nThe amount, location, and timing of water reaching a drainage channel from natural precipitation and controlled or uncontrolled reservoir releases determines the flow at downstream locations. Some precipitation evaporates, some slowly percolates through soil, some may be temporarily sequestered as snow or ice, and some may produce rapid runoff from surfaces including rock, pavement, roofs, and saturated or frozen ground. The fraction of incident precipitation promptly reaching a drainage channel has been observed from nil for light rain on dry, level ground to as high as 170 percent for warm rain on accumulated snow.\nMost precipitation records are based on a measured depth of water received within a fixed time interval. \"Frequency\" of a precipitation threshold of interest may be determined from the number of measurements exceeding that threshold value within the total time period for which observations are available. Individual data points are converted to \"intensity\" by dividing each measured depth by the period of time between observations. This intensity will be less than the actual peak intensity if the \"duration\" of the rainfall event was less than the fixed time interval for which measurements are reported. Convective precipitation events (thunderstorms) tend to produce shorter duration storm events than orographic precipitation. Duration, intensity, and frequency of rainfall events are important to flood prediction. Short duration precipitation is more significant to flooding within small drainage basins.\nThe most important upslope factor in determining flood magnitude is the land area of the watershed upstream of the area of interest. Rainfall intensity is the second most important factor for watersheds of less than approximately . The main channel slope is the second most important factor for larger watersheds. Channel slope and rainfall intensity become the third most important factors for small and large watersheds, respectively.\nTime of Concentration is the time required for runoff from the most distant point of the upstream drainage area to reach the point of the drainage channel controlling flooding of the area of interest. The time of concentration defines the critical duration of peak rainfall for the area of interest. The critical duration of intense rainfall might be only a few minutes for roof and parking lot drainage structures, while cumulative rainfall over several days would be critical for river basins.\nDownslope factors.\nWater flowing downhill ultimately encounters downstream conditions slowing movement. The final limitation in coastal flooding lands is often the ocean or some coastal flooding bars which form natural lakes. In flooding low lands, elevation changes such as tidal fluctuations are significant determinants of coastal and estuarine flooding. Less predictable events like tsunamis and storm surges may also cause elevation changes in large bodies of water. Elevation of flowing water is controlled by the geometry of the flow channel and, especially, by depth of channel, speed of flow and amount of sediments in it Flow channel restrictions like bridges and canyons tend to control water elevation above the restriction. The actual control point for any given reach of the drainage may change with changing water elevation, so a closer point may control for lower water levels until a more distant point controls at higher water levels.\nEffective flood channel geometry may be changed by growth of vegetation, accumulation of ice or debris, or construction of bridges, buildings, or levees within the flood channel.\nPeriodic floods occur on many rivers, forming a surrounding region known as the flood plain. Even when rainfall is relatively light, the shorelines of lakes and bays can be flooded by severe winds\u2014such as during hurricanes\u2014that blow water into the shore areas.\nCoincidence.\nExtreme flood events often result from coincidence such as unusually intense, warm rainfall melting heavy snow pack, producing channel obstructions from floating ice, and releasing small impoundments like beaver dams. Coincident events may cause extensive flooding to be more frequent than anticipated from simplistic statistical prediction models considering only precipitation runoff flowing within unobstructed drainage channels. Debris modification of channel geometry is common when heavy flows move uprooted woody vegetation and flood-damaged structures and vehicles, including boats and railway equipment. Recent field measurements during the 2010\u201311 Queensland floods showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by velocity and water depth fluctuations. These considerations ignore further the risks associated with large debris entrained by the flow motion.\nNegative impacts.\nFloods can be a huge destructive power. When water flows, it has the ability to demolish all kinds of buildings and objects, such as bridges, structures, houses, trees, and cars. Economical, social and natural environmental damages are common factors that are impacted by flooding events and the impacts that flooding has on these areas can be catastrophic.\nImpacts on infrastructure and societies.\nThere have been numerous flood incidents around the world which have caused devastating damage to infrastructure, the natural environment and human life. \nFloods can have devastating impacts to human societies. Flooding events worldwide are increasing in frequency and severity, leading to increasing costs to societies. \nCatastrophic riverine flooding can result from major infrastructure failures, often the collapse of a dam. It can also be caused by drainage channel modification from a landslide, earthquake or volcanic eruption. Examples include outburst floods and lahars. Tsunamis can cause catastrophic coastal flooding, most commonly resulting from undersea earthquakes.\nEconomic impacts.\nThe primary effects of flooding include loss of life and damage to buildings and other structures, including bridges, sewerage systems, roadways, and canals. The economic impacts caused by flooding can be severe.\nEvery year flooding causes countries billions of dollars' worth of damage that threatens the livelihood of individuals. As a result, there is also significant socio-economic threats to vulnerable populations around the world from flooding. For example, in Bangladesh in 2007, a flood was responsible for the destruction of more than one million houses. And yearly in the United States, floods cause over $7 billion in damage.\nFlood waters typically inundate farm land, making the land unworkable and preventing crops from being planted or harvested, which can lead to shortages of food both for humans and farm animals. Entire harvests for a country can be lost in extreme flood circumstances. Some tree species may not survive prolonged flooding of their root systems.\nFlooding in areas where people live also has significant economic implications for affected neighborhoods. In the United States, industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10\u201325 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home. According to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster. In the United States, insurance is available against flood damage to both homes and businesses.\nEconomic hardship due to a temporary decline in tourism, rebuilding costs, or food shortages leading to price increases is a common after-effect of severe flooding. The impact on those affected may cause psychological damage to those affected, in particular where deaths, serious injuries and loss of property occur.\nHealth impacts.\nFatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by drowning; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong currents. Deaths do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with dehydration, heat stroke, heart attack and any other illness that needs medical supplies that cannot be delivered.\nInjuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Injuries do not just affect those who were directly in the flood: rescue teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur before, during and after the flood. During floods accidents occur with falling debris or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are when large numbers injuries can occur.\nCommunicable diseases are increased due to many pathogens and bacteria that are being transported by the water. There are many waterborne diseases such as cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis E and diarrheal diseases, to mention a few. Gastrointestinal disease and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Clean water supplies are often contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of sanitation in the water and in living quarters, depending on where the flood is and how prepared the community is for a flood.\nWhen floods hit, people can lose nearly all their crops, livestock, and food reserves and face starvation.\nFloods also frequently damage power transmission and sometimes power generation, which then has knock-on effects caused by the loss of power. This includes loss of drinking water treatment and water supply, which may result in loss of drinking water or severe water contamination. It may also cause the loss of sewage disposal facilities. Lack of clean water combined with human sewage in the flood waters raises the risk of waterborne diseases, which can include typhoid, giardia, cryptosporidium, cholera and many other diseases depending upon the location of the flood.[]\nDamage to roads and transport infrastructure may make it difficult to mobilize aid to those affected or to provide emergency health treatment.\nFlooding can cause chronically wet houses, leading to the growth of indoor mold and resulting in adverse health effects, particularly respiratory symptoms. Respiratory diseases are common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of water damage and mold that grows after an incident. Research suggests that there will be an increase of 30\u201350% in adverse respiratory health outcomes caused by dampness and mold exposure for those living in coastal and wetland areas. Fungal contamination in homes is associated with increased allergic rhinitis and asthma. Vector-borne diseases also increase, due to the residual still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are malaria, dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever. Floods may have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial integrity. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and stress. One of the most treated illnesses in long-term health problems are depression caused by the flood and all the tragedy that flows with one.\nLoss of life.\nBelow is a list of the deadliest floods worldwide, showing events with death tolls at or above 100,000 individuals.\nPositive impacts (benefits).\nFloods (in particular more frequent or smaller floods) can also bring many benefits, such as recharging ground water, making soil more fertile and increasing nutrients in some soils. For this reason, periodic flooding was essential to the well-being of ancient peoples along the Tigris-Euphrates Rivers, the Nile River, the Indus River, the Ganges and the Yellow River among others.\nFlood waters provide much needed water resources in arid and semi-arid regions where precipitation can be very unevenly distributed throughout the year and kills pests in the farming land. Freshwater floods particularly play an important role in maintaining ecosystems in river corridors and are a key factor in maintaining floodplain biodiversity. Flooding can spread nutrients to lakes and rivers, which can lead to increased biomass and improved fisheries for a few years.\nFor some fish species, an inundated floodplain may form a highly suitable location for spawning, with few predators and enhanced levels of nutrients or food. Fish such as the weather fish use floods to reach new habitats. Bird populations may also profit from the boost in food production caused by flooding.\nThe viability of hydropower, a renewable source of energy, is also higher in flood-prone regions.\nProtections against floods and associated hazards.\nFlood management.\nFlood management examples.\nIn many countries around the world, waterways prone to floods are often carefully managed. Defenses such as detention basins, levees, bunds, reservoirs, and weirs are used to prevent waterways from overflowing their banks. When these defenses fail, emergency measures such as sandbags or portable inflatable tubes are often used to try to stem flooding. Coastal flooding has been addressed in portions of Europe and the Americas with coastal defenses, such as sea walls, beach nourishment, and barrier islands.\nIn the riparian zone near rivers and streams, erosion control measures can be taken to try to slow down or reverse the natural forces that cause many waterways to meander over long periods of time. Flood controls, such as dams, can be built and maintained over time to try to reduce the occurrence and severity of floods as well. In the United States, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains a network of such flood control dams.\nIn areas prone to urban flooding, one solution is the repair and expansion of human-made sewer systems and stormwater infrastructure. Another strategy is to reduce impervious surfaces in streets, parking lots and buildings through natural drainage channels, porous paving, and wetlands (collectively known as green infrastructure or sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS)). Areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding. Ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated, protected by floodwalls and levees, or designed to withstand temporary inundation. Property owners can also invest in solutions themselves, such as re-landscaping their property to take the flow of water away from their building and installing rain barrels, sump pumps, and check valves.\nFlood safety planning.\nIn the United States, the National Weather Service gives out the advice \"Turn Around, Don't Drown\" for floods; that is, it recommends that people get out of the area of a flood, rather than trying to cross it. At the most basic level, the best defense against floods is to seek higher ground for high-value uses while balancing the foreseeable risks with the benefits of occupying flood hazard zones. Critical community-safety facilities, such as hospitals, emergency-operations centers, and police, fire, and rescue services, should be built in areas least at risk of flooding. Structures, such as bridges, that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas should be designed to withstand flooding. Areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent.\nPlanning for flood safety involves many aspects of analysis and engineering, including:\nEach topic presents distinct yet related questions with varying scope and scale in time, space, and the people involved. Attempts to understand and manage the mechanisms at work in floodplains have been made for at least six millennia.\nIn the United States, the Association of State Floodplain Managers works to promote education, policies, and activities that mitigate current and future losses, costs, and human suffering caused by flooding and to protect the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains \u2013 all without causing adverse impacts. A portfolio of best practice examples for disaster mitigation in the United States is available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nFlood clean-up safety.\nClean-up activities following floods often pose hazards to workers and volunteers involved in the effort. Potential dangers include electrical hazards, carbon monoxide exposure, musculoskeletal hazards, heat or cold stress, motor vehicle-related dangers, fire, drowning, and exposure to hazardous materials. Because flooded disaster sites are unstable, clean-up workers might encounter sharp jagged debris, biological hazards in the flood water, exposed electrical lines, blood or other body fluids, and animal and human remains. In planning for and reacting to flood disasters, managers provide workers with hard hats, goggles, heavy work gloves, life jackets, and watertight boots with steel toes and insoles.\nFlood predictions.\nA series of annual maximum flow rates in a stream reach can be analyzed statistically to estimate the 100-year flood and floods of other recurrence intervals there. Similar estimates from many sites in a hydrologically similar region can be related to measurable characteristics of each drainage basin to allow indirect estimation of flood recurrence intervals for stream reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis.\nPhysical process models of channel reaches are generally well understood and will calculate the depth and area of inundation for given channel conditions and a specified flow rate, such as for use in floodplain mapping and flood insurance. Conversely, given the observed inundation area of a recent flood and the channel conditions, a model can calculate the flow rate. Applied to various potential channel configurations and flow rates, a reach model can contribute to selecting an optimum design for a modified channel. Various reach models are available as of 2015, either 1D models (flood levels measured in the channel) or 2D models (variable flood depths measured across the extent of a floodplain). HEC-RAS, the Hydraulic Engineering Center model, is among the most popular software, if only because it is available free of charge. Other models such as TUFLOW combine 1D and 2D components to derive flood depths across both river channels and the entire floodplain.\nPhysical process models of complete drainage basins are even more complex. Although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area, others are poorly understood at all scales, and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown. Basin models typically combine land-surface process components (to estimate how much rainfall or snowmelt reaches a channel) with a series of reach models. For example, a basin model can calculate the runoff hydrograph that might result from a 100-year storm, although the recurrence interval of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood. Basin models are commonly used in flood forecasting and warning, as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and climate change.\nIn the United States, an integrated approach to real-time hydrologic computer modelling uses observed data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), various cooperative observing networks, various automated weather sensors, the NOAA National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC), various hydroelectric companies, etc. combined with quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF) of expected rainfall and/or snow melt to generate daily or as-needed hydrologic forecasts. The NWS also cooperates with Environment Canada on hydrologic forecasts that affect both the US and Canada, like in the area of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.\nThe Global Flood Monitoring System, \"GFMS\", a computer tool which maps flood conditions worldwide, is available online. Users anywhere in the world can use GFMS to determine when floods may occur in their area. GFMS uses precipitation data from NASA's Earth observing satellites and the Global Precipitation Measurement satellite, \"GPM\". Rainfall data from GPM is combined with a land surface model that incorporates vegetation cover, soil type, and terrain to determine how much water is soaking into the ground, and how much water is flowing into streamflow.\nUsers can view statistics for rainfall, streamflow, water depth, and flooding every 3 hours, at each 12-kilometer gridpoint on a global map. Forecasts for these parameters are 5 days into the future. Users can zoom in to see inundation maps (areas estimated to be covered with water) in 1-kilometer resolution.\nAnticipating floods before they occur allows for precautions to be taken and people to be warned so that they can be prepared in advance for flooding conditions. For example, farmers can remove animals from low-lying areas and utility services can put in place emergency provisions to re-route services if needed. Emergency services can also make provisions to have enough resources available ahead of time to respond to emergencies as they occur. People can evacuate areas to be flooded.\nIn order to make the most accurate flood forecasts for waterways, it is best to have a long time-series of historical data that relates stream flows to measured past rainfall events. Coupling this historical information with real-time knowledge about volumetric capacity in catchment areas, such as spare capacity in reservoirs, ground-water levels, and the degree of saturation of area aquifers is also needed in order to make the most accurate flood forecasts.\nRadar estimates of rainfall and general weather forecasting techniques are also important components of good flood forecasting. In areas where good quality data is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway, and it also may allow for the computation of the likely statistical return period of a flood. In many developed countries, urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood \u2013 that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% (i.e. 1 \u2212 0.99100, or roughly 1 \u2212 1/\"e\") of occurring in any 100-year period of time.\nAccording to the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) Northeast River Forecast Center (RFC) in Taunton, Massachusetts, a rule of thumb for flood forecasting in urban areas is that it takes at least of rainfall in around an hour's time in order to start significant ponding of water on impermeable surfaces. Many NWS RFCs routinely issue Flash Flood Guidance and Headwater Guidance, which indicate the general amount of rainfall that would need to fall in a short period of time in order to cause flash flooding or flooding on larger water basins.\nFlood risk assessment.\nFlood risks can be defined as the risk that floods pose to individuals, property and the natural landscape based on specific hazards and vulnerability. The extent of flood risks can impact the types of mitigation strategies required and implemented.\nA large amount of the world's population lives in close proximity to major coastlines, while many major cities and agricultural areas are located near floodplains. There is significant risk for increased coastal and fluvial flooding due to changing climatic conditions.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"flood\" comes from the Old English , a word common to Germanic languages (compare German , Dutch from the same root as is seen in \"flow, float\"; also compare with Latin , ), meaning \"a flowing of water, tide, an overflowing of land by water, a deluge, Noah's Flood; mass of water, river, sea, wave\". The Old English word comes from the Proto-Germanic \"floduz\" (Old Frisian , Old Norse , Middle Dutch , Dutch , German , and Gothic derives from \"floduz\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This group comprises the genera \"Anser\" (grey geese and white geese) and \"Branta\" (black geese). Some members of the Tadorninae subfamily (e.g., Egyptian goose, Orinoco goose) are commonly called geese, but are not considered \"true geese\" taxonomically. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller.\nThe term \"goose\" may refer to such bird of either sex, but when paired with \"gander\", \"goose\" refers specifically to a female one (\"gander\" referring to a male). Young birds before fledging are called goslings. The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"goose\" is a direct descendant of Proto-Indo-European \"*\u01f5\u02b0h\u2082\u00e9ns\". In Germanic languages, the root gave Old English \"g\u014ds\" with the plural \"g\u0113s\" and \"gandra\" (becoming Modern English goose, geese, gander, respectively), West Frisian \"goes\", \"gies\" and \"guoske\", , New High German \"Gans\", \"G\u00e4nse\", and \"Ganter\", and Old Norse \"g\u00e1s\" and \"g\u00e6slingr\", whence English \"gosling\".\nThis term also gave , (goose, from ), (), (), , Spanish and , Ancient (), (swans), , , , , (), (), , and ().\nTrue geese and their relatives.\nThe two living genera of true geese are: \"Anser\", grey geese and white geese, such as the greylag goose and snow goose, and \"Branta\", black geese, such as the Canada goose.\nTwo genera of geese are only tentatively placed in the Anserinae; they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: \"Cereopsis\", the Cape Barren goose, and \"Cnemiornis\", the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these or, more probably, the goose-like coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese.\nFossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is that their fossil record, particularly in North America, is dense and comprehensively documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about 10 million years ago in the Miocene. The aptly named \"Anser atavus\" (meaning \"progenitor goose\") from some 12 million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans. In addition, some goose-like birds are known from subfossil remains found on the Hawaiian Islands.\nGeese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.\nFossil record.\nGoose fossils have been found ranging from 10 to 12 million years ago (Middle Miocene). \"Garganornis ballmanni\" from Late Miocene (~ 6\u20139 Ma) of Gargano region of central Italy, stood one and a half meters tall and weighed about 22 kilograms. The evidence suggests the bird was flightless, unlike modern geese.\nMigratory patterns.\nMost goose species are migratory, though populations of Canada geese living near human developments may remain in a locality year-round. These 'resident' geese, found primarily in the eastern United States, may migrate only short distances, or not at all, if they have adequate food supply and access to open water.\nNavigation.\nMigratory geese may use several environmental cues in timing the beginning of their migration, including temperature, predation threat, and food availability. Like all migratory birds, geese exhibit an ability to navigate using an internal compass, using a combination of innate and learned behaviors. The preferred direction of migration is heritable, and birds appear to orient themselves using Earth's magnetic field. Migrations occur over the course of several weeks, and up to 85% of migration time is spent at perennial stopover sites, where individuals rest and build up fat stores for further travel.\nFormation.\nGeese, like other birds, fly in a V formation. This formation helps to conserve energy in flight, and aids in communication and monitoring of flock mates. Using great white pelicans as a model species, researchers showed that flying in a V formation increased the aerodynamics of trailing birds, thus requiring fewer wing flaps to stay aloft and lowering individuals' heartrates. Leading geese switch positions on longer flights to allow for multiple individuals to gain benefits from the less energy-intensive trailing positions; in family groups, parental birds almost always lead.\nOther birds called \"geese\".\nSome mainly Southern Hemisphere birds are called \"geese\", most of which belong to the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae. These are:\nOthers:\nIn popular culture.\n\"Gray Goose Laws\" in Iceland.\nThe oldest collection of Medieval Icelandic laws is known as \"Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s\"; i.e., the \"Gray Goose Laws\".

{"id": "50485", "revid": "48181213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50485", "title": "Debugger", "text": "Computer program used to test and debug other programs\nA debugger is a computer program used to test and debug other programs (the \"target\" programs). Common features of debuggers include the ability to run or halt the target program using breakpoints, step through code line by line, and display or modify the contents of memory, CPU registers, and stack frames.\nThe code to be examined might alternatively be running on an \"instruction set simulator\" (ISS), a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered, but which will typically be somewhat slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate (or the same) processor. Some debuggers offer two modes of operation, full or partial simulation, to limit this impact.\nAn exception occurs when the program cannot normally continue because of a programming bug or invalid data. For example, the program might have tried to use an instruction not available on the current version of the CPU or attempted to access unavailable or protected memory. When the program \"traps\" or reaches a preset condition, the debugger typically shows the location in the original code if it is a source-level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly now seen in integrated development environments. If it is a low-level debugger or a machine-language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly (unless it also has online access to the original source code and can display the appropriate section of code from the assembly or compilation).\nFeatures.\nTypically, debuggers offer a query processor, a symbol resolver, an expression interpreter, and a debug support interface at its top level. Debuggers also offer more sophisticated functions such as running a program step by step (single-stepping or program animation), stopping (breaking) (pausing the program to examine the current state) at some event or specified instruction by means of a breakpoint, and tracking the values of variables.Some debuggers have the ability to modify the program state while it is running. It may also be possible to continue execution at a different location in the program to bypass a crash or logical error.\nThe same functionality which makes a debugger useful for correcting bugs allows it to be used as a software cracking tool to evade copy protection, digital rights management, and other software protection features. It often also makes it useful as a general verification tool, fault coverage, and performance analyser, especially if instruction path lengths are shown.\nMost mainstream debugging engines, such as gdb and dbx, provide console-based command line interfaces. Debugger front-ends are popular extensions to debugger engines that provide IDE integration, program animation, and visualization features.\nRecord and replay debugging.\nRecord and replay debugging, also known as \"software flight recording\" or \"program execution recording\", captures application state changes and stores them to disk as each instruction in a program executes. The recording can then be replayed and interactively debugged to diagnose and resolve defects. Record and replay debugging is useful for remote debugging and for resolving intermittent, non-deterministic, and other hard-to-reproduce defects.\nReverse debugging.\nSome debuggers include a feature called \"reverse debugging\", also known as \"historical debugging\" or \"backwards debugging\". These debuggers make it possible to step a program's execution backwards in time. Various debuggers include this feature. Microsoft Visual Studio (2010 Ultimate edition, 2012 Ultimate, 2013 Ultimate, and 2015 Enterprise edition) offers IntelliTrace reverse debugging for C#, Visual Basic .NET, and some other languages, but not C++. Reverse debuggers also exist for C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, and other languages. Some are open source; some are proprietary commercial software. Some reverse debuggers slow down the target by orders of magnitude, but the best reverse debuggers cause a slowdown of 2\u00d7 or less. Reverse debugging is very useful for certain types of problems, but is not commonly used.\nTime travel debugging.\nIn addition to the features of reverse debuggers, time travel debugging also allow users to interact with the program, changing the history if desired, and watch how the program responds.\nLanguage dependency.\nSome debuggers operate on a single specific language while others can handle multiple languages transparently. For example, if the main target program is written in COBOL but calls assembly language subroutines and PL/1 subroutines, the debugger may have to dynamically switch modes to accommodate the changes in language as they occur.\nMemory protection.\nSome debuggers also incorporate memory protection to avoid storage violations such as buffer overflow. This may be extremely important in transaction processing environments where memory is dynamically allocated from memory 'pools' on a task by task basis.\nHardware support for debugging.\nMost modern microprocessors have at least one of these features in their CPU design to make debugging easier:\nDebugger front-ends.\nSome of the most capable and popular debuggers implement only a simple command line interface (CLI)\u2014often to maximize portability and minimize resource consumption. Developers typically consider debugging via a graphical user interface (GUI) easier and more productive. This is the reason for visual front-ends, that allow users to monitor and control subservient CLI-only debuggers via graphical user interface. Some GUI debugger front-ends are designed to be compatible with a variety of CLI-only debuggers, while others are targeted at one specific debugger.\nEthical or legal debugging.\nDebugging is often used to illegally crack or pirate software, which is usually illegal even when done non-maliciously. Crackme's are programs specifically designed to be cracked or debugged. These programs allow those with debuggers to practice their debugging ability without getting into legal trouble.\nList of debuggers.\nSome widely used debuggers are:\nEarlier minicomputer debuggers include:\nMainframe debuggers include:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Written by Adam Brooks, the film is about a woman who flies to France to confront her straying fianc\u00e9 and gets into trouble when the charming crook seated next to her uses her to smuggle a stolen diamond necklace. \"French Kiss\" was filmed on location in Paris, the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur r\u00e9gion of southeastern France, and Cannes. The film was released in the United States on May 5, 1995, and received mixed reviews. The film was a success and went on to earn a total worldwide gross of $101,982,854.\nA Hindi remake of the film named \"Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha\" was released on July 24, 1998. The 2004 Malayalam comedy film \"Vettam\" was also based on \"French Kiss\".\nIt was the last movie to be shot by cinematographer Owen Roizman before his death in 2023.\nPlot.\nAmerican history teacher Kate lives in Canada with her fianc\u00e9 Charlie, a doctor. When Charlie urges her to accompany him to Paris for an upcoming conference, she declines, partly due to her fear of flying, lactose intolerance and her pending application to become a Canadian citizen.\nDays later, Charlie calls Kate, saying he has fallen in love with a French woman, Juliette, and will not be returning. Determined to win him back, Kate boards a flight to Paris and is seated next to smarmy Frenchman Luc Teyssier, whom she instantly dislikes. Luc, who comes from a family of vintners, is smuggling a stolen diamond necklace in an American grape vine. He plans to sell the necklace and use the vine to create his own vineyard. Knowing Kate is unlikely to be searched at customs, he hides them in her bag.\nAt the airport in Paris, Luc is spotted by Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon, who offers him a ride home and searches his bag for signs of criminality. Cardon is aware of Luc's profession but encourages him to stop and is unwilling to arrest him because Luc once saved his life.\nKate waits for Charlie in the lobby of his hotel, but faints when she sees him kissing the beautiful, glamorous Juliette. A French thief, Bob, steals her luggage while she's out. Luc arrives to retrieve the vine and necklace, and helps Kate identify the thief, whom Luc knows. At Bob's apartment, he admits to having sold her passport and given away her clothes, but the vine is still there.\nKate attempts to get help from both the American and Canadian embassies, but she is denied help as she sought Canadian citizenship without disclosing a prior felony conviction for possession of marijuana. She books a train to Cannes to pursue Charlie, who is traveling with Juliette to meet her parents. Luc, having discovered the necklace is not with the vine and must be in Kate's bag, arrives and pretends to be interested in helping her win Charlie back.\nThat night, Kate kisses Luc in her sleep. He is disturbed to realize his attraction to her. In the morning, Kate describes a \"delicious dream,\" while sampling copious amounts of French cheese, but they soon make her ill. The pair get off the train at La Ravelle in Paulhaguet, which Luc reluctantly admits is his hometown. He takes Kate to his family's vineyard. She learns about his family and that he gambled away his rights to the family vineyard in a poker game, but is knowledgeable about wine and has a clear passion for it. As they board the train for Cannes, Kate playfully reveals she found the necklace.\nLuc advises Kate to mimic the romantic attitudes of French women, who act indifferent toward men and play hard to get. Kate approaches Charlie and Juliette on the beach. She admits to having come to France to win Charlie back, but now claims Luc is her lover and she's realized that the life she was building with Charlie was boring and no longer interests her. That afternoon, Cardon approaches Kate, telling her the necklace is stolen and asking her to hand it over to him so that Luc will not be arrested. She convinces Luc to let her sell the necklace to Cartier.\nKate has dinner with Charlie to discuss the details of dividing their shared property in Canada. He is intrigued by her newfound indifference to him, while Luc distracts Juliette. Kate and Charlie go back to her room, but Kate rejects his advances, realizing she no longer loves him. Luc goes to bed with Juliette, but stops when he calls her \"Kate.\"\nThe next morning, Kate tells Luc she has won Charlie back. She returns the necklace to Cardon and then gives Luc a check, supposedly from Cartier, which is actually a check for her life savings. She then leaves with Luc's gratitude and heads for the airport. Cardon approaches Luc, who witnesses Charlie and Juliette reconciling, and reveals what Kate has done for him. Luc finds Kate on the airplane and confesses his love for her. They are last seen kissing passionately on the vineyard they now own together.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nPre-production.\nThe lead role of Luc was originally written for G\u00e9rard Depardieu, but Kevin Kline accepted the role when Depardieu was not available for the film.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography took place from September 17 to December 22, 1994. \"French Kiss\" was filmed primarily in Paris, the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region of southeastern France, and Cannes.\nIn Paris, scenes were shot at the Hotel George V, where Kate has her encounters with the supercilious concierge. The hotel lobby was used for the scene where the petty thief Bob steals Kate's bag after she faints. Several scenes show the Eiffel Tower in the background\u2014the one site Kate longs to see most but keeps on missing. A phonebooth on Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es near the Arc de Triomphe was used for the scene where Kate calls Charlie's mother. Scenes were also filmed at the American Embassy at 2 Avenue Gabriel, and the Canadian Embassy at 35 Avenue Montaigne. The scene where Luc throws money on the sidewalk was filmed at the corner of rue Paul-Albert and rue Feutrier in Montmartre.\nDriving scenes in Paris were filmed in front of the Louvre near the Louvre Pyramid, along the Rive Droite, and on Rue des Rosiers, where Luc drives down a narrow, winding cobblestoned street. Additional Paris scenes were filmed at the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur in Montmartre, the Grande Pharmacie de la Place Blanche at 5 Place Blanche, the Palais de Chaillot, and Place des Abbesses, where Kate and Luc discuss his \"little problem\". The final scene filmed in Paris was at the Gare Saint-Lazare train station, where Luc is chased by Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon while trying to board a train south to Cannes.\nIn the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region, the small village of Valbonne, about fifteen minutes north of Cannes, was used for several scenes, including the scene where Luc fights with his brother in the main village square in front of the Hotel les Armoiries, an old seventeenth century building. Other scenes were filmed at the train station and nearby vineyards around La Ravelle, 84240 La Tour-d'Aigues, The train station near Meyrargues, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, was also used in one scene.\nIn Cannes, several exterior shots of the Carlton Hotel were used to represent where the four main characters stay. There are interior scenes of the lobby and the brasserie used for morning breakfasts. Other scenes filmed here include the beach in front of the hotel along with the adjacent waterfront\u2014in particular the Cartier boutique on the next corner. The grape harvest scenes were filmed at Ch\u00e2teau Val Joanis in Pertuis, Vaucluse. Studio scenes were shot at Paris Studios Cin\u00e9ma.\nTitle.\nThe film was originally titled \"Paris Match\", a play on the name of the famous French newsmagazine. However, the title had to be changed after Billy Crystal challenged it with the MPAA as being too close to that of his own Paris-set romantic comedy \"Forget Paris\", released just two weeks later.\nSoundtrack.\nThe \"French Kiss Original Soundtrack\" album was released by Mercury Records on CD on May 9, 1995. It peaked at 170 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nRelease.\nCritical response.\n\"French Kiss\" was released in United States on May 5, 1995, and received mixed reviews. In his review in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Mick LaSalle wrote that director Lawrence Kasdan \"takes what could have been a fluffy comedy with lots of plot complications and picturesque scenery and instead puts his focus on the important things: on the characters played by Ryan and Kline and how they happen to be feeling.\" LaSalle also applauded Kasdan's sense of subtle comedy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;With his attention in the right place, Kasdan comes up with ways of using the setting to make emotional points. For example, though the film doesn't go out of its way to make you notice, Ryan keeps missing out on getting to see the Eiffel Tower. It's behind her as she's riding in a car, or she's turning toward it a second after they've turned out the lights. She doesn't know what she's missing\u2014until eventually she does.\nLaSalle found Kline's performance \"extraordinary\" and that he not only perfected the accent but the \"speech rhythms and the manner as well.\" LaSalle also praised Ryan's comic timing, which \"continues to delight.\"\nIn her review in \"The Washington Post\", Rita Kempley, giving it a mixed review, wrote that the film \"isn't as passionate as the title suggests\u2014in fact, it's facile\u2014but Ryan and Kevin Kline, as her attractive opposite, are irresistible together.\" Kempley applauded the acting performances:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Kline's hilariously hammy l'accent puts Inspector Clouseau's to shame; his performance is the zaniest since \"A Fish Called Wanda\". Ryan's Kate is even pickier than the heroine in \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and melts just as endearingly. She and Kline spar convincingly; Doris Day and Rock Hudson had sexier scenes, but none this romantic.\nIn his review in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", a disappointed Roger Ebert wrote, \"The characters in this movie may look like adults, but they think like teenagers.\" Although he acknowledged that the film was not without its charms\u2014Paris and Cannes being \"two of the most photogenic cities on earth\"\u2014Ebert concluded, \"Kline's Frenchman is somehow not worldly enough, and Ryan's heroine never convinces us she ever loved her fianc\u00e9 in the first place.\"\nIn her review in \"The New York Times\", Janet Maslin called the film a \"romantic comedy with barely a laugh or a spark, and with a pace that makes it feel longer than Mr. Kasdan's previous work, \"Wyatt Earp\".\"\nReview aggregation website \"Rotten Tomatoes\" gave the film a score of 48% based on reviews from 27 critics with a weighted average of 5.6/10. The consensus summarizes: \"\"French Kiss\" is effervescent like good champagne but its spirit fizzles in a film that isn't as intoxicating as its stars.\" On Metacritic, another aggregator, the film holds a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nBox office.\nThe film earned $38,896,854 in the United States and an additional $63,086,000 in international markets for a total worldwide gross of $101,982,854.\nHome media.\n\"French Kiss\" was released in United States on video on February 6, 1996. It was released in DVD format by 20th Century Fox on January 18, 2000, and in Blu-ray format by 20th Century Fox on January 8, 2013.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are versions for AIX, OS/2, eComStation, ArcaOS and Linux operating systems. The latter is available as free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). HP-UX has another, different filesystem named JFS that is actually an OEM version of Veritas Software's VxFS.\nIn the AIX operating system, two generations of JFS exist, which are called \"JFS\" (\"JFS1\") and \"JFS2\" respectively.\nIBM's JFS was originally designed for 32-bit systems. JFS2 was designed for 64-bit systems. \nIn other operating systems, such as OS/2 and Linux, only the second generation exists and is called simply \"JFS\". This should not be confused with JFS in AIX that actually refers to JFS1.\nHistory.\nIBM introduced JFS with the initial release of AIX version 3.1 in February 1990. This file system, now called \"JFS1 on AIX\", was the premier file system for AIX over the following decade and was installed in thousands or millions of customers' AIX systems. Historically, the JFS1 file system is very closely tied to the memory manager of AIX, which is a typical design for a file system supporting only one operating system. JFS was one of the first file systems to support Journaling.\nIn 1995, work began to enhance the file system to be more scalable and to support machines that had more than one processor. Another goal was to have a more portable file system, capable of running on multiple operating systems. After several years of designing, coding, and testing, the new JFS was first shipped in OS/2 Warp Server for eBusiness in April 1999, and then in OS/2 Warp Client in October 2000. In December 1999, a snapshot of the original OS/2 JFS source was granted to the open source community and work was begun to port JFS to Linux. The first stable release of \"JFS for Linux\" appeared in June 2001. The \"JFS for Linux\" project is maintained by a small group of contributors known as the \"JFS Core Team\". This release of sources also worked to form the basis of a re-port back to OS/2 of the open-source JFS.\nIn parallel with this effort, some of the JFS development team returned to the AIX Operating System Development Group in 1997 and started to move this new JFS source base to the AIX operating system. In May 2001, a second journaled file system, \"Enhanced Journaled File System (JFS2)\", was made available for AIX 5L.\nEarly in 2008 there was speculation that IBM is no longer interested in maintaining JFS and thus it should not be used in production environments. However, Dave Kleikamp, a member of the IBM Linux Technology Center and JFS Core Team, explained that they still follow changes in the Linux kernel and try to fix potential software bugs. He went on to add that certain distributions expect a larger resource commitment from them and opt not to support the filesystem.\nIn 2012, TRIM command support for solid-state drives was added to JFS.\nFeatures.\nJFS supports the following features.\nJournal.\nJFS is a journaling file system. Rather than adding journaling as an add-on feature like in the ext3 file system, it was implemented from the start. The journal can be up to 128 MB. JFS journals metadata only, which means that metadata will remain consistent but user files may be corrupted after a crash or power loss. JFS's journaling is similar to XFS in that it only journals parts of the inode.\nB+ tree.\nJFS uses a B+ tree to accelerate lookups in directories. JFS can store 8 entries of a directory in the directory's inode before moving the entries to a B+ tree. JFS also indexes extents in a B+ tree.\nDynamic inode allocation.\nJFS dynamically allocates space for disk inodes as necessary. Each inode is 512 bytes. 32 inodes are allocated on a 16 kB Extent.\nExtents.\nJFS allocates files as an extent. An extent is a variable-length sequence of Aggregate blocks. An extent may be located in several allocation groups. To solve this the extents are indexed in a B+ tree for better performance when locating the extent locations.\nCompression.\nCompression is supported only in JFS1 on AIX and uses a variation of the LZ algorithm. Because of high CPU usage and increased free space fragmentation, compression is not recommended for use other than on a single user workstation or off-line backup areas.\nConcurrent input / output (CIO).\nJFS normally applies read-shared, write-exclusive locking to files, which avoids data inconsistencies but imposes write serialization at the file level. The CIO option disables this locking. Applications such as relational databases which maintain data consistency themselves can use this option to largely eliminate filesystem overheads.\nAllocation groups.\nJFS uses allocation groups. Allocation groups divide the aggregate space into chunks. This allows JFS to use resource allocation policies to achieve great I/O performance. The first policy is to try to cluster disk blocks and disk inodes for related data in the same AG in order to achieve good locality for the disk. The second policy is to distribute unrelated data throughout the file system in an attempt to minimize free-space fragmentation. When there is an open file JFS will lock the AG the file resides in and only allow the open file to grow. This reduces fragmentation as only the open file can write to the AG.\nSuperblocks.\nThe superblock maintains information about the entire file system and includes the following fields:\nOn Linux.\nIn the Linux operating system, JFS is supported with the kernel module (since the kernel version \"2.4.18pre9-ac4\") and the complementary userspace utilities packaged under the name \"JFSutils\". Most Linux distributions support JFS unless it is specifically removed due to space restrictions, such as on live CDs.\nAccording to benchmarks of the available filesystems for Linux, JFS is fast and reliable, with consistently good performance under different kinds of load.\nActual usage of JFS in Linux is uncommon, however, JFS does have a niche role in Linux: it offers a case-insensitive mount option, unlike most other Linux file systems.\nThere are also potential problems with JFS, such as its implementation of journal writes. They can be postponed until there is another trigger\u2014potentially indefinitely, which can cause data loss over a theoretically infinite timeframe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over the course of his 30-year career, he starred in a record 15 television series.\nUrich began his career in television in the early 1970s. After guest stints and roles in short-lived television series, he won a co-starring role in the action/crime drama series \"S.W.A.T.\" in 1975. In 1978, he landed the lead role of Dan Tanna in the crime drama series \"Vega$\", which aired on ABC from 1978 to June 1981 and earned him two Golden Globe Award nominations. In addition to his work in television, Urich also co starred in several feature films, including \"Magnum Force\" (1973), \"The Ice Pirates\" (1984) and \"Turk 182\" (1985). From 1985 to 1988, he portrayed the title role in the detective television series \"\", based on Robert B. Parker's series of mystery novels. In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series \"National Geographic Explorer\". He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. He was also awarded a Golden Boot Award for his work in Western television series and films. \nIn 1993, he won an Emmy for narrating a nature documentary. He revealed on \"The Late Show with David Letterman\" that he never knew about his nomination and win. It was sent by FedEx to his home.\nIn 1996, Urich starred in the television series \"The Lazarus Man\". It was canceled shortly after he announced that he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare cancer, in July that year. He sought treatment for his illness while continuing his career and also worked to raise money for cancer research. He was declared cancer free in 1998 and returned to television in the UPN series \"\". In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical \"Chicago\". His last role was in the NBC sitcom \"Emeril\" in 2001, but in the autumn of that year his cancer returned and he died in April 2002 at age 55.\nEarly life.\nUrich was born and raised in Toronto, Ohio, the son of John Paul and Cecilia Monica (n\u00e9e Halpate) Urich. He was of Rusyn (Ukrainian) and Slovak extraction and raised Byzantine Catholic. His elder brother was actor Tom Urich (1935-2022). An excellent high school athlete, Urich attended Florida State University on a football scholarship He played backup center during the 1965\u201366 football season, receiving only minimal playing time, and was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1968, he earned a bachelor's degree in Radio and Television Communications. He went on to Michigan State University and earned a master's degree in Broadcast Research and Management. He took voice lessons at the University of Chicago music school. \nUrich explained in a 1997 interview with Tom Snyder that he worked in sales in Chicago at WGN-TV for $150 a week and was fired after they discovered he was moonlighting. Urich had also worked briefly as a weatherman.\nCareer.\nAfter appearing in a Chicago production of \"The Rainmaker\" with Burt Reynolds, Urich decided to pursue acting full-time after Reynolds encouraged him to move to Los Angeles and do more acting.\n1970s\u20131980s.\nUrich made his television debut in a guest starring role in \"The F.B.I.\", in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in \"Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice\". It was a television adaptation of the 1969 film of the same title. It struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes. He made his film debut later that same year opposite Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry film \"Magnum Force\" playing a vigilante motorcycle-patrol police officer. In 1975, Urich was cast in the action/crime drama series \"S.W.A.T.\". According to the executive producer Aaron Spelling, Burt Reynolds convinced Spelling to allow Urich to read for the part. Spelling was impressed with his reading and cast him in the role of \"Officer Jim Street\". A mid-season replacement, it earned high enough ratings to warrant a second season. However, it was canceled in 1976 due to its violent content.\nUrich's next role was on the sitcom \"Soap\" as Peter the Tennis Player in 1977. That same year he was cast as Paul Thurston, a handsome, ego-driven talk show host in the \"Bewitched\" spin-off series \"Tabitha\", starring Lisa Hartman. Its ratings were initially strong, but schedule changes caused ratings to drop, and the show was canceled in 1978 after 13 episodes. Shortly after, he was cast in another Aaron Spelling produced series, called \"Vega$\". Urich portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves various crimes in Las Vegas. \"Vega$\" was a hit for ABC and he received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on it. By the third season, ratings had started to decline, and with little network support, \"Vega$\" was canceled at the end of the third season in June, 1981. Shortly after, Urich signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and focused on film roles. His first film for MGM was \"Endangered Species\" (1982), a science fiction film directed by Alan Rudolph.\nAfter filming \"Endangered Species\", Urich returned to television and starred in \"Gavilan\". He played the title character who was a former CIA agent turned oceanographer. The series, however, was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films \"The Ice Pirates\", and Wes Craven's \"Invitation to Hell\". In 1985, Urich co-starred in the film \"Turk 182\", although it was not a commercial success. In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in \"\". It was a hit and aired for three seasons. He also reprised the role in several television films after it was canceled: \"Spenser: Ceremony\" (1993), \"Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes\" (1994), \"Spenser: The Judas Goat\" (1994), and \"Spenser: A Savage Place\" (1995). In 1988, he hosted the documentary series \"National Geographic Explorer\". He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed Jake Spoon in the acclaimed television miniseries \"Lonesome Dove\", a role for which he received many positive reviews.\n1990s\u20132000s.\nIn the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom \"American Dreamer\" and the TV movie \"83 Hours 'Til Dawn\". The following year, he starred in \"Crossroads\", a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and Faye Dunaway starred in the sitcom \"It Had to Be You\". It was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, he narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called \"Alien Encounters: From New Tomorrowland\". It has never been shown again. In 1996, he starred in the TNT western series \"The Lazarus Man\". It earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after it was renewed, he announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. Its production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, opted to cancel it due to that. In 1999, he commented on their choice to do so, \"There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work.\" In 2000, he sued them for breach of contract. The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms. While undergoing cancer treatments, Urich hosted the medical documentary series \"Vital Signs\" in 1997 and the PBS series \"Boatworks\". After a year of treatment, he was declared cancer-free and returned to television in 1998 as Captain Jim Kennedy III in \"\". It aired on UPN for two seasons. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical \"Chicago\" and also starred in the North American tour of the musical, in 1999 and in 2000. The next year, he costarred in \"Emeril\", a sitcom starring celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. While it was critically panned, he received good notices for his work on it. It would be his last role in a television series. Urich's final television film, \"Night of the Wolf\", aired on Animal Planet the night before his death.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and children.\nUrich's first marriage was to actress Barbara Rucker in 1968. They divorced in 1974. He married actress Heather Menzies (1949\u20132017) in 1975. They adopted three children. They remained married until his death in 2002.\nIllness and death.\nIn July 1996, Urich announced his diagnosis with synovial sarcoma, a rare cancer affecting soft tissue. Despite his illness, he continued working, underwent treatment and advocated for cancer cure research. He received an award from the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Gilda Radner Courage Award for his cancer awareness efforts. He and his wife established the Urich Fund at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center to support cancer research. Additionally, Urich donated $125,000, his winnings from an episode of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\". He was declared cancer-free in 1998 and became the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society that year.\nIn November 2001, Urich shared in an interview that doctors had found lumps in his body, but a new medication had successfully treated them. A week before his death, he was hospitalized at Los Robles Hospital &amp; Medical Center in Thousand Oaks with respiratory problems. He died there on April 16, 2002. His funeral Mass was held on April 19 at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North Hollywood. A statement was released by his publicist Cindy Guagenti, and said Urich's wife and three children were with him when he died. \nUrich's body was cremated, and his ashes interred at the family's vacation home in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada. A memorial stands in the West Lake Church of Christ Cemetery, near their vacation home.\nLegacy.\nUrich and his wife helped to raise money for the Eccles Performing Arts Centers at the Park City High School in Park City, Utah. After his death, the school established the Robert Urich Scholarship fund in his honor. In addition, they established the Robert and Heather Urich Fund for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. She also had cancer and was an ovarian cancer survivor. Heather continued to work for the center, until she died from brain cancer on December 24, 2017, surrounded by their three children.\nUrich's hometown of Toronto, Ohio, named the Robert Urich Interchange in his honor. It connects the town to Ohio State Route 7. For his contribution to the television industry, Urich has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd. Until Usher was added, he was the only person with a name starting with the letter U on the walk.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prior to the 18th century, they were concentrated in their homelands, in towns along river valleys of what is now southwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, edges of western South Carolina, northern Georgia and northeastern Alabama with hunting grounds in Kentucky, together consisting of around 40,000 square miles.\nThe Cherokee language is part of the Iroquoian language group. In the 19th century, James Mooney, an early American ethnographer, recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region, where other Iroquoian peoples have been based. However, anthropologist Thomas R. Whyte, writing in 2007, dated the split among the peoples as occurring earlier. He believes that the origin of the proto-Iroquoian language was likely the Appalachian region, and the split between Northern and Southern Iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago.\nBy the 19th century, White American settlers had classified the Cherokee of the Southeast as one of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" in the region. They were agrarian, lived in permanent villages and had begun to adopt some cultural and technological practices of the white settlers. They also developed their own writing system.\nToday three Cherokee tribes are federally recognized: the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB) in Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation (CN) in Oklahoma, and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) in North Carolina.\nThe Cherokee Nation has more than 300,000 tribal citizens, making it the largest of the 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States. In addition, numerous groups claim Cherokee lineage, and some of these are state-recognized. A total of more than 819,000 people are estimated to have identified as having Cherokee ancestry on the U.S. census; most are not enrolled citizens of any tribe.\nOf the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, the Cherokee Nation and the UKB have headquarters in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and most of their citizens live in the state. The UKB are mostly descendants of \"Old Settlers\", also called Western Cherokee: those who migrated from the Southeast to Arkansas and Oklahoma in about 1817, prior to Indian removal. They are related to the Cherokee who were later forcibly relocated there in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is located on land known as the Qualla Boundary in western North Carolina. They are mostly descendants of ancestors who had resisted or avoided relocation, remaining in the area. Because they gave up tribal citizenship at the time, they became state and US citizens. In the late 19th century, they reorganized as a federally recognized tribe.\nEtymology.\nA Cherokee-language name for Cherokee people is (, translating as 'Principal People'). Another endonym is (, translating as 'People from Kituwah'). () is the Cherokee name for the Cherokee language.\nMany theories, though all unproven, abound about the origin of the name \"Cherokee\". It may have originally been derived from one of the competitive tribes in the area.\nThe earliest Spanish transliteration of the name, from 1755, is recorded as , but it dates to accounts related to the Hernando de Soto expedition in the mid-16th century. Another theory is that \"Cherokee\" derives from the Lower Creek word (\"chuh-log-gee\"), as the Creek were also in this mountainous region.\nThe Iroquois Five Nations, historically based in New York and Pennsylvania, called the Cherokee ('inhabitants of the cave country'). It is possible the word \"Cherokee\" comes from a Muscogee Creek word meaning 'people of different speech', because the two peoples spoke different languages. Jack Kilpatrick disputes this idea, noting that he believes the name come from the Cherokee word meaning 'he has turned aside'.\nOrigins.\nAnthropologists and historians have two main theories of Cherokee origins. One is that the Cherokee, an Iroquoian-speaking people, migrated to Southern Appalachia from northern areas around the Great Lakes in The area became territory of the \"Iroquois\" (also known as the \"Haudenosaunee\") nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples of the Southeast such as the Tuscarora people of the Carolinas, and the Meherrin and Nottaway of Virginia. The other theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years and that proto-Iroquoian developed there instead of in the north. \nSupporting the first theory are recorded conversations of Cherokee elders made by ethnographer James Mooney in the late 19th century, who recounted an oral tradition of their people migrating south from the Great Lakes region in ancient times. They occupied territories where earthwork platform mounds were built by peoples during the earlier Woodland period.\nThe people of the Middle Woodland period are believed to be ancestors of the historic Cherokee and occupied what is now Western North Carolina, circa 200 to 600 CE. They are believed to have built what is called the Biltmore Mound, found in 1984 south of the Swannanoa River on the Biltmore Estate, which has numerous Native American sites.\nOther ancestors of the Cherokee are considered to be part of the later Pisgah phase of South Appalachian Mississippian culture, a regional variation of the Mississippian culture that arose circa 1000 and lasted to 1500 CE. There is a consensus among most specialists in Southeast archeology and anthropology about these dates. But Finger says that ancestors of the Cherokee people lived in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee for a far longer period of time. Additional mounds were built by peoples during this cultural phase. Typically in this region, towns had a single platform mound and served as a political center for smaller villages.\nHomelands.\nThe Cherokee occupied numerous towns throughout the river valleys and mountain ridges of their homelands. What were called the Lower towns were found in what is present-day western Oconee County, South Carolina, along the Keowee River (called the Savannah River in its lower portion). The principal town of the Lower Towns was Keowee. Other Cherokee towns on the Keowee River included Estatoe and Sugartown (\"Kulsetsiyi\"), a name repeated in other areas.\nIn western North Carolina, what were known as the Valley, Middle, and Outer Towns were located along the major rivers of the Tuckasegee, the upper Little Tennessee, Hiwasee, French Broad and other systems. The Overhill Cherokee occupied towns along the lower Little Tennessee River and upper Tennessee River on the western side of the Appalachian Mountains, in present-day southeastern Tennessee.\nAgriculture.\nDuring the late Archaic and Woodland Period, Native Americans in the region began to cultivate plants such as marsh elder, lambsquarters, pigweed, sunflowers, and some native squash. People created new art forms such as shell gorgets, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.\nDuring the Mississippian culture-period (1000 to 1500 CE in the regional variation known as the South Appalachian Mississippian culture), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern flint corn. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the Green Corn Ceremony.\nEarly culture.\nMuch of what is known about pre-18th century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th century encountered peoples of the Mississippian culture era, who were ancestral to tribes that emerged in the Southeast, such as the Cherokee, Muscogee, Cheraw, and Catawba. Specifically in 1540\u201341, a Spanish expedition led by Hernando de Soto passed through present-day South Carolina, proceeding into western North Carolina and what is considered Cherokee country. The Spanish recorded a \"Chalaque\" people as living around the Keowee River, where western North Carolina, South Carolina, and northeastern Georgia meet. The Cherokee consider this area to be part of their homelands, which also extended into southeastern Tennessee.\nFurther west, De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day northwestern Georgia, recording them as ruled at the time by the Coosa chiefdom. This is believed to be a chiefdom ancestral to the Muscogee Creek people, who developed as a Muskogean-speaking people with a distinct culture.\nIn 1566, the Juan Pardo expedition traveled from the present-day South Carolina coast into its interior, and into western North Carolina and southeastern Tennessee. He recorded meeting Cherokee-speaking people who visited him while he stayed at the Joara chiefdom (north of present-day Morganton, North Carolina). The historic Catawba later lived in this area of the upper Catawba River. Pardo and his forces wintered over at Joara, building Fort San Juan there in 1567.\nHis expedition proceeded into the interior, noting villages near modern Asheville and other places that are part of the Cherokee homelands. According to anthropologist Charles M. Hudson, the Pardo expedition also recorded encounters with Muskogean-speaking peoples at Chiaha in southeastern modern Tennessee.\nLinguistic studies.\nLinguistic studies have been another way for researchers to study the development of people and their cultures. Unlike most other Native American tribes in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee and Tuscarora people spoke Iroquoian languages. Since the Great Lakes region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that both the Cherokee and Tuscarora migrated south from that region. The Cherokee oral history tradition supports their migration from the Great Lakes.\nLinguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago. Scholars posit a split between the groups in the distant past, perhaps 3,500\u20133,800 years ago. Glottochronology studies suggest the split occurred between about 1500 and 1800 BCE. The Cherokee say that the ancient settlement of \"Kituwa\" on the Tuckasegee River is their original settlement in the Southeast. It was formerly adjacent to and is now part of Qualla Boundary (the base of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians) in North Carolina.\nAccording to Thomas Whyte, who posits that proto-Iroquoian developed in Appalachia, the Cherokee and Tuscarora broke off in the Southeast from the major group of Iroquoian speakers who migrated north to the Great Lakes area. There a succession of Iroquoian-speaking tribes were encountered by Europeans in historic times.\nOther sources of early Cherokee history.\nIn the 1830s, the American writer John Howard Payne visited Cherokee then based in Georgia. He recounted what they shared about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. For instance, the Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A \"white\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. As Payne recounted, this group, which was hereditary and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \"red\" organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity.\nResearchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the \"Ani-kutani\". Ethnographer James Mooney, who studied and talked with the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt. By the time that Mooney was studying the people in the late 1880s, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.\nAnother major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the \"didanvwisgi\" (), Cherokee medicine men, after Sequoyah's creation of the Cherokee syllabary in the 1820s. Initially only the \"didanvwisgi\" learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense. Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.\nHistory.\n17th century: English contact.\nIn 1657, there was a disturbance in Virginia Colony as the \"Rechahecrians\" or \"Rickahockans\", as well as the Siouan \"Manahoac\" and \"Nahyssan\", broke through the frontier and settled near the Falls of the James River, near present-day Richmond, Virginia. The following year, a combined force of English colonists and Pamunkey drove the newcomers away. The identity of the \"Rechahecrians\" has been much debated. Historians noted the name closely resembled that recorded for the \"Eriechronon\" or \"Erielhonan\", commonly known as the Erie tribe, another Iroquoian-speaking people based south of the Great Lakes in present-day northern Pennsylvania. This Iroquoian people had been driven away from the southern shore of Lake Erie in 1654 by the powerful Iroquois Five Nations, also known as \"Haudenosaunee\", who were seeking more hunting grounds to support their dominance in the beaver fur trade. The anthropologist Martin Smith theorized some remnants of the tribe migrated to Virginia after the wars (1986:131\u201332), later becoming known as the Westo to English colonists in the Province of Carolina. A few historians suggest this tribe was Cherokee.\nVirginian traders developed a small-scale trading system with the Cherokee in the Piedmont before the end of the 17th century. The earliest recorded Virginia trader to live among the Cherokee was Cornelius Dougherty or Dority, in 1690.\n18th century.\nThe Cherokee gave sanctuary to a band of Shawnee in the 1660s. But from 1710 to 1715, the Cherokee and Chickasaw allied with the British, and fought the Shawnee, who were allied with French colonists, forcing the Shawnee to move northward.\nThe Cherokee fought with the Yamasee, Catawba, and British in late 1712 and early 1713 against the Tuscarora in the Second Tuscarora War. The Tuscarora War marked the beginning of a British-Cherokee relationship that, despite breaking down on occasion, remained strong for much of the 18th century. With the growth of the deerskin trade, the Cherokee were considered valuable trading partners, since deer skins from the cooler country of their mountain hunting-grounds were of better quality than those supplied by the lowland coastal tribes, who were neighbors of the English colonists.\nIn January 1716, Cherokee murdered a delegation of Muscogee Creek leaders at the town of Tugaloo, marking their entry into the Yamasee War. It ended in 1717 with peace treaties between the colony of South Carolina and the Creek. Hostility and sporadic raids between the Cherokee and Creek continued for decades. These raids came to a head at the Battle of Taliwa in 1755, at present-day Ball Ground, Georgia, with the defeat of the Muscogee.\nIn 1721, the Cherokee ceded lands in South Carolina. In 1730, at Nikwasi, a Cherokee town and Mississippian culture site, a Scots adventurer, Sir Alexander Cuming, crowned Moytoy of Tellico as \"Emperor\" of the Cherokee. Moytoy agreed to recognize King George II of Great Britain as the Cherokee protector. Cuming arranged to take seven prominent Cherokee, including \"Attakullakulla\", to London, England. There the Cherokee delegation signed the Treaty of Whitehall with the British. Moytoy's son, Amo-sgasite (Dreadful Water), attempted to succeed him as \"Emperor\" in 1741, but the Cherokee elected their own leader, Conocotocko (Old Hop) of Chota.\nPolitical power among the Cherokee remained decentralized, and towns acted autonomously. In 1735, the Cherokee were said to have 64 towns and villages, with an estimated fighting force of 6,000 men. In 1738 and 1739, smallpox epidemics broke out among the Cherokee, who had no natural immunity to the new infectious disease. Nearly half their population died within a year. Hundreds of other Cherokee committed suicide due to their losses and disfigurement from the disease.\nBritish colonial officer Henry Timberlake, born in Virginia, described the Cherokee people as he saw them in 1761:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Cherokees are of a middle stature, of an olive colour, tho' generally painted, and their skins stained with gun-powder, pricked into it in very pretty figures. The hair of their head is shaved, tho' many of the old people have it plucked out by the roots, except a patch on the hinder part of the head, about twice the bigness of a crown-piece, which is ornamented with beads, feathers, wampum, stained deer hair, and such like baubles. The ears are slit and stretched to an enormous size, putting the person who undergoes the operation to incredible pain, being unable to lie on either side for nearly forty days. To remedy this, they generally slit but one at a time; so soon as the patient can bear it, they wound round with wire to expand them, and are adorned with silver pendants and rings, which they likewise wear at the nose. This custom does not belong originally to the Cherokees, but taken by them from the Shawnese, or other northern nations.\nThey that can afford it wear a collar of wampum, which are beads cut out of clam-shells, a silver breast-plate, and bracelets on their arms and wrists of the same metal, a bit of cloth over their private parts, a shirt of the English make, a sort of cloth-boots, and mockasons (sic), which are shoes of a make peculiar to the Americans, ornamented with porcupine-quills; a large mantle or match-coat thrown over all complete their dress at home ...\nFrom 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in North Georgia. The Cherokee were victorious in the Battle of Taliwa. British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the Seven Years' War, which was fought across Europe and was called the French and Indian War on the North American front. These included Fort Loudoun near Chota on the Tennessee River in eastern Tennessee. Serious misunderstandings arose quickly between the two allies, resulting in the 1760 Anglo-Cherokee War.\nKing George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, as his government tried to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes they depended on as allies. The Crown found the ruling difficult to enforce with colonists.\nFrom 1771 to 1772, North Carolinian settlers squatted on Cherokee lands in Tennessee, forming the Watauga Association. Daniel Boone and his party tried to settle in Kentucky, but the Shawnee, Delaware, Mingo, and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party that included Boone's son, James Boone, and William Russell's son, Henry, who were killed in the skirmish.\nIn 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by Cornstalk, Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the Second Cherokee War. Overhill Cherokee Nancy Ward, Dragging Canoe's cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the Overhill towns in what is now Tennessee. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.\nDragging Canoe and his band settled along Chickamauga Creek near present-day Chattanooga, Tennessee, where they established 11 new towns. Chickamauga Town was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the Chickamauga to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a guerrilla war against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee\u2013American wars, but this is not a historian's term.\nThe first Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse, signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the Cumberland and Duck rivers (i.e. the Cumberland Plateau) to Tennessee.\nScots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century.\nThe traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the Highlands. A few were Scotch-Irish, English, French, and German (see Scottish Indian trade). Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some of their mixed-race children, who were raised in Native American cultures, later became significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast.\nNotable traders, agents, and refugee Tories among the Cherokee included John Stuart, Henry Stuart, Alexander Cameron, John McDonald, John Joseph Vann (father of James Vann), Daniel Ross (father of John Ross), John Walker Sr., Mark Winthrop Battle, John McLemore (father of Bob), William Buchanan, John Watts (father of John Watts Jr.), John D. Chisholm, John Benge (father of Bob Benge), Thomas Brown, John Rogers (Welsh), John Gunter (German, founder of Gunter's Landing), James Adair (Irish), William Thorpe (English), and Peter Hildebrand (German), among many others. Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.\nBy contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were Scotch-Irish, Irish from Ulster who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the plantation of Ulster. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scotch-Irish who were Loyalists, such as Simon Girty.\n19th century.\nAcculturation.\nThe Cherokee lands between the Tennessee and Chattahoochee rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the Cherokee\u2013American wars. The deerskin trade was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling Cherokee Nation began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.\nGeorge Washington sought to 'civilize' Southeastern Native Americans, through programs overseen by the Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins. He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the American Revolutionary War. The deerskin trade brought white-tailed deer to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat. The government supplied the tribes with spinning wheels and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor. Americans instructed the women in weaving. Eventually, Hawkins helped them set up smithies, gristmills and cotton plantations.\nThe Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs Little Turkey (1788\u20131801), Black Fox (1801\u20131811), and Pathkiller (1811\u20131827), all former warriors of Dragging Canoe. The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of James Vann and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s The Ridge and Charles R. Hicks advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming. In 1801 they invited Moravian missionaries from North Carolina to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.' The Moravians and later Congregationalist missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions school in Connecticut.\nIn 1806 a Federal Road from Savannah, Georgia, to Knoxville, Tennessee, was built through Cherokee land. Chief James Vann opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the Chattahoochee and built a cotton-plantation on a spur of the road from Athens, Georgia, to Nashville. His son 'Rich Joe' Vann developed the plantation to , cultivated by 150 slaves. He exported cotton to England, and owned a steamboat on the Tennessee River.\nThe Cherokee allied with the U.S. against the nativist and pro-British Red Stick faction of the Upper Creek in the Creek War during the War of 1812. Cherokee warriors led by Major Ridge played a major role in General Andrew Jackson's victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Major Ridge moved his family to Rome, Georgia, where he built a substantial house, developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the Oostanaula River. Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chief John Ross, the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing (Chattanooga, Tennessee). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.\nAround 1809 Sequoyah began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced Cherokee syllabary, the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of Central America. Initially, his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.\nIn 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the Oostanaula (near present-day Calhoun, Georgia). In November 1825, New Town became the capital of the Cherokee Nation, and was renamed New Echota, after the Overhill Cherokee principal town of Chota. Sequoyah's syllabary was adopted. They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son John Ridge. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed John Ross as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the Vermont missionary Samuel Worcester and Major Ridge's nephew Elias Boudinot, who had taken the name of his white benefactor, a leader of the Continental Congress and New Jersey Congressman. They translated the Bible into Cherokee syllabary. Boudinot published the first edition of the bilingual 'Cherokee Phoenix,' the first American Indian newspaper, in February 1828.\nRemoval era.\nBefore the final removal to present-day Oklahoma, many Cherokees relocated to present-day Arkansas, Missouri and Texas. Between 1775 and 1786 the Cherokee, along with people of other nations such as the Choctaw and Chickasaw, began voluntarily settling along the Arkansas and Red Rivers.\nIn 1802, the federal government promised to extinguish Indian titles to lands claimed by Georgia in return for Georgia's cession of the western lands that became Alabama and Mississippi. To convince the Cherokee to move voluntarily in 1815, the US government established a Cherokee Reservation in Arkansas. The reservation boundaries extended from north of the Arkansas River to the southern bank of the White River. Di'wali (The Bowl), Sequoyah, Spring Frog and Tatsi (Dutch) and their bands settled there. These Cherokees became known as \"Old Settlers.\"\nThe Cherokee eventually migrated as far north as the Missouri Bootheel by 1816. They lived interspersed among the Delawares and Shawnees of that area. The Cherokee in Missouri Territory increased rapidly in population, from 1,000 to 6,000 over the next year (1816\u20131817), according to reports by Governor William Clark. Increased conflicts with the Osage Nation led to the Battle of Claremore Mound and the eventual establishment of Fort Smith between Cherokee and Osage communities. In the Treaty of St. Louis (1825), the Osage were made to \"cede and relinquish to the United States, all their right, title, interest, and claim, to lands lying within the State of Missouri and Territory of Arkansas...\" to make room for the Cherokee and the \"Mashcoux\", Muscogee Creeks. As late as the winter of 1838, Cherokee and Creek living in the Missouri and Arkansas areas petitioned the War Department to remove the Osage from the area.\nA group of Cherokee traditionalists led by \"Di'wali\" moved to Spanish Texas in 1819. Settling near Nacogdoches, they were welcomed by Mexican authorities as potential allies against Anglo-American colonists. The Texas Cherokees were mostly neutral during the Texas War of Independence. In 1836, they signed a treaty with Texas President Sam Houston, an adopted member of the Cherokee tribe. His successor Mirabeau Lamar sent militia to evict them in 1839.\nTrail of Tears.\nFollowing the War of 1812, and the concurrent Red Stick War, the U.S. government persuaded several groups of Cherokee to a voluntary removal to the Arkansas Territory. These were the \"Old Settlers\", the first of the Cherokee to make their way to what would eventually become Indian Territory (modern day Oklahoma). This effort was headed by Indian Agent Return J. Meigs, and was finalized with the signing of the Jackson and McMinn Treaty, giving the Old Settlers undisputed title to the lands designated for their use.\nDuring this time, Georgia focused on removing the Cherokee's neighbors, the Lower Creek. Georgia Governor George Troup and his cousin William McIntosh, chief of the Lower Creek, signed the Treaty of Indian Springs in 1825, ceding the last Muscogee (Creek) lands claimed by Georgia. The state's northwestern border reached the Chattahoochee, the border of the Cherokee Nation. In 1829, gold was discovered at Dahlonega, on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia. The Georgia Gold Rush was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee. When Andrew Jackson was inaugurated as president in 1829, Georgia gained a strong ally in Washington. In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, authorizing the forcible relocation of American Indians east of the Mississippi to a new Indian Territory.\nJackson claimed the removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction as a people, which he considered the fate that \"...the Mohegan, the Narragansett, and the Delaware\" had suffered. There is, however, ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting to modern farming techniques. A modern analysis shows that the area was in general in a state of economic surplus and could have accommodated both the Cherokee and new settlers.\nThe Cherokee brought their grievances to a US judicial review that set a precedent in Indian country. John Ross traveled to Washington, D.C., and won support from National Republican Party leaders Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. Samuel Worcester campaigned on behalf of the Cherokee in New England, where their cause was taken up by Ralph Waldo Emerson (see Emerson's 1838 letter to Martin Van Buren). In June 1830, a delegation led by Chief Ross defended Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Cherokee Nation v. Georgia\".\nIn 1831, Georgia militia arrested Samuel Worcester for residing on Indian lands without a state permit, imprisoning him in Milledgeville. In \"Worcester v. Georgia\" (1832), the US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that American Indian nations were \"distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights,\" and entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments that infringed on their sovereignty. \"Worcester v. Georgia\" is considered one of the most important dicta in law dealing with Native Americans.\nJackson ignored the Supreme Court's ruling, as he needed to conciliate Southern sectionalism during the era of the Nullification Crisis. His landslide reelection in 1832 emboldened calls for Cherokee removal. Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a Land Lottery, and the state militia occupied New Echota. The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to Red Clay, a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim. Ross had the support of Cherokee traditionalists, who could not imagine removal from their ancestral lands.\nA small group known as the \"Ridge Party\" or the \"Treaty Party\" saw relocation as inevitable and believed the Cherokee Nation needed to make the best deal to preserve their rights in Indian Territory. Led by Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot, they represented the Cherokee elite, whose homes, plantations and businesses were confiscated, or under threat of being taken by white squatters with Georgia land-titles. With capital to acquire new lands, they were more inclined to accept relocation. On December 29, 1835, the \"Ridge Party\" signed the Treaty of New Echota, stipulating terms and conditions for the removal of the Cherokee Nation. In return for their lands, the Cherokee were promised a large tract in the Indian Territory, $5 million, and $300,000 for improvements on their new lands.\nJohn Ross gathered over 15,000 signatures for a petition to the U.S. Senate, insisting that the treaty was invalid because it did not have the support of the majority of the Cherokee people. The Senate passed the Treaty of New Echota by a one-vote margin. It was enacted into law in May 1836.\nTwo years later, President Martin Van Buren ordered 7,000 federal troops and state militia under General Winfield Scott into Cherokee lands to evict the tribe. Over 16,000 Cherokee were forcibly relocated westward to Indian Territory in 1838\u20131839, a migration known as the Trail of Tears or in Cherokee or (\"The Trail Where They Cried\"), although it is described by another word (\"The Removal\"). Marched over across Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas, the people suffered from disease, exposure and starvation, and as many as 4,000 died, nearly a fifth of the population. As some Cherokees were slaveholders, they took enslaved African Americans with them west of the Mississippi. Intermarried European Americans and missionaries also walked the Trail of Tears. Ross preserved a vestige of independence by negotiating permission for the Cherokee to conduct their own removal under U.S. supervision.\nIn keeping with the tribe's \"blood law\" that prescribed the death penalty for Cherokee who sold lands, Ross's son arranged the murder of the leaders of the \"Treaty Party\". On June 22, 1839, a party of twenty-five Ross supporters assassinated Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot. The party included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald, James and Joseph Spear. Boudinot's brother Stand Watie fought and survived that day, escaping to Arkansas.\nIn 1827, Sequoyah had led a delegation of Old Settlers to Washington, D.C., to negotiate for the exchange of Arkansas land for land in Indian Territory. After the Trail of Tears, he helped mediate divisions between the Old Settlers and the rival factions of the more recent arrivals. In 1839, as President of the Western Cherokee, Sequoyah signed an Act of Union with John Ross that reunited the two groups of the Cherokee Nation.\nEastern Band.\nThe Cherokee living along the Oconaluftee River in the Great Smoky Mountains were the most conservative and isolated from European\u2013American settlements. They rejected the reforms of the Cherokee Nation. When the Cherokee government ceded all territory east of the Little Tennessee River to North Carolina in 1819, they withdrew from the Nation. William Holland Thomas, a white store owner and state legislator from Jackson County, North Carolina, helped over 600 Cherokee from Qualla Town obtain North Carolina citizenship, which exempted them from forced removal. Over 400 Cherokee either hid from Federal troops in the remote Snowbird Mountains, under the leadership of Tsali (), or belonged to the former Valley Towns area around the Cheoah River who negotiated with the state government to stay in North Carolina. An additional 400 Cherokee stayed on reserves in Southeast Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northeast Alabama, as citizens of their respective states. Together, these groups were the ancestors of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and some of the state-recognized tribes in surrounding states.\nCivil War.\nThe American Civil War was devastating for both East and Western Cherokee. The Eastern Band, aided by William Thomas, became the Thomas Legion of Cherokee Indians and Highlanders, fighting for the Confederacy in the American Civil War. Cherokee in Indian Territory divided into Union and Confederate factions.\nStand Watie, the leader of the Ridge Party, raised a regiment for Confederate service in 1861. John Ross, who had reluctantly agreed to ally with the Confederacy, was captured by Federal troops in 1862. He lived in a self-imposed exile in Philadelphia, supporting the Union. In the Indian Territory, the national council of those who supported the Union voted to abolish slavery in the Cherokee Nation in 1863, but they were not the majority slaveholders and the vote had little effect on those supporting the Confederacy.\nWatie was elected Principal Chief of the pro-Confederacy majority. A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in Indian Territory and Arkansas, capturing Union supply trains and steamboats, and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862. He became a Brigadier General of the Confederate States; the only other American Indian to hold the rank in the American Civil War was Ely S. Parker with the Union Army. On June 25, 1865, two months after Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Stand Watie became the last Confederate General to stand down.\nReconstruction and late 19th century.\nAfter the Civil War, the U.S. government required the Cherokee Nation to sign a new treaty, because of its alliance with the Confederacy. The U.S. required the 1866 Treaty to provide for the emancipation of all Cherokee slaves, and full citizenship to all Cherokee Freedmen and all African Americans who chose to continue to reside within tribal lands, so that they \"shall have all the rights of native Cherokees.\" Both before and after the Civil War, some Cherokee intermarried or had relationships with African Americans, just as they had with whites. Many Cherokee Freedmen have been active politically within the tribe.\nThe US government also acquired easement rights to the western part of the territory, which became the Oklahoma Territory, for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would be better off if each family owned its own land. The Dawes Act of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The U.S. government counted the remainder of tribal land as \"surplus\" and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.\nThe Curtis Act of 1898 dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant the abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the Five Civilized Tribes of the Indian Territory proposed the creation of the State of Sequoyah as one to be exclusively Native American but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the Oklahoma and Indian Territories entered the union as the state of Oklahoma.\nBy the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a segregated society. In the aftermath of Reconstruction, conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively disenfranchise all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed Jim Crow laws that divided society into \"white\" and \"colored\", mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored. Black Americans and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as U.S. citizens enforced until after the Civil Rights Movement secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.\nTribal land jurisdiction status.\nOn July 9, 2020, the United States Supreme Court decided in the McGirt v Oklahoma decision in a criminal jurisdiction case that roughly half the land of the state of Oklahoma made up of tribal nations like the Cherokee are officially Native American tribal land jurisdictions. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, himself a Cherokee Nation citizen, sought to reverse the Supreme Court decision. The following year, the state of Oklahoma couldn't block federal action to grant the Cherokee Nation\u2014along with the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminole Nations\u2014reservation status.\nPopulation history.\nJohn R. Swanton enumerates 201 Cherokee villages and towns. The Cherokee had 6,000 warriors (and therefore around 30,000 people) in years 1730\u201335 according to J. Adair. In 1738 they also had 6,000 warriors, but down to 5,000 in 1740 (according to Ga. Hist. Coll., II). Colonel James Oglethorpe confirms that they had 5,000 warriors in 1739 (Ga. Coll. Rec., V). Also according to Ga. Coll. Rec., V an epidemic reduced them \"by almost one-half\" in 1738, but this source doesn't specify how numerous they were before the epidemic. Perhaps this source exaggerates the casualties caused by that epidemic, and in fact it killed just around 1,000 warriors. Arthur Dobbs estimated the Cherokee warrior strength in 1755 at 2,590 (but W. Douglas at about the same time reported 6,000 warriors). In 1761 soon after the end of the Anglo-Cherokee War there were 2,300 warriors according to J. Adair. By year 1768 their number recovered back to 3,000 warriors, and B. R. Carroll in \"Historical Collections of South Carolina\" also reported that they had 3,000 warriors. By 1819 there were 4,000 warriors (and therefore around 20,000 people - including about 5,000 to the west of the Mississippi). George Catlin estimated 22,000 Cherokees in 1832, before their removal. But according to a report by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs dated November 25, 1841, the number of Cherokees who had already been removed west of the Mississippi (to Oklahoma, Indian Territory) was 25,911. Henry Schoolcraft reported 21,707 Cherokees in 1857. Indian Affairs 1861 reported 22,000. Enumeration published in 1886 counted 23,000 Cherokee in Oklahoma (Indian Territory) as of year 1884. Indian Affairs reported in 1890 around 25,000 among the Western Cherokee (in Oklahoma) and in years 1884 and 1889 around 3,000 among the Eastern Cherokee. The Cherokee national census of 1890 in Oklahoma gave the total number of the nation under Cherokee law to be 25,978. In 1900 there were 35,000 in Oklahoma. According to James Mooney (quoted by Frederick Webb Hodge) the majority of the earlier estimates of the Cherokee population are probably too low as the Cherokee occupied so extensive a territory that only a part of them came into contact with the Whites. Indian Affairs 1910 reported that in 1910 the Cherokee in Oklahoma contained 41,701 people, including 36,301 by blood, 286 by intermarriage and 4,917 Freedmen. While the census of 1910 counted 31,489 Cherokees.\nIn the 2020 census a total of 1,130,730 people claimed Cherokee ancestry. However the percentage of full-blood individuals is probably very low considering that the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians reported having only 395 full-blood members. Perhaps there is a larger number of full-blood individuals among the United Keetoowah Band and among the Cherokee Nation.\nCulture.\nSpirituality.\nThe Cherokee believe that the world is divided into two major spiritual forces: \"red\" (war, success, youth) and \"white\" (peace, introspection, old age).\nCultural institutions.\nThe Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, Inc., of Cherokee, North Carolina, is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative. They were founded in 1946 to provide a venue for traditional Eastern Band Cherokee artists. The Museum of the Cherokee People, also in Cherokee, displays permanent and changing exhibits, houses archives and collections important to Cherokee history, and sponsors cultural groups, such as the Warriors of the AniKituhwa dance group.\nIn 2007, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians entered into a partnership with Southwestern Community College and Western Carolina University to create the Oconaluftee Institute for Cultural Arts (OICA), to emphasize native art and culture in traditional fine arts education. This is intended both to preserve traditional art forms and encourage exploration of contemporary ideas. Located in Cherokee, OICA offered an associate degree program. In August 2010, OICA acquired a letterpress and had the Cherokee syllabary recast to begin printing one-of-a-kind fine art books and prints in the Cherokee language. In 2012, the Fine Art degree program at OICA was incorporated into Southwestern Community College and moved to the SCC Swain Center, where it continues to operate.\nThe Cherokee Heritage Center, of Park Hill, Oklahoma, is the site of a reproduction of an ancient Cherokee village, Adams Rural Village (including 19th-century buildings), Nofire Farms, and the Cherokee Family Research Center for genealogy. The Cherokee Heritage Center also houses the Cherokee National Archives. Both the Cherokee Nation (of Oklahoma) and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee, as well as other tribes, contribute funding to the CHC.\nMarriage.\nBefore the 19th century, polygamy was common among the Cherokee, especially by elite men. The matrilineal culture meant that women controlled property, such as their dwellings, and their children were considered born into their mother's clan, where they gained hereditary status. Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders. In addition, the society was matrifocal; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives. Her eldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.\nIt was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman. The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation. They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture. As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as John Ridge and Elias Boudinot to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.\nIn the late nineteenth century, the U.S. government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining the approval of ten of her blood relatives. Once married, the man had status as an \"Intermarried White,\" a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. Common law marriages were more popular. Such \"Intermarried Whites\" were listed in a separate category on the registers of the Dawes Rolls, prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for assimilation of the Native Americans.\nEthnobotany definition.\nEthnobotany is the study of interrelations between humans and plants; however, current use of the term implies the study of Indigenous or traditional knowledge of plants. It involves the Indigenous knowledge of plant classification, cultivation, and use as food, medicine and shelter.\nGender roles.\nMen and women have historically played important yet, at times, different roles in Cherokee society. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and \"mothers\" of the clans. As in many Native American cultures, Cherokee women are honored as life-givers. As givers and nurturers of life via childbirth and the growing of plants, and community leaders as clan mothers, women are traditionally community leaders in Cherokee communities. Some have served as warriors, both historically and in contemporary culture in military service. Cherokee women are regarded as tradition-keepers and responsible for cultural preservation.\nThe redefining of gender roles in Cherokee society first occurred in the time period between 1776 and 1835. This period is demarcated by the De Soto exploration and subsequent invasion, was followed by the American Revolution in 1776, and culminated with the signing of Treaty of New Echota in 1835. The purpose of this redefinition was to push European social standards and norms on the Cherokee people. The long-lasting effect of these practices reorganized Cherokee forms of government towards a male-dominated society which has affected the nation for generations. Miles argues white agents were mainly responsible for the shifting of Cherokee attitudes toward women's role in politics and domestic spaces. These \"white agents\" could be identified as white missionaries and white settlers seeking out \"manifest destiny\". By the time of removal in the mid-1830s, Cherokee men and women had begun to fulfill different roles and expectations as defined by the \"civilization\" program promoted by US presidents Washington and Jefferson.\nWhile there is a record of a non-Native traveler in 1825 noticing what he considered to be \"men who assumed the dress and performed the duties of women\", this observer was unfamiliar with how the Natives in that region dressed. There is no evidence of what would now be considered \"two-spirit\" individuals in Cherokee society; this is generally the case in matriarchal and matrilineal cultures, as third gender roles are usually found in patriarchal societies and cultures with more rigid gender roles.\nSlavery.\nSlavery was a component of Cherokee society prior to European colonization, as they frequently enslaved enemy captives taken during times of conflict with other Indigenous tribes. By their oral tradition, the Cherokee viewed slavery as the result of an individual's failure in warfare and as a temporary status, pending release or the slave's adoption into the tribe. During the colonial era, Carolinian settlers purchased or impressed Cherokees as slaves during the late 17th and early 18th century. The Cherokee were also among the Native American peoples who sold Indian slaves to traders for use as laborers in Virginia and further north. They took them as captives in raids on enemy tribes.\nAs the Cherokee began to adopt some European-American customs, they began to purchase enslaved African Americans to serve as workers on their farms or plantations, which some of the elite families had in the antebellum years. When the Cherokee were forcibly removed on the Trail of Tears, they took slaves with them, and acquired others in Indian Territory.\nLanguage and writing system.\nThe Cherokee speak a Southern Iroquoian language, which is polysynthetic and is written in a syllabary invented by Sequoyah () in the 1810s. For years, many people wrote and transliterated Cherokee or used poor intercompatible fonts to type out the syllabary. However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to Unicode, the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.\nBecause of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include \"ditiyohihi\" (), which means \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,\" meaning \"attorney.\" Another example is \"didaniyisgi\" () which means \"he catches them finally and conclusively,\" meaning \"policeman.\"\nMany words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as \"gasoline\", which in Cherokee is (). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named \"Nowata\". The word is a Delaware Indian word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name \"nowata\" for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town \"Amadikanigvnagvna\" () which means \"the water is all gone from here\", i.e. \"no water\".\nOther examples of borrowed words are () for \"coffee\" and () for \"watch\" (which led to () or \"big watch\" for \"clock\").\nThe following table is an example of Cherokee text and its translation:\nTreaties and government.\nTreaties.\nThe Cherokee have participated in at least thirty-six treaties in the past three hundred years.\nGovernment.\nAfter being ravaged by smallpox, and feeling pressure from European settlers, the Cherokee adopted a European-American Representative democracy form of government in an effort to retain their lands. They established a governmental system modeled on that of the United States, with an elected principal chief, senate, and house of representatives. On April 10, 1810 the seven Cherokee clans met and began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government. Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established. In 1825, the National Council extended citizenship to the children of Cherokee men married to white women. These ideas were largely incorporated into the 1827 Cherokee constitution. The constitution stated that \"No person who is of negro or mulatto [\"sic\"] parentage, either by the father or mother side, shall be eligible to hold any office of profit, honor or trust under this Government,\" with an exception for, \"negroes and descendants of white and Indian men by negro women who may have been set free.\" This definition to limit rights of multiracial descendants may have been more widely held among the elite than the general population.\nModern Cherokee tribes.\nCherokee Nation.\nDuring 1898\u20131906 the federal government dissolved the former Cherokee Nation, to make way for the incorporation of Indian Territory into the new state of Oklahoma. From 1906 to 1975, the structure and function of the tribal government were defunct, except for the purposes of DOI management. In 1975 the tribe drafted a constitution, which they ratified on June 26, 1976, and the tribe received federal recognition.\nIn 1999, the CN changed or added several provisions to its constitution, among them the designation of the tribe to be \"Cherokee Nation,\" dropping \"of Oklahoma.\" According to a 2009 statement by BIA head Larry Echo Hawk, the Cherokee Nation is not legally considered the \"historical Cherokee tribe\" but instead a \"successor in interest.\" The attorney of the Cherokee Nation has stated that they intend to appeal this decision.\nThe modern Cherokee Nation, in recent times, has expanded economically, providing equality and prosperity for its citizens. Under the leadership of Principal Chief Bill John Baker, the Nation has significant business, corporate, real estate, and agricultural interests. The CN controls Cherokee Nation Entertainment, Cherokee Nation Industries, and Cherokee Nation Businesses. CNI is a very large defense contractor that creates thousands of jobs in eastern Oklahoma for Cherokee citizens.\nThe CN has constructed health clinics throughout Oklahoma, contributed to community development programs, built roads and bridges, constructed learning facilities and universities for its citizens, instilled the practice of Gadugi and self-reliance, revitalized language immersion programs for its children and youth, and is a powerful and positive economic and political force in Eastern Oklahoma.\nThe CN hosts the Cherokee National Holiday on Labor Day weekend each year, and 80,000 to 90,000 Cherokee citizens travel to Tahlequah, Oklahoma, for the festivities. It publishes the \"Cherokee Phoenix,\" the tribal newspaper, in both English and Cherokee, using the Sequoyah syllabary. The Cherokee Nation council appropriates money for historic foundations concerned with the preservation of Cherokee culture.\nThe Cherokee Nation supports the Cherokee Nation Film festivals in Tahlequah, Oklahoma and participates in the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.\nEastern Band of Cherokee Indians.\nThe Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, led by Chief Richard Sneed,\nhosts over a million visitors a year to cultural attractions of the sovereign nation. The reservation, the \"Qualla Boundary\", has a population of over 8,000 Cherokee, primarily direct descendants of Indians who managed to avoid \"The Trail of Tears\".\nAttractions include the Oconaluftee Indian Village, Museum of the Cherokee Indian, and the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual. Founded in 1946, the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual is the country's oldest and foremost Native American crafts cooperative. The outdoor drama \"Unto These Hills\", which debuted in 1950, recently broke record attendance sales. Together with Harrah's Cherokee Casino and Hotel, Cherokee Indian Hospital and Cherokee Boys Club, the tribe generated $78 million in the local economy in 2005.\nUnited Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.\nThe United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians formed their government under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and gained federal recognition in 1946. Enrollment in the tribe is limited to people with a quarter or more of Cherokee blood. Many members of the UKB are descended from Old Settlers \u2013 Cherokees who moved to Arkansas and Indian Territory before the Trail of Tears. Of the 12,000 people enrolled in the tribe, 11,000 live in Oklahoma. Their chief is Joe Bunch.\nThe UKB operate a tribal casino, bingo hall, smokeshop, fuel outlets, truck stop, and gallery that showcases art and crafts made by tribal members. The tribe issues their own tribal vehicle tags.\nRelations among the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes.\nThe Cherokee Nation participates in numerous joint programs with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. It also participates in cultural exchange programs and joint Tribal Council meetings involving councilors from both Cherokee Tribes. These are held to address issues affecting all of the Cherokee people.\n174 years after the Trail of Tears, on July 12, 2012, the leaders of the three separate Cherokee tribes met in North Carolina.\nContemporary settlement.\nCherokee people are most concentrated in Oklahoma and North Carolina, but some reside in the US West Coast, due to economic migrations caused by the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression, job availability during the Second World War, and the Federal Indian Relocation program during the 1950s\u20131960s. Destinations for Cherokee diaspora included multi-ethnic/racial urban centers of California (i.e. the Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Areas). They frequently live in farming communities, or by military bases and other Indian reservations.\nMembership controversies.\nTribal recognition and citizenship.\nThe three Cherokee tribes have differing requirements for enrollment. The Cherokee Nation determines enrollment by lineal descent from Cherokees listed on the Dawes Rolls and has no minimum blood quantum requirement. Currently, descendants of the Dawes Cherokee Freedman rolls are citizens of the tribe, pending court decisions. The Cherokee Nation includes numerous citizens who have mixed ancestry, including African-American, Latino American, Asian American, European-American, and others. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum of one-sixteenth Cherokee blood quantum (genealogical descent, equivalent to one great-great-grandparent) and an ancestor on the Baker Roll. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum of one-quarter Keetoowah Cherokee blood quantum (equivalent to one grandparent). The UKB does not allow citizens who have relinquished their citizenship to re-enroll in the UKB.\nThe 2000 United States census reported 729,533 Americans self-identified as Cherokee. The 2010 census reported an increased number of 819,105 with almost 70% being mixed-race Cherokees. In 2015, the Cherokee Nation, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, and the Eastern Band of Cherokees had a combined enrolled population of roughly 344,700.\nOver 200 groups claim to be Cherokee nations, tribes, or bands. Cherokee Nation spokesman Mike Miller has suggested that some groups, which he calls Cherokee Heritage Groups, are encouraged. Others, however, are controversial for their attempts to gain economically through their claims to be Cherokee. The three federally recognized groups note that they are the only groups having the legal right to present themselves as Cherokee Indian Tribes and only their enrolled citizens are legally Cherokee.\nOne exception to this may be the Texas Cherokee. Before 1975, they were considered part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the Indian Claims Commission. At one time W.W. Keeler served as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation and, at the same time, held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.\nFollowing the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in Rusk County, Texas, were excluded from CN citizenship. Because they had already migrated from Indian Territory at the time of the Dawes Commission, their ancestors were not recorded on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, which serve as the basis for tracing descent for many individuals. But, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or Old settler rolls.\nWhile most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation after the Civil War and following the death of John Ross in 1866, in the 21st century, there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They have treaty rights going back to the Treaty of Bird's Fort. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation.\nOther remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay, and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government that gave individual land allotments to Cherokee households. State-recognized tribes may have different membership requirements and genealogical documentation than to the federally recognized ones.\nCurrent enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the US Bureau of Indian Affairs. The CN noted such facts during the Constitutional Convention held to ratify a new governing document. The document was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83, the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.\nCherokee Freedmen.\nThe Cherokee Freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the Antebellum Period, were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866. This was in the wake of the American Civil War, when the U.S. emancipated slaves and passed US constitutional amendments granting freedmen citizenship in the United States.\nIn 1988, the federal court in the Freedmen case of \"Nero v. Cherokee Nation\" held that Cherokees could decide citizenship requirements and exclude Freedmen. On March 7, 2006, the Cherokee Nation Judicial Appeal Tribunal ruled that the Cherokee Freedmen were eligible for Cherokee citizenship. This ruling proved controversial; while the Cherokee Freedman had historically been recorded as \"citizens\" of the Cherokee Nation at least since 1866 and the later Dawes Commission Land Rolls, the ruling \"did not limit membership to people possessing Cherokee blood\". This ruling was consistent with the 1975 Constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, in its acceptance of the Cherokee Freedmen on the basis of historical citizenship, rather than documented blood relation.\nOn March 3, 2007, a constitutional amendment was passed by a Cherokee vote limiting citizenship to Cherokees on the Dawes Rolls for those listed as Cherokee by blood on the Dawes roll, which did not include partial Cherokee descendants of slaves, Shawnee and Delaware. The Cherokee Freedmen had 90 days to appeal this amendment vote which disenfranchised them from Cherokee citizenship and file appeal within the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council, which is currently pending in \"Nash, et al. v. Cherokee Nation Registrar\". On May 14, 2007, the Cherokee Freedmen were reinstated as citizens of the Cherokee Nation by the Cherokee Nation Tribal Courts through a temporary order and temporary injunction until the court reached its final decision. On January 14, 2011, the tribal district court ruled that the 2007 constitutional amendment was invalid because it conflicted with the 1866 treaty guaranteeing the Freedmen's rights.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite the label \"sect\", most members remained in the established (and dominant) Church of England, which was highly interwoven with offices of state.\nHistory.\nThe Clapham movement grew from 18th-century evangelical trends in the Church of England (the Anglican Church) and started to coalesce around residents of Clapham, especially during the rectorship there of John Venn (in office: 1792-1813)\nand came to engage in systematically advocating social reform.\nIn the course of time the growth of evangelical Christian revivalism in England\nand the movement for Catholic emancipation fed into a waning of the old precept that every Englishman automatically counted as an Anglican.\nSome new Christian groups (such as the Methodists and the Plymouth Brethren) moved away from Anglicanism, and the Christian social reformers who succeeded the Claphamites from about the 1830s\noften exemplified Nonconformist conscience\nand identified with groups functioning outside the established Anglican Church.\nSummary and context.\nThese were reformists and abolitionists, being contemporary terms as the 'Sect' was \u2013 until 1844 \u2013 unnamed. They figured and heard readings, sermons and lessons from prominent and wealthy Evangelical Anglicans who called for the liberation of slaves, abolition of the slave trade and the reform of the penal system, and recognised and advocated other cornerstone civil-political rights and socio-economic rights. Defying the status quo of labour exploitation and consequent vested interests in the legislature was laborious and was motivated by their Christian faith and concern for social justice and fairness for all human beings. Their most famous member was William Wilberforce, widely commemorated in monuments and credited with hastening the end of the slave trade.\nElectoral and other political rights were a main cause of all Radicals then their Northern successors the Chartists, their shared earliest success being the Great Reform Act 1832. Many of the other key rights saw a comparative context in treatises of the Age of Enlightenment, and Age of Revolutions. France's 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, together with the 1689 English Bill of Rights, the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, and the 1789 United States Bill of Rights, inspired, in large part, the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nCampaigns and successes.\nThe name stems from most of its figures being non-dissenting parishioners of Clapham, then a village south of London (today part of south-west London), where Wilberforce and Thornton, its two most influential leaders, often lived and met. Liturgy, sermons and sometimes meetings at Holy Trinity Church on Clapham Common were a central feature, largely neighboured by upmarket new homes and expensive single-home plots of land (fashionable villas in the terms of the time).\nHenry Venn, since seen as the founder, was lesser clergy, Curate, there (from at least 1754) and his son John became rector (parish priest) (1792\u20131813). The House of Commons politicians (MPs) William Wilberforce (first elected 1780) and Henry Thornton (first elected 1782), two of the most influential of the sect were parishioners and many of the meetings were held in their houses. They were encouraged by Beilby Porteus, the Bishop of London, himself an abolitionist and reformer, who sympathised with many of their aims. The term \"Clapham Sect\" is an almost non-contemporaneous invention by James Stephen in an article of 1844 which celebrated and romanticised the work of these reformers.\nThe reformers included members from St Edmund Hall, Oxford and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Charles Simeon had preached to students from the university, some of whom underwent an evangelical conversion experience and later became associated with the Clapham Sect.\nLampooned in their day as \"the saints\", the group published a journal, the \"Christian Observer\", edited by Zachary Macaulay and were also credited with the foundation of several missionary and tract societies, including the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Church Missionary Society.\nAfter many decades of work both in British society and in Parliament, the reformers saw their efforts rewarded with the final passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807, banning the trade throughout the British Empire and, after many further years of campaigning, the total emancipation of British slaves with the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. They also campaigned vigorously for Britain to use its influence to work towards abolishing slavery throughout the world.\nSome of the group, Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce, were responsible for the founding in 1787 of Sierra Leone as a settlement for some of the African-Americans freed by the British during the American Revolutionary War; it thus became the first non trading-post British \"colony\" akin to a fledgling mission state in Africa, whose purpose in Clarkson's words was \"the abolition of the slave trade, the civilisation of Africa, and the introduction of the gospel there\". Later, in 1792, another of the group John Clarkson was instrumental in the creation of its capital Freetown.\nThe group are described by the historian Stephen Tomkins as \"a network of friends and families in England, with William Wilberforce as its centre of gravity, who were powerfully bound together by their shared moral and spiritual values, by their religious mission and social activism, by their love for each other, and by marriage\".\nBy 1848 when evangelical bishop John Bird Sumner became Archbishop of Canterbury, it is said that between a quarter and a third of Anglican clergy were linked to the movement, which by then had diversified greatly in its goals, although they were no longer considered an organised faction.\nMembers of the group founded or were involved with a number of other societies, including the Abolition Society, formally known as the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade (founded by Clarkson, Sharp and others) and run largely by white middle-class women of Quaker, Unitarian and Evangelical faiths. The Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions followed in 1823. There was also the Proclamation Society, the Sunday School Society, the Bettering Society, and the Small Debt Society.\nThe Clapham Sect have been credited with playing a significant part in the development of Victorian morality, through their writings, their societies, their influence in Parliament, and their example in philanthropy and moral campaigns, especially against slavery. In the words of Tomkins, \"The ethos of Clapham became the spirit of the age.\"\nMembers.\nMembers of the Clapham Sect, and those associated with them, included:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50504", "revid": "30886872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50504", "title": "Ike Turner", "text": "American musician (1931\u20132007)\nIzear Luster \"Ike\" Turner Jr. (November 5, 1931 \u2013 December 12, 2007) was an American musician, bandleader, songwriter, record producer, and talent scout. An early pioneer of 1950s rock and roll, he is best known for his work in the 1960s and 1970s with his wife Tina Turner as the leader of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue.\nA native of Clarksdale, Mississippi, Turner began playing piano and guitar as a child and then formed the Kings of Rhythm as a teenager. His first recording, \"Rocket 88\" (credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats), is considered a contender for the distinction of first rock and roll song. During the 1950s, Turner also worked as a talent scout and producer for Sun Records and Modern Records. He was instrumental in the early careers of various blues musicians such as B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, and Bobby \"Blue\" Bland. In 1954, Turner relocated to East St. Louis where his Kings of Rhythm became one of the most renowned acts in Greater St. Louis. He formed the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue in 1960, which over the course of the decade became a soul/rock crossover success.\nTurner's cocaine addiction and legal troubles, together with accounts by Tina Turner of domestic violence (published in her 1986 autobiography \"I, Tina\" and the 1993 film adaptation \"What's Love Got to Do with It\"), had an impact on his career. Addicted to cocaine for at least 15 years, Turner was convicted of drug offenses and served 18 months in prison. After his release in 1991, he relapsed in 2004, and died of a drug overdose in 2007. During the last decade of his life, Turner revived his career as a frontman by returning to his blues roots. He released two award-winning albums, \"Here and Now\" (2001) and \"Risin' with the Blues\" (2006).\nHailed as a \"great innovator\" of rock and roll by contemporaries such as Little Richard and Johnny Otis, Turner received critical acclaim as well. \"Rolling Stone\" editor David Fricke ranked Turner No. 61 on his list of 100 Greatest Guitarists and noted, \"Turner was one of the first guitarists to successfully transplant the intensity of the blues into more commercial music.\" Turner won five Grammy Awards, including two competitive awards and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. He also received the Recording Academy's Heroes Award. Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Tina Turner in 1991. As a solo artist he is inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame, the Clarksdale Walk of Fame, the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame, the Blues Hall of Fame, and the Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nIzear Luster Turner Jr. was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, on November 5, 1931, to Beatrice Cushenberry, a seamstress, and Izear Luster Turner, a Baptist minister. His parents were Creole. Turner was the younger of their two children; his sister, Lee Ethel Knight, was \"some ten years\" his senior. When Turner applied for his first passport in the 1960s, he discovered that his name was registered as Ike Wister Turner. By then both of his parents were deceased, so he could not verify the origin of his name.\nBlues historian Ted Drozdowski claimed that Turner's father died in an industrial accident;\naccording to Turner, he witnessed his father beaten and left for dead by a white man (another account given by Turner alleged that \"a couple of pickup-truck loads of whites in khaki pants and khaki shirts\" dragged his father away, returning him after having \"kicked holes in his stomach\"). He claimed he was later told this assault was an act of retaliation over a woman with whom his father was having an affair, and that his father lived for two or three years as an invalid in a tent erected by the Health Department in the family's yard before succumbing to his injuries when Turner was about five years old. Donald Brackett, author of \"Tumult! The Incredible Life of Tina Turner\", observed Turner \"often related\" this story, but that \"like most Ike stories, it might need to be taken with a pound of salt.\"\nHis mother remarried an artist named Philip Reese, who Turner described as a violent alcoholic. One day after Reese gave him a whipping, Turner knocked him out with a length of lumber and ran away to Memphis for a few days before returning home. Despite their troubled relationship, Turner moved his stepfather into one of his homes in St. Louis after his mother died in 1959 and took care of him until his death in 1961.\nTurner recounted how he was sexually assaulted at the age of six by a woman called Miss Boozie. Walking past her house to school, she would invite him to help feed her chickens and then take him to bed. This continued daily for some time. Turner was also sexually assaulted by another middle-aged woman, Miss Reedy, before he was twelve. Reflecting on these experiences, he stated: \"That's probably why every relationship I was in was surrounded by sex. Sex was power to me.\"\nTurner attended Booker T. Washington Elementary School, then was promoted to Myrtle Hall in the sixth grade. He quit school in the eighth grade and began working as an elevator operator at the Alcazar Hotel in downtown Clarksdale. During breaks, he would watch DJ John Friskillo play records at the radio station, WROX, located in the hotel. WROX is noted for being the first radio station in Mississippi to employ a black DJ, Early Wright. One day, Friskillo spotted Turner watching and put him to work, teaching him the ins and outs of the control room. Soon, he was left to play records while Friskillo took coffee breaks. This led to Turner being offered a job by the station manager as the DJ on the late-afternoon shift. On his show, \"Jive Till Five\", he played a diverse range of music such as Roy Milton and Louis Jordan alongside early rockabilly records.\nTurner was inspired to learn the piano after he heard blues pianist Pinetop Perkins play at his friend Ernest Lane's house. Turner persuaded his mother to pay for piano lessons, but he did not take to the formal style of playing. Instead, he spent the money in a pool hall and learned boogie-woogie from Perkins. At some point in the 1940s, Turner moved into Clarksdale's Riverside Hotel. The Riverside played host to touring musicians, including Sonny Boy Williamson II and Duke Ellington. Turner associated with many of these musicians, and at 13 years old he backed Sonny Boy Williamson II on piano.\nCareer.\n1946\u20131950: Formation of the Kings of Rhythm.\nAs a teenager, Turner joined a local rhythm ensemble called the Tophatters, who played around Clarksdale, Mississippi. Members of the band were Clarksdale musicians and included Turner's school friends Raymond Hill, Eugene Fox and Clayton Love. The Tophatters played big band arrangements from sheet music. Turner, who was trained by ear and could not sight read, would learn the pieces by listening to a version on record at home, pretending to be reading the music during rehearsals. The Tophatters had over 30 members, but they broke up into two groups after six months to a year. One faction wanted to play jazz music and became the Dukes of Swing. The other band led by Turner became the Kings of Rhythm. Turner said, \"we wanted to play blues, boogie-woogie and Roy Brown, Jimmy Liggins, Roy Milton.\" Turner kept the name throughout his career, although it went through lineup changes over time. Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits. B.B. King helped them to get a steady weekend gig and recommended them to Sam Phillips at Memphis Recording Service. In the 1950s, Turner's group got regular airplay from live sessions on the radio stations WROX in Clarksdale and KFFA in Helena, Arkansas.\nAround the time he was starting out with the Kings of Rhythm, Turner and Lane became unofficial roadies for blues musician Robert Nighthawk, who often played live on WROX. The pair played drums and piano on radio sessions. Turner gained experience performing by supporting Nighthawk at gigs around Clarksdale. He played juke joints alongside other local blues artists such as Elmore James, Muddy Waters, and Little Walter. Performances typically lasted about twelve hours, from early evening to dawn the next day. Turner recalled, \"there wasn't no intermission. If the drummer had to pee, I would play drums until he returned...There were no breaks. We just switched around.\"\n1951: \"Rocket 88\".\nIn March 1951, Turner and his band recorded the song \"Rocket 88\" at Memphis Recording Service. Turner's vocalist Johnny O'Neal had left to sign a solo contract with King Records, so Jackie Brenston, a saxophonist in the Kings of Rhythm, sang lead vocals while Turner was on piano. \"Rocket 88\" is notable among other things for Willie Kizart's distorted guitar sound.\nPhillips licensed the recording to Chess Records in Chicago. Chess released it under the name \"Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats\" instead of \"Ike Turner and His Kings of Rhythm Featuring Jackie Brenston\". Turner blamed Phillips for this misrepresentation. Soon after its release, the single caused a sensation and Turner performed with his band at the W.C. Handy Theatre in Memphis.\nThe single reached number-one on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B charts in June 1951 and spent 5 weeks on top of the charts. The record sold approximately half a million copies. Turner and the band were paid $20 each for the record. The exception was Brenston, who sold the rights to Phillips for $910. Phillips used profits from the success of the record to launch Sun Records in February 1952.\nThe song is often cited as the first rock n' roll record, but in a later interview, Turner offered this assessment: \"I don't think that 'Rocket 88' is rock 'n' roll. I think that 'Rocket 88' is R&amp;B, but I think 'Rocket 88' is the cause of rock and roll existing\".\nThe success of \"Rocket 88\" generated tension and ego clashes in the band which culminated with Brenston leaving to pursue a solo career, causing the band to fall apart. Turner, without a band and disappointed his hit record had not created more opportunities for him, disbanded the Kings of Rhythm for a few years.\n1951\u20131954: Session musician and talent scout.\nSoon after the release of \"Rocket 88\", Turner moved to West Memphis, Arkansas and played with various local bands. He then became a freelance talent scout, session musician, and production assistant for Sam Phillips at Sun Studio, commuting to Memphis, Tennessee. Wishing to exploit his Delta music connections, the Bihari brothers at Modern Records also hired Turner as a talent scout, paying him to find southern musicians who might be worth recording. Turner arranged for B.B. King and the Beale Streeters to record for Modern at the YMCA in Memphis. Turner played piano on King's early records \"You Know I Love You\" and \"3 O'Clock Blues\", which became King's first two number-ones. According to Joe Bihari, Turner had brought King to his attention years prior. He said, \"Ike wasn't more than sixteen then. He would send dubs of things he cut to us, and if we'd like them we'd make a seal or sign the artist. That's how we acquired B.B. King.\" King also maintained that Turner introduced him to the Bihari brothers.\nUnaware of songwriter's royalties, Turner also wrote new material which the Biharis copyrighted under their own names. They often purchased or claimed co-writer credit of songs written by artists on their labels using pseudonyms. Turner estimated he wrote seventy-eight hit records for the Biharis. Artists Turner discovered for Modern and Sun include Bobby Bland, Howlin' Wolf, Rosco Gordon, Boyd Gilmore, Houston Boines, Charley Booker, and Little Milton. He played piano in sessions with them and lesser-known artists such as the Prisonaires, Driftin' Slim, Ben Burton, Matt Cockrell, Dennis Binder, Sunny Blair, and Baby Face Turner.\nTurner was contracted to the Bihari brothers, but he continued to work for Phillips, where he was effectively the in-house producer. This sometimes created conflicts of interest. In 1951, Turner recorded two Howlin' Wolf tracks for Phillips, playing piano on \"How Many More Years\" and \"Moanin' at Midnight\", which Phillips sent to Chess. Turner and Howlin' Wolf then recorded a version of \"Moanin' at Midnight\" at radio station KWEM in West Memphis without Phillips' or the Chess brothers' knowledge. He sent the results to the Biharis at Modern and they released it on their subsidiary label RPM Records. Turner also attempted to poach Elmore James from Trumpet Records and record him for Modern. Trumpet found out and Modern had to cancel the record. However, James did eventually sign with Modern, and Turner played on his recordings that were released on Modern's subsidiary label Flair Records.\nWhile in Helena, Turner tried to recruit Little Walter to record for Modern in January 1952, but Little Walter was on his way to Mississippi. In 1952, Turner discovered Little Junior Parker in West Memphis, and they formed a band with Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy. Turner recorded Parker's first single, \"You're My Angel\" / \"Bad Women, Bad Whiskey\", credited to Little Junior Parker and the Blue Flames. That summer Turner recorded with the new vocalist and pianist in his band, Marion Louis Lee, resulting in \"My Heart Belongs to You\" / \"Looking for My Baby\". The records were released on RPM as Bonnie and Ike Turner and they performed together at the Hippodrome in Memphis. Turner married Lee in September 1952.\nUnbeknownst to Turner, during his time in West Memphis, he met Elvis Presley, who was a truck driver. He recalled, \"[Presley] was just a white boy that would come over to black clubs. He would come in and stand behind the piano and watch me play. I never knew he was no musician.\" Turner discovered his identity many years later after Presley approached him when they were both playing at the International Hotel.\nTo accommodate his then-wife Bonnie, who also played piano, Turner taught himself how to play guitar by ear, and Willie Kizart taught him blues guitar techniques. He began playing guitar in sessions in 1953, and by 1954, with the assistance of Joe Bihari, he built a makeshift recording studio at a defunct Greyhound bus station in Clarksdale. Turner used his Kings of Rhythm as session musicians. They played on many recordings for Bihari's Modern, RPM, and Flair labels. Some of the artists Turner backed on piano and guitar during this period include Elmore James, Johnny Ace and the Flairs. Around this time Turner discovered Billy \"The Kid\" Emerson in Greenville. He brought Emerson to record at Sun Records and backed him on guitar in 1954.\n1954\u20131959: St. Louis.\nIn 1954, Turner visited his sister Lee Ethel Knight in St. Louis, Missouri. During his stay, he went clubbing at Ned Love's in East St. Louis, Illinois. Love invited Turner and his band to play at his club. Eventually, Turner returned with his reformed version of the Kings of Rhythm. The band consisted of Willie Kizart on guitar, Willie \"Bad Boy\" Sims on drums, vocalist Johnny O'Neal, Turner's nephew Jesse Knight Jr. on bass, and Turner's wife Annie Mae Wilson on piano and vocals.\nTurner maintained strict discipline and the band lived at his home on Virginia Place in East St. Louis which doubled as a studio. A teetotaler at the time, he avoided drugs and insisted all band members also adopt this policy, firing anyone he even suspected of breaking the rules. Turner established his group as one of the most highly rated on the St. Louis club circuit, vying for popularity with their main competition, Sir John's Trio featuring Chuck Berry. The bands would play all-nighters in St. Louis, then cross the river to the clubs of East St. Louis, and continue playing until dawn. Initially, they played for predominately black audiences at clubs in Illinois such as the Club Manhattan in East St. Louis, which Turner and his band built, the Club Riviera in St. Louis, the Harlem Club in Brookline and the Kingsbury in Madison. In St. Louis, Turner was exposed to a white audience who were excited by R&amp;B. He played at the Moonlight Bar, Latin Quarter, and the Club Imperial, which was popular with white teenagers. He also gained a big following at Club DeLisa and locally he was acknowledged as the \"King of Rock and Roll.\" As his popularity grew among both whites and blacks, he demanded that the clubs should be integrated. He performed regularly on Dave Dixon's radio show, which aired live from the Birdcage Lounge, on KSTL. He also had live music broadcasts on the St. Louis radio station KATZ.\nIn between live dates, Turner took the band to Cincinnati to record for Federal Records in 1956. The single, \"I'm Tore Up\" / \"If I Never Had Known You\" featuring Billy Gayles, was released in April 1956. It became a regional hit and Turner's booking fee doubled after its release. Like Brenston years prior, Gayles left Turner's band to pursue a solo career. In 1958, Turner took the band to Chicago to record for Cobra/Artistic, as well as fulfilling his contract as a session musician back at Sun. While in Chicago, Turner backed Otis Rush, playing the signature vibrato guitar parts on \"Double Trouble\". He also helped Buddy Guy record his second record, resulting in the single \"You Sure Can't Do\" / \"This Is The End\", on which Turner played guitar and composed the latter.\nTurner befriended St. Louis R&amp;B fan Bill Stevens, who set up the short-lived Stevens Records in 1959. Turner released two singles on the Stevens label, \"Jack Rabbit\" / \"In Your Eyes Baby\" and \"Ho\u2013Ho\" / \"Hey\u2013Hey.\" He used the anagram \"Icky Renrut\" because he was still under contract with Sun for several more months, and he didn't want to cause friction with Phillips. In addition, Turner recorded numerous sessions for Stevens with various vocalists and musician lineups of the Kings of Rhythm.\n1960\u20131976: The Ike and Tina Turner Revue.\nIn 1956, Ann Bullock accompanied her sister Alline Bullock to watch Turner and the Kings of Rhythm at the Club Manhattan in East St. Louis. Alline was a barmaid at the club and was dating Turner's drummer Eugene Washington. Through her sister and Washington, Ann Bullock asked Turner to sing with his band. Turner said he'd call her onstage, but he never did. One night during an intermission, she got hold of the microphone from Washington and sang \"You Know I Love You\" by B.B. King. Impressed by her voice, Turner invited her to sing with the band. She made her recording debut on Turner's song \"Boxtop\", released on Tune Town Records in 1958.\nIn March 1960, Turner allowed her to record a demo of his self-penned song \"A Fool in Love\". He intended to use the demo as guide track for Art Lassiter, who did not attend the scheduled recording session at Technisonic Studios. A local DJ suggested he send the record to Sue Records in New York, where label owner Juggy Murray insisted on releasing the track with Bullock's vocal. Murray offered a $20,000 advance for the song and suggested Turner \"make her the star\" of his show. Turner then renamed her \"Tina\" because it rhymed with Sheena; however, family and friends still called her Ann. He was inspired by Sheena, Queen of the Jungle and Nyoka the Jungle Girl to create her stage persona. He had the name \"Tina Turner\" trademarked, so that in case she left, another singer could perform under the same name.\nThe single \"A Fool In Love\" was released in July 1960, and it became a national hit, selling a million copies. It peaked at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart and No. 27 on the Hot 100. Turner added a backing girl group he renamed the Ikettes, and along with the Kings of Rhythm they began performing as the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue. The success of the single was followed by a string of hits including \"I Idolize You\", \"Poor Fool\", and \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" which gave them their second million-seller and their first Grammy nomination.\nIn 1961, Turner played piano on Albert King's first hit record, \"Don't Throw Your Love on Me So Strong\". The single, released on King Records, peaked at No. 14 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart. He also wrote and produced the Ikettes hit \"I'm Blue (The Gong-Gong Song)\".\nThe Revue performed rigorously on the Chitlin' Circuit and built a reputation as \"one of the hottest, most durable, and potentially most explosive of all R&amp;B ensembles.\" To assure he always had a record out while on tour, Turner formed multiple labels such as Sputnik, Teena, Prann, Innis, Sony and Sonja. He produced singles by the Ikettes, Jimmy Thomas, Fontella Bass, George Jackson, and other artists on his labels. The duo switched to Turner's Sonja label in 1963. For the next six years, they recorded on Warner Bros./Loma, Modern/Kent, Cenco, Philles, Tangerine, Pompeii, Blue Thumb, Minit, and A&amp;M. Between 1964 and 1965, they scored fourteen top 40 R&amp;B hits with \"You Can't Miss Nothing That You Never Had\", \"Tell Her I'm Not Home\", \"Good Bye, So Long\", and \"Two Is a Couple\". Around this time, Jimi Hendrix briefly played backing guitar in the band.\nIn 1965, Phil Spector saw them perform at a club on the Sunset Strip and invited them to film \"The Big T.N.T. Show\". Impressed by their performance, Spector negotiated a deal with their manager Bob Krasnow, head of Loma Records, offering $20,000 to produce Tina and have them released from their Loma contract. After Tina and Spector recorded \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\", the duo signed to Spector's Philles label in 1966. The failure of the single in America triggered Spector's retreat from the music industry. However, it was a hit in Europe, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 1 on Los 40 Principales in Spain. Following the song's success in the UK, they were invited to open for the Rolling Stones on their 1966 British Tour. This exposure introduced them to a wider audience outside of R&amp;B. Soon they were booking bigger venues, and by 1969 they were headlining in Las Vegas. \nIn April 1969, Turner and the Kings of Rhythm released an album, \"A Black Man's Soul\", on Pompeii Records. The album earned Turner his first solo Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance at the 12th Annual Grammy Awards. Later that year, the duo released the blues-oriented albums \"Outta Season\" and \"The Hunter\" on Blue Thumb Records. Turner and Bob Krasnow, founder of Blue Thumb, co-produced Earl Hooker's 1969 album \"Sweet Black Angel\". In November, the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue opened for the Rolling Stones on their 1969 American Tour.\nIn January 1970, they performed on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and released their rendition of \"Come Together\", which reached No. 21 on the R&amp;B chart. Their cover of \"I Want to Take You Higher\" by Sly and the Family Stone was also successful on the charts in 1970. Turner, who was a friend of Sly Stone, played guitar on Sly and the Family Stone's album \"There's a Riot Goin' On\" (1971). The release of \"Proud Mary\" in 1971 became Ike &amp; Tina Turner's biggest hit, reaching No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart. It sold more than a million copies, and won the duo a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Group at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards.\nTheir mainstream success provided Turner with the finances to open his own recording studio, Bolic Sound in Inglewood, in 1972. Turner had two sixteen track studios built, a large one to rent out and a smaller one for his personal recordings. He fitted them out with state-of-the-art equipment. Artists who recorded there included Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Duane Allman, Little Richard, Gayle McCormick, and Frank Zappa.\nTurner released two solo albums for United Artists Records, \"Blues Roots\" (1972) and \"Bad Dreams\" (1973). In 1973, the duo released \"Nutbush City Limits\" penned by Tina. The single peaked at No. 22 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, No. 11 on the R&amp;B chart and it was a bigger hit in Europe. The Turners received the Golden European Record Award, the first ever given, for selling more than one million records of \"Nutbush City Limits\" in Europe.\nDuring this period, Turner produced singer Judy Cheeks' debut album \"Judy Cheeks\" (1973), and the last album by the Ikettes, \"(G)Old &amp; New\" (1974). In 1974, Ike and Tina released the album \"The Gospel According to Ike &amp; Tina Turner.\" The album was nominated for Best Soul Gospel \"Performance\". Turner also earned a solo nomination for his single \"Father Alone\". Between 1974 and 1975, the duo released the singles \"Sweet Rhode Island Red\", \"Sexy Ida\", and \"Baby, Get It On\".The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue ended abruptly in 1976. That year, they headlined at the Waldorf Astoria New York and signed a television deal with CBS-TV. Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year $150,000 per year deal with Cream Records, which was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, the Turners got into a violent altercation en route to their gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Turner later claimed that Tina initiated the conflict by purposely irritating him so that she would have a reason to break up with him before they signed the new contract. Tina fled from the hotel shortly after they arrived, and filed for divorce on July 27, 1976. She would later describe a relationship in which Turner was frequently violent and abusive, sometimes beating her with wooden objects like a shoe-stretcher or hanger. The night she left, his beating left her face bruised, swollen, and bleeding.\nUnited Artists responded to the Turners' separation by releasing albums of compiled recordings from their last sessions together, \"Delilah's Power\" (1977) and \"Airwaves\" (1978). Two years after their divorce was finalized, Turner released the single \"Party Vibes\" / \"Shame, Shame, Shame\" from the album \"The Edge\" (1980) which peaked at No. 27 on the \"Billboard\" Disco Top 100 chart.\n1977\u20132007: Later career.\nAfter his breakup with Tina, singer Holly Maxwell sang with Turner on occasion from 1977 to 1985 and again for eight months in 1992. She reported a positive working relationship with Turner, and later released the memoir \"Freebase Ain't Free\" about their close friendship. In 1979, Turner spent time in the studio with Chaka Khan following her separation from her manager-husband. She told \"Jet\": \"He's been real inspiration and a catalyst emotionally and in other ways as well. We plan to record together.\" Turner struggled to find success due to his cocaine addiction and run-ins with the law. In 1988, Turner attempted an ill-fated return to the stage with Marcy Thomas, Bonnie Johnson, and Jeanette Bazzell as his Ikettes.\nWhile Turner was in prison following a drug conviction, Ike &amp; Tina Turner were inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Tina did not attend because she took the year off from making public appearances, so Phil Spector delivered a speech at the ceremony on their behalf. After his release from prison, Turner told the press that he was nervous about returning to performing live, but had plans to return to the studio. He sold 20 unreleased Ike &amp; Tina Turner masters to the independent label Esquire Records. In 1992, Turner performed as a special guest at Oliver Sain's Soul Reunion concert at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis.\nHip-hop group Salt-N-Pepa sampled Turner's composition \"I'm Blue (The Gong Gong Song)\", released by the Ikettes in 1961, for their 1993 single \"Shoop\". The song reached No. 4 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and Turner earned around half a million dollars in royalties. He re-recorded \"I'm Blue\" as a duet with singer Billy Rogers in 1995. Produced by Rogers, the remake received favorable reviews. Turner later appeared on the song \"Love Gravy\" with Rick James for the soundtrack album \"\".\nTurner reformed the Ikettes in the mid-1990s, which included his then-wife Jeanette Bazzell Turner, Nina Hill, and Michelle Love (Randi Love). Vera Clyburn, who was an Ikette in the 1970s, was the lead singer. They performed to positive reviews as the Ike Turner Revue. In August 1997, Turner returned to his hometown Clarksdale to headline the 10th Annual Sunflower River Blues &amp; Gospel Festival. Turner credited Joe Louis Walker with encouraging him to return to his roots in blues music. Turner played guitar and assisted in the production on Walker's 1997 album \"Great Guitars\"; Walker paid him $5,000 a night for six songs. Walker invited Turner to perform with him at the San Francisco Blues Festival and to tour in Europe. The positive response to the tour encouraged Turner to reform the Kings of Rhythm. They toured the US in 2001, and headlined a showcase at South by Southwest, where they were hailed as one of the highlights of the conference. Turner's work on the tour led to the recording and release of his Grammy-nominated album \"Here &amp; Now\" (2001). In 2002, Turner's performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival was released as a live album and DVD.\nIn 2002, Turner filmed Martin Scorsese's PBS documentary series \"The Blues\", which aired in September 2003. He is featured in the documentaries \"The Road to Memphis\" and , as part of the series. Turner appeared on the Gorillaz's album \"Demon Days\" (2005), playing piano on \"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\". He performed the song with Gorillaz at the Manchester Opera House in November 2005. His performance is featured in the live concert DVD \"Demon Days: Live at the Manchester Opera House\".\nIn 2006, Turner released his last album, \"Risin' With the Blues\", on the independent label Zoho Roots. The album received positive critical reception, and was nominated for best Blues Album at the 7th Annual Independent Music Awards. Turner won his first solo Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007.\nTurner began working on a collaboration album with Gorillaz's producer Danger Mouse and the Black Keys in early 2007. The Black Keys sent demos to Turner, but the project was temporarily shelved. After Turner's death, the songs were used for their 2008 album \"Attack &amp; Release\". Although Turner does not appear on the album, \"Pitchfork\" noted his influence in the production.\nArtistry and legacy.\nMusical style.\nIn his career, Turner originally worked in the style of 1950s R&amp;B, or post-jump blues. His early influences included Amos Milburn and Louis Jordan, as well as country music artists such as Hank Williams Sr. and Merle Travis. Though primarily known as a guitarist, Turner began his career playing piano and personally considered it his main instrument. In 1951, journalist Mike McGee compared him to jazz pianist Fats Waller and wrote: \"Ike Turner is the hottest piano player in many a day.\"\nTurner grew up playing boogie woogie piano, which he learned from blues pianist Pinetop Perkins. He decided he was not meant to be a frontman when at twelve he was coerced into giving an impromptu piano recital in school. He found the experience terrifying and from then on preferred not to be the focus of attention, but rather to be in the background controlling the show. He considered himself an organizer rather than a performer. Musician Donald Fagen noted: \"[T]alented as he was, there wasn't anything really supernatural about Ike's skills as a musician... What Ike excelled at was leadership: conceptualization, organization, and execution.\"\nTurner's guitar style is distinguished by heavy use of the whammy bar to achieve a strong reverb-soaked vibrato, string bending, hammer-ons and triplets in his blues phrasing. Turner was an early adopter of the Fender Stratocaster electric guitar, buying one from O.K. Houk's Piano Co. store in Memphis the year of its release in 1954. Unaware that the guitar's tremolo arm could be used to subtle effect, Turner used it to play screaming, swooping and diving solos that predated artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck by a decade. In \"The Stratocaster Chronicles\", Tom Wheeler wrote that Turner's \"inventive style is a classic example of an artist discovering the Stratocaster, adapting to its features and fashioning something remarkable.\" Turner himself said of his tremolo technique: \"I thought it was to make the guitar scream\u2014people got so excited when I used that thing.\" Dave Rubin wrote in \"Premier Guitar\" magazine: \"All those years of playing piano and arranging taught him a considerable amount about harmony, as he could certainly navigate I-IV-V chord changes. Ike modestly terms what he does on the guitar as 'tricks', but make no mistake, he attacked his axe with the conviction of a man who knew precisely what he wanted to hear come out of it.\"\nReviewing Turner's 1973 album \"Bad Dreams\", Robert Christgau wrote: \"After twenty years of raking it in from the shadows, he's finally figured out a way of applying his basically comic bass/baritone to rock and roll. Studio-psychedelic New Orleans, echoes of the Band and Dr. John, some brilliant minor r&amp;b mixed in with the dumb stuff. My God\u2014at the moment he's more interesting than Tina.\"\nInfluence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"It ain't Little Richard, it ain't Chuck, it ain't Fats Domino \u2014 no, we came on later. This man was playing the blues, rhythm and blues. Rock 'n' roll came from rhythm and blues: rock 'n' roll ain't nothing but rhythm and blues up-tempo. Ike Turner was the innovator, for rhythm and blues and for rock 'n' roll. We just came and took it home.\"\n \u2014 \"Little Richard\" (1999)\nTurner was praised by his contemporaries for his influence. Johnny Otis said, \"Ike Turner is a very important man in American music. The texture and flavor of R&amp;B owe a lot to him. He defined how to put the Fender bass into that music. He was a great innovator.\" B.B. King was a great admirer of Turner, describing him as \"The best bandleader I've ever seen.\" King also said, \"When they talk about rock 'n roll, I see Ike as one of the founding fathers.\" Turner was a big influence on Little Richard, who wrote the introduction to Turner's autobiography. Little Richard was inspired to play the piano after he heard Turner's piano intro on \"Rocket 88\", and later used it note for note on \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\". Prince also said Turner was his first musical influence.\nPhil Alexander, editor-in-chief of \"Mojo\" magazine, referred to Turner as the \"cornerstone of modern day rock 'n' roll\" and credited his arrangements of blues standards as being an influence on 1960s British Invasion groups: \"He proceeded to influence British rockers from the mid-1960s onwards. Without Ike you wouldn't have had the Stones and Zeppelin. People like that wouldn't have had the source material on which they drew.\"\nSpeaking on \"Rocket 88\" being a contender for the first rock 'n' roll record, broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said:In musical terms [he was] very important. \"Rocket 88\" is one of the two records that can claim to be the first rock 'n' roll record, the other being \"The Fat Man\" by Fats Domino from 1949. But \"Rocket 88\" does have a couple of elements which \"The Fat Man\" did not. The wailing saxophone and that distorted electric guitar. It was number one in the rhythm and blues chart for five weeks, it is in the Grammy Hall of Fame and it was an indisputable claim to fame for Ike Turner...To critics he will be known as a great founder, unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man.Nigel Cawthorne\u2014co-author of Turner's autobiography\u2014said:Although there had been black rock 'n' rollers who had made it big already, they really only played to a white audience. Ike and Tina played to a mixed audience and he deliberately desegregated audiences in the southern states and he wouldn't play to any segregated audiences at all. Because he had such a big band and entourage he desegregated a lot of the hotels because the hotel chains wouldn't want to miss out on the money they would make from him touring the southern states.Turner's songs have been sampled by hip hop artists; most notably, Salt-N-Pepa used \"I'm Blue\" for their 1994 hit \"Shoop\". Jurassic 5 used \"Getting Nasty\" from \"A Black Man's Soul\" on the track \"Concrete Schoolyard\" in 1997. Main Source also sampled \"Getting Nasty\" on the track \"Snake Eyes\" as well as Ike &amp; Tina Turner's \"Bold Soul Sister\" on \"Just Hanging Out\"; both featured on their 1991 album \"Breaking Atoms\". The track \"Funky Mule\", also from \"A Black Man's Soul\", has been sampled extensively by jungle DJs, with the drum introduction being a very popular break. It was sampled by producer Goldie for his 1994 hit \"Inner City Life\", in the same year by Krome &amp; Time on \"The License\", and by Paradox in 2002 on track \"Funky Mule\".\nIn 2009, a Nashville-based band, Mr. Groove Band, recorded a tribute album titled \"Rocket 88: Tribute to Ike Turner\". Vocalists on the album include Turner's last wife Audrey Madison Turner and former Ikette Bonnie Bramlett.\nAccolades.\nTurner won two competitive Grammy Awards. Ike &amp; Tina Turner won Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Group for \"Proud Mary\" in 1972. In 2007, Turner won Best Traditional Blues Album for \"Risin' with the Blues\". Turner also has three songs inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame: \"Rocket 88\", \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\", and \"Proud Mary\".\nIke &amp; Tina Turner were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Turner is inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. He is also inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame. He was honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame in 2001.\nTurner won Comeback Album of The Year for \"Here and Now\" at the W.C. Handy Blues Awards in 2002. In 2004, he was awarded the Heroes Award from the Memphis branch of the Recording Academy. He was a recipient of the Legend Award at the 2007 Mojo Awards.\nIn 2003, the album \"\" was ranked No. 212 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time (No. 214 on 2012 revised list).\nIn 2004, Fender Custom Shop manufactured a limited edition Ike Turner Tribute Stratocaster. The model has an alder body in Sonic Blue with an Ike Turner signature in gold ink on the body under the clear-coat, with a maple neck in a 1960s \"C\" shape with a rosewood fingerboard, with 21 vintage frets. It had three custom single coil 1960s Strat pickups. Only 100 specimens were made, retailing at $3,399.99.\nIn August 2010, Turner was posthumously celebrated in his hometown of Clarksdale, Mississippi. On August 6, Clarksdale officials and music fans gathered to unveil a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail and a plaque on the Clarksdale Walk of Fame in downtown Clarksdale honoring Turner and his musical legacy. The unveilings coincided with Clarksdale's 23rd Annual Sunflower River Blues &amp; Gospel Festival, which paid tribute to Turner.\nAlthough Turner considered himself a pianist rather than a guitarist, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine editor David Fricke ranked him No. 61 on his list of 100 Greatest Guitarists in 2010.\nIn 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Ike &amp; Tina Turner No. 2 on their list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.\nIn 2017, the Mississippi Blues Trail honored \"Rocket 88\" for being an influential record with a marker in Lyon, Mississippi. In 2018, \"Rocket 88\" was chosen for the inaugural class of influential songs inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles.\nPortrayal in popular culture.\nIn 1986, Tina Turner released her autobiography, \"I, Tina\", in which she recounted Turner's volatile behavior. He received negative publicity that was exacerbated in 1993 by the release of the film adaptation \"What's Love Got to Do with It\". Turner received $45,000 for the film, but he had unknowingly signed papers waiving the right to sue Disney's Touchstone Pictures for his depiction. He was portrayed by Laurence Fishburne, whose performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor at the 66th Academy Awards.\nAfter the release of the film, the fictionalized version of Turner from the movie was seized on by comedians, who reused the persona in sketches. On the 1990s sketch comedy show \"In Living Color\", Turner was parodied by David Alan Grier. He was portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live\"'s Weekend Update by Tim Meadows in a pageboy wig. On the \"John Boy and Billy\" radio show, cast member Jeff Pillars regularly performed an impersonation of Turner in a segment called \"Ax/Ask Ike\". These sketches were collected in a 2008 comedy album \"Ike at the Mike\". In 2006, \"Vibe\" magazine ranked the character of Ike Turner from \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" at No. 4 in their list of the 20 best movie \"bad guys\".\nCommenting on the historical accuracy of the film, Tina told Larry King in 1997: \"I would have liked them to have more truth, but according to Disney [owner of the film's production company], they said it's impossible, the people would not have believed the truth.\" In 2018, Tina told Oprah Winfrey that she only recently watched the film, but she could not finish it because she \"didn't realize they would change the details so much.\" Phil Spector criticized Tina's book and called the film a \"piece of trash\" during his eulogy at Turner's funeral.\nIn 2015, TV One's \"Unsung\" offered some redemption with \"The Story of Ike Turner\", which documented his career along with his trials and tribulations. In the musical \"Tina: The Tina Turner Musical\", Turner was portrayed by British actor Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, who won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his role in 2019.\nBooks.\nIn 1999, Turner published his autobiography \"Takin' Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner\". It was written with Nigel Cawthorne and Little Richard wrote the introduction. In 2003, John Collis published \"Ike Turner: King of Rhythm\" about the life and musical contributions of Turner.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages.\nTurner was married fourteen times. He often married another woman before divorcing his existing wife. Speaking on his early marriages, he said: \"You gave a preacher two dollars, the (marriage) papers cost three dollars, that was it. In those days, African Americans did not bother with divorces.\"\nEarly marriages.\nTurner was first married at 16 years old to Edna Dean Stewart of Ruleville, Mississippi. They were married on April 10, 1948. Records show that Turner added four years to his age. Edna didn't want to stay in Clarksdale, so she left Turner and returned to Ruleville.\nTurner's second wife, Velma Davis (n\u00e9e Dishman), is the elder sister of former Ikette Joshie Armstead. Turner met her at the Cotton Club on Camplin Avenue in Yazoo City, Mississippi in 1948. Davis claimed that Turner was the father of her daughter Linda Turner Bullock, born in 1949. However, Turner asserted in his book that he was not the biological father. The couple married on September 19, 1950. Davis and Bullock attended Turner's Mississippi Blues Trail marker unveiling in 2010.\nTurner then married Rosa Lee Sane in West Memphis, Arkansas. She had a mental breakdown, so her family put her in an insane asylum in Tennessee. Turner tried to get her out, but he never saw her again.\nTurner married Marion Louis Lee (Bonnie Turner) in Clarksdale on September 24, 1952. Lee was a member of the Kings of Rhythm as a pianist and vocalist. In 1952, under the alias Mary Sue, she released the single \"Everybody's Talking\" / \"Love Is a Gamble\" on Modern Records. She co-wrote both tunes with Turner. The couple also recorded for RPM Records and Sun Records. Turner recalled, \"Bonnie played piano. It was a job staying ahead of this chick, man, cos' she was always trying to outdo me.\" While they were in Sarasota, Florida for a gig, she ran off to New York with another man in 1953. Their divorce was finalized in 1955.\nAfter Lee, Turner married a woman named Alice in Helena, Arkansas. According to Turner, they did not consummate their marriage. Alice was dating his vocalist Johnny O'Neal, but Turner liked her, so he married her to avoid \"locking heads\" with O'Neal. \"If I married her, he couldn't do nothing\", he said.\nAfter Alice, Turner married Annie Mae Wilson from Greenville, Mississippi. She played piano and was the secretary for his band. Wilson left Turner for a policeman in East St. Louis, Illinois. In 1958, Turner presented a petition to the East St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners, stating that police officer Curtis Smith had harassed him and hit him in the head, causing his eardrum to burst, out of spite because of his relationship with Wilson.\nIn East St. Louis, Turner lived with Lorraine Taylor. Her parents owned the Taylor Sausage Factory in St. Louis. Sources often incorrectly refer to Taylor as one of Turner's wives, but she was his live-in girlfriend. Lorraine already had two children of her own before she had two sons, Ike Jr. and Michael, with Turner.\nTina Turner.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I still love Tina as much as I ever loved her...I wrote her a letter five years ago. I never sent it...I was telling her in this letter that I'm sorry for putting her and the kids through that kind of stuff. I was stupid. I was inconsiderate about her feelings. I understand today. She came from an abusive relationship and went straight to the top.\"\n\u2014 \"Ike Turner\" (2007)\nIn 1956, Turner met Ann Bullock (whom he later renamed Tina Turner) at the Club Manhattan in East St. Louis. They became close friends and she began dating his saxophonist Raymond Hill. When Bullock became pregnant by Hill, they lived with Turner and his live-in girlfriend Lorraine Taylor. Hill injured his ankle and left Bullock before their son Craig was born in August 1958. During Bullock's pregnancy, Taylor became suspicious that Bullock was pregnant by Turner and threatened her with a gun before shooting herself; her injuries were nonfatal. However, Turner and Bullock eventually began having an affair and she became pregnant in January 1960.\nFollowing the birth of their son Ronnie in October 1960, they were married in Tijuana in 1962. Turner stated that the reason they went to Tijuana was to see \"sex shows and whores\". At the time, he was still legally married to Alice Bell. He used a detective agency to locate Bell in Chicago and they divorced in 1974. On multiple occasions, Turner said that he was never officially married to Tina. He also revealed on \"The Howard Stern Show\" in 1993 and on \"Fresh Air\" in 1996 that Tina's birth name was Martha Nell (not Anna Mae) Bullock. Tina signed her legal name as Martha Nell Turner on multiple contracts.\nFollowing a violent altercation in July 1976, Tina filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. Although Turner reiterated that they were never officially married, they had a common-law marriage and still had to go through a formal divorce. Their divorce was finalized on March 29, 1978. In the final divorce decree, Tina took responsibility for missed concert dates as well as an IRS lien. Tina retained songwriter royalties from songs she had written, but Ike got the publishing royalties for his compositions and hers. She also kept her two Jaguar cars, furs and jewelry along with her stage name. Tina gave up her share of their Bolic Sound recording studio, publishing companies, and real estate.\nIn her 1986 autobiography, Tina revealed that Turner had been abusive during their marriage. She said: \"It was my relationship with Ike that made me most unhappy. At first, I had really been in love with him. Look what he'd done for me. But he was totally unpredictable.\" Turner admitted he took Tina for granted and called her \"the best woman I ever knew\". In his autobiography, he said: \"Sure, I've slapped Tina. We had fights and there have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her.\" In a 1999 interview, Roseanne Barr urged him to publicly apologize to Tina on \"The Roseanne Barr Show\". In 2007, Turner told \"Jet\" that he had written Tina an apology letter, but had never sent it. In 2018, Tina told \"The Sunday Times\" that \"as an old person, I have forgiven him, but I would not work with him. He asked for one more tour with me, and I said, 'No, absolutely not.' Ike wasn't someone you could forgive and allow him back in.\"\nLater marriages.\nTurner married Margaret Ann Thomas in Las Vegas on April 11, 1981; they divorced in 1990. They had met in the mid-1960s at a concert in Bakersfield, California. According to Turner, Tina suggested Ann fill in as an Ikette; she could not sing, but she was attractive. Eventually, she moved into their View Park home. Turner stated, \"I loved Tina, but I was in love with Ann Thomas.\" Their daughter Mia was born in January 1969. They rekindled their friendship years after their divorce, and she found Turner unconscious at his home the day he died.\nTurner was introduced to St. Louis native singer Jeanette Bazzell by his son Ike Turner Jr. in 1988. She became his lead vocalist and they married in a private ceremony at Circus Circus Hotel &amp; Resort in Las Vegas on July 4, 1995. They divorced in 2000, but later rekindled their friendship. According to Jeanette, Turner called her his \"backbone\". In 2019, she told \"Palm Spring Life\" that the film \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" \"assassinated Ike's career. But more than that, it broke his heart\". She added, \"Ike doesn't get any recognition because of all the negative things [shown] in that movie and in his relationship with Tina... I went through things with Ike, too, but there's a time to forgive and to let go. To strip him from having the opportunity to get recognition in an area where he was entitled to deserve it, it's so wrong to me.\"\nTurner met San Francisco native singer Audrey Madison through a mutual friend in 1993. She started as an Ikette before becoming his lead singer. They married at A Special Memory Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on October 8, 2006. Turner filed for divorce two months later on December 22, but after the divorce was granted, they reconciled in 2007. In 2011, Audrey appeared as a contestant on \"The X Factor\". In 2016, she released her memoir \"Love Had Everything to Do with It\", which details her volatile relationship with Turner due to his bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. She told \"The Afro\": \"I decided to write it because it was like a cleansing and it released all of the trauma. Also, I wanted the general public to have a better outlook and perspective on where Ike was mentally and emotionally, because so often, as a nation, we turn on people who have mental health issues and define them by their behaviors rather than their condition.\"\nChildren.\nTurner had six children. He had two sons, Ike Turner III (1958\u20132025) and Michael Turner (b. 1960), with Lorraine Taylor. He had a son, Ronald \"Ronnie\" Turner (1960\u20132022), with Tina Turner. Tina's son Craig Turner (1958\u20132018) with Raymond Hill was adopted by Turner and carried his surname. Craig died in an apparent suicide.\nTurner had a daughter, Mia, with Ann Thomas. \nTurner's second wife, Velma Davis (n\u00e9e Dishman), claimed that Turner was the father of her daughter, Linda Turner Bullock (b. 1949). Turner denied her assertion in his autobiography, in which Velma is mistakenly referred to as Thelma: \"I met Thelma Dishman, who, at that time, I thought was a pretty girl. Thelma was pregnant, not by me, but I liked her.\"\nIn 1988, Turner discovered that he had a daughter named Twanna Melby (b. 1959). Her mother, Pat Richard, had attended Sumner High School with Tina in St. Louis. In 1991, after Turner had completed 18 months of a prison sentence for cocaine intoxication and driving under the influence of cocaine, he was paroled into Twanna Melby's custody.\nIke Turner Jr. released an album, \"Hard Labor\", in 1987. He won a Grammy Award for his involvement with Turner's 2006 album \"Risin' with the Blues\". He toured with former Ikette Randi Love as Sweet Randi Love and The Love Thang Band.\nRonnie Turner was in a band called Manufactured Funk with songwriter and musician Patrick Moten. He played bass guitar in his mother's band after his parents divorced and he later played in his father's band. He married French singer Afida Turner in 2007. After his father's death, he told \"Jet\" magazine: \"I loved my father very much... You can talk 5 or 10 minutes about the bad he's done. You can talk all night about the achievements he's had. He was successful with my mom and after my mom. He won a Grammy before he died. That's a lifetime achievement.\" Ronnie died from complications of colon cancer in 2022.\nIn 2017, Ike Jr. stated that Michael Turner, who struggled with addiction as an adult, was by then using a wheelchair and had a history of \"strokes and seizures.\" In 2018, Ike Jr. revealed that Michael was now \"in a convalescent home in Southern California and needs medical support.\"\nIke Turner Jr. died from kidney failure in 2025.\nLegal problems and drug addiction.\nIn 1960, Turner and two others were charged for \"interstate transportation of forged checks and conspiracy.\" Turner plead not guilty and was forced to stand trial in St. Louis. The jury failed to reach a verdict at the first trial, but he was found not guilty at the retrial in 1961.\nIn 1974, Turner and three others were arrested for using illegal blue boxes at Bolic Sound studio to make long-distance phone calls. He was cleared of the charges.\nBefore the age of thirty, Turner did not use drugs or drink alcohol. He would fire anyone in his band who used any substances. Turner was first introduced to cocaine by \"two very famous people\" he had been working with at the International Hotel in Las Vegas. Producer D'Angela Proctor alleged in Turner's \"Unsung\" documentary that the two famous people were Elvis Presley and Redd Foxx. He took the cocaine home and tried it one night while writing songs at the piano. Turner said he liked the reduced need for sleep the drug gave him, which allowed him to write more music. By the early 1970s, he was heavily addicted to the drug, buying it in large quantities and sharing it with friends. Turner later estimated that he had spent $11\u00a0million on cocaine. His addiction caused a hole through his nasal septum, the pain of which he relieved by using more cocaine. He eventually began freebasing crack cocaine.\nBy the 1980s, Turner's finances were in disarray and he owed the state of California $12,802 in back taxes. He later settled his account. He had tried to sell his studio Bolic Sound to raise funds to avoid foreclosure, but the studio burned down on the day a potential buyer was scheduled to view it in January 1981.\nDuring the 1980s, Turner was arrested multiple times for drug and firearm offenses, which resulted in two convictions.\nTurner managed to break his dependency on cocaine while in prison and remained clean for more than ten years. He visited high schools during Black History Month to speak against drug use. While trying to help an acquaintance from crack addiction at a crack house he relapsed in 2004.\nHealth problems.\nIn 2005, Turner revealed he had been diagnosed with emphysema, which required him to use an oxygen tank. His daughter Mia Turner said, \"He was too weak from the emphysema to do anything. He'd go in the studio for a couple of minutes and play a couple of bars and say he had to go lay down.\" Despite his ill health, he collaborated with Gorillaz on their album \"Demon Days\" and performed the track with them at the Manchester Opera House in November 2005.\nAfter his death in 2007, Turner's autopsy and toxicology report showed he was taking Seroquel at the time of his death. The medicine is most commonly used as treatment for bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. His ex-wife Audrey Madison claimed Turner was bipolar and that she was helping him with his illness, a claim supported by Turner's personal assistant and caretaker, Falina Rasool. Rasool said she talked to Turner about his bipolar disorder and witnessed its effects. \"I would come in the room and see him change like a lightbulb, switch on and switch off. I did ask him about it. He said he made a song about it and we started laughing\", said Rasool, referring to \"Bi Polar\" from the Grammy-winning album \"Risin' with the Blues\". \"I know I'm bipolar...And I've been bipolar, but a lot of people is bipolar\", he told her. However, Turner's daughter, Mia Turner, disagreed with this diagnosis and felt he was being overmedicated.\nReligious affiliation.\nTurner was raised a Baptist and reportedly converted to Judaism in 1994, but never spoke about it.\nDeath.\nIn the weeks leading up to his death, Turner became reclusive. On December 10, 2007, he told his assistant, Falina Rasool, that he believed he was dying and would not make it to Christmas. He died two days later, on December 12, at the age of 76, at his home in San Marcos, California. He was found by his former wife, Ann Thomas. Rasool was also in the house and administered CPR. Turner was pronounced dead at 11:38\u00a0a.m.\nHis funeral was held on December 21, 2007, at the City of Refuge Church in Gardena, California. Among those who spoke at the funeral were Little Richard, Solomon Burke and Phil Spector. The Kings of Rhythm played \"Rocket 88\" and \"Proud Mary\". Turner was cremated after the funeral service.\nOn January 16, 2008, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office reported that Turner had died from a cocaine overdose. \"The cause of death for Ike Turner is cocaine toxicity with other significant conditions, such as hypertensive cardiovascular disease and pulmonary emphysema\", Supervising Medical Examiner Investigator Paul Parker told CNN. His daughter Mia was said to be surprised at the coroner's assessment, believing his advanced stage emphysema was a larger factor.\nTurner died without a valid will. Less than a week after his death, his former wife Audrey Madison Turner filed a petition stating that he had penned a handwritten will naming her as a beneficiary. In 2009, a judge ruled that the handwritten will was invalid and that Turner's children were legally the direct heirs to his estate.\nAwards and nominations.\nTurner has received various awards in recognition for his significant role as a pioneer of rock and roll.\nBlues Foundation Awards.\nBlues Music Awards&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nBlues Hall of Fame&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nGrammy Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nGrammy Hall of Fame&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nIndependent Music Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nSelected discography.\nRecordings as a sideman.\nHowlin' Wolf\nAlbert King\nEarl Hooker\nGorillaz\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "50505", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50505", "title": "Mule", "text": "Domestic hybrid of horse and donkey\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe mule is a domestic equine hybrid between a donkey and a horse. It is the offspring of a male donkey (a jack) and a female horse (a mare). The horse and the donkey are different species, with different numbers of chromosomes; of the two possible first-generation hybrids between them, the mule is easier to obtain and more common than the hinny, which is the offspring of a male horse (a stallion) and a female donkey (a jenny).\nMules vary widely in size, and may be of any color seen in horses or donkeys. They are more patient, hardier and longer-lived than horses, and are perceived as less obstinate and more intelligent than donkeys.\nTerminology.\nA female mule is called a \"molly\", a \"Molly mule\", or more formally \"mare mule\". A male mule is called a \"john\", \"John mule\", or more formally \"horse mule\". A young male mule is called a \"mule colt\", and a young female is called a \"mule filly\". The donkey used to produce mules is called a \"mule jack\", and a group of mules is often called a \"pack\", though the words \"barren\" and \"span\" also apply.\nHistory.\nBreeding of mules became possible only when the range of the domestic horse, which originated in Central Asia in about , extended into that of the domestic ass, which originated in north-eastern Africa. This overlap probably occurred in Anatolia and Mesopotamia in Western Asia, and mules were bred there before .37\nThe Hittites, a people of Asia Minor known for their horse-riding skills, held mules in higher esteem than their best horses. The price of a mule was three times that of a good horse for the Hittites. Similarly, mules were seven times as valuable as donkeys to the Sumerians.\nA painting in the Tomb of Nebamun at Thebes, dating from approximately , shows a chariot drawn by a pair of animals which have been variously identified as onagers, mules37 or hinnies.96 Mules were present in Israel and Judah in the time of King David.37 There are many representations of them in Mesopotamian works of art dating from the first millennium BC. Among the bas-reliefs depicting the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal from the North Palace of Nineveh is a clear and detailed image of two mules loaded with nets for hunting.96\nHomer noted their arrival in Asia Minor in the \"Iliad\" in 800 BC.\nMules contributed to the development of the Americas when Christopher Columbus, introduced donkeys and horses to the continent during his expeditions in 1495. Bringing four male and two female donkeys in addition to horses allowed for the production of mules, which assisted the Spanish in their conquest of the continent. The defeat of the Aztecs, for example, opened up Mexico as a mule breeding ground, and the presence of mules in military operations and watch duties soon became commonplace.\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, George Washington bred mules at his Virginia estate of Mount Vernon. Often called the \"father of the American mule,\" George Washington sent his donkeys to a multitude of American farms to breed with horses and create mules. Washington found that mules work harder and longer than horses at the same tasks. They also need less food and water than horses. In 1785, he had 132 horses at Mount Vernon. In 1799, there were 27 horses, 20 donkeys, and 63 mules. Before then, mules were not common in the United States, but Washington understood their value, as they were \"more docile than donkeys and cheaper to maintain.\" \nBy the nineteenth century, mules had become favored draught animals on farms and for pulling boats. Their numbers in the US reached 885,000, though they remained more popular in the south than the north. Most notably, the Twenty Mule Teams pulled, often in teams of 20 or more animals, wagonloads of borax out of Death Valley, California from 1883 to 1889. They pulled wagons carrying 10 short tons (9 metric tons) of borax ore during trips to the Borate mines before being replaced by railroads.\nMules were used by armies to transport supplies, occasionally as mobile firing platforms for smaller cannons, and to pull heavier field guns with wheels over mountainous trails such as in Afghanistan during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, widespread use of mules declined in industrialised countries. The use of mules for farming and for transportation of agricultural products largely gave way to diesel-powered tractors and transportation.\nThe first cloned equine was a mule foal, Idaho Gem, who was cloned by nuclear transfer of cells from foetal material, and was born at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho, United States on May 5, 2003. Neither an equid nor a hybrid animal had been cloned before that time.\nAs of 2018, Mexico had the largest population of mules in the world at 3,287,449.\nCharacteristics.\nIn general terms, in both mules and hinnies, the foreparts and head of the animal are similar to those of the sire (father), while the hindparts and tail tend to resemble those of the dam (mother).36 Mules are generally larger than hinnies, with longer ears and a heavier head like donkeys, while their tails are usually covered with long hair like that of horses.37 Mules have thin limbs, small narrow hooves, and short manes like donkeys, while their height, shape of neck and body, and uniformity of their coat and teeth are more similar to what is seen in horses.\nMules vary widely in size, from small miniature mules under to large and powerful draught mules standing up to at the withers.86 The median weight range is between about . \nMules' coats may be of any color seen in the horse or donkey. Mules usually display the light points commonly seen in donkeys: pale or mealy areas on the belly and the insides of the thighs, on the muzzle, and around the eyes. They often have primitive markings such as dorsal stripes, shoulder stripes, or zebra stripes on the legs.37\nMules exhibit hybrid vigor. Charles Darwin wrote: \"The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature.\"\nMules inherit from donkeys the traits of intelligence, sure-footedness, toughness, endurance, disposition, and natural cautiousness; from horses, they inherit speed, conformation, and agility. They grow faster and live longer, giving them a larger interval of productivity compared to horses or donkeys. They rarely become ill, unlike horses, who often need to be checked for worms, and like their donkey fathers, mules can see their hind legs and have hooves better suited to dry climates. Additionally, the skin of mules is tougher than that of horses or donkeys, and they tend to live longer on fewer resources than do horses. Mules are reputed to exhibit a higher cognitive intelligence than both of their parent species, but robust scientific evidence to back up these claims is lacking. Preliminary data exists from at least two evidence-based studies, but it relies on a limited set of specialized cognitive tests and a small number of subjects.\nSimilar to other equine animals, mules can sleep while standing (mostly to protect themselves against danger). To prevent predation, a group of mules may select members of the pack to \"stand watch\" while sleeping upright as the others sleep on the ground.\nFertility.\nThe speciation of horses and donkeys from their common ancestor happened sometime between 7.7 and 15.4 million years ago. Today, they are phenotypically and genetically different, with a horse having 64 chromosomes and a donkey having 62. A mule has 63 chromosomes, 32 from the horse and 31 from the donkey. Its odd number of chromosomes makes gamete formation difficult, often leaving mules infertile. This also disqualifies them as a species under the .\nThe conception of a mule is difficult due to the differences in behavior and mating patterns between donkeys and horses. When in close proximity, groups of horses and groups of donkeys do not interact with each other often, and donkeys remain at the bottom of the equine social hierarchy while horses rule the pasture and mules are left in a mid-tier social caste.\nMule pregnancy is rare, but can occasionally occur naturally, as well as through embryo transfer. A few mare mules have produced offspring when mated with a horse or a jack. Herodotus gives an account of such an event as an ill omen of Xerxes' invasion of Greece in 480 BC: \"There happened also a portent of another kind while he was still at Sardis\u2014a mule brought forth young and gave birth to a mule\" (Herodotus \"The Histories\" 7:57), and a mule's giving birth was a frequently recorded portent in antiquity, although scientific writers also doubted whether it was really possible (see e.g. Aristotle, \"Historia animalium\", 6.24; Varro, \"De re rustica\", 2.1.28). Between 1527 and 2002, approximately sixty such births were reported. In Morocco in early 2002 and Colorado in 2007, mare mules produced colts. Blood and hair samples from the Colorado birth verified that the mother was indeed a mule and the foal was indeed her offspring.\nA 1939 article in the \"Journal of Heredity\" describes two offspring of a fertile mare mule named \"Old Bec,\" which was owned at the time by Texas A&amp;M University in the late 1920s. One of the foals was a female, sired by a jack. Unlike her mother, she was sterile. The other, sired by a five-gaited Saddlebred stallion, exhibited no characteristics of any donkey. That horse, a stallion, was bred to several mares, which gave birth to live foals that showed no characteristics of the donkey. In 1995, a group from the Federal University of Minas Gerais described a female mule that was pregnant for a seventh time, having previously produced two donkey sires, two foals with the typical 63 chromosomes of mules, and several horse stallions that had produced four foals. The three of the latter available for testing each bore 64 horse-like chromosomes. These foals phenotypically resembled horses, though they bore markings absent from the sire's known lineages, and one had ears noticeably longer than those typical of her sire's breed. The elder two horse-like foals had proved fertile at the time of publication, with their progeny being typical of horses.\nUse.\nMules are commonly used as pack animals. While a few mules can carry live weight up to , mules can generally be packed with dead weight up to around 90 kg (198 lb). Although it depends on the individual animal, mules trained by the Army of Pakistan are reported to be able to carry up to and walk without resting. Mule trains are also used to deliver food to remote areas of the world: in Nepal, for example, the World Food Programme provides food for children in the Sudurpaschim province with the help of mule drivers.\nMules also have uses beyond heavy lifting. In the Abruzzo region of Italy, for example, mules are used to defend herds of animals against predators like wolves and feral dogs. Horse breeders in Italy used to add a female mule to their flocks, finding that the mule tended to protect the foals with even more vigor than the actual mother. They are additionally used as research specimens, especially in studies regarding the slicing, rearrangement, and compatibility of chromosomes.\nCare and management.\nA mule's diet is more similar to that of a donkey than a horse. They store water more efficiently, for example, and can consume 15 gallons of it daily, making them suitable for more desert-like climates. Their diet is also herbivorous, mainly consisting of grains, hay and greens, though they can also enjoy fruits and vegetables. Mules can have dietary preferences based on taste and texture. Additionally, protein intake can be an issue with mules, so monitoring the amount of essential amino acids in their diet can be helpful.\nA mule's hooves should be cleaned regularly to remove debris and should be shortened at least every two months to prevent overgrowth, pain, and discomfort. If necessary, mules may also wear muleshoes to protect their hooves, and generally wear a smaller horseshoe than a horse of the same size, due to their smaller and narrower hooves. A mule's coat needs to be groomed regularly.\nAn adult mule's temperature should remain within the range of 37.5\u00b0C \u2013 38.5\u00b0C, their pulse has a healthy range of 26-40 bpm, and they should take 8-16 breaths per minute.\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the preferred measurement unit to express distances between geographical places on land in most of the world; notable exceptions are the United States and the United Kingdom where the statute mile is used.\nPronunciation.\nThere are two common pronunciations for the word.\nThe first pronunciation follows a pattern in English whereby SI units are pronounced with the stress on the first syllable (as in kilogram, kilojoule and kilohertz) and the pronunciation of the actual base unit does not change irrespective of the prefix (as in centimetre, millimetre, nanometre and so on). It is generally preferred by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\nMany other users, particularly in countries where SI (the metric system) is not widely used, use the second pronunciation with stress on the second syllable. The second pronunciation follows the stress pattern used for the names of measuring instruments (such as \"micrometer\", \"barometer\", \"thermometer\", \"tachometer,\" and \"speedometer\"). The contrast is even more obvious in countries that use the American spelling of the word \"metre\". This pronunciation is irregular because it makes the kilometre the only SI unit with the stress on the second syllable.\nAfter Australia introduced the metric system in 1970, the first pronunciation was declared official by the government's Metric Conversion Board. However, the Australian prime minister at the time, Gough Whitlam, insisted that the second pronunciation was the correct one because of the Greek origins of the two parts of the word.\nHistory.\nBy a decree of 8 May 1790, the French National Constituent Assembly ordered the French Academy of Sciences to develop a new measurement system. In August 1793, the French National Convention decreed the metre as the sole length measurement system in the French Republic and it was based on millionth of the distance from the orbital poles (either North or South) to the Equator, this being a truly internationally based unit. The first name of the kilometre was \"Millaire\".\nAlthough the metre was formally defined in 1799, the myriametre (\u00a0metres) was preferred to the \"kilometre\" for everyday use. The term \"\"myriam\u00e8tre\" appeared a number of times in the text of Develey's book \"Physique d'Emile: ou, Principes de la science de la nature\", (published in 1802), while the term \"kilometre\" only appeared in an appendix. French maps published in 1835 had scales showing \"myriametres\" and \"lieues de Poste\"\" (Postal leagues of about \u00a0metres).\nThe Dutch, on the other hand, adopted the kilometre in 1817 but gave it the local name of the \"mijl\". It was only in 1867 that the term \"\"kilometer\"\" became the only official unit of measure in the Netherlands to represent \u00a0metres.\nTwo German textbooks dated 1842 and 1848 respectively give a snapshot of the use of the kilometre across Europe: the kilometre was in use in the Netherlands and in Italy, and the myriametre was in use in France.\nIn 1935, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) officially abolished the prefix \"myria-\" and with it the \"myriametre\", leaving the kilometre as the recognised unit of length for measurements of that magnitude.\nThe symbol km for the kilometre is in lower case and has been standardised by the BIPM. A slang term for the kilometre in the US, UK, and Canadian militaries is \"klick\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Melanin pigments are produced in a specialized group of cells known as melanocytes.\nThere are five basic types of melanin: eumelanin, pheomelanin, neuromelanin, allomelanin and pyomelanin. Melanin is produced through a multistage chemical process known as melanogenesis, where the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine is followed by polymerization. Pheomelanin is a cysteinated form containing polybenzothiazine portions that are largely responsible for the red or yellow tint given to some skin or hair colors. Neuromelanin is found in the brain. Research has been undertaken to investigate its efficacy in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's. Allomelanin and pyomelanin are two types of nitrogen-free melanin.\nThe phenotypic color variation observed in the epidermis and hair of mammals is primarily determined by the levels of eumelanin and pheomelanin in the examined tissue. In an average human individual, eumelanin is more abundant in tissues requiring photoprotection, such as the epidermis and the retinal pigment epithelium. In healthy subjects, epidermal melanin is correlated with UV exposure, while retinal melanin has been found to correlate with age, with levels diminishing 2.5-fold between the first and ninth decades of life, which has been attributed to oxidative degradation mediated by reactive oxygen species generated via lipofuscin-dependent pathways. In the absence of albinism or hyperpigmentation, the human epidermis contains approximately 74% eumelanin and 26% pheomelanin, largely irrespective of skin tone, with eumelanin content ranging between 71.8\u201378.9%, and pheomelanin varying between 21.1\u201328.2%. Total melanin content in the epidermis ranges from around 0 \u03bcg/mg in albino epidermal tissue to &gt;10 \u03bcg/mg in darker tissue.\nIn the human skin, melanogenesis is initiated by exposure to UV radiation, causing the skin to darken. Eumelanin is an effective absorbent of light; the pigment is able to dissipate over 99.9% of absorbed UV radiation. Because of this property, eumelanin is thought to protect skin cells from UVA and UVB radiation damage, reducing the risk of folate depletion and dermal degradation. Exposure to UV radiation is associated with increased risk of melanoma, a cancer of melanocytes (melanin cells). Studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with more concentrated melanin, i.e. darker skin tone.\nMelanin types.\nEumelanin.\nEumelanin (lit.\u2009'true melanin') has two forms linked to 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA). DHI-derived eumelanin is dark brown or black and insoluble, and DHICA -derived eumelanin which is lighter and soluble in alkali. Both eumelanins arise from the oxidation of tyrosine in specialized organelles called melanosomes. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase. The initial product, dopaquinone can transform into either 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) or 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA). DHI and DHICA are oxidized and then polymerize to form the two eumelanins. \nIn natural conditions, DHI and DHICA often co-polymerize, resulting in a range of eumelanin polymers. These polymers contribute to the variety of melanin components in human skin and hair, ranging from light yellow/red pheomelanin to light brown DHICA-enriched eumelanin and dark brown or black DHI-enriched eumelanin. These final polymers differ in solubility and color. \nAnalysis of highly pigmented (Fitzpatrick type V and VI) skin finds that DHI-eumelanin comprises the largest portion, approximately 60\u201370%, followed by DHICA-eumelanin at 25\u201335%, and pheomelanin only 2\u20138%. Notably, while an enrichment of DHI-eumelanin occurs in during sun tanning, it is accompanied by a decrease in DHICA-eumelanin and pheomelanin. A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair. A small amount of eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes blond hair. Eumelanin is present in the skin and hair, etc.\nPheomelanin.\nPheomelanins (or phaeomelanins, from Greek \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 \"phaios\", \"grey\") impart a range of yellowish to reddish colors. Pheomelanins are particularly concentrated in the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina. When a small amount of eumelanin in hair (which would otherwise cause blond hair) is mixed with pheomelanin, the result is orange hair, which is typically called \"red\" or \"ginger\" hair. Pheomelanin is also present in the skin, and redheads consequently often have a more pinkish hue to their skin as well. Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet light increases pheomelanin content, as it does for eumelanin; but rather than absorbing light, pheomelanin within the hair and skin reflect yellow to red light, which may increase damage from UV radiation exposure.\nPheomelanin production is highly dependent on cysteine availability, which is transported into the melanosome, reacting with dopaquinone to form cys-dopa. Cys-dopa then undergoes several transformations before forming pheomelanin. In chemical terms, pheomelanins differ from eumelanins in that the oligomer structure incorporates benzothiazine and benzothiazole units that are produced, instead of DHI and DHICA, when the amino acid L-cysteine is present.\nPheomelanins, unlike eumelanins, are rare in lower organisms with claims they are an \"evolutionary innovation in the tetrapod lineage\" but recent research finds them also in some fish.\nNeuromelanin.\nNeuromelanin (NM) is an insoluble polymer pigment produced in specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. Humans have the largest amount of NM, which is present in lesser amounts in other primates, and totally absent in many other species. The biological function remains unknown, although human NM has been shown to efficiently bind transition metals such as iron, as well as other potentially toxic molecules. Therefore, it may play crucial roles in apoptosis and the related Parkinson's disease.\nOther forms of melanins.\nUp until the 1960s, melanin was classified into eumelanin and pheomelanin. However, in 1955, a melanin associated with nerve cells was discovered, neuromelanin. In 1972 a water-soluble form, pyomelanin, was discovered. In 1976, allomelanin, the fifth form of the melanins, was found in nature.\nPeptidomelanin.\nPeptidomelanin is another water-soluble form of melanin. It was found to be secreted into the surrounding medium by germinating \"Aspergillus niger\" (strain: melanoliber) spores. Peptidomelanin is formed as a copolymer between L-DOPA eumelanin and short peptides that form a 'corona', that are responsible for the substance's solubility. The peptide chains are linked to the L-DOPA core polymer via peptide bonds. This led to a proposed biosynthetic process involving the hydroxylation of tyrosinylated peptides formed via proteases during sporogenesis, which are then incorporated autoxidatively into a growing L-DOPA core polymer.\nSelenomelanin.\nIt is possible to enrich melanin with selenium instead of sulphur. This selenium analogue of pheomelanin has been successfully synthesized through chemical and biosynthetic routes using selenocystine as a feedstock. Due to selenium's higher atomic number, the obtained selenomelanin can be expected to provide better protection against ionising radiation as compared to the other known forms of melanin. This protection has been demonstrated with radiation experiments on human cells and bacteria, opening up the possibility of applications in space travel.\nTrichochromes.\nTrichochromes (formerly called trichosiderins) are pigments produced from the same metabolic pathway as the eumelanins and pheomelanins, but unlike those molecules they have low molecular weight. They occur in some red human hair.\nHumans.\nIn humans, melanin is the primary determinant of skin color. It is also found in hair, the pigmented tissue underlying the iris of the eye, and the stria vascularis of the inner ear. In the brain, tissues with melanin include the medulla and pigment-bearing neurons within areas of the brainstem, such as the locus coeruleus. It also occurs in the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland.\nThe melanin in the skin is produced by melanocytes, which are found in the basal layer of the epidermis. Although, in general, human beings possess a similar concentration of melanocytes in their skin, the melanocytes in some individuals and ethnic groups produce variable amounts of melanin. The ratio of eumelanin (74%) and pheomelanin (26%) in the epidermis is constant regardless of the degree of pigmentation. Some humans have very little or no melanin synthesis in their bodies, a condition known as albinism.\nBecause melanin is an aggregate of smaller component molecules, there are many different types of melanin with different proportions and bonding patterns of these component molecules. Both pheomelanin and eumelanin are found in human skin and hair, but eumelanin is the most abundant melanin in humans, as well as the form most likely to be deficient in albinism.\nOther organisms.\nMelanins have very diverse roles and functions in various organisms. A form of melanin makes up the ink used by many cephalopods (see cephalopod ink) as a defense mechanism against predators. Melanins also protect microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, against stresses that involve cell damage such as UV radiation from the sun and reactive oxygen species. Melanin also protects against damage from high temperatures, chemical stresses (such as heavy metals and oxidizing agents), and biochemical threats (such as host defenses against invading microbes). Therefore, in many pathogenic microbes (for example, in \"Cryptococcus neoformans\", a fungus) melanins appear to play important roles in virulence and pathogenicity by protecting the microbe against immune responses of its host. In invertebrates, a major aspect of the innate immune defense system against invading pathogens involves melanin. Within minutes after infection, the microbe is encapsulated within melanin (melanization), and the generation of free radical byproducts during the formation of this capsule is thought to aid in killing them. Some types of fungi, called radiotrophic fungi, appear to be able to use melanin as a photosynthetic pigment that enables them to capture gamma rays and harness this energy for growth.\nIn fish, melanin occurs not only in the skin but also in internal organs such as eyes. Most fish species use eumelanin, but \"Stegastes apicalis\" and \"Cyprinus carpio\" use pheomelanin instead.\nThe darker feathers of birds owe their color to melanin and are less readily degraded by bacteria than unpigmented ones or those containing carotenoid pigments. Feathers that contain melanin are also 39% more resistant to abrasion than those that do not because melanin granules help fill the space between the keratin strands that form feathers. Pheomelanin synthesis in birds implies the consumption of cysteine, a semi\u2010essential amino acid that is necessary for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) but that may be toxic if in excess in the diet. Indeed, many carnivorous birds, which have a high protein content in their diet, exhibit pheomelanin\u2010based coloration.\nMelanin is also important in mammalian pigmentation. The coat pattern of mammals is determined by the agouti gene which regulates the distribution of melanin. The mechanisms of the gene have been extensively studied in mice to provide an insight into the diversity of mammalian coat patterns.\nMelanin in arthropods has been observed to be deposited in layers thus producing a Bragg reflector of alternating refractive index. When the scale of this pattern matches the wavelength of visible light, structural coloration arises: giving a number of species an iridescent color.\nArachnids are one of the few groups in which melanin has not been easily detected, though researchers found data suggesting spiders do in fact produce melanin.\nSome moth species, including the wood tiger moth, convert resources to melanin to enhance their thermoregulation. As the wood tiger moth has populations over a large range of latitudes, it has been observed that more northern populations showed higher rates of melanization. In both yellow and white male phenotypes of the wood tiger moth, individuals with more melanin had a heightened ability to trap heat but an increased predation rate due to a weaker and less effective aposematic signal.\nMelanin may protect \"Drosophila\" flies and mice against DNA damage from non-UV radiation.\nPlants.\nMelanin produced by plants are sometimes referred to as 'catechol melanins' as they can yield catechol on alkali fusion. It is commonly seen in the enzymatic browning of fruits such as bananas. Chestnut shell melanin can be used as an antioxidant and coloring agent. Biosynthesis involves the oxidation of indole-5,6-quinone by the tyrosinase type polyphenol oxidase from tyrosine and catecholamines leading to the formation of catechol melanin. Despite this many plants contain compounds which inhibit the production of melanins.\nInterpretation as a single monomer.\nIt is now understood that melanins do not have a single structure or stoichiometry. Nonetheless, chemical databases such as PubChem include structural and empirical formulae; typically \"3,8-Dimethyl-2,7-dihydrobenzo[1,2,3-\"cd\":4,5,6-\"c\"\u2032\"d\"\u2032]diindole-4,5,9,10-tetrone\". This can be thought of as a single monomer that accounts for the measured elemental composition and some properties of melanin, but is unlikely to be found in nature. Solano claims that this misleading trend stems from a report of an empirical formula in 1948, but provides no other historical detail.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nBiosynthetic pathways.\nThe first step of the biosynthetic pathway for both eumelanins and pheomelanins is catalysed by tyrosinase.\nTyrosine \u2192 DOPA \u2192 dopaquinone\nDopaquinone can combine with cysteine by two pathways to benzothiazines and pheomelanins\ndopaquinone + cysteine \u2192 5-S-cysteinyldopa \u2192 benzothiazine intermediate \u2192 pheomelanin\ndopaquinone + cysteine \u2192 2-S-cysteinyldopa \u2192 benzothiazine intermediate \u2192 pheomelanin\nAlso, dopaquinone can be converted to leucodopachrome and follow two more pathways to the eumelanins\ndopaquinone \u2192 leucodopachrome \u2192 dopachrome \u2192 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid \u2192 quinone \u2192 eumelanin\ndopaquinone \u2192 leucodopachrome \u2192 dopachrome \u2192 5,6-dihydroxyindole \u2192 quinone \u2192 eumelanin\nDetailed metabolic pathways can be found in the KEGG database (see External links).\nMicroscopic appearance.\nMelanin is brown, non-refractile, and finely granular with individual granules having a diameter of less than 800 nanometers. This differentiates melanin from common blood breakdown pigments, which are larger, chunky, and refractile, and range in color from green to yellow or red-brown. In heavily pigmented lesions, dense aggregates of melanin can obscure histologic detail. A dilute solution of potassium permanganate is an effective melanin bleach.\nGenetic disorders and disease states.\nThere are approximately nine types of oculocutaneous albinism, which is mostly an autosomal recessive disorder. Certain ethnicities have higher incidences of different forms. For example, the most common type, called oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2), is especially frequent among people of black African descent and white Europeans. People with OCA2 usually have fair skin, but are often not as pale as OCA1. They (OCA2 or OCA1? see comments in History) have pale blonde to golden, strawberry blonde, or even brown hair, and most commonly blue eyes. 98.7\u2013100% of modern Europeans are carriers of the derived allele SLC24A5, a known cause of nonsyndromic oculocutaneous albinism. It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a congenital reduction or absence of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. The estimated frequency of OCA2 among African-Americans is 1 in 10,000, which contrasts with a frequency of 1 in 36,000 in European Americans. In some African nations, the frequency of the disorder is even higher, ranging from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000. Another form of Albinism, the \"yellow oculocutaneous albinism\", appears to be more prevalent among the Amish, who are of primarily Swiss and German ancestry. People with this IB variant of the disorder commonly have white hair and skin at birth, but rapidly develop normal skin pigmentation in infancy.\nOcular albinism affects not only eye pigmentation but visual acuity, as well. People with albinism typically test poorly, within the 20/60 to 20/400 range. In addition, two forms of albinism, with approximately 1 in 2,700 most prevalent among people of Puerto Rican origin, are associated with mortality beyond melanoma-related deaths.\nThe connection between albinism and deafness is well known, though poorly understood. In his 1859 treatise \"On the Origin of Species\", Charles Darwin observed that \"cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf\". In humans, hypopigmentation and deafness occur together in the rare Waardenburg's syndrome, predominantly observed among the Hopi in North America. The incidence of albinism in Hopi Indians has been estimated as approximately 1 in 200 individuals. Similar patterns of albinism and deafness have been found in other mammals, including dogs and rodents. However, a lack of melanin \"per se\" does not appear to be directly responsible for deafness associated with hypopigmentation, as most individuals lacking the enzymes required to synthesize melanin have normal auditory function. Instead, the absence of melanocytes in the stria vascularis of the inner ear results in cochlear impairment, though the reasons for this are not fully understood.\nIn Parkinson's disease, a disorder that affects neuromotor functioning, there is decreased neuromelanin in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus as a consequence of specific dropping out of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pigmented neurons. This results in diminished dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis. While no correlation between race and the level of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra has been reported, the significantly lower incidence of Parkinson's in blacks than in whites has \"prompt[ed] some to suggest that cutaneous melanin might somehow serve to protect the neuromelanin in substantia nigra from external toxins.\"\nIn addition to melanin deficiency, the molecular weight of the melanin polymer may be decreased by various factors such as oxidative stress, exposure to light, perturbation in its association with melanosomal matrix proteins, changes in pH, or in local concentrations of metal ions. A decreased molecular weight or a decrease in the degree of polymerization of ocular melanin has been proposed to turn the normally anti-oxidant polymer into a pro-oxidant. In its pro-oxidant state, melanin has been suggested to be involved in the causation and progression of macular degeneration and melanoma. Rasagiline, an important monotherapy drug in Parkinson's disease, has melanin binding properties, and melanoma tumor reducing properties.\nHigher eumelanin levels also can be a disadvantage, however, beyond a higher disposition toward vitamin D deficiency. Dark skin is a complicating factor in the laser removal of port-wine stains. Effective in treating white skin, in general, lasers are less successful in removing port-wine stains in people of Asian or African descent. Higher concentrations of melanin in darker-skinned individuals simply diffuse and absorb the laser radiation, inhibiting light absorption by the targeted tissue. In a similar manner, melanin can complicate laser treatment of other dermatological conditions in people with darker skin.\nFreckles and moles are formed where there is a localized concentration of melanin in the skin. They are highly associated with pale skin.\nNicotine has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues because of its precursor function in melanin synthesis or its irreversible binding of melanin. This has been suggested to underlie the increased nicotine dependence and lower smoking cessation rates in darker pigmented individuals.\nHuman adaptations.\nPhysiology.\nMelanocytes insert granules of melanin into specialized cellular vesicles called melanosomes. These are then transferred into the keratinocyte cells of the human epidermis. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the cell nucleus, where they protect the nuclear DNA from mutations caused by the ionizing radiation of the sun's ultraviolet rays. In general, people whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the equator have larger quantities of eumelanin in their skins. This makes their skins brown or black and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun, which more frequently result in melanomas in lighter-skinned people.\nNot all the effects of pigmentation are advantageous. Pigmentation increases the heat load in hot climates, and dark-skinned people absorb 30% more heat from sunlight than do very light-skinned people, although this factor may be offset by more profuse sweating. In cold climates dark skin entails more heat loss by radiation. Pigmentation also hinders synthesis of vitamin D. Since pigmentation appears to be not entirely advantageous to life in the tropics, other hypotheses about its biological significance have been advanced; for example a secondary phenomenon induced by adaptation to parasites and tropical diseases.\nEvolutionary origins.\nEarly humans evolved dark skin color, as an adaptation to a loss of body hair that increased the effects of UV radiation. Before the development of hairlessness, early humans might have had light skin underneath their fur, similar to that found in other primates. Anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, and then populated the rest of the world through migration between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, in some areas interbreeding with certain archaic human species (Neanderthals, Denisovans, and possibly others). The first modern humans had darker skin, similar to modern indigenous Africans today. Following migration to Asia and Europe, the selective pressure for darker UV-protective skin decreased. This resulted in the current range of human skin color. Of the two common gene variants known to be associated with pale human skin, \"Mc1r\" does not appear to have undergone positive selection, while \"SLC24A5\" has undergone positive selection.\nEffects.\nAs with peoples having migrated northward, those with light skin migrating toward the equator acclimatize to the much stronger solar radiation. Nature selects for less melanin when ultraviolet radiation is weak. Most people's skin darkens when exposed to UV light, giving them more protection when it is needed. This is the physiological purpose of sun tanning. Dark-skinned people, who produce more skin-protecting eumelanin, have a greater protection against sunburn and the development of melanoma, a potentially deadly form of skin cancer, as well as other health problems related to exposure to strong solar radiation, including the photodegradation of certain vitamins such as riboflavins, carotenoids, tocopherol, and folate.\nMelanin in the eyes, in the iris and choroid, helps protect from ultraviolet and high-frequency visible light; people with blue, green, and grey eyes are more at risk of sun-related eye problems. Furthermore, the ocular lens yellows with age, providing added protection. However, the lens also becomes more rigid with age, losing most of its accommodation\u2014the ability to change shape to focus from far to near\u2014a detriment due probably to protein crosslinking caused by UV exposure.\nRecent research suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection. Melanin is able to effectively chelate metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, often much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting the rest of the cell. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the loss of neuromelanin, observed in Parkinson's disease, is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain.\nPhysical properties and technological applications.\nEvidence exists for a highly cross-linked heteropolymer bound covalently to matrix scaffolding melanoproteins. It has been proposed that the ability of melanin to act as an antioxidant is directly proportional to its degree of polymerization or molecular weight. Suboptimal conditions for the effective polymerization of melanin monomers may lead to formation of pro-oxidant melanin with lower-molecular-weight, implicated in the causation and progression of macular degeneration and melanoma. Signaling pathways that upregulate melanization in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also may be implicated in the downregulation of rod outer segment phagocytosis by the RPE. This phenomenon has been attributed in part to foveal sparing in macular degeneration.\nRole in melanoma metastasis.\nHeavily pigmented melanoma cells have a Young's modulus of about 4.93 kPa, compared to non-pigmented cells, with a value of 0.98 kPa. The elasticity of melanoma cells is crucial to metastasis and growth; non-pigmented tumors were larger than pigmented tumors, and spread far more easily. Pigmented and non-pigmented cells are both present in melanoma tumors, so that they can both be drug-resistant and metastatic.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was written using the cuneiform script, originally used for Sumerian, but also used to write multiple languages in the region including Eblaite, Hurrian, Elamite, Old Persian and Hittite. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian went beyond just the cuneiform script; owing to their close proximity, a lengthy span of contact and the prestige held by the former, Sumerian significantly influenced Akkadian phonology, vocabulary and syntax. This mutual influence of Akkadian and Sumerian has also led scholars to describe the languages as a sprachbund.\nAkkadian proper names are first attested in Sumerian texts in the mid-3rd millennium BC, and inscriptions ostensibly written in Sumerian but whose character order reveals that they were intended to be read in East Semitic (presumably early Akkadian) date back to as early as c.\u20092600 BC. From about the 24th century BC, texts fully written in Akkadian begin to appear. By the 20th century BC, two variant forms of the same language were in use in Assyria and Babylonia, known as Assyrian and Babylonian respectively. The bulk of preserved material is from this later period, corresponding to the Near Eastern Iron Age. In total, hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated, covering a vast textual tradition of religious and mythological narrative, legal texts, scientific works, personal correspondence, political, civil and military events, economic tracts and many other examples.\nCenturies after the fall of the Akkadian Empire, Akkadian, in its Assyrian and Babylonian varieties, was the native language of the Mesopotamian empires (Old Assyrian Empire, Babylonia, Middle Assyrian Empire) throughout the later Bronze Age, and became the lingua franca of much of the Ancient Near East by the time of the Bronze Age collapse c.\u20091150 BC. However, its decline began in the Iron Age, during the Neo-Assyrian Empire, by about the 8th century BC (Tiglath-Pileser III), in favour of Old Aramaic. By the Hellenistic period, the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia. The last known Akkadian cuneiform document dates from the 1st century AD.\nMandaic and Suret are two (Northwest Semitic) Neo-Aramaic languages that retain some Akkadian vocabulary and grammatical features.\nAkkadian is a fusional language with grammatical case. Like all Semitic languages, Akkadian uses the system of consonantal roots. The K\u00fcltepe texts, which were written in Old Assyrian, include Hittite loanwords and names, which constitute the oldest record of any Indo-European language.\nClassification.\nAkkadian is a Semitic language of the East Semitic branch. Its relatives in the East Semitic branch include Eblaite. This group differs from the Northwest Semitic languages (such as Aramaic) and South Semitic languages (such as Ge\u02bdez) in its subject\u2013object\u2013verb word order, while the other Semitic languages usually have either a verb\u2013subject\u2013object or subject\u2013verb\u2013object order.\nIn contrast to most other Semitic languages, Akkadian has only one non-sibilant fricative: \u1e2b . Akkadian lost both the glottal and pharyngeal fricatives, which are characteristic of the other Semitic languages. Until the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian sibilants were exclusively affricated.\nAdditionally Akkadian is the only Semitic language to use the prepositions \"ina\" and \"ana\" (locative case, English \"in\"/\"on\"/\"with\", and dative-locative case, \"for\"/\"to\", respectively). Other Semitic languages like Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic have the prepositions \"bi/b\u0259\" and \"li/l\u0259\" (locative and dative, respectively). The origin of the Akkadian spatial prepositions is unknown.\nThe Semitic languages are further grouped by most linguists into the Afroasiatic macrofamily of languages, meaning that Akkadian is distantly related to Ancient Egyptian, as well as many other languages spoken historically and currently across northern and western Africa and West Asia.\nHistory and writing.\nWriting.\nOld Akkadian is preserved on clay tablets dating back to c.\u20092500 BC. It was written using cuneiform, a script adopted from the Sumerians using wedge-shaped symbols pressed in wet clay. As employed by Akkadian scribes, the adapted cuneiform script could represent either (a) Sumerian logograms (\"i.e.\", picture-based characters representing entire words), (b) Sumerian syllables, (c) Akkadian syllables, or (d) phonetic complements. In Akkadian the script practically became a fully fledged syllabic script, and the original logographic nature of cuneiform became secondary, though logograms for frequent words such as 'god' and 'temple' continued to be used. For this reason, the sign \"AN\" can on the one hand be a logogram for the word \"ilum\" ('god') and on the other signify the god Anu or even the syllable \"-an-\". Additionally, this sign was used as a determinative for divine names.\nAnother peculiarity of Akkadian cuneiform is that many signs do not have a well defined phonetic value. Certain signs, such as ', do not distinguish between the different vowel qualities. Nor is there any coordination in the other direction; the syllable ', for example, is rendered by the sign ', but also by the sign '. Both of these are often used for the same syllable in the same text.\nCuneiform was in many ways unsuited to Akkadian: among its flaws was its inability to represent important phonemes in Semitic, including a glottal stop, pharyngeals, and emphatic consonants. In addition, cuneiform was a syllabary writing system\u2014i.e., a consonant plus vowel comprised one writing unit\u2014frequently inappropriate for a Semitic language made up of triconsonantal roots (i.e., three consonants plus any vowels).\nDevelopment.\nAkkadian is divided into several varieties based on geography and historical period:\nOne of the earliest known Akkadian inscriptions was found on a bowl at Ur, addressed to the very early pre-Sargonic king Meskiagnunna of Ur (c.\u20092485\u20132450 BC) by his queen Gan-saman, who is thought to have been from Akkad. The Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad, introduced the Akkadian language (the \"language of Akkad\") as a written language, adapting Sumerian cuneiform orthography for the purpose. During the Middle Bronze Age (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language virtually displaced Sumerian, which is assumed to have been extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.\nOld Akkadian, which was used until the end of the 3rd millennium BC, differed from both Babylonian and Assyrian, and was displaced by these dialects. By the 21st century BC Babylonian and Assyrian, which were to become the primary dialects, were easily distinguishable. Old Babylonian, along with the closely related dialect Mariotic, is clearly more innovative than the Old Assyrian dialect and the more distantly related Eblaite language. For this reason, forms like \"lu-prus\" ('I will decide') were first encountered in Old Babylonian instead of the older \"la-prus\".\nWhile generally more archaic, Assyrian developed certain innovations as well, such as the \"Assyrian vowel harmony\". Eblaite was even more so, retaining a productive dual and a relative pronoun declined in case, number and gender. Both of these had already disappeared in Old Akkadian. Over 20,000 cuneiform tablets in Old Assyrian have been recovered from the K\u00fcltepe site in Anatolia.\nMost of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use both of cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.\nOld Babylonian was the language of king Hammurabi and his code, which is one of the oldest collections of laws in the world. (see Code of Ur-Nammu.) Old Assyrian developed as well during the second millennium BC, but because it was a purely popular language\u2014kings wrote in Babylonian\u2014few long texts are preserved. It was, however, notably used in the correspondence of Assyrian traders in Anatolia in the 20th\u201318th centuries BC and that even led to its temporary adoption as a diplomatic language by various local Anatolian polities during that time.\nThe Middle Babylonian period started in the 16th century BC. The division is marked by the Kassite invasion of Babylonia around 1550\u00a0BC. The Kassites, who reigned for 300 years, gave up their own language in favor of Akkadian, but they had little influence on the language. At its apogee, Middle Babylonian was the written language of diplomacy of the entire Ancient Near East, including Egypt (Amarna Period). During this period, a large number of loan words were included in the language from Northwest Semitic languages and Hurrian. However, the use of these words was confined to the fringes of the Akkadian-speaking territory.\nFrom 1500\u00a0BC onwards, the Assyrian language is termed Middle Assyrian. It was the language of the Middle Assyrian Empire. However, the Babylonian cultural influence was strong and the Assyrians wrote royal inscriptions, religious and most scholarly texts in Middle Babylonian, whereas Middle Assyrian was used mostly in letters and administrative documents.\nDuring the first millennium BC, Akkadian progressively lost its status as a \"lingua franca\". In the beginning, from around 1000\u00a0BC, Akkadian and Aramaic were of equal status, as can be seen in the number of copied texts: clay tablets were written in Akkadian, while scribes writing on papyrus and leather used Aramaic. From this period on, one speaks of Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian.\nNeo-Assyrian experienced an upswing in popularity in the 10th century BC when the Assyrian kingdom became a major power with the Neo-Assyrian Empire. During the existence of that empire, however, Neo-Assyrian began to turn into a chancellery language, being marginalized by Old Aramaic. The dominance of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Tiglath-Pileser III over Aram-Damascus in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a \"lingua franca\" of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by Akkadian. Texts written 'exclusively' in Neo-Assyrian disappear within 10 years of Nineveh's destruction in 612\u00a0BC. Under the Achaemenids, Aramaic continued to prosper, but Assyrian continued its decline. The language's final demise came about during the Hellenistic period when it was further marginalized by Koine Greek, even though Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into Parthian times.\nNeo-Assyrian was used in some surviving tablets containing poetry and also more prominently in surviving letters of royal correspondence. Because of the multilingual nature of the empire, many loan words are attested as entering the Assyrian language during the Neo-Assyrian period. The number of surviving documents written in cuneiform grew considerably fewer in the late reign of Ashurbanipal, which suggests that the language was declining since it is probably attributable to an increased use of Aramaic, often written on perishable materials like leather scrolls or papyrus. The Neo-Assyrian Akkadian language did not disappear completely until around the end of the 6th century BC however, well into the subsequent post-imperial period.\nSimilarly, the Persian conquest of the Mesopotamian kingdoms contributed to the decline of Babylonian, from that point on known as Late Babylonian, as a popular language. However, the language was still used in its written form. Even after the Greek invasion under Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, Akkadian was still a contender as a written language, but spoken Akkadian was likely extinct by this time, or at least rarely used. The last positively identified Akkadian text comes from the 1st century AD. The latest known text in cuneiform Babylonian is an astronomical almanac dated to 79/80\u00a0AD. However, the latest cuneiform texts are almost entirely written in Sumerian logograms. Iamblichus, a 2nd century Syrian novelist, may have been one of the last known people to know Babylonian.\nDecipherment.\nThe Akkadian language began to be rediscovered when Carsten Niebuhr in 1767 was able to make extensive copies of cuneiform texts and published them in Denmark. The deciphering of the texts started immediately, and bilinguals, in particular Old Persian-Akkadian bilinguals, were of great help. Since the texts contained several royal names, isolated signs could be identified, and were presented in 1802 by Georg Friedrich Grotefend. By this time it was already evident that Akkadian was a Semitic language, and the final breakthrough in deciphering the language came from Edward Hincks, Henry Rawlinson and Jules Oppert in the middle of the 19th century.\nIn the early 21st century it was shown that automatic high-quality translation of Akkadian can be achieved using natural language processing methods such as convolutional neural networks.\nDialects.\nThe following table summarises the dialects of Akkadian identified with certainty so far.\nSome researchers (such as W. Sommerfeld 2003) believe that the Old Akkadian variant used in the older texts is not an ancestor of the later Assyrian and Babylonian dialects, but rather a separate dialect that was replaced by these two dialects and which died out early.\nEblaite, formerly thought of as yet another Akkadian dialect, is now generally considered a separate East Semitic language.\nPhonology.\nBecause Akkadian as a spoken language is extinct and no contemporary descriptions of the pronunciation are known, little can be said with certainty about the phonetics and phonology of Akkadian. Some conclusions can be made, however, due to the relationship to the other Semitic languages and variant spellings of Akkadian words.\nConsonants.\nThe following table presents the consonants of the Akkadian language, as distinguished in Akkadian cuneiform. The reconstructed phonetic value of a phoneme is given in IPA transcription, alongside its standard (DMG-Umschrift) transliteration in angle brackets .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReconstruction.\nAkkadian emphatic consonants are typically reconstructed as ejectives, which are thought to be the oldest realization of emphatics across the Semitic languages. One piece of evidence for this is that Akkadian shows a development known as Geers's law, where one of two emphatic consonants dissimilates to the corresponding non-emphatic consonant. For the sibilants, traditionally \u27e8\u27e9 has been held to be postalveolar , and \u27e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u27e9 analyzed as fricatives; but attested assimilations in Akkadian suggest otherwise. For example, when the possessive suffix \"-\u0161u\" is added to the root \"awat\" ('word'), it is written \"awassu\" ('his word') even though \"\u0161\u0161\" would be expected.\nThe most straightforward interpretation of this shift from \"t\u0161\" to \"ss\", is that \u27e8\u27e9 form a pair of voiceless alveolar affricates , \u27e8\u27e9 is a voiceless alveolar sibilant , and \u27e8\u27e9 is a voiced alveolar affricate or fricative . The assimilation is then [awat+su] &gt; . In this vein, an alternative transcription of \u27e8\u27e9 is \u27e8\u27e9, with the macron below indicating a soft (lenis) articulation in Semitic transcription. Other interpretations are possible. could have been assimilated to the preceding , yielding , which would later have been simplified to .\nThe rhotic \u27e8\u27e9 has traditionally been interpreted as a voiced alveolar trill but its pattern of alternation with \u27e8\u27e9 suggests it was a fricative (either uvular or velar ). In the Hellenistic period, Akkadian \u27e8\u27e9 was transcribed using the Greek \u03c1, indicating it was pronounced similarly as an alveolar sound (though Greeks may also have perceived a uvular trill as \u03c1).\nDescent from Proto-Semitic.\nSeveral Proto-Semitic phonemes are lost in Akkadian. The Proto-Semitic glottal stop , as well as the fricatives , , are lost as consonants, either by sound change or orthographically, but they gave rise to the vowel quality \"e\" not exhibited in Proto-Semitic. The voiceless lateral fricatives () merged with the sibilants as in Canaanite, leaving 19 consonantal phonemes. Old Akkadian preserved the /*\u015b/ phoneme longest but it eventually merged with /*\u0161/, beginning in the Old Babylonian period. The following table shows Proto-Semitic phonemes and their correspondences among Akkadian, Modern Standard Arabic and Tiberian Hebrew:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVowels.\nThe existence of a back mid-vowel has been proposed, but the cuneiform writing gives no good proof for this. There is limited contrast between different u-signs in lexical texts, but this scribal differentiation may reflect the superimposition of the Sumerian phonological system (for which an /o/ phoneme has also been proposed), rather than a separate phoneme in Akkadian.\nAll consonants and vowels appear in long and short forms. Long consonants are transliterated as double consonants, and inconsistently written as such in cuneiform. Long vowels are transliterated with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u016b) or a circumflex (\u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ee, \u00fb), the latter being used for long vowels arising from the contraction of vowels in hiatus. The distinction between long and short is phonemic, and is used in the grammar; for example, \"iprusu\" ('that he decided') versus \"iprus\u016b\" ('they decided').\nStress.\nThere is broad agreement among most Assyriologists about Akkadian stress patterns. The rules of Akkadian stress were originally reconstructed by means of a comparison with other Semitic languages, and the resulting picture was gradually amended using internal linguistic evidence from Akkadian sources, especially deriving from so-called \"plene\" spellings (spellings with an extra vowel).\nAccording to this widely accepted system, the place of stress in Akkadian is completely predictable and sensitive to syllable weight. There are three syllable weights: \"light\" (ending in -V); \"heavy\" (ending in -V\u0304 or -VC), and \"superheavy\" (ending in -V\u0302, -V\u0304C or -V\u0302C). If the last syllable is superheavy, it is stressed, otherwise the rightmost heavy non-final syllable is stressed. If a word contains only light syllables, the first syllable is stressed. It has also been argued that monosyllabic words generally are not stressed but rather function as clitics. The special behaviour of /V\u0302/ syllables is explained by their functioning, in accordance with their historical origin, as sequences of two syllables, of which the first one bears stress.\nA rule of Akkadian phonology is that certain short (and probably unstressed) vowels are dropped. The rule is that the last vowel of a succession of syllables that end in a short vowel is dropped, for example the declinational root of the verbal adjective of a root PRS is \"PaRiS-\". Thus the masculine singular nominative is \"PaRS-um\" (&lt; \"*PaRiS-um\") but the feminine singular nominative is \"PaRiStum\" (&lt; \"*PaRiS-at-um\"). Additionally there is a general tendency of syncope of short vowels in the later stages of Akkadian.\nGrammar.\nMorphology.\nConsonantal root.\nMost roots of the Akkadian language consist of three consonants, called the radicals, but some roots are composed of four consonants, so-called quadriradicals. The radicals are occasionally represented in transcription in upper-case letters, for example \"PRS\" (to decide). Between and around these radicals various infixes, suffixes and prefixes, having word generating or grammatical functions, are inserted. The resulting consonant-vowel pattern differentiates the original meaning of the root. The middle radical can be geminated, which is represented by a doubled consonant in transcription, and sometimes in the cuneiform writing itself.\nThe consonants ', ', ' and ' are termed \"weak radicals\" and roots containing these radicals give rise to irregular forms.\nCase, number and gender.\nFormally, Akkadian has three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases (nominative, accusative and genitive). However, even in the earlier stages of the language, the dual number is vestigial, and its use is largely confined to natural pairs (eyes, ears, etc.). Adjectives are never found in the dual. In the dual and plural, the accusative and genitive are merged into a single oblique case.\nAkkadian, unlike Arabic, has only \"sound\" plurals formed by means of a plural ending. Broken plurals are not formed by changing the word stem. As in all Semitic languages, some masculine nouns take the prototypically feminine plural ending (\"-\u0101t\").\nThe nouns \"\u0161arrum\" (king) and \"\u0161arratum\" (queen) and the adjective \"dannum\" (strong) will serve to illustrate the case system of Akkadian.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs is clear from the above table, the adjective and noun endings differ only in the masculine plural. Certain nouns, primarily those referring to geography, can also form a locative ending in \"-um\" in the singular and the resulting forms serve as adverbials. These forms are generally not productive, but in the Neo-Babylonian the \"um\"-locative replaces several constructions with the preposition \"ina\".\nIn the later stages of Akkadian, the mimation (word-final \"-m\") and nunation (dual final \"-n\") that occurred at the end of most case endings disappeared, except in the locative. Later, the nominative and accusative singular of masculine nouns collapsed to \"-u\" and in Neo-Babylonian most word-final short vowels were dropped. As a result, case differentiation disappeared from all forms except masculine plural nouns. However, many texts continued the practice of writing the case endings, although often sporadically and incorrectly. As the most important contact language throughout this period was Aramaic, which itself lacks case distinctions, it is possible that Akkadian's loss of cases was an areal as well as phonological phenomenon.\nNoun states and nominal sentences.\nAs is also the case in other Semitic languages, Akkadian nouns may appear in a variety of \"states\" depending on their grammatical function in a sentence. The basic form of the noun is the \"status rectus\" (the governed state), which is the form as described above, complete with case endings. In addition to this, Akkadian has the \"status absolutus\" (the absolute state) and the \"status constructus\" (construct state). The latter is found in all other Semitic languages, while the former appears only in Akkadian and some dialects of Aramaic.\nThe status absolutus is characterised by the loss of a noun's case ending (e.g. \"aw\u012bl\" &lt; \"aw\u012blum\", \"\u0161ar\" &lt; \"\u0161arrum\"). It is relatively uncommon, and is used chiefly to mark the predicate of a nominal sentence, in fixed adverbial expressions, and in expressions relating to measurements of length, weight, and the like.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe status constructus is more common by far, and has a much wider range of applications. It is employed when a noun is followed by another noun in the genitive, a pronominal suffix, or a verbal clause in the subjunctive, and typically takes the \"shortest form of the noun which is phonetically possible\". In general, this amounts to the loss of case endings with short vowels, with the exception of the genitive -i in nouns preceding a pronominal suffix, hence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nbut\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere are numerous exceptions to this general rule, usually involving potential violations of the language's phonological limitations. Most obviously, Akkadian does not tolerate word-final consonant clusters, so nouns like \"kalbum\" (dog) and \"ma\u1e2brum\" (front) would have illegal construct state forms \"*kalb\" and \"*ma\u1e2br\" unless modified. In many of these instances, the first vowel of the word is simply repeated (e.g. \"kalab\", \"ma\u1e2bar\"). This rule, however, does not always hold true, especially in nouns where a short vowel has historically been elided (e.g. \"\u0161aknum\" &lt; \"*\u0161akinum\" \"governor\"). In these cases, the lost vowel is restored in the construct state (so \"\u0161aknum\" yields \"\u0161akin\").\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA genitive relation can also be expressed with the relative preposition \"\u0161a\", and the noun that the genitive phrase depends on appears in status rectus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe same preposition is also used to introduce true relative clauses, in which case the verb is placed in the subjunctive mood.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVerbal morphology.\nVerb aspects.\nThe Akkadian verb has six finite verb aspects (preterite, perfect, present, imperative, precative, and vetitive (the negative form of precative)) and three infinite forms (infinitive, participle and verbal adjective). The preterite is used for actions that are seen by the speaker as having occurred at a single point in time. The present is primarily imperfective in meaning and is used for concurrent and future actions as well as past actions with a temporal dimension. The final three finite forms are injunctive where the imperative and the precative together form a paradigm for positive commands and wishes, and the vetitive is used for negative wishes. The periphrastic prohibitive, formed by the present form of the verb and the negative adverb l\u0101, is used to express negative commands.\nThe infinitive of the Akkadian verb is a verbal noun, and in contrast to some other languages the Akkadian infinitive can be declined in case. The verbal adjective is an adjectival form and designates the state or the result of the action of the verb, and consequently the exact meaning of the verbal adjective is determined by the semantics of the verb itself. The participle, which can be active or passive, is another verbal adjective and its meaning is similar to the English gerund.\nThe following table shows the conjugation of the G-stem verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\") in the various verb aspects of Akkadian:\nThe table below shows the different affixes attached to the preterite aspect of the verb root PRS \"to decide\"; and as can be seen, the grammatical genders differ only in the second person singular and third person plural.\nVerb moods.\nAkkadian verbs have three moods:\nThe following table demonstrates the verb moods of verbs derived from the root PRS (\"to decide\", \"to separate\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVerb patterns.\nAkkadian verbs have thirteen separate derived stems formed on each root. The basic, underived, stem is the G-stem (from the German Grundstamm, meaning \"basic stem\"). Causative or intensive forms are formed with the doubled D-stem, and it gets its name from the doubled-middle radical that is characteristic of this form. The doubled middle radical is also characteristic of the present. The forms of the D-stem use the secondary conjugational affixes, so a D-form will never be identical to a form in a different stem. The \u0160-stem is formed by adding a prefix \"\u0161-\", and these forms are mostly causatives. The passive forms of the verb are in the N-stem, formed by adding a \"n-\" prefix. The \"n-\" element is assimilated to a following consonant, so the original /n/ is only visible in a few forms.\nReflexive and iterative verbal stems can be derived from each of the basic stems. The reflexive stem is formed with an infix \"-ta\", and the derived stems are therefore called Gt, Dt, \u0160t and Nt, and the preterite forms of the Xt-stem are identical to the perfects of the X-stem. Iteratives are formed with the infix \"-tan-\", giving the Gtn, Dtn, \u0160tn and Ntn. Because of the assimilation of \"n\", the /n/ is only seen in the present forms, and the Xtn preterite is identical to the Xt durative.\nThe final stem is the \u0160D-stem, a form mostly attested only in poetic texts, and whose meaning is usually identical to either the \u0160-stem or the D-stem of the same verb. It is formed with the \u0160 prefix (like the \u0160-stem) in addition to a doubled-middle radical (like the D-stem).\nAn alternative to this naming system is a numerical system. The basic stems are numbered using Roman numerals so that G, D, \u0160 and N become I, II, III and IV, respectively. The infixes are numbered using Arabic numerals; 1 for the forms without an infix, 2 for the Xt, and 3 for the Xtn. The two numbers are separated using a solidus. As an example, the \u0160tn-stem is called III/3. The most important user of this system is the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.\nThere is mandatory congruence between the subject of the sentence and the verb. This is expressed by prefixes and suffixes. There are two different sets of affixes, a primary set used for the forms of the G and N-stems, and a secondary set for the D and \u0160-stems.\nThe stems, their nomenclature and examples of the third-person masculine singular stative of the verb \"par\u0101sum\" (root PRS: 'to decide, distinguish, separate') is shown below:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStative.\nA very often appearing form which can be formed by nouns, adjectives as well as by verbal adjectives is the stative. Nominal predicatives occur in the status absolutus and correspond to the verb \"to be\" in English. The stative in Akkadian corresponds to the Egyptian pseudo-participle. The following table contains an example of using the noun \"\u0161arrum\" (king), the adjective \"rap\u0161um\" (wide) and the verbal adjective \"parsum\" (decided).\nThus, the stative in Akkadian is used to convert simple stems into effective sentences, so that the form \"\u0161arr-\u0101ta\" is equivalent to: \"you were king\", \"you are king\" and \"you will be king\". Hence, the stative is independent of time forms.\nDerivation.\nBeside the already explained possibility of derivation of different verb stems, Akkadian has numerous nominal formations derived from verb roots. A very frequently encountered form is the maPRaS form. It can express the location of an event, the person performing the act and many other meanings. If one of the root consonants is labial (p, b, m), the prefix becomes na- (maPRaS &gt; naPRaS). Examples for this are: \"ma\u0161kanum\" (place, location) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), \"ma\u0161ra\u1e2bum\" (splendour) from \u0160R\u1e2a (be splendid), \"ma\u1e63\u1e63arum\" (guards) from N\u1e62R (guard), \"nap\u1e2barum\" (sum) from P\u1e2aR (summarize).\nA very similar formation is the maPRaSt form. The noun derived from this nominal formation is grammatically feminine. The same rules as for the maPRaS form apply, for example \"ma\u0161kattum\" (deposit) from \u0160KN (set, place, put), \"narkabtum\" (carriage) from RKB (ride, drive, mount).\nThe suffix \u2013 \u016bt is used to derive abstract nouns. The nouns which are formed with this suffix are grammatically feminine. The suffix can be attached to nouns, adjectives and verbs, e.g. \"ab\u016btum\" (paternity) from \"abum\" (father), \"rab\u00fbtum\" (size) from \"rab\u00fbm\" (large), \"wa\u1e63\u00fbtum\" (leaving) from W\u1e62Y (leave).\nAlso derivatives of verbs from nouns, adjectives and numerals are numerous. For the most part, a D-stem is derived from the root of the noun or adjective. The derived verb then has the meaning of \"make X do something\" or \"becoming X\", for example: \"du\u0161\u0161\u00fbm\" (let sprout) from \"d\u012b\u0161um\" (grass), \"\u0161ullu\u0161um\" (to do something for the third time ) from \"\u0161al\u0101\u0161\" (three).\nPronouns.\nPersonal pronouns.\nIndependent personal pronouns.\nIndependent personal pronouns in Akkadian are as follows:\nSuffixed (or enclitic) pronouns.\nSuffixed (or enclitic) pronouns (mainly denoting the genitive, accusative and dative) are as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemonstrative pronouns.\nDemonstrative pronouns in Akkadian differ from the Western Semitic variety. The following tables show the Akkadian demonstrative pronouns according to near and far deixis:\nRelative pronouns.\nRelative pronouns in Akkadian are shown in the following table:\nUnlike plural relative pronouns, singular relative pronouns in Akkadian exhibit full declension for case. Only the form \"\u0161a\" (originally accusative masculine singular) survived, while the other forms disappeared in time.\nInterrogative pronouns.\nThe following table shows the interrogative pronouns used in Akkadian:\nPrepositions.\nAkkadian has prepositions which consist mainly of only one word. For example: \"ina\" (in, on, out, through, under), \"ana\" (to, for, after, approximately), \"adi\" (to), \"a\u0161\u0161um\" (because of), \"eli\" (up, over), \"i\u0161tu/ultu\" (of, since), \"mala\" (in accordance with), \"itti\" (also, with). There are some compound prepositions which are combined with \"ina\" and \"ana\" (e.g. \"ina ma\u1e2bar\" (forwards), \"ina balu\" (without), \"ana \u1e63\u0113r\" (up to), \"ana ma\u1e2bar\" (forwards). Regardless of the complexity of the preposition, the following noun is always in the genitive case.\nExamples: \"ina b\u012btim\" (in the house, from the house), \"ana dummuqim\" (to do good), \"itti \u0161arrim\" (with the king), \"ana \u1e63\u0113r m\u0101r\u012b\u0161u\" (up to his son).\nNumerals.\nSince numerals are written mostly as a number sign in the cuneiform script, the transliteration of many numerals is not well ascertained yet. Along with the counted noun, the cardinal numerals are in the status absolutus. Because other cases are very rare, the forms of the status rectus are known only by isolated numerals. The numerals 1 and 2 as well as 21\u201329, 31\u201339, 41\u201349 correspond with the counted in the grammatical gender. The numerals 3\u201320, 30, 40 and 50 are characterized by polarity of gender, i.e. if the counted noun is masculine, the numeral would be feminine and vice versa.\nThis polarity is typical of the Semitic languages and appears, for example, in classical Arabic. The numerals 60, 100, and 1,000 do not change according to the gender of the counted noun. Counted nouns more than two appear in the plural form. Body parts that occur in pairs appear in the dual form in Akkadian; \"e.g.\", \"\u0161\u0113pum\" (foot) becomes \"\u0161\u0113p\u0101n\" (two feet).\nThe ordinals are formed (with few exceptions) by adding a case ending to the nominal form PaRuS. The P, R and S must be substituted with the suitable consonants of the numeral. It is noted, that in the case of the numeral \"one\", the ordinal (masculine) and the cardinal number are the same. A metathesis occurs in the numeral \"four\".\nExamples: erb\u0113 a\u0161\u0161\u0101tum (four wives) (masculine numeral), meat \u0101l\u0101n\u016b (100 towns).\nSyntax.\nNominal phrases.\nAdjectives, relative clauses and appositions follow the noun.\nWhile numerals precede the counted noun.\nIn the following table the nominal phrase \"erb\u0113t \u0161arr\u016b dann\u016btum \u0161a \u0101lam \u012bpu\u0161\u016b ab\u016bya\" 'the four strong kings who built the city are my fathers' is analyzed:\nSentence syntax.\nAkkadian sentence order was Subject+Object+Verb (SOV), which sets it apart from most other ancient Semitic languages such as Arabic and Biblical Hebrew, which typically have a verb\u2013subject\u2013object (VSO) word order. Modern South Semitic languages in Ethiopia also have SOV order, but these developed within historical times from the classical verb\u2013subject\u2013object (VSO) language Ge'ez. It has been hypothesized that this word order was a result of influence from the Sumerian language, which was also SOV. There is evidence that native speakers of both languages were in intimate language contact, forming a single society for at least 500 years, so it is entirely likely that a sprachbund could have formed. Further evidence of an original VSO or SVO ordering can be found in the fact that direct and indirect object pronouns are suffixed to the verb. Word order seems to have shifted to SVO/VSO late in the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, possibly under the influence of Aramaic.\nVocabulary.\nThe Akkadian vocabulary is mostly of Semitic origin. Although classified as East Semitic, many elements of its basic vocabulary find no evident parallels in related Semitic languages: \"m\u0101rum\" 'son' (Semitic *bn), \"q\u0101tum\" 'hand' (Semitic *yd), \"\u0161\u0113pum\" 'foot' (Semitic *rgl), \"qab\u00fbm\" 'say' (Semitic *qwl), \"izuzzum\" 'stand' (Semitic *qwm), \"ana\" 'to, for' (Semitic *li).\nDue to extensive contact with Sumerian and Aramaic, the Akkadian vocabulary contains many loan words from these languages. Aramaic loan words were limited to the 1st centuries of the 1st millennium BC and primarily in the north and middle parts of Mesopotamia. Sumerian loan words were spread in the whole linguistic area. Beside the previous languages, some nouns were borrowed from Hurrian, Kassite, Ugaritic and other ancient languages.\nSince Sumerian and Hurrian, two non-Semitic languages, differ from Akkadian in word structure, only nouns and some adjectives (not many verbs) were borrowed from these languages. Some verbs were borrowed, along with many nouns, from Aramaic and Ugaritic, both of which are Semitic languages.\nThe following table contains examples of loan words in Akkadian:\nAkkadian was also a source of borrowing to other Semitic languages such as \"bi\u1e63ru\" \"onion\" (into and ), \"\u0101su\" \"myrtle\" ( \"\u0101s\") and so on, above all Sumerian with examples: Sumerian \"da-ri\" ('lastingly', from Akkadian \"d\u0101rum\"), Sumerian \"ra gaba\" ('riders, messenger', from Akkadian \"r\u0101kibum\").\nIn 2011, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago completed a 21-volume dictionary, the \"Chicago Assyrian Dictionary\", of the Akkadian language. The dictionary took 90 years to develop, beginning in 1921, with the first volume published in 1956. The completion of this work was hailed as a significant milestone for the study of the language by prominent academic Irving Finkel of the British Museum.\nSample text.\nThe following is the 7th section of the Hammurabi law code, written in the mid-18th century BC:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like nearby Elam, it is one of the cradles of civilization, along with Egypt, the Indus Valley, the Erligang culture of the Yellow River valley, Caral-Supe, and Mesoamerica. Living along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, Sumerian farmers grew an abundance of grain and other crops, a surplus of which enabled them to form urban settlements. The world's earliest known texts come from the Sumerian cities of Uruk and Jemdet Nasr, and date to between c.\u20093350\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20092500 BC, following a period of proto-writing c.\u20094000\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20092500 BC.\nName.\nThe term \"Sumer\" () comes from the Akkadian name for the \"Sumerians\", the ancient non-Semitic-speaking inhabitants of southern Mesopotamia. In their inscriptions, the Sumerians called their land \"Kengir\", the \"Country of the noble lords\" (), and their language \"Emegir\" ( or ).\nThe Akkadians, the East Semitic-speaking people who later conquered the Sumerian city-states, gave Sumer its main historical name, but the phonological development of the term is uncertain. Hebrew , Egyptian , and Hittite , all referring to southern Mesopotamia, could be western variants of \"Sumer\".\nOrigins.\nMost historians have suggested that Sumer was first permanently settled between c.\u20095500 and c.\u20093300 BC by a West Asian people who spoke the Sumerian language (pointing to the names of cities, rivers, basic occupations, etc., as evidence), a non-Semitic and non-Indo-European agglutinative language isolate.\nOthers have suggested that the Sumerians were a North African people who migrated from the Green Sahara into the Middle East and were responsible for the spread of farming in the Middle East. However, contrary evidence strongly suggests that the first farming originated in the Fertile Crescent. Although not specifically discussing Sumerians, Lazaridis et al. 2016 have suggested a partial North African origin for some pre-Semitic cultures of the Middle East, particularly Natufians, after testing the genomes of Natufian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture-bearers. Craniometric analysis has also suggested an affinity between Natufians and ancient North Africans.\nSome scholars associate the Sumerians with the Hurrians and Urartians, and suggest the Caucasus as their homeland. This is not generally accepted.\nBased on mentions of Dilmun as the \"home city of the land of Sumer\" in Sumerian legends and literature, other scholars have suggested the possibility that the Sumerians originated from Dilmun, which was theorized to be the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. In Sumerian mythology, Dilmun was also mentioned as the home of deities such as Enki. The status of Dilmun as the Sumerians\u2019 ancestral homeland has not been established, but archaeologists have found evidence of civilization in Bahrain, namely the existence of Mesopotamian-style round disks.\nA prehistoric people who lived in the region before the Sumerians have been termed the \"Proto-Euphrateans\" or \"Ubaidians\", and are theorized to have evolved from the Samarra culture of northern Mesopotamia. The Ubaidians, though never mentioned by the Sumerians themselves, are assumed by modern-day scholars to have been the first civilizing force in Sumer. They drained the marshes for agriculture, developed trade, and established industries, including weaving, leatherwork, metalwork, masonry, and pottery.\nSome scholars contest the idea of a Proto-Euphratean language or one substrate language; they think the Sumerian language may originally have been that of the hunting and fishing peoples who lived in the marshland and the Eastern Arabia littoral region and were part of the Arabian bifacial culture. Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians lived along the coast of Eastern Arabia, today's Persian Gulf region, before it was flooded at the end of the Ice Age.\nSumerian civilization took form in the Uruk period (4th millennium BC), continuing into the Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. The Sumerian city of Eridu, on the coast of the Persian Gulf, is considered to have been one of the oldest cities, where three separate cultures may have fused: that of peasant Ubaidian farmers, living in mud-brick huts and practicing irrigation; that of mobile nomadic Semitic pastoralists living in black tents and following herds of sheep and goats; and that of fisher folk, living in reed huts in the marshlands, who may have been the ancestors of the Sumerians.\nReliable historical records begin with Enmebaragesi (Early Dynastic I). The Sumerians progressively lost control to Semitic states from the northwest. Sumer was conquered by the Semitic-speaking kings of the Akkadian Empire around 2270 BC (short chronology), but Sumerian continued as a sacred language. Native Sumerian rule re-emerged for about a century in the Third Dynasty of Ur at approximately 2100\u20132000 BC, but the Akkadian language also remained in use for some time.\nArcheological discovery.\nThe Sumerians were entirely unknown during the early period of modern archeology. Jules Oppert was the first scholar to publish the word Sumer in a lecture on 17 January 1869. The first major excavations of Sumerian cities were in 1877 at Girsu by the French archeologist Ernest de Sarzec, in 1889 at Nippur by John Punnett Peters from the University of Pennsylvania between 1889 and 1900, and in Shuruppak by German archeologist Robert Koldewey in 1902\u20131903. Major publications of these finds were \"\"Decouvertes en Chald\u00e9e par Ernest de Sarzec\" by L\u00e9on Heuzey in 1884, \"Les Inscriptions de Sumer et d'Akkad\" by Fran\u00e7ois Thureau-Dangin in 1905, and \"Grundz\u00fcge der sumerischen Grammatik\"\" on Sumerian grammar by Arno Poebel in 1923.\nCity-states in Mesopotamia.\nIn the late 4th millennium BC, Sumer was divided into many independent city-states, which were divided by canals and boundary stones. Each was centered on a temple dedicated to the particular patron god or goddess of the city and ruled over by a priestly governor (ensi) or by a king (lugal) who was intimately tied to the city's religious rites.\nAn incomplete list of cities that may have been visited, interacted and traded with, invaded, conquered, destroyed, occupied, colonized by and/or otherwise within the Sumerians\u2019 sphere of influence (ordered from south to north):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nApart from Mari, which lies full 330 kilometres (205 miles) north-west of Agade, but which is credited in the king list as having exercised kingship in the Early Dynastic II period, and Nagar, an outpost, these cities are all in the Euphrates-Tigris alluvial plain, south of Baghdad in what are now the B\u0101bil, Diyala, W\u0101sit, Dhi Qar, Basra, Al-Muthann\u0101 and Al-Q\u0101disiyyah governorates of Iraq.\nHistory.\nThe Sumerian city-states rose to power during the prehistoric Ubaid and Uruk periods. Sumerian written history reaches back to the 27th century BC and before, but the historical record remains obscure until the Early Dynastic III period, c.\u200923rd century BC, when the language of the written records becomes easier to decipher, which has allowed archaeologists to read contemporary records and inscriptions.\nThe Akkadian Empire was the first state that successfully united larger parts of Mesopotamia in the 23rd century BC. After the Gutian period, the Ur III kingdom similarly united parts of northern and southern Mesopotamia. It ended in the face of Amorite incursions at the beginning of the second millennium BC. The Amorite \"dynasty of Isin\" persisted until c.\u20091700 BC, when Mesopotamia was united under Babylonian rule.\nUbaid period.\nThe Ubaid period is marked by a distinctive style of fine quality painted pottery which spread throughout Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. The oldest evidence for occupation comes from Tell el-'Oueili, but, given that environmental conditions in southern Mesopotamia were favourable to human occupation well before the Ubaid period, it is likely that older sites exist but have not yet been found. It appears that this culture was derived from the Samarran culture from northern Mesopotamia. It is not known whether or not these were the actual Sumerians who are identified with the later Uruk culture. The story of the passing of the gifts of civilization (\"me\") to Inanna, goddess of Uruk and of love and war, by Enki, god of wisdom and chief god of Eridu, may reflect the transition from Eridu to Uruk.\nUruk period.\nThe archaeological transition from the Ubaid period to the Uruk period is marked by a gradual shift from painted pottery domestically produced on a slow wheel to a great variety of unpainted pottery mass-produced by specialists on fast wheels. The Uruk period is a continuation and an outgrowth of Ubaid with pottery being the main visible change.\nBy the time of the Uruk period, c. 4100\u20132900 BC calibrated, the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of southern Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities, with populations of over 10,000 people, where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labour captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area\u2014from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as western Iran.\nThe Uruk period civilization, exported by Sumerian traders and colonists, like that found at Tell Brak, had an effect on all surrounding peoples, who gradually evolved their own comparable, competing economies and cultures. The cities of Sumer could not maintain remote, long-distance colonies by military force.\nSumerian cities during the Uruk period were probably theocratic and were most likely headed by a priest-king (\"ensi\"), assisted by a council of elders, including both men and women. It is quite possible that the later Sumerian pantheon was modeled upon this political structure. There was little evidence of organized warfare or professional soldiers during the Uruk period, and towns were generally unwalled. During this period Uruk became the most urbanized city in the world, surpassing for the first time 50,000 inhabitants.\nThe ancient Sumerian king list includes the early dynasties of several prominent cities from this period. The first set of names on the list is of kings said to have reigned before a major flood occurred. These early names may be fictional, and include some legendary and mythological figures, such as Alulim and Dumuzid.\nThe end of the Uruk period coincided with the Piora oscillation, a dry period from c. 3200\u20132900 BC that marked the end of a long wetter, warmer climate period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, called the Holocene climatic optimum.\nEarly Dynastic Period.\nThe dynastic period begins c. 2900 BC and was associated with a shift from the temple establishment headed by council of elders led by a priestly \"En\" (a male figure when it was a temple for a goddess, or a female figure when headed by a male god) towards a more secular Lugal (Lu = man, Gal = great) and includes such legendary patriarchal figures as Dumuzid, Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh\u2014who reigned shortly before the historic record opens c. 2900 BC, when the now deciphered syllabic writing started to develop from the early pictograms. The center of Sumerian culture remained in southern Mesopotamia, even though rulers soon began expanding into neighboring areas, and neighboring Semitic groups adopted much of Sumerian culture for their own.\nThe earliest dynastic king on the Sumerian king list whose name is known from any other legendary source is Etana, 13th king of the first dynasty of Kish. The earliest king authenticated through archaeological evidence is Enmebaragesi of Kish (Early Dynastic I), whose name is mentioned in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\"\u2014leading to the suggestion that Gilgamesh himself might have been a historical king of Uruk. As the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" shows, this period was associated with increased war. Cities became walled, and increased in size as undefended villages in southern Mesopotamia disappeared. Both Gilgamesh and one of his predecessors Enmerkar are credited with having built the walls of Uruk.\n1st Dynasty of Lagash.\nThe dynasty of Lagash (c. 2500\u20132270 BC), though omitted from the king list, is well attested through several important monuments and many archaeological finds.\nAlthough short-lived, one of the first empires known to history was that of Eannatum of Lagash, who annexed practically all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror as a matter of policy. Eannatum's Stele of the Vultures depicts vultures pecking at the severed heads and other body parts of his enemies. His empire collapsed shortly after his death.\nLater, Lugal-zage-si, the priest-king of Umma, overthrew the primacy of the Lagash dynasty in the area, then conquered Uruk, making it his capital, and claimed an empire extending from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. He was the last ethnically Sumerian king before Sargon of Akkad.\nAkkadian Empire.\nThe Akkadian Empire dates to c.\u20092334\u20132154 BC (middle chronology), founded by Sargon of Akkad. The Eastern Semitic Akkadian language is first attested in proper names of the kings of Kish c.\u20092800 BC, preserved in later king lists. There are texts written entirely in Old Akkadian dating from c.\u20092500 BC. Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of Sargon of Akkad (c.\u20092334\u20132279 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the Ur III period that followed it.\nAkkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years, but by around 1800 BC, Sumerian was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes. Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a \"Semitic vs. Sumerian\" conflict. It is certain that Akkadian was also briefly imposed on neighboring parts of Elam that were previously conquered, by Sargon.\nGutian period.\nc. 2193\u20132119 BC (middle chronology)\nThe Gutian people were a group of semi nomadic peoples who originated from the Zagros Mountains of northeastern Mesopotamia. The Gutian Dynasty rose to prominence during the decline and fall of Akkadian Empire under poorly understood circumstances. Following the death of Akkad's last powerful ruler, Shar-Kali-Sharri (c. 2218 - 2193 BC), the Gutians gradually took control of Akkadian centers, including the capital Akkad in 2193 BC. The eventual fall of the Akkadian Empire in 2154 BC marked the peak of Gutian strength. There is very little information on the Gutian rulers and people, it is often considered to be a dark age of the Sumerians, an intermediary between the Akkadian Empire and the Third Dynasty of Ur. The Gutian period came to an end with the rise of Utu-hengal of Uruk (c. 2119 - 2112 BC), who defeated the last Gutian king, Tirigan, briefly establishing the short lived 5th dynasty of Uruk. Shortly after, Ur-Nammu of Ur (c. 2112 - 2094 BC) would overthrow Utu-hengal's kingdom and establish the Third Dynasty of Ur in 2112 BC. \n2nd Dynasty of Lagash.\nc.\u20092200\u20132110 BC (middle chronology)\nFollowing the downfall of the Akkadian Empire at the hands of Gutians, another native Sumerian ruler, Gudea of Lagash, rose to local prominence and continued the practices of the Sargonic kings' claims to divinity.\nThe previous Lagash dynasty, Gudea and his descendants also promoted artistic development and left a large number of archaeological artifacts.\nUr III period.\nLater, the Third Dynasty of Ur under Ur-Nammu and Shulgi (c. 2112\u20132004 BC, middle chronology), whose power extended as far as southern Assyria, has been erroneously called a \"Sumerian renaissance\" in the past. Already, the region was becoming more Semitic than Sumerian, with the resurgence of the Akkadian-speaking Semites in Assyria and elsewhere, and the influx of waves of Semitic Martu (Amorites), who founded several competing local powers in the south, including Isin, Larsa, Eshnunna and later, Babylonia.\nThe last of these eventually came to briefly dominate the south of Mesopotamia as the Babylonian Empire, just as the Old Assyrian Empire had already done in the north from the late 21st century BC. The Sumerian language continued as a sacerdotal language taught in schools in Babylonia and Assyria, much as Latin was used in the Medieval period, for as long as cuneiform was used.\nFall and transmission.\nThis period is generally taken to coincide with a major shift in population from southern Mesopotamia toward the north. Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. Soil salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely.\nDuring the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three-fifths. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth, Sumerian remained only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe.\nFollowing an Elamite invasion and sack of Ur during the rule of Ibbi-Sin (c. 2028\u20132004 BC), Sumer came under Amorite rule (taken to introduce the Middle Bronze Age). The independent Amorite states of the 20th to 18th centuries are summarized as the \"Dynasty of Isin\" in the Sumerian king list, ending with the rise of Babylonia under Hammurabi c. 1800 BC.\nLater rulers who dominated Assyria and Babylonia occasionally assumed the old Sargonic title \"King of Sumer and Akkad\", such as Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria after c. 1225 BC.\nPopulation.\nUruk, one of Sumer's largest cities, has been estimated to have had a population of 50,000\u201380,000 at its height. Given the other cities in Sumer, and the large agricultural population, a rough estimate for Sumer's population might be 0.8 million to 1.5 million. The world population at this time has been estimated at 27 million.\nThe Sumerians spoke a language isolate. A number of linguists have claimed to be able to detect a substrate language of unknown classification beneath Sumerian, because names of some of Sumer's major cities are not Sumerian, revealing influences of earlier inhabitants. However, the archaeological record shows clear uninterrupted cultural continuity from the time of the early Ubaid period (5300\u20134700 BC C-14) settlements in southern Mesopotamia. The Sumerian people who settled here, farmed the lands in this region that were made fertile by silt deposited by the Tigris and the Euphrates.\nSome archaeologists have speculated that the original speakers of ancient Sumerian may have been farmers, who moved down from the north of Mesopotamia after perfecting irrigation agriculture there. The Ubaid period pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via Choga Mami transitional ware, to the pottery of the Samarra period culture (c.\u20095700\u20134900 BC C-14) in the north, who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell el-'Oueili near Larsa, excavated by the French in the 1980s, where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. According to this theory, farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control, enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment.\nOthers have suggested a continuity of Sumerians, from the indigenous hunter-fisherfolk traditions, associated with the bifacial assemblages found on the Arabian littoral. Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians may have been the people living in the Persian Gulf region before it flooded at the end of the last Ice Age.\nCulture.\nSocial and family life.\nIn the early Sumerian period, the primitive pictograms suggest that\nThere is considerable evidence concerning Sumerian music. Lyres and flutes were played, among the best-known examples being the Lyres of Ur.\nSumerian culture was male-dominated and stratified. The Code of Ur-Nammu, the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the Ur III, reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late Sumerian law. Beneath the \"lu-gal\" (\"great man\" or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The \"lu\" or free person, and the slave (male, \"arad\"; female \"geme\"). The son of a \"lu\" was called a \"dumu-nita\" until he married. A woman (\"munus\") went from being a daughter (\"dumu-mi\"), to a wife (\"dam\"), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (\"numasu\") and she could then remarry another man who was from the same tribe.\nIn early Sumer women played an important public rule as priestesses. They could also own property, transact business and had their rights protected by the courts. Sons and daughters inherited property on equal terms. The status of women deteriorated in the centuries after 2300 BC. Their right to dispose of their property was limited, and the female deities also lost their former importance.\nInscriptions describing the reforms of king Urukagina of Lagash (c.\u20092350 BC) say that he abolished the former custom of polyandry in his country, prescribing that a woman who took multiple husbands be stoned with rocks upon which her crime had been written.\nMarriages were usually arranged by the parents of the bride and groom; engagements were usually completed through the approval of contracts recorded on clay tablets. These marriages became legal as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to his bride's father. One Sumerian proverb describes the ideal, happy marriage, through the mouth of a husband, who boasts that his wife has borne him eight sons and is still eager to have sex.\nThe Sumerians considered it desirable for women to still be virgins at the time of marriage, but did not expect the same of men, although one author considers premarital sex in general to have been discouraged. Neither Sumerian nor Akkadian had a word exactly corresponding to the English word 'virginity', and the concept was expressed descriptively, for example as \"a/\u00e9-nu-gi4-a\" (Sum.)/\"la naqbat\" (Akk.) 'un-deflowered', or \"gi\u0161 nunzua\", 'never having known a penis'. It is unclear whether terms such as \"\u0161i\u0161itu\" in Akkadian medical texts indicate the hymen, but it appears that the intactness of the hymen was much less relevant to assessing a woman's virginity than in later cultures of the Near East. Most assessments of virginity depended on the woman's own account.\nFrom the earliest records, the Sumerians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex. Their sexual mores were determined not by whether a sexual act was deemed immoral, but rather by whether or not it made a person ritually unclean. The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women, and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and with their partners. The Sumerians did not regard anal sex as taboo either. \"Entu\" priestesses were forbidden from producing offspring and frequently engaged in anal sex as a method of birth control.\nProstitution existed, but it is not clear if sacred prostitution did.\nLanguage and writing.\nThe most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of clay tablets written in cuneiform script. Sumerian writing is considered to be a great milestone in the development of humanity's ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature, both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws.\nAlthough the writing system was first hieroglyphic using ideograms, logosyllabic cuneiform soon followed.\nTriangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the Sumerian language have survived, including personal and business letters, receipts, lexical lists, laws, hymns, prayers, stories, and daily records. Full libraries of clay tablets have been found. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects, like statues or bricks, are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes in training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after Semitic speakers had become dominant.\nA prime example of cuneiform writing is a lengthy poem that was discovered in the ruins of Uruk. The \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" was written in the standard Sumerian cuneiform. It tells of a king from the early Dynastic II period named Gilgamesh or \"Bilgamesh\" in Sumerian. The story relates the fictional adventures of Gilgamesh and his companion, Enkidu. It was laid out on several clay tablets and is thought to be the earliest known surviving example of fictional literature.\nThe Sumerian language is generally regarded as a language isolate in linguistics, because it belongs to no known language family. Akkadian, by contrast, belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other language families. It is an agglutinative language. In other words, morphemes (\"units of meaning\") are added together to create words, unlike analytic languages where morphemes are purely added together to create sentences. Some authors have proposed that there may be evidence of a substratum or adstratum language for geographic features and various crafts and agricultural activities, called variously Proto-Euphratean or Proto Tigrean, but this is disputed by others.\nUnderstanding Sumerian texts today can be problematic. Most difficult are the earliest texts, which in many cases do not give the full grammatical structure of the language and seem to have been used as an \"aide-m\u00e9moire\" for knowledgeable scribes.\nAkkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC. Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Babylonia and Assyria until the 1st century AD.\nReligion.\nThe Sumerians credited their divinities for all matters pertaining to them and exhibited humility in the face of cosmic forces, such as death and divine wrath.\nSumerian religion seems to have been founded upon two separate cosmogenic myths. The first saw creation as the result of a series of \"hieroi gamoi\" or sacred marriages, involving the reconciliation of opposites, postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings, the gods.\nThis pattern continued to influence regional Mesopotamian myths. Thus, in the later Akkadian Enuma Elish, creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water, between male Abzu, and female Tiamat. The products of that union, Lahm and Lahmu, \"the muddy ones\", were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of Enki in Eridu, the first Sumerian city.\nMirroring the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposits its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly resulted in the creation of Anshar and Kishar, the \"sky-pivot\" (or axle), and the \"earth pivot\", parents in turn of Anu (the sky) and Ki (the earth).\nAnother important Sumerian hieros gamos was that between Ki, here known as Ninhursag or \"Lady of the Mountains\", and Enki of Eridu, the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture.\nAt an early stage, following the dawn of recorded history, Nippur, in central Mesopotamia, replaced Eridu in the south as the primary temple city, whose priests exercised political hegemony on the other city-states. Nippur retained this status throughout the Sumerian period.\nDeities.\nSumerians believed in an anthropomorphic polytheism, or the belief in many gods in human form. There was no common set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings. Nonetheless, these were not exclusive; the gods of one city were often acknowledged elsewhere. Sumerian speakers were among the earliest people to record their beliefs in writing, and were a major inspiration in later Mesopotamian mythology, religion, and astrology.\nThe Sumerians worshiped:\nThese deities formed the main pantheon, and in addition to this there were hundreds of other minor gods. Sumerian gods were often associated with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities' political power. The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. The temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture. Citizens had a labor duty to the temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.\nCosmology.\nSumerians envisioned Earth to be a rectangular field with four corners. The Sumerian afterlife involved a descent into a gloomy netherworld to spend eternity in a wretched existence as a Gidim (ghost).\nThe universe was divided into four quarters:\nTheir known world extended from \"The Upper Sea\" or Mediterranean coastline, to \"The Lower Sea\", the Persian Gulf and the land of Meluhha (probably the Indus Valley) and Magan (Oman), famed for its copper ores.\nTemple and temple organisation.\nZiggurats (Sumerian temples) each had an individual name and contained a forecourt with a central pond for purification. The temple itself had a central nave with aisles along either side. Flanking the aisles were rooms for the priests. At one end stood a podium and a mudbrick table for animal and vegetable sacrifices. Granaries and storehouses were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style.\nFunerary practices.\nIt was believed that when people died, they would be confined to a gloomy world of Ereshkigal, whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food. Those who could afford it sought burial at Dilmun. Human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the Ur royal cemetery where Queen Puabi was accompanied in death by her servants.\nAgriculture and hunting.\nThe Sumerians adopted an agricultural lifestyle perhaps as early as c.\u20095000\u20134500 BC. The region demonstrated a number of core agricultural techniques, including organized irrigation, large-scale intensive cultivation of land, monocropping involving the use of plough agriculture, and the use of an agricultural specialized labour force under bureaucratic control. The necessity to manage temple accounts with this organization led to the development of writing (c. 3500 BC).\nIn the early Sumerian Uruk period, the primitive pictograms suggest that sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs were domesticated. They used oxen as their primary beasts of burden and donkeys or equids as their primary transport animal and \"woollen clothing as well as rugs were made from the wool or hair of the animals. ... By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields, and the \"shaduf\" was already employed for the purpose of irrigation. Plants were also grown in pots or vases.\"\nThe Sumerians were one of the first known beer-drinking societies. Cereals were plentiful and were the key ingredient in their early brew. They brewed multiple kinds of beer consisting of wheat, barley, and mixed grain beers. Beer brewing was very important to the Sumerians. It was referenced in the Epic of Gilgamesh when Enkidu was introduced to the food and beer of Gilgamesh's people: \"Drink the beer, as is the custom of the land... He drank the beer-seven jugs! and became expansive and sang with joy!\"\nThe Sumerians practiced similar irrigation techniques as those used in Egypt. American anthropologist Robert McCormick Adams says that irrigation development was associated with urbanization, and that 89% of the population lived in the cities.\nThey grew barley, chickpeas, lentils, wheat, dates, onions, garlic, lettuce, leeks and mustard. Sumerians caught many fish and hunted fowl and gazelle.\nSumerian agriculture depended heavily on irrigation. The irrigation was accomplished by the use of \"shaduf\", canals, channels, dykes, weirs, and reservoirs. The frequent violent floods of the Tigris, and less so, of the Euphrates, meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of silt, and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a corv\u00e9e, although the rich were able to exempt themselves.\nAs is known from the \"Sumerian Farmer's Almanac\", after the flood season and after the Spring equinox and the \"Akitu\" or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they made oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with pickaxes. After drying, they plowed, harrowed, and raked the ground three times, and pulverized it with a mattock, before planting seed. Unfortunately, the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley as their principal crop.\nSumerians harvested during the spring in three-person teams consisting of a reaper, a binder, and a sheaf handler. The farmers would use threshing wagons, driven by oxen, to separate the cereal heads from the stalks and then use threshing sleds to disengage the grain. They then winnowed the grain/chaff mixture.\nArt.\nThe Sumerians were great artists. Sumerian artefacts show great detail and ornamentation, with fine semi-precious stones imported from other lands, such as lapis lazuli, marble, and diorite, and precious metals like hammered gold, incorporated into the design. Since stone was rare it was reserved for sculpture. The most widespread material in Sumer was clay, as a result many Sumerian objects are made of clay. Metals such as gold, silver, copper, and bronze, along with shells and gemstones, were used for the finest sculptures and inlays. Small stones of all kinds, including more precious stones such as lapis lazuli, alabaster, and serpentine, were used for cylinder seals.\nSome of the most famous masterpieces are the Lyres of Ur, which are considered to be the world's oldest surviving stringed instruments. They were discovered by Leonard Woolley when the Royal Cemetery of Ur was excavated between 1922 and 1934.\nArchitecture.\nThe Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex mudbrick, not fixed with mortar or cement. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as tells, are found throughout the ancient Near East.\nAccording to Archibald Sayce, the primitive pictograms of the early Sumerian (i.e. Uruk) era suggest that \"Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. The foundation stones\u2014or rather bricks\u2014of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them.\"\nThe most impressive and famous of Sumerian buildings are the ziggurats, large layered platforms that supported temples. Sumerian cylinder seals also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE. The Sumerians also developed the arch, which enabled them to develop a strong type of dome. They built this by constructing and linking several arches. Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as buttresses, recesses, half columns, and clay nails.\nMathematics.\nThe Sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. The period c. 2700\u20132300 BC saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.\nEconomy and trade.\nDiscoveries of obsidian from far-away locations in Anatolia and lapis lazuli from Badakhshan in northeastern Afghanistan, beads from Dilmun (modern Bahrain), and several seals inscribed with the Indus Valley script suggest a remarkably wide-ranging network of ancient trade centered on the Persian Gulf. For example, Imports to Ur came from many parts of the world. In particular, the metals of all types had to be imported.\nThe \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" refers to trade with far lands for goods, such as wood, that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, cedar from Lebanon was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen Puabi at Ur, indicates it was traded from as far away as Mozambique.\nThe Sumerians used slaves, although they were not a major part of the economy. Slave women worked as weavers, pressers, millers, and porters.\nSumerian potters decorated pots with cedar oil paints. The potters used a bow drill to produce the fire needed for baking the pottery. Sumerian masons and jewelers knew and made use of alabaster (calcite), ivory, iron, gold, silver, carnelian, and lapis lazuli.\nTrade with the Indus valley.\nEvidence for imports from the Indus to Ur can be found from around 2350 BC. Various objects made with shell species that are characteristic of the Indus coast, particularly \"Turbinella pyrum\" and \"Pleuroploca trapezium\", have been found in the archaeological sites of Mesopotamia dating from around 2500\u20132000 BC. Carnelian beads from the Indus were found in the Sumerian tombs of Ur, the Royal Cemetery at Ur, dating to 2600\u20132450. In particular, carnelian beads with an etched design in white were probably imported from the Indus Valley, and made according to a technique of acid-etching developed by the Harappans. Lapis lazuli was imported in great quantity by Egypt, and already used in many tombs of the Naqada II period (c. 3200 BC). Lapis lazuli probably originated in northern Afghanistan, as no other sources are known, and had to be transported across the Iranian plateau to Mesopotamia, and then Egypt.\nSeveral Indus seals with Harappan script have also been found in Mesopotamia, particularly in Ur, Babylon and Kish.\nGudea, the ruler of the Neo-Sumerian Empire at Lagash, is recorded as having imported \"translucent carnelian\" from Meluhha, generally thought to be the Indus Valley area. Various inscriptions also mention the presence of Meluhha traders and interpreters in Mesopotamia. About twenty seals have been found from the Akkadian and Ur III sites, that have connections with Harappa and often use Harappan symbols or writing.\nThe Indus Valley Civilization only flourished in its most developed form between 2400 and 1800 BC, but at the time of these exchanges, it was a much larger entity than the Mesopotamian civilization, covering an area of 1.2 million square kilometers with thousands of settlements, compared to an area of only about 65.000 square kilometers for the occupied area of Mesopotamia, while the largest cities were comparable in size at about 30\u201340,000 inhabitants.\nMoney and credit.\nLarge institutions kept their accounts in barley and silver, often with a fixed rate between them. The obligations, loans and prices in general were usually denominated in one of them. Many transactions involved debt, for example goods consigned to merchants by temple and beer advanced by \"ale women\".\nCommercial credit and agricultural consumer loans were the main types of loans. The trade credit was usually extended by temples in order to finance trade expeditions and was nominated in silver. The interest rate was set at 1/60 a month (one shekel per mina) some time before 2000 BC and it remained at that level for about two thousand years.\nRural loans commonly arose as a result of unpaid obligations due to an institution (such as a temple), in this case the arrears were considered to be lent to the debtor. They were denominated in barley or other crops and the interest rate was typically much higher than for commercial loans and could amount to 1/3 to 1/2 of the loan principal.\nPeriodically, rulers signed \"clean slate\" decrees that cancelled all the rural (but not commercial) debt and allowed bondservants to return to their homes. Customarily, rulers did it at the beginning of the first full year of their reign, but they could also be proclaimed at times of military conflict or crop failure. The first known ones were made by Enmetena and Urukagina of Lagash in 2400\u20132350 BC. According to Hudson, the purpose of these decrees was to prevent debts mounting to a degree that they threatened the fighting force, which could happen if peasants lost their subsistence land or became bondservants due to inability to repay their debt.\nMilitary.\nThe almost constant wars among the Sumerian city-states for 2000 years helped to develop the military technology and techniques of Sumer to a high level. The first war recorded in any detail was between Lagash and Umma in c. 2450 BC on a stele called the Stele of the Vultures. It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry. The infantry carried spears, wore copper helmets, and carried rectangular shields. The spearmen are shown arranged in what resembles the phalanx formation, which requires training and discipline; this implies that the Sumerians may have used professional soldiers.\nThe Sumerian military used carts harnessed to onagers. These early chariots functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and lances. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-wheeled device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a woven basket and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.\nSumerian cities were surrounded by defensive walls. The Sumerians engaged in siege warfare between their cities, but the mudbrick walls were able to deter some foes.\nTechnology.\nExamples of Sumerian technology include: the wheel, cuneiform script, arithmetic and geometry, irrigation systems, Sumerian boats, lunisolar calendar, bronze, leather, saws, chisels, hammers, braces, bits, nails, pins, rings, hoes, axes, knives, lancepoints, arrowheads, swords, glue, daggers, waterskins, bags, harnesses, armor, quivers, war chariots, scabbards, boots, sandals, harpoons and beer.\nThe Sumerians had three main types of boats:\nLegacy.\nEvidence of wheeled vehicles appeared in the mid-4th millennium BC, near-simultaneously in Mesopotamia, the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe. The wheel initially took the form of the potter's wheel. The new concept led to wheeled vehicles and mill wheels. The Sumerians' cuneiform script is the oldest (or second oldest after the Egyptian hieroglyphs) which has been deciphered (the status of even older inscriptions such as the Jiahu symbols and Tartaria tablets is controversial). The Sumerians were among the first astronomers, mapping the stars into sets of constellations, many of which survived in the zodiac and were also recognized by the ancient Greeks. They were also aware of the five planets that are easily visible to the naked eye.\nThey invented and developed arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6. This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry, cavalry, and archers. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records.\nThe first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state's primary temple.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a type of melanocytic tumor that contains nevus cells. A mole can be either subdermal (under the skin) or a pigmented growth on the skin, formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte. The high concentration of the body's pigmenting agent, melanin, is responsible for their dark color. Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi (singular \"nevus\"), occurring commonly in humans. Some sources equate the term \"mole\" with \"melanocytic nevus\", but there are also sources that equate the term \"mole\" with any nevus form.\nThe majority of moles appear during the first 2 decades of a person's life, with about 1 in every 100 babies being born with moles. Acquired moles are a form of benign neoplasm, while congenital moles, or congenital nevi, are considered a minor malformation or hamartoma and may be at a higher risk for melanoma.\nSigns and symptoms.\nAccording to the American Academy of Dermatology, the most common types of moles are skin tags, raised moles, and flat moles. Benign moles are usually brown, tan, pink, or black (the latter especially on dark-colored skin). They are circular or oval and are usually small (commonly between 1\u20133 mm), though some can be larger than the size of a typical pencil eraser (&gt;5 mm). Some moles produce dark, coarse hair. Common mole hair removal procedures include plucking, cosmetic waxing, electrolysis, threading, and cauterization.\nAging.\nMoles tend to appear during early childhood and during the first 30 years of life. They may change slowly, becoming raised, changing color, or gradually fading. Most people have between 30 and 40 moles, but some have as many as 600.\nThe number of moles a person has was found to have a correlation with telomere length. However, the relation between telomeres and aging remains uncertain.\nComplications.\nThe American Academy of Dermatology says that the vast majority of moles are benign. Data on the chances of transformation from melanocytic nevus to melanoma are controversial, but it appears that about 10% of melanomas have a precursor lesion, of which about 10% are melanocytic nevi. Therefore, it appears that melanoma quite seldom (1% of cases) has a melanocytic nevus as a precursor.\nCause.\nThe cause of this condition is not clearly understood, but it is thought to result from a defect in embryologic development during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The defect is thought to cause a proliferation of melanocytes, the cells responsible for normal skin color. When melanocytes are produced at an extremely rapid rate, they form in clusters instead of spreading out evenly, resulting in abnormal skin pigmentation in some areas of the body.\nGenetics.\nGenes can influence a person's moles. Dysplastic nevus syndrome is a largely hereditary condition that causes a person to have a large quantity of moles (often 100 or more), with some larger than normal or atypical. This often leads to a higher risk of melanoma, a serious type of skin cancer. Dysplastic nevi are more likely than ordinary moles to become cancerous. While dysplastic nevi are common, and many people have a few of these abnormal moles, having more than 50 ordinary moles also increases the risk of developing melanoma.\nIn the general population, a slight majority of melanomas do not form in existing moles but rather create new growths on the skin. Somewhat surprisingly, this pattern also applies to those with dysplastic nevi. These individuals are at a higher risk of melanoma occurring not only where there is an existing mole but also in areas without moles. Consequently, such persons need regular examinations to check for changes in their moles and to identify any new ones.\nSunlight.\nUltraviolet (UV) light from the sun causes premature ageing of the skin and skin damage that can lead to melanoma. Researchers hypothesized that overexposure to UV, including excessive sunlight, may play a role in the formation of acquired moles. However, more research is needed to determine the complex interaction between genetic makeup and overall UV exposure. Some strong indications supporting this hypothesis (but falling short of proof) include:\nStudies have found that sunburns and excessive sun exposure can increase risk factors for melanoma. This is in addition to the higher risk already faced by individuals with dysplastic nevi (the uncertainty is regarding acquiring benign moles). To prevent and reduce the risk of melanoma caused by UV radiation, the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute recommend:\nDiagnosis.\nClinical diagnosis can be made with the naked eye using the ABCD guideline or by using dermatoscopy. An online-screening test is also available to help screen out benign moles.\nClassification.\nMelanocytic nevi can mainly be classified by depth, being congenital versus acquired, and/or specific dermatoscopic or histopathologic patterns:\nSpecific dermatoscopic or histopathologic patterns \nRecurrent nevus: Any incompletely removed nevus with residual melanocytes left in the surgical wound. It creates a dilemma for the patient and physician, as these scars cannot be distinguished from a melanoma.\nDifferentiation from melanoma.\nIt often requires a dermatologist to fully evaluate moles. For instance, a small blue or bluish-black spot, often called a blue nevus, is usually benign but often mistaken for melanoma. Conversely, a junctional nevus, which develops at the junction of the dermis and epidermis, is potentially cancerous.\nA basic approach to evaluating suspicious moles is found in the mnemonic A-B-C-D, used by institutions such as the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The letters stand for Asymmetry, Border, Color, and Diameter. Sometimes, the letter E (for Elevation or Evolving) is added. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, if a mole starts changing in size, color, shape or, especially, if the border of a mole develops ragged edges or becomes larger than a pencil eraser, it would be an appropriate time to consult with a physician. Other warning signs include a mole, even if smaller than a pencil eraser, that is different from the others and begins to crust over, bleed, itch, or become inflamed. Such changes may indicate the development of melanomas. \nAnother method of melanoma detection is the \"ugly duckling sign\". It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective in detecting melanoma. Simply, correlation of common characteristics of a person's skin lesion is made. Lesions which greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled as an \"ugly duckling\", and further professional exam is required. The \"little red riding hood sign\", suggests that individuals with fair skin and light colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose melanomas.\nExtra care and caution should be rendered when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi. A dermatoscope must be used to detect \"ugly ducklings\", as many melanomas in these individuals resemble non-melanomas or are considered to be \"wolves in sheep's clothing\". These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas, which will not present easy-to-observe color changes and variation in colors. The borders of these amelanotic melanomas are often indistinct, making visual identification without a dermatoscope very difficult.\nPeople with a personal or family history of skin cancer or of dysplastic nevus syndrome (multiple atypical moles) should see a dermatologist at least once a year to be sure they are not developing melanoma.\nManagement.\nFirst, a diagnosis must be made. If the lesion is suspected to be skin cancer, a skin biopsy may be done before considering removal. Alternatively, an excisional biopsy with complete removal of the lesion may be done. Other reasons for removal may be cosmetic or because a raised mole interferes with daily life (e.g., shaving).\nIf a melanocytic nevus is suspected of being a melanoma, it needs to be sampled or removed via skin biopsy, and sent for microscopic evaluation by a pathologist. Depending on the size and location of the original nevus, a complete excisional skin biopsy or a punch skin biopsy can be done. Removal can also occur by shaving. Shaving leaves a red mark on the site but changes to the patient's usual skin color in about 2 weeks. However, there might still be a risk of spread of the melanoma, so the methods of melanoma diagnosis, including excisional biopsy, are still recommended even in these instances. Moles can also be removed by laser, surgery, or electrocautery.\nMedical lasers can be used to remove flat moles (those level with the surface of the skin), as well as some raised moles, leaving a scab. Some dermatologists think lasers are not the best method for removing moles because the laser only cauterizes or, in certain cases, removes very superficial levels of skin. Moles tend to go deeper into the skin than non-invasive lasers can penetrate. A second concern about laser treatment is that if the lesion is a melanoma and was misdiagnosed as a benign mole, the procedure might delay diagnosis. If the mole is incompletely removed by the laser, and the pigmented lesion regrows, it might form a recurrent nevus.\nFor surgery, many dermatologic and plastic surgeons first use a freezing solution, usually liquid nitrogen, on a raised mole and then shave it away with a scalpel. If the surgeon opts for the shaving method, they usually also cauterize the stump. However, freezing should not be done to a nevus suspected to be a melanoma, as the ice crystals can cause pathological changes called \"freezing artifacts\" which might interfere with the diagnosis of the melanoma.\nElectrocautery is a procedure that uses an electrical current to burn moles, skin tags, and warts off the skin. Electric currents are set to a level such that they only reach the outermost layers of the skin, thus reducing the problem of scarring. Approximately 1\u20133 treatments may be needed to completely remove a mole. Typically, a local anesthetic is applied to the treated skin area before beginning the mole removal procedure.\nMole removal risks.\nThe risks associated with mole removal vary depending on the method employed (e.g., surgical excision, shave removal, or laser therapy). In general, patients may experience mild postoperative discomfort, which is typically manageable with over-the-counter analgesics. Localized redness and the formation of a scab are also common but usually resolve within 1\u20132 weeks as the wound heals. Third, similar to other surgeries, there is also risk of infection, bleeding, allergic reactions to anesthesia, or even nerve damage. Lastly, the mole removal may leave an uncomfortable scar depending on the mole's size.\nSociety and culture.\n Throughout much of human history, individuals with facial moles were often subject to ridicule, superstition, and stigma. Far from being viewed as marks of beauty, facial moles were commonly associated with negative imagery and folklore. In particular, moles located on the nose, cheeks, or chin were frequently linked to witches or other undesirable creatures, reflecting cultural beliefs that cast them as disfiguring or ominous growths rather than natural features.\nDuring the Salem witch trials, warts and other dermatological lesions such as moles, scars, and other blemishes found on accused women were considered evidence of a pact with the devil.\nFace mole reading.\nIn traditional Chinese culture, facial moles are used in divination or fortune telling (moleomancy). Moles that can be easily seen may be considered warnings or reminders, while hidden moles may symbolize good luck and fortune. Furthermore, traditional Chinese culture holds that each facial mole indicates the presence of a corresponding mole on another part of the body. For instance, if a mole is present around the mouth, a corresponding mole should be found in the pubic region.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50526", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50526", "title": "Robert Walpole", "text": "Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742\nRobert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford (; 26 August 1676 \u2013 18 March 1745), known between 1725 and 1742 as Sir Robert Walpole, was a British Whig statesman who is generally regarded as the \"de facto\" first Prime Minister of Great Britain, serving from 1721 to 1742. His formal titles included First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons.\nAlthough the exact dates of Walpole's dominance, dubbed the \"Robinocracy\", are a matter of scholarly debate, the period 1721\u20131742 is often used. He dominated the Walpole\u2013Townshend ministry, as well as the subsequent Walpole ministry, and holds the record as the longest-serving British prime minister. W. A. Speck wrote that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20\u00a0years as prime minister \"is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history.\u00a0Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons\".\nWalpole was a Whig from the gentry class who was first elected to Parliament in 1701 and held many senior positions. He was a country squire and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian F.\u00a0O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his \"reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence\". Julian Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation, he worked for peace, lower taxes and growing exports, and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He mostly avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps; his appointment to Chancellor of the Exchequer after the South Sea Bubble stock-market crisis drew attention to perceived protection of political allies by Walpole.\nHistorian H. T. Dickinson sums up his historical role by saying that \"Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history. He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the Glorious Revolution (1688). He established stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament.\" Some scholars rank him highly among British prime ministers.\nEarly life.\nWalpole was born in Houghton, Norfolk, in 1676. One of 19\u00a0children, he was the third son and fifth child of Robert Walpole, a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of Castle Rising in the House of Commons. His wife Mary Burwell was the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of Rougham, Suffolk. Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole, was his younger brother.\nAs a child, Walpole attended a private school at Massingham, Norfolk. Walpole entered Eton College in 1690 where he was a King's Scholar. He left Eton on 2\u00a0April 1696 and matriculated at King's College, Cambridge, on the same day. On 25\u00a0May 1698, he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining older brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November\u00a01700 his father died, and Robert succeeded to inherit the Walpole estate. A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9\u00a0June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.\nEarly career.\nPolitical career.\nWalpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the English general election at Castle Rising in Norfolk. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of King's Lynn, a pocket borough that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career. Voters and politicians nicknamed him \"Robin\".\nLike his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the Whig Party. In 1705, Walpole was appointed by Queen Anne to be a member of the council for her husband, Prince George of Denmark, Lord High Admiral. After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by Lord Godolphin (the Lord High Treasurer and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of Secretary at War in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of Treasurer of the Navy.\nDespite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell, a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the Sacheverell riots, and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory Robert Harley, removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711. Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition. He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.\nIn 1712, Walpole was accused of venality and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced \"guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption\". He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the House of Lords; he was then imprisoned in the Tower of London for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir Richard Steele in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713.\nStanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry.\nQueen Anne died in 1714. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was succeeded by her second cousin, the Elector of Hanover, George I. George I distrusted the Tories, who he believed opposed his right to succeed to the throne. The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years. Robert Walpole became a Privy Councillor and rose to the position of Paymaster of the Forces in a Cabinet nominally led by Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, but actually dominated by Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend (Walpole's brother-in-law), and James Stanhope (later 1st Earl Stanhope). Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, was impeached, and Henry St\u00a0John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, suffered from an act of attainder, the Attainder of Viscount Bolingbroke Act 1714 (1 Geo. 1. St. 2. c. 16).\nHalifax, the titular head of the administration, died in 1715 and by 1716 Walpole was appointed to the posts of First Commissioner (Lord) of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was a member of the \"Board of General Officers\" established in 1717 to investigate the abuse of pay. Walpole's fellow members, appointed by the Prince of Wales (later George\u00a0II), included William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath, Secretary at War; General Henry Lumley; General Thomas Erle; and Sir Philip Meadowes, Controller of the Army and Knight Marshal of the King's Palace,\nwhose daughter, Mary Meadows, was maid-of-honour to Walpole's friend, Queen Caroline. A keen huntsman, Walpole built for himself Great Lodge (Old Lodge) in Richmond Park. Philip Medows, the deputy ranger of the park and son of Walpole's political ally, Sir Philip Meadowes, lived at Great Lodge after Walpole had vacated it.\nIn his new political positions, and encouraged by his advisers, Walpole introduced the sinking fund, a device to reduce the national debt. The Cabinet of which he was a member was often divided over most important issues. Normally, Walpole and Townshend were on one side, with Stanhope and Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland on the other. Foreign policy was the primary issue of contention; George I was thought to be conducting foreign affairs with the interests of his German territories, rather than those of Great Britain, at heart. The Stanhope\u2013Sunderland faction, however, had the King's support. In 1716 Townshend had been removed from the important post of Northern Secretary and put in the lesser office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\nEven this change did not appease Stanhope and Sunderland, who secured the dismissal of Townshend from the Lord-Lieutenancy in April 1717. On the next day, Walpole resigned from the Cabinet to join the Opposition \"because I could not connive at some things that were carrying on\", and by joining the opposition he did not intend \"to make the king uneasy or to embarrass his affairs.\" This began the Whig Split, dividing the dominant party for three years. In the new Cabinet, Sunderland and Stanhope (who was created an Earl) were the effective heads. Walpole reversed his earlier support for the impeachment of Robert Harley, the former first minister, and joined with the Tory opposition in securing an acquittal in July\u00a01717.\nSoon after Walpole's resignation, a bitter family quarrel between the King and the Prince of Wales, split the royal family. Walpole and others who opposed the Government often congregated at Leicester House, the home of the Prince of Wales, to form political plans.\nWalpole also became an adviser and close friend of the Prince of Wales's wife, Caroline. In 1720 he improved his position by bringing about a reconciliation between the Prince of Wales and the King.\nWalpole continued to be an influential figure in the House of Commons. He was especially active in opposing one of the Government's more significant proposals, the Peerage Bill, which would have limited the power of the monarch to create new peerages. Walpole brought about a temporary abandonment of the bill in 1719 and the outright rejection of the bill by the House of Commons. This defeat led Stanhope and Sunderland to reconcile with their opponents; Walpole returned as Paymaster of the Forces and Townshend was appointed Lord President of the Council. By accepting the position of Paymaster, however, Walpole lost the favour of the Prince of Wales (the future King George II), who still harboured disdain for his father's Government.\nPremiership (1721\u20131742).\nSoon after Walpole returned to the Cabinet, Britain was swept by a wave of over-enthusiastic speculation which led to the South Sea Bubble. The Government had established a plan whereby the South Sea Company would assume the national debt of Great Britain in exchange for lucrative bonds. It was widely believed that the company would eventually reap an enormous profit through international trade in cloth, agricultural goods, and slaves. Many in the country, including Walpole himself, frenziedly invested in the company. By the latter part of 1720, however, the company had begun to collapse as the price of its shares plunged. In 1721 a committee investigated the scandal, finding that there was corruption on the part of many in the Cabinet. Among those implicated were John Aislabie (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), James Craggs the Elder (the Postmaster General), James Craggs the Younger (the Southern Secretary), and even Lords Stanhope and Sunderland (the heads of the Ministry). Both Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger died in disgrace; the remainder were impeached for their corruption. Aislabie was found guilty and imprisoned, but the personal influence of Walpole saved both Stanhope and Sunderland. For his role in preventing these individuals and others from being punished, Walpole gained the nickname of \"The Screen\",\nor \"Screenmaster-General\".\nThe resignation of Sunderland and the death of Stanhope in 1721 left Walpole as the most important figure in the administration. On 3 April 1721 he was appointed First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons. Walpole's \"de facto\" tenure as \"prime minister\" is often dated to his appointment as First Lord of the Treasury in 1721, though he himself rejected that title (it was originally a term of abuse), stating in 1741: \"I unequivocally deny that I am sole and prime minister.\" His brother-in-law Lord Townshend served as Secretary of State for the Northern Department and controlled the nation's foreign affairs. The two also had to contend with the Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Lord Carteret. Townshend and Walpole were thus restored to power and \"annihilated the opposing faction\".\nFirst term.\nUnder the guidance of Walpole, Parliament attempted to deal with the financial crisis brought on by the South Sea Bubble. The estates of the directors of the South Sea Company were used to relieve the suffering of the victims, and the stock of the company was divided between the Bank of England and East India Company. The crisis had gravely damaged the credibility of the King and of the Whig Party, but Walpole defended both with skilful oratory in the House of Commons.\nWalpole's first year as prime minister was also marked by the discovery of a plot formed by Francis Atterbury, the bishop of Rochester. The exposure of the scheme crushed the hopes of the Jacobites whose previous attempts at rebellion (most notably the risings of 1715 and 1719) had also failed. The Tory Party was equally unfortunate even though Lord Bolingbroke, a Tory leader who fled to France to avoid punishment for his Jacobite sympathies, was permitted to return to Britain in 1723.\nDuring the remainder of George I's reign, Walpole's ascendancy continued; the political power of the monarch was gradually diminishing and that of his ministers gradually increasing. In 1724 the primary political rival of Walpole and Townshend in the Cabinet, Lord Carteret, was dismissed from the post of Southern Secretary and once again appointed to the lesser office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In Ireland, Lord Carteret used his power to secretly aid in the controversy over Wood's Halfpence and support \"Drapier's Letters\" behind the scenes and cause harm to Walpole's power. Walpole was able to recover from these events by removing the patent. However, Irish sentiment was situated against the English control.\nTownshend, working with the King, helped keep Great Britain at peace, especially by negotiating a defensive alliance with France and Prussia in 1725. Walpole was not consulted and stated that Townshend was \"too precipitate\" in his actions. Great Britain, free from Jacobite threats, from war, and from financial crises, grew prosperous, and Robert Walpole acquired the favour of George I. In 1725 he persuaded the King to revive the Order of the Bath and was himself invested with it, and in 1726 was made a Knight of the Garter, earning him the nickname \"Sir Bluestring\". His eldest son was granted a barony.\nSecond term.\nWalpole's position was threatened in 1727 when George I died and was succeeded by George II. For a few days it seemed that Walpole would be dismissed but, on the advice of Queen Caroline, the King agreed to keep him in office. Although the King disliked Townshend, he retained him as well. Over the next years Walpole continued to share power with Townshend but the two clashed over British foreign affairs, especially over policy regarding Austria. Gradually Walpole became the clearly dominant partner in government. His colleague retired on 15 May 1730 and this date is sometimes given as the beginning of Walpole's unofficial tenure as prime minister. Townshend's departure enabled Walpole to conclude the Treaty of Vienna, creating the Anglo-Austrian alliance.\nOpposition.\nWalpole, a polarising figure, had many opponents, the most important of whom were in the Country Party, such as Lord Bolingbroke (who had been his political enemy since the days of Queen Anne) and William Pulteney (a capable Whig statesman who felt snubbed when Walpole failed to include him in the Cabinet). Bolingbroke and Pulteney ran a periodical called \"The Craftsman\" in which they incessantly denounced the Prime Minister's policies. Walpole was also satirised and parodied extensively; he was often compared to the criminal Jonathan Wild as, for example, John Gay did in his farcical \"The Beggar's Opera\". Walpole's other enemies included Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Henry Fielding, and Samuel Johnson.\nSupport.\nWalpole secured the support of the people and of the House of Commons with a policy of avoiding war. He used his influence to prevent George II from entering the War of the Polish Succession in 1733, because it was a dispute between the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. He boasted, \"There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.\" By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes. He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates. He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s in 1732. His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers. Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on them. By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint. The joke backfired in 1733 when he was defeated in a major battle to impose excise taxes on wine and tobacco. To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation's merchants. Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it, but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place. Thus, Walpole lost a considerable element of his Whig Party to the Opposition.\nAfter the general elections of 1734, Walpole's supporters still formed a majority in the House of Commons although they were less numerous than before. He maintained both his parliamentary supremacy and his popularity in Norfolk, his home county. In May\u00a01734, he presented a new silver mace \"weighing 168\u00a0ounces, gilt, and finely exchased, to the city of Norwich \u2013 on the cup part of it are Sir Robert's arms, and the arms of the city; it was first carried before Mayor Philip Meadows\u00a0Esq. on the 29th of May\". However, despite these great occasions, Walpole's broader popularity had begun to wane. In 1736 an increase in the tax on gin inspired riots in London. The even more serious Porteous riots broke out in Edinburgh after the King pardoned a captain of the guard (John Porteous) who had commanded his troops to shoot a group of protesters. Though these events diminished Walpole's popularity, they failed to shake his majority in Parliament. Walpole's domination over the House of Commons was highlighted by the ease with which he secured the rejection of Sir John Barnard's plan to reduce the interest on the national debt. Walpole was also able to persuade Parliament to pass the Licensing Act 1737 under which London theatres were regulated. The act revealed a disdain for Swift, Pope, Fielding, and other literary figures who had attacked his government in their works.\nWhile the \"country party\" attacked Walpole relentlessly, he subsidised writers and lesser-known journalists such as William Arnall and Bishop Benjamin Hoadly as well as two men he named to the role of poet laureate, Laurence Eusden and Colley Cibber. They defended Walpole from the charge of evil political corruption by arguing that corruption is the universal human condition. Furthermore, they argued, political divisiveness was also universal and inevitable because of selfish passions that were integral to human nature. Arnall argued that government must be strong enough to control conflict, and in that regard, Walpole was quite successful. This style of \"court\" political rhetoric continued through the 18th\u00a0century.\nDecline.\nThe year 1737 saw the death of Walpole's close friend Queen Caroline. Though her death did not end his personal influence with George\u00a0II, who had grown loyal to the Prime Minister during the preceding years, Walpole's domination of government continued to decline. His opponents acquired a vocal leader in Frederick, Prince of Wales who was estranged from his father, the King. Several young politicians including William Pitt the Elder and George Grenville formed a faction known as the \"Patriot Boys\" and joined the Prince of Wales in opposition.\nWalpole's failure to maintain a policy of avoiding military conflict eventually led to his fall from power. Under the Treaty of Seville (1729), Great Britain agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies in North America. Spain claimed the right to board and search British vessels to ensure compliance with this provision. Disputes, however, broke out over trade with the West Indies. Walpole attempted to prevent war but was opposed by the King, the House of Commons, and by a faction in his own Cabinet. In 1739 Walpole abandoned all efforts to stop the conflict and commenced the War of Jenkins' Ear (so called because Robert Jenkins, a Welsh mariner, claimed that a Spaniard inspecting his vessel had severed his ear).\nWalpole's influence continued to dramatically decline even after the war began. In the 1741 general election his supporters secured an increase in votes in constituencies that were decided by mass electorates but failed to win in many pocket boroughs (constituencies subject to the informal but strong influence of patrons). In general, the government made gains in England and Wales but this was not enough to overturn the reverses of the 1734 election and further losses in Cornwall where many constituencies were obedient to the will of the Prince of Wales (who was also Duke of Cornwall). These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland. Walpole's new majority was difficult to determine because of the uncertain loyalties of many new members, but contemporaries and historians estimated it as low as fourteen to eighteen.\nIn the new Parliament, many Whigs thought the ageing Prime Minister incapable of leading the military campaign. Moreover, his majority was not as strong as it had formerly been, his detractors \u2013 such as William Pulteney, Earl of Bath, and Lord Perceval \u2013 being approximately as numerous as his supporters. Behind these political enemies were opposition Whigs, Tories and Jacobites. Walpole was alleged to have presided over an immense increase in corruption and to have enriched himself enormously whilst in office. Parliamentary committees were formed to investigate these charges. In 1742 when the House of Commons was prepared to determine the validity of a by-election in Chippenham, Walpole and others agreed to treat the issue as a motion of no confidence. As Walpole was defeated on the vote, he agreed to resign from the Government. The news of the naval disaster against Spain in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias also prompted the end of his political career. King George\u00a0II wept on his resignation and begged to see him frequently. As part of his resignation the King agreed to elevate him to the House of Lords as the Earl of Orford, Viscount Walpole and Baron Walpole of Houghton in the County of Norfolk, this occurred on 6 February 1742. Five days later he formally relinquished the seals of office.(phttps://)\nAlthough no longer First Lord of the Treasury, Walpole remained politically involved as an advisor. His former colleagues were still pleased to see him, perhaps in part because he retained the King's favour. After his resignation, his main political roles were to support the government by means of advice, to dole out some patronage and to speak on the ministry's behalf in the Lords.\nLater life.\nLord Orford was succeeded as prime minister by Lord Wilmington in an administration whose true head was Lord Carteret. A committee was created to inquire into Walpole's ministry but no substantial evidence of wrongdoing or corruption was discovered. Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the \"Minister behind the Curtain\" for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of Henry Pelham whom he regarded as a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He advised Pelham to make use of his seat in the Commons to serve as a bridge between the King and Parliament, just as Walpole had done.\nDuring this time, Walpole also made two interventions in the Lords. The first was in January 1744 in the debate on Hanoverian troops being kept in British pay. Walpole prevented them from losing the troops. In his second intervention, Walpole, with fear of a Jacobite-inspired invasion in February 1744, made a speech on the situation. Frederick, Prince of Wales, usually hostile to Walpole, warmly received him at his court the next day, most likely because his father's throne, and the future of the whole Hanoverian dynasty, was at risk from the Stuart Pretender.\nAlong with his political interests in his last years, Walpole enjoyed the pleasures of the hunt. Back at his recently rebuilt country seat in Houghton, Norfolk, such pastimes were denied him due to \"dismal weather\". He also enjoyed the beauties of the countryside. His art collection gave him particular pleasure. He had spent much money in the 1720s and 1730s in building up a collection of Old Masters from all over Europe. Walpole also concerned himself with estate matters.\nHis health, never good, deteriorated rapidly toward the end of 1744. Walpole died in London on 18 March 1745 from a bladder stone, aged 68 years, and was buried at the Church of St Martin at Tours on the Houghton Hall estate. His earldom passed to his eldest son, also called Robert, who was in turn succeeded by his only son George. Upon the death of the third Earl, the earldom was inherited by the first Earl's younger son Horace Walpole, who is now remembered for his many thousands of insightful letters, published in 48\u00a0volumes by Yale University Press. The title died with him in 1797.\nLegacy.\nWalpole exercised a tremendous influence on the politics of his day. The Tories became a minor insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified constitution of Great Britain was less momentous, even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first prime minister. He relied primarily on the favour of the King, rather than the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak. It would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.\nWalpole's strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country's prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the Hanoverian dynasty, and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat ended, soon after Walpole's term ended, with the defeat of the rebellion of 1745. Later in the century, the Whig MP Edmund Burke \"admitted him into the whig pantheon\". Burke wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was an honorable man and a sound Whig. He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. ... With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours [\"sic\"] by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.\nPhilip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield expressed scepticism as to whether \"an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both\". Chesterfield claimed he was \"much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In private life he was good natured, chearfull, social. Inelegant in his manners, loose in his morals. He had a coarse wit, which he was too free of for a man in his station, as it is always inconsistent with dignity. He was very able as a Minister, but without a certain elevation of mind ... He was both the ablest Parliament man, and the ablest manager of a Parliament, that I believe ever lived ... Money, not prerogative, was the chief engine of his administration, and he employed it with a success that in a manner disgraced humanity ... When he found any body proof, against pecuniary temptations, which alass! was but seldom, he had recourse to still a worse art. For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of publick virtue, and the love of one's country, calling them the \"chimerical school boy flights of classical learning\"; declaring himself at the same time, \"no Saint, no Spartan, no reformer\". He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, \"well are you to be an old Roman? a patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser\". And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart. ... His name will not be recorded in history among the best men, or the best Ministers, but much much less ought it to be ranked among the worst.\n10 Downing Street represents another part of Walpole's legacy. George\u00a0II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732, but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22\u00a0September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number\u00a010 (preferring their larger private residences), but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the prime minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).\nWalpole has attracted attention from heterodox economists as a pioneer of protectionist policies, in the form of tariffs and subsidies to woollen manufacturers. As a result, the industry became Britain's primary export, enabling the country to import the raw materials and food that fueled the industrial revolution.\nWalpole is immortalised in St Stephen's Hall, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.\nWalpole rebuilt Houghton Hall in Norfolk as his country seat. He also left behind a collection of art which he had assembled during his career. His grandson, the 3rd\u00a0Earl of Orford, sold many of the works in this collection to the Russian Empress Catherine\u00a0II in 1779. This collection \u2013 then regarded as one of the finest in Europe \u2013 now lies in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 2013 the Hermitage loaned the collection to Houghton for display, following the original William Kent hanging plan, which had been recently discovered at Houghton.\nThe nursery rhyme \"Who Killed Cock Robin?\" may allude to the fall of Walpole, who carried the popular nickname \"Cock Robin\".\nVarious locations are named after Walpole, including Walpole Street in Wolverhampton, England; and the towns of Walpole, Massachusetts (founded in 1724), and Orford, New Hampshire (incorporated in 1761) in the United States.\nMarriages and issue.\nCatherine Shorter.\nOn 30 July 1700, Walpole married Catherine Shorter (1682\u20131737), the eldest daughter and co-heiress of John Shorter of Bybrook in Ashford, Kent (the son of Sir John Shorter (1625\u20131688), Lord Mayor of London) by his wife Elizabeth Philipps (born c. 1664), a daughter of Sir Erasmus Philipps, 3rd Baronet. She was described as \"a woman of exquisite beauty and accomplished manners\". Her \u00a320,000 dowry was, according to Walpole's brother Horatio Walpole, spent on the wedding, christenings and jewels. Her sister and co-heiress Charlotte Shorter married (as his third wife) Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Baron Conway (1679\u20131731/2), by whom she was the mother of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford (1718\u20131794). Sir John Shorter (c. 1625\u20131688), Lord Mayor of London, married Isabel Birkhead, a sister of Edward Birkhead (d.1662) of Richmond House, Twickenham, Serjeant-at-Arms in the House of Commons in 1648, a Quaker Magistrate and the principal landowner in the parish of Twickenham. Catherine's youngest son Horace later built Strawberry Hill House on land purchased by him at Twickenham. Catherine Shorter died on 20 August 1737 and was buried at Houghton, with a monument in the south aisle of the King Henry VII Chapel, Westminster Abbey, erected by her son Horatio, in the form of a life-size white marble statue, a copy by Filippo della Valle of a Roman statue of Livia (or \"Pudicitia\") in the Villa Mattei in Rome.\nOn the plinth sculpted by John Michael Rysbrack is the following inscription written by Horace:\nTo the memory of Catherine Lady Walpole, eldest daughter of John Shorter, Esqr. of Bybrook in Kent and first wife of Sir Robert Walpole, afterwards Earl of Orford, Horace her youngest son consecrates this monument. She had beauty and wit without vice or vanity, and cultivated the Arts without affectation. She was devout, tho' without bigotry to any sect, and was without prejudice to any party tho' the wife of a minister, whose power she esteemed but when she could employ it to benefit the miserable or to reward the meritorious. She loved a private life, tho' born to shine in public; and was an ornament to courts, untainted by them. She died 20 August 1737.\nBy Catherine Shorter he had two daughters and three sons:\nMaria Skerritt.\nPrior to the death of his first wife Walpole took on a mistress, Maria Skeritt (d. 1738), a fashionable socialite of wit and beauty, with an independent fortune of \u00a330,000, the daughter and sole heiress of Thomas Skeritt (d. 1738) (\"aliter\" Skerret, Skeritt, etc), a wealthy Irish merchant living in Dover Street, Mayfair, London. They had been living together openly in Richmond Park and Houghton Hall since before 1728, and married at some time before March 1738. She died on 4 June 1739 following a miscarriage. Walpole considered her \"indispensable to his happiness\", and her loss plunged him into a \"deplorable and comfortless condition\", which led to a severe illness. By Maria Skerritt he had one daughter, born before the marriage, but subsequently legitimated:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Enchiladas can be filled with various ingredients, including meats, cheese, beans, potatoes, vegetables, or combinations. Enchilada sauces include chili-based sauces, such as salsa roja, various moles, tomato-based sauces, such as salsa verde, or cheese-based sauces, such as chile con queso.\nEtymology.\nThe Royal Spanish Academy defines the word \"enchilada\", as used in Mexico, as a rolled maize tortilla stuffed with meat and covered with a tomato and chili sauce. \"Enchilada\" is the past participle of the Mexican Spanish \"enchilar\", \"to add chili pepper to\"; literally, \"to season (or decorate) with chili\".\nHistory.\nEnchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to Aztec times. The people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in Coyoac\u00e1n, which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native Nahuatl name for the flat corn bread used was \"tlaxcalli\"; the Spanish gave it the name \"tortilla\".) The Nahuatl word for enchilada is \"ch\u012bllap\u012btzalli\" , which is formed of the Nahuatl word for \"chili\", \"ch\u012blli\" and the Nahuatl word for \"flute\", \"tlap\u012btzalli\" . In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, \"\" (\"The Mexican Chef\"), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galvan Rivera's \"Diccionario de Cocina\", published in 1845.\nVarieties.\nIn their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in chili sauce and eaten without fillings. There are now many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form. Various adjectives may be used to describe the recipe content or origin, e.g. \"enchilada tapatia\" would be a recipe from Jalisco.\nVarieties include:\nFillings, toppings and garnishes.\nFillings include meat (e.g. beef, poultry, pork, seafood) or cheese, potatoes, vegetables, beans, tofu, and any combination thereof. Enchiladas are commonly topped or garnished with cheese, sour cream, lettuce, olives, chopped onions, chili peppers, sliced avocado, and salsa, or fresh cilantro.\nOutside of Mexico.\nCosta Rica.\nIn Costa Rica, the enchilada is a common, small, spicy pastry made with puff pastry and filled with diced potatoes spiced with a common variation of Tabasco sauce or other similar sauces. Other variations include fillings made of spicy chicken or minced meat.\nHonduras.\nIn Honduras, enchiladas look and taste very different from those in Mexico; they are not corn tortillas rolled around a filling, but instead are flat, fried, corn tortillas topped with ground beef, salad toppings (usually consisting of cabbage and tomato slices), a tomato sauce (often ketchup blended with butter and other spices such as cumin), and crumbled or shredded cheese. They look and taste much like what many people call a tostada.\nNicaragua.\nIn Nicaragua, enchiladas are different from the other ones in Central America and resemble those in Mexico; they are corn tortillas filled with a mixture of ground beef and rice with chili, they are then folded and covered in egg batter and deep fried. It is commonly served with a cabbage and tomato salad (either pickled salad or in cream and tomato sauce). The Nicaraguan enchilada resembles the empanada of other countries.\nGuatemala.\nIn Guatemala, enchiladas look much like Honduran enchiladas but the recipe is different. This version most commonly begins with a leaf of fresh lettuce on top of a flat fried corn tortilla, then a layer of 'picado de carne,' which includes meat (generally ground beef, shredded chicken, or pork) and diced vegetables (carrot, potato, onion, celery, green bean, peas, red bell pepper, garlic, bay leaf, seasoned with salt and black pepper). The next layer in the recipe is the 'curtido' layer which includes more vegetables (cabbage, beets, onions, and carrots). After this is two or three pieces of sliced hard boiled egg, then thin sliced white onion, and finally a drizzle of mild red salsa. The dish is topped with either queso seco or queso fresco and garnished with cilantro.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 295,911. The county seat is the city of Poughkeepsie. The county was created in 1683, one of New York's first twelve counties, and later organized in 1713. Dutchess County is part of the Kiryas Joel\u2013Poughkeepsie\u2013Newburgh metropolitan area, which belongs to the larger New York\u2013Newark\u2013Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. The county is part of the Hudson Valley region of the state.\nHistory.\nBefore Anglo-Dutch settlement, what is today Dutchess County was a leading center for the indigenous Wappinger peoples. They had their council-fire at what is now Fishkill Hook, and had settlements throughout the area.\nOn November 1, 1683, the Province of New York established its first twelve counties, including Dutchess. Its boundaries at that time included the present Putnam County, and a small portion of the present Columbia County (the towns of Clermont and Germantown). The county was named for Mary of Modena, Duchess of York; \"dutchess\" is an archaic spelling of the word \"duchess\".\nThe Province of New York and the Connecticut Colony negotiated an agreement on November 28, 1683, establishing their border as east of the Hudson River, north to Massachusetts. The east of the Byram River making up the Connecticut Panhandle were granted to Connecticut, in recognition of the wishes of the residents. In exchange, Rye was granted to New York, along with a wide strip of land running north from Ridgefield to Massachusetts alongside the New York counties of Westchester, Putnam then Dutchess, known as \"The Oblong\". The eastern half of the stub of land in northeast Dutchess County containing Rudd Pond and Taconic State Park is the northernmost extension of The Oblong.\nUntil 1713, Dutchess was administered by Ulster County. On October 23, 1713, Queen Anne gave permission for Dutchess County to elect its own officers from among their own population, including a supervisor, tax collector, tax assessor and treasurer. In 2013, Dutchess County celebrated its 300th anniversary of democracy based upon a legislative resolution sponsored by County Legislator Michael Kelsey from Salt Point. In 1812, Putnam County was detached from Dutchess.\nThe Patents.\nFourteen royal land patents were granted between 1685 and 1706 covering the entirety of the original footprint of Dutchess County (which until 1812 included today's Putnam County).\nThe first ten, granted between 1685 and 1697, covered almost all of Hudson River shoreline in the original county, with three - Rombouts, the Great Nine Partners, and Philipse Patents - extending significantly inland. The eleventh, and smallest, Cuyler, 1697, was the first to contain solely inland territory, just in from the Hudson. The twelfth, and next smallest, Fauconnier, in 1705, completed the Hudson River shoreline. The last two, Beekman, 1705, and the Little Nine Partners, 1706, laid claim to the remaining interior lands.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEarly settlement.\nFrom 1683 to 1715, most of the settlers in Dutchess County were Dutch. Many of these moved in from Albany and Ulster counties. They settled along the Fishkill Creek and in the areas that are now Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck.\nFrom 1715 to 1730, most of the new settlers in Dutchess county were Germans. From 1730 until 1775, New Englanders were the primary new settlers in Dutchess County. Coles Mills was settled by Elisha Cole from Cape Cod in 1747 at the outlet of Barrett Pond into the West Branch of the Croton River.\n20th century.\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was born in Dutchess County. He lived in his family home in Hyde Park, overlooking the Hudson River. His family's home is now the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, managed by the National Park Service.\nPrior to the 1960s, Dutchess County was primarily agricultural. Since then the southwestern part (from Poughkeepsie southward and from the Taconic State Parkway westward) of the county has developed into a largely residential area, suburban in character, with many of its residents commuting to jobs in New York City and Westchester County. The northern and eastern regions of the county remain rural with large farmlands but at the same time developed residences used during the summer and or on weekends by people living in the New York City urban area.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.6%) is water.\nDutchess County is located in southeastern New York State, between the Hudson River on its west and the New York\u2013Connecticut border on its east, about halfway between the cities of Albany and New York City. It contains two cities: Beacon and Poughkeepsie. Depending on precise location within the county, road travel distance to New York City ranges between .\nThe terrain of the county is mostly hilly, especially in the Hudson Highlands in the southwestern corner and the Taconic Mountains to the northeast. Some areas nearer the river are flatter.\nThe highest point in the county is the summit of Brace Mountain, in the Taconics, at above sea level. The lowest point is sea level, along the Hudson River. The highest point of neighboring Fairfield County, Connecticut, is a point along the state line in Pawling.\nWappinger Creek, at from its source at Thompson Pond in Pine Plains to where it drains into the Hudson at New Hamburg, is the longest stream in the county. Its watershed is likewise the largest in the county. To its south is the watershed of Dutchess County's second-longest stream, Fishkill Creek, part of which spills over into Putnam County. Within that watershed are the county's third-longest stream, Sprout Creek, and its largest, deepest and highest lakes: Whaley (), in the town of Pawling; Sylvan () in the town of Beekman and Beacon Reservoir, in the town of Fishkill, at respectively.\nOther, smaller tributaries of the Hudson such as the Saw Kill drain the northwestern portion of the county. The southeastern fringe of Dutchess is part of the upper Croton River watershed and thus part of the New York City water supply system. On the east, in the Oblong, streams drain into the Housatonic River in adjacent Connecticut.\nA border nearly one-half mile (800\u00a0m) long exists with Berkshire County, Massachusetts, in the extreme northern end of the county.\nState, county, and town parks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 280,150 people, 99,536 households, and 69,177 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 106,103 housing units at an average density of . 22.0% of the population was of Italian, 16.9% Irish, 11.3% German and 6.7% English ancestry according to Census 2000. 88.3% spoke English and 4.8% spoke Spanish.\nBased on the Census Ancestry tallies, including people who listed more than one ancestry, Italians were the largest group in Dutchess County with 60,645. Irish came in a very close second at 59,991. In third place were the 44,915 Germans who barely exceeded the 44,078 people not in the 105 specifically delineated ancestry groups.\nThere were 99,536 households, out of which 34.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.5% were married couples living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.5% were non-families. 24.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 3.16.\nAs of Q4 2021, the median home value in Dutchess County was $365,199, an increase of 13.8% from the prior year.\nIn the county, the age distribution of the population shows 25.1% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 30.2% from 25 to 44, 23.2% from 45 to 64, and 12.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.2 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $53,086, and the median income for a family was $63,254. Males had a median income of $45,576 versus $30,706 for females. The per capita income for the county was $23,940. About 5.0% of families and 7.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.5% of those under age 18 and 6.5% of those age 65 or over.\nThe decrease in population between 1810 and 1820 was due to the separation of Putnam County from Dutchess in 1812.\nRacial demographics.\nAs of 2017, the residents of Dutchess County were reported as the following: American Indian and Alaska Native (0.04%), Asian (4%), Black or African American (8.5%), Hispanic or Latino (12.5%), Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (0.016%), Some Other Race (0.35%), Two or More Races (3%), White (71%).\nGovernment.\nDutchess County has a Charter Government with a County Executive and directly elected legislature of 25 members, each elected from a single member district. The Charter form of Government went in to effect in 1968 given the favorable outcome of a 1967 special election dedicated to the question. From 1713 until 1967, the County Government had been managed by a Board of Supervisors, made up of the locally elected leaders.\nElections.\nThe composition of the County Legislature is 15 Republicans and 10 Democrats for the 2024\u20132025 term. County elections occur in odd-numbered years.\nHistorically, Dutchess County, like most of the lower Hudson, was classic \"Yankee Republican\" territory. Between 1884 and 2004, the Republican presidential candidate carried Dutchess County in 28 out of 30 elections (1964 and 1996 being exceptions). Even Hyde Park resident Franklin D. Roosevelt failed to carry the county during his four campaigns.\nThe Republican edge narrowed significantly in the 1990s, with George H. W. Bush going from 61 percent of the county's vote in 1988 to only 40.5 percent in 1992, although that likely was affected by the presence of Ross Perot on the ballot as a third-party candidate. In 2008, Barack Obama became only the third Democrat to carry the county since 1884, and the first to win a majority since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. It has gone for the Democratic candidate in five consecutive elections (2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024), though never by a margin of more than 10%.\nDutchess County is split between two congressional districts. The most southern portion is in the 17th district, represented by Republican Mike Lawler. The rest of the county is in the 18th district, represented by Democrat Pat Ryan. These are considered \"swing\" districts nationally, with Cook Partisan Voting Index ratings of D +1 and D +2, respectively, as of 2025.\nLaw enforcement.\nThe Cities of Beacon and Poughkeepsie; Towns of Fishkill, Hyde Park, Pine Plains, Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck, Red Hook, and East Fishkill; and Villages of Millerton, Wappingers Falls, and Millbrook, have their own Police departments. The remainder of the county is patrolled by the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office and New York State Police. The New York State Police Troop K headquarters is located in Millbrook.\nCommunities.\nN.B.: Cities, Towns and Villages are official political designations.\nTowns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVillages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHamlets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEducation.\nPublic school districts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrivate schools.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransportation.\nCrossings.\nThree spans cross the Hudson River, linking Dutchess with Orange, Ulster, and Greene Counties:\nRailroads.\nThe Metro-North railroad provides a critical link to New York City for Dutchess County's commuting population. The Hudson Line and Amtrak run concurrently along the Hudson River, on the western edge of the county. The Hudson Line has stops at Breakneck Ridge, Beacon, and New Hamburg (a hamlet of the town of Poughkeepsie) before the Hudson Line terminates at Poughkeepsie. The tracks continue north of that point as Amtrak, with Poughkeepsie and Rhinecliff (a small hamlet in the Town of Rhinebeck) being stops along Amtrak's Empire Service.\nThe Harlem Line, on the eastern side of the county, has station stops in Pawling, along the Appalachian Trail, Wingdale, Dover Plains, and two stops in Wassaic (one along the Tenmile River and the other the namesake terminus of that line).\nBuses and ferries.\nPublic transportation in Dutchess County is handled by Dutchess County Public Transit, commonly called \"the LOOP.\" Outside of the urbanized area of the county, most service is limited. Privately run lines connect Poughkeepsie to New Paltz and Beacon to Newburgh. Leprechaun Lines and Short Line Bus also operate some service through Poughkeepsie, Rhinebeck, and the southern part of the county.\nNY Waterway operates the Newburgh\u2013Beacon Ferry, which is located at the Beacon train station.\nAir.\nGeneral aviation facilities are located at Hudson Valley Regional Airport (formerly Dutchess County Airport), located in Wappinger and Sky Park Airport in Red Hook, New York. General commercial passenger service is provided by New York Stewart International Airport, which is located across the Hudson River in Newburgh.\nCulture.\nDutchess County holds an annual county fair. The County Chamber of Commerce holds an annual hot air balloon launch typically in the first week of July. The main launch sites are along the Hudson River. As many as 20 balloons participate in the event.\nThe Dutchess County Historical Society was formed in 1914 and is active in the preservation of a large collection at the 18th century Clinton House. The Society has published a yearbook since 1914 and presents up to four awards of merit in the field of Dutchess County history each year.\nMedia.\nDutchess County has no locally based television stations. (However, it does have a translator for the Capitol District PBS affiliate, WMHT.) Its only news radio format station is WKIP (AM) of Poughkeepsie. WRHV is an NPR affiliated broadcasting out of Poughkeepsie. The country music format station, WRWB-FM, broadcasting across the Hudson River, can be reached in much of the county.\n\"Poughkeepsie Journal\" is published in that city. \"Vassar Miscellany News,\" associated with Vassar College, is published weekly. Also published in the county is the \"Beacon Free Press\"/\"Southern Dutchess News.\"\nHealth.\nThe county is home to four hospitals. Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck and Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie are both owned by Nuvance Health. In addition, MidHudson Regional Hospital (formerly St. Francis) is located in Poughkeepsie and The Castle Point Veterans Health Administration is in Wappinger.\nOn March 11, 2020, the county's first case of COVID-19 was confirmed. As of June 2021, there had been 29,483 cases and 445 deaths.\nSports.\nThe Hudson Valley Renegades are a minor league baseball team affiliated with the New York Yankees. The team is a member of the South Atlantic League, play at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill and have been located in Dutchess County since 1994.\nPrevious professional sports teams include the Hudson Valley Bears (2008-2009) which played hockey, and the Hudson Valley Hawks which played in the former National Professional Basketball League.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "50530", "revid": "37664675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50530", "title": "Mole (animal)", "text": "Common name for several small mammals\nMoles are small, subterranean mammals. They have cylindrical bodies, velvety fur, very small, inconspicuous eyes and ears, reduced hindlimbs, and short, powerful forelimbs with large paws adapted for digging.\nThe word \"mole\" most commonly refers to many species in the family Talpidae (which are named after the Latin word for mole, \"talpa\"). True moles are found in most parts of North America, Europe (except for Ireland) and Asia. Other mammals referred to as moles include the African golden moles and the Australian marsupial moles, which have a similar ecology and lifestyle to true moles but are unrelated. \nMoles may be viewed as pests to gardeners, but they provide positive contributions to soil, gardens, and ecosystems, including soil aeration, feeding on slugs and small creatures that eat plant roots, and providing prey for other wildlife. They eat earthworms and other small invertebrates in the soil.\nTerminology.\nIn Middle English, moles were known as \"moldwarps\". By the era of Early Modern English, the mole was also known in English as \"mouldywarp\" or \"mouldiwarp\", a word having cognates in other Germanic languages such as German (\"Maulwurf\"), and Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Icelandic (\"muldvarp\", \"moldvarp\", \"mullvad\", \"moldvarpa\"), where \"muld/mull/mold\" refers to soil and \"varp/vad/varpa\" refers to throwing, hence \"one who throws soil\" or \"dirt-tosser\".\nMale moles are called \"boars\"; females are called \"sows\".\nCharacteristics.\nUnderground breathing.\nMoles have been found to tolerate higher levels of carbon dioxide than other mammals, because their blood cells have a special form of hemoglobin that has a higher affinity to oxygen than other forms. In addition, moles use oxygen more effectively by reusing the exhaled air, and can survive in low-oxygen environments such as burrows.\nExtra thumbs.\nMoles have polydactyl forepaws: each has an extra thumb (also known as a prepollex) next to the regular thumb. While the mole's other digits have multiple joints, the prepollex has a single, sickle-shaped bone that develops later and differently from the other fingers during embryogenesis from a transformed sesamoid bone in the wrist, independently evolved but similar to the giant panda thumb. This supernumerary digit is species-specific, as it is not present in shrews, the mole's closest relatives. Androgenic steroids are known to affect the growth and formation of bones, and a connection is possible between this species-specific trait and the male genital apparatus in female moles of many mole species (gonads with testicular and ovary tissues).\nDiet.\nMoles are omnivores, but their diet primarily consists of earthworms and other small invertebrates found in the soil. The mole runs are in reality \"worm traps\", the mole sensing when a worm falls into the tunnel and quickly running along to kill and eat it. Because their saliva contains a toxin that can paralyze earthworms, moles are able to store their still-living prey for later consumption. They construct special underground \"larders\" for just this purpose; researchers have discovered such larders with over a thousand earthworms in them. Before eating earthworms, moles pull them between their squeezed paws to force the collected earth and dirt out of the worm's gut.\nThe star-nosed mole can detect, catch and eat food faster than the human eye can follow.\nBreeding.\nBreeding season for a mole depends on species, but is generally from February through May. Males search for females by letting out high-pitched squeals and tunneling through foreign areas.\nThe gestation period of the Eastern (North America) mole (\"Scalopus aquaticus\") is approximately 42 days. Three to five young are born, mainly in March and early April. Townsend's moles mate in February and March, and the 2\u20134 young are born in March and April after a gestation period of about 1 month.\nSocial structure.\nMoles are allegedly solitary creatures, coming together only to mate. Territories may overlap, but moles avoid each other and males may fight fiercely if they meet.\nClassification.\nThe family Talpidae contains all the true moles and some of their close relatives. Those species called \"shrew moles\" represent an intermediate form between the moles and their shrew ancestors, and as such may not be fully described by the article.\nMoles were traditionally classified in the order Insectivora, but that order has since been abandoned because it has been shown to not be monophyletic. Moles are now classified with shrews and hedgehogs, in the more narrowly defined order Eulipotyphla.\nOther \"moles\".\nMany groups of burrowing animals (pink fairy armadillos, tuco-tucos, mole rats, mole crickets, pygmy mole crickets, and mole crabs) have independently developed close physical similarities with moles due to convergent evolution; two of these are so similar to true moles, they are commonly called and thought of as \"moles\" in common English, although they are completely unrelated to true moles or to each other. These are the golden moles of southern Africa and the marsupial moles of Australia. While difficult to distinguish from each other, they are most easily distinguished from true moles by shovel-like patches on their noses, which they use in tandem with their abbreviated forepaws to swim through sandy soils.\nGolden moles.\nThe golden moles belong to the same branch on the phylogenetic tree as the tenrecs, called Tenrecomorpha, which, in turn, stem from a main branch of placental mammals called the Afrosoricida. This means that they share a closer common ancestor with such existing afrosoricids as elephants, manatees and aardvarks than they do with other placental mammals, such as true Talpidae moles.\nMarsupial moles.\nAs marsupials, these moles are even more distantly related to true talpid moles than golden moles are, both of which belong to the Eutheria, or placental mammals. This means that they are more closely related to such existing Australian marsupials as kangaroos or koalas, and even to a lesser extent to American marsupials, such as opossums, than they are to placental mammals, such as golden or Talpidae moles.\nClass Mammalia\nInteraction with humans.\nPelts.\nMoles' pelts have a velvety texture not found in surface animals. Surface-dwelling animals tend to have longer fur with a natural tendency for the nap to lie in a particular direction, but to facilitate their burrowing lifestyle, mole pelts are short and very dense and have no particular direction to the nap. This makes it easy for moles to move backwards underground, as their fur is not \"brushed the wrong way\". The leather is extremely soft and supple. Queen Alexandra, the wife of Edward VII of the United Kingdom, ordered a mole-fur garment to start a fashion that would create a demand for mole fur, thereby turning what had been a serious pest problem in Scotland into a lucrative industry for the country. Hundreds of pelts are cut into rectangles and sewn together to make a coat. The natural color is taupe, (derived from the French noun \"taupe\" meaning mole) but it is readily dyed any color.\nThe term \"moleskin\" for a tough cotton fabric is in common use today.\nPest status: extermination and humane options.\nMoles are considered agricultural pests in some countries, while in others, such as Germany, they are a protected species, but may be killed with a permit. Problems cited as caused by moles include contamination of silage with soil particles, making it unpalatable to livestock, the covering of pasture with fresh soil reducing its size and yield, damage to agricultural machinery by the exposure of stones, damage to young plants through disturbance of the soil, weed invasion of pasture through exposure of freshly tilled soil, and damage to drainage systems and watercourses. Other species such as weasels and voles may use mole tunnels to gain access to enclosed areas or plant roots.\nMoles burrow and raise molehills, killing parts of lawns. They can undermine plant roots, indirectly causing damage or death. Moles do not eat plant roots.\nMoles are controlled with traps such as mole-catchers, smoke bombs, and poisons such as calcium carbide, which produces acetylene gas to drive moles away. Strychnine was also used for this purpose in the past. The most common method now is Phostoxin or Talunex tablets. They contain aluminium phosphide and are inserted in the mole tunnels, where they turn into phosphine gas (not be confused with phosgene gas). More recently, high-grade nitrogen gas has proven effective at killing moles, with the added advantage of having no polluting effect to the environment.\nOther common defensive measures include cat litter and blood meal, to repel the mole, or smoking its burrow. Devices are also sold to trap the mole in its burrow, when one sees the \"mole hill\" moving and therefore knows where the animal is, and then stabbing it.\nOther humane options are also possible including humane traps that capture the mole alive so it may be transported elsewhere. In many contexts including ordinary gardens, the damage caused by moles to lawns is mostly visual, and it is possible instead of extermination to simply remove the earth of the molehills as they appear, leaving their permanent galleries for the moles to continue their existence underground. However, when the tunnels are near the surface in soft ground or after heavy rain, they may collapse, leaving (small) unsightly furrows in the lawn.\nMeat.\nWilliam Buckland, known for eating every animal he could, opined that mole meat tasted vile.\nArchaeology.\nMoles can inadvertently help archaeologists by bringing small artifacts to the surface through their digging. By examining molehills for sherds and other small objects, archaeologists can find evidence of human habitation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
