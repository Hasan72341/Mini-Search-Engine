The members met at Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois. They consist of Dan Haseltine on vocals, Charlie Lowell on piano and keyboards, Stephen Mason on lead guitars and Matthew Odmark on rhythm guitars. Although the band has no permanent drummer or bass guitarist, Jeremy Lutito and Gabe Ruschival of Disappointed by Candy fill these roles for live concerts. Past tour band members include Aaron Sands, Scott Savage, and Joe Porter. Jars of Clay's style is a blend of alternative rock, folk, acoustic, and R&amp;B.\nThe band's name is derived from the New International Version's translation of 2 Corinthians 4:7:\nThis verse is paraphrased in their song \"Four Seven\", which appears as a hidden track on the CD release of their self-titled album.\nBand history.\nCharlie Lowell and Matt Bronleewe originally met as friends in high school. There, Lowell first learned of 2 Corinthians 4:7, which later became the basis for the band's name. Dan Haseltine, Steve Mason, Charlie Lowell and Matt Bronleewe formed Jars of Clay at Greenville College, in Greenville, Illinois in the early 1990s. Charlie Lowell first met Dan Haseltine after noticing that he was wearing a Toad the Wet Sprocket shirt. Pursuing a career in music together was not necessarily their original goal; some of the first songs they wrote together were for music and recording classes they were taking at the time. Their second guitarist Matt Odmark joined some time later. While in college playing together at local coffee houses, Jars gained a reputation for their original arrangement of \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\" which had been adapted to the tune of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".\nIn 1994, the band submitted a demo to a talent competition run by the Gospel Music Association and were selected as finalists. They traveled to Nashville to perform and won the contest. Back in Greenville, they self-released a limited-run of the same demo, \"Frail\", after their song of the same name. The buzz from their performance in Nashville and the demo's popularity resulted in offers from record labels, so the band decided to drop school and move to Nashville. At this time, Bronleewe left the band to finish school and settle down with his fianc\u00e9e. He was replaced with Matt Odmark, Lowell's childhood friend and fellow McQuaid Jesuit High School alum.\nThe band signed with Essential Records and started recording their first full-length studio album, \"Jars of Clay\". Adrian Belew, of progressive rock band King Crimson, heard the band and offered to produce, leading to him producing two songs: \"Liquid\" and \"Flood\". The band's self-titled debut released in 1995. When the single \"Flood\" began to climb the charts on mainstream radio stations, Silvertone Records (Essential's parent company) started to heavily promote the song, turning it into one of the biggest mainstream hits ever by a band on a Christian label. The album has since reached multi-platinum certification according to the RIAA. \"Flood\" peaked at No.\u00a037 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No.\u00a012 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock chart, and was the band's only secular radio hit.\nThe band toured in support of other Christian acts, such as PFR, and with mainstream acts like Matchbox Twenty, Duncan Sheik, and Sting. This resulted in a small backlash from some Christian groups.\nThe band released \"Drummer Boy\", a Christmas EP entitled, at the end of 1995. The EP was re-released, on Silvertone Records, in 1997 with a slightly different track listing. The band's second album, \"Much Afraid\", produced by Stephen Lipson was also released in 1997. The album sold well and like its predecessor, enjoyed crossover success. The album went on to earn a Grammy for \"Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album\". The album has since earned platinum certification by the RIAA. They released two music videos for this album for the songs \"Crazy Times\" and \"Five Candles (You Were There)\". \nIn 1999, Jars of Clay released their third album, \"If I Left the Zoo\", which was produced by Dennis Herring. The record was their third to crossover into the mainstream, and it earned the band their second Grammy award. It was during this time that touring drummer Scott Savage left the band's touring group to play for Jaci Velasquez and was replaced by Joe Porter. Lead radio single, \"Unforgetful You\", was also featured on the soundtrack to the motion picture \"Drive Me Crazy\". \"Collide\" was also featured on the motion picture \"Hometown Legend\". Upon the release of \"If I Left the Zoo\" they also released \"Front Yard Luge\" and after a year \"The White Elephant Sessions\". \"If I Left the Zoo\" so far has the most singles released by Jars of Clay.\nIn 2001, the four members of the band received honorary degrees at Greenville College. Only three of them, Haseltine, Lowell, and Mason, had studied at the school before dropping out in 1994 to move to Nashville. Odmark still received an honorary degree, despite having attended the University of Rochester in upstate New York.\nIn 2002, the band self-produced and released their fourth album, \"The Eleventh Hour\", which earned them a Grammy award for the third album in a row. The album relied on studio musicians and the band's touring musicians to fill in for the band's lack of drummer and bass player. Concerts from the subsequent \"Eleventh Hour Tour\" were recorded for later projects, including the release of a live concert DVD, .\nThe double-disc \"\" features an acoustic disc and a live disc. The acoustic disc consisted of reworked and rearranged fan favorites, two \"The Eleventh Hour\" b-sides, and a cover of Adam Again's \"Dig\". The latter was actually intended for a tribute album for Gene Eugene, who had died recently. The live disc features a recent concert recording that include songs from throughout the band's career.\nThe band continued the acoustic and organic approach that was featured on \"Furthermore\" for their fifth studio album entitled \"Who We Are Instead\", which released on November 4, 2003. On the album, the band revisited various styles they had used previously, as well as experimenting with new influences, such as gospel, hymns, and Nickel Creek's \"newgrass\" style.\nIn early 2005, the band released \"Redemption Songs\", a collection of hymns and traditional songs with new melodies and rearranged the music. \"God Will Lift Up Your Head\", reworked as an acoustic rocker, was a hit for the band on Christian radio. They also covered five hymns from the \"Indelible Grace\" CD series (a series which originated from the work of Reformed University Fellowship).\nTheir next album, \"Good Monsters\", was released on September 5, 2006 and was labeled by Jars of Clay \"their first ever rock record\". In the September 2006 edition of \"CCM Magazine\", the band credited fellow artist Ashley Cleveland with inspiring the improvisational sound of the album. The magazine called it \"the most profound album the Christian music community has released in years\".\nOn September 4, 2007, two albums from the band were released simultaneously. The first was a mainstream release of \"Live Monsters\", an EP of live concert recordings of songs, originally recorded for \"Good Monsters\" and that had been previously released through the iTunes Store and the official Jars of Clay online store. The second release, through Essential/Legacy, was a greatest hits album, \"The Essential Jars of Clay\". On April 1, 2008, Essential Records released the band's third greatest hits album, the second in that year, \"Greatest Hits\". Included was the new song \"Love is the Protest\".\nIn March 2007, the band announced at a concert in Des Moines, Iowa, that they were no longer on Essential Records and would now be releasing music independently. Later, press releases announced the name of their label as Gray Matters, which would be a partnership with Nettwerk Music Group. Along with the announcement of their new label, the band mentioned that they are planning to record the soundtrack to , a documentary about Milton and Fred Ochieng' - brothers from the African village training to be doctors in the States, working to build a clinic in their home town. The band's first release through Gray Matters was a full-length Christmas album, \"Christmas Songs\", on October 16, 2007. On July 29, 2008, Gray Matters Records released \"Closer EP\" exclusively through online digital music stores. It was subsequently released on CD on August 19, 2008 and included reworked versions of \"Flood\", called \"Flood (New Rain)\", and \"Love Song For a Savior ('08)\" from their debut album. \nThe band's tenth studio album, \"The Long Fall Back to Earth\", was released on April 21, 2009. and contained 14 songs, including \"Closer\" and \"Safe to Land\", from the \"Closer EP\", and is influenced by 80s music, specifically Tears for Fears and The Cure. \"The Long Fall Back to Earth\" debuted at No.\u00a029 on the \"Billboard\" 200 mainstream charts, which was Jars of Clay's highest debut since \"The Eleventh Hour\" which debuted at No.\u00a028 in 2002. The second single off the album is \"Heaven\". The song \"Hero\" was featured on a trailer for NBC's \"Kings\". \"The Long Fall Back to Earth\" was nominated for the Grammy to the \"Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album\", though they didn't win in the category.\n\"The Shelter\" was released October 5, 2010 and features eleven tracks. During their promotion for the album, the band streamed the entire album for a few days before its release on their website. In early 2011 they toured the United States on the Rock And Worship Roadshow headlined by MercyMe. In July 2012, the band traveled to Portland, Oregon, to begin recording \"Inland\" at Flora Recording &amp; Playback, a music studio owned and operated by Tucker Martine. The new album was released on August 27, 2013 and features twelve tracks. On March 18, 2013, the band released an exclusive track, \"Love in Hard Times\", that could only be acquired with the purchase of their EP \"Under the Weather (Live in Sellersville, PA)\" directly from their website. On June 17, 2013, the band released a free download of the song \"Inland\" through \"Rolling Stone\"'s website. The first single off of the album, \"After the Fight\", was released on June 18.\nThe group's activities have been limited in recent years (as of 2022), each band member focusing on individual pursuits, but they continue to release music and perform sporadically. They collaborated with pop group SHEL, performing a Christmas concert in Nashville that led to a 6-song Christmas-themed EP titled \"A Family Christmas\", which included four original songs. In 2022, they contributed a track to \"There's a Rainbow Somewhere\", a tribute album to Randy Stonehill.\nBlood: Water Mission.\nLead singer Dan Haseltine visited Africa in 2002, which in turn inspired the founding of , a non-profit organization created to raise awareness and money for the poverty and AIDS stricken regions of the continent. The name is derived from, as Haseltine says, \"The two things Africa needs most\" - clean blood and clean water. The mission has begun the 1000 Wells project, an effort to have a thousand new wells built throughout Africa. In 2012, the organization met their goal of providing clean water to 1,000 African communities through the organization they founded, Blood: Water Mission, and its 1,000 Wells Project. Former Bassist for Jars of Clay Aaron Sands serves as Administrative Director for the project.\nBeliefs.\nIn a 2002 interview with NPR's Scott Simon on \"Weekend Edition Saturday\", responding to a question about the relatively subtle religious content of their music, Haseltine said that the band's songs are not meant to explain their faith but are written about their lives, which are affected by their faith. Haseltine explained the decision to \"shy away from ... traditional religious language\" as a conscious one, in part to make their music more accessible to those \"put off by religion\" and to \"love people in a way that isn't exclusive to simply people that understand the language of Christianity\". Haseltine also stated that art can \"make people feel what's true rather than telling them\".\nBand members.\nCurrent\nFormer\nCurrent touring musicians\nFormer touring musicians\nAwards.\nJars of Clay has been nominated for and won several awards, including Grammy Awards and several other music awards, known as the GMA Dove Awards. Some of these successes have been collaborative efforts, including two \"City on a Hill\" albums and the for the 2005 film \"\". The group has won five Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) awards.\nIn June 2009, Jars of Clay was named as one of PeaceByPeace.com's first peace heroes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The brand and formula are owned by Keurig Dr Pepper, although the beverage is distributed by PepsiCo except in the UK where it is distributed by Britvic, PepsiCo's designated UK distributor.\nHistory.\n7 Up was created by Charles Leiper Grigg, who launched his St. Louis\u2013based company The Howdy Corporation in 1920. Grigg came up with the formula for a lemon-lime soft drink in 1928, and the product was launched a year before the Wall Street crash of 1929. The trademark \"SEVEN-UP\" was granted in 1928, and a 1929 taste test advertisement featured a flying \"7up\" logo. The name became \"7up Lithiated Lemon Soda\" in 1930\u20131931, as indicated by the use of a logo with tilted \"up\" and historical paper labels.\nAn oft-repeated story is that the drink was originally called \"Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda,\" but investigative reports find little or no evidence that a drink with this name ever existed. In fact, \"Bib-Label\" is not part of the name of the soda, but refers to the practice of hanging a piece of paper around the neck of a soda bottle like a bib.\nThe drink did, initially, claim to contain lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug. It was one of a number of patent medicine products popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. In 1936 the federal government forced the manufacturer to remove a number of health claims, and because \"lithium was not an actual ingredient\", the name was changed to just \"7\u00a0Up\" in 1937.\nThe origin of the name 7\u00a0Up is unclear. Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink, while others have claimed that the number was a reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass of 7. Britvic also claims that the name alluded to 7\u00a0Up being packaged in seven-ounce bottles when Coca-Cola and most other soft drinks were bottled in six-ounce bottles.\nIn 1986 Pepsi bought 7up \nThe 7 Up company was privately owned by its founding families until it was sold in 1978 to Philip Morris, which sold it in 1986 in two parts: the international division to PepsiCo and the US business to a group led by the investment firm Hicks &amp; Haas. In the US, 7\u00a0Up merged with Dr Pepper in 1988 to form Dr Pepper/Seven Up; Cadbury Schweppes bought the combined company in 1995. In 2008 the Dr Pepper Snapple Group was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes. In 2018, The this merger will effectively be undone following KDP's 2025 acquisition of JDE Peet's and the subsequent separation of its coffee business and beverage business.\nConsumption.\n7 Up is commonly consumed cold\u00a0\u2013 refrigerated or with ice. It is also used as a mixer for highball alcoholic lemon-lime soda cocktails, including the 7 and 7 (Seagram's 7 Crown and 7 Up) and CC and Seven (Canadian Club whisky and 7\u00a0Up). 7\u00a0Up is also used in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic punches.\nFormula.\n7 Up has been reformulated several times since its launch in 1928. In 2006, the version of the product sold in the U.S. was reformulated so it could be marketed as being \"100% natural\". This was achieved by eliminating the chelating agent calcium disodium EDTA, and replacing sodium citrate with potassium citrate to reduce the beverage's sodium content. This reformulation contains no fruit juice and, in the U.S., is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The manufacturing process used in the production of HFCS has led some public health and advocacy groups to challenge the ad campaign's \"natural\" claims.\nIn 2007, after the Center for Science in the Public Interest threatened to sue 7\u00a0Up, it was announced that 7\u00a0Up would stop being marketed as \"100% natural\". Instead, it is now promoted as having \"100% Natural Flavors\". The controversy does not extend to other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where HFCS is not generally used in foods, including 7\u00a0Up. In 2011, 7\u00a0Up began test marketing a formula, called 7\u00a0Up Retro, using sugar rather than HFCS. Container labels sport the caption \"Made With Real Sugar\".\nVariants.\nBarbecue sauces and marinades.\nIn 2007, Cadbury Schweppes entered into a licensing partnership with Vita Food Products to produce a line of barbecue sauces and marinades flavored with Dr Pepper, 7\u00a0Up, and A&amp;W Root Beer.\nAdvertising campaigns.\nMetal pedestrian crossing markers saying \"Drink 7up Safety First\" were installed in many U.S. cities in the 1930s.\n\"Fresh-Up Freddie\" was the rooster mascot for 7\u00a0Up in the 1950s. He gave viewers lessons about how to plan successful parties and picnics by having plenty of 7\u00a0Up on hand. The commercials were produced by Disney, giving the character the specific Disney look of the time. Freddie has been described as a hybrid of the rooster Panchito Pistoles from \"The Three Caballeros\" and the zany Aracuan Bird from the same film. He often was dressed in human clothes. Freddie also appeared in the 1957 \"Zorro\" TV series' commercial intermissions. In these commercials, Freddie fought with Pete the Cat. Freddie, who was featured in a small amount of merchandising, was voiced by Paul Frees.\nIn the late 1960s and 1980s, Geoffrey Holder appeared in television ads as part of 7\u00a0Up's \"Uncola\" ad campaign, designed to highlight differences between 7\u00a0Up and other soft drinks on the market with cola flavoring. In the ads, Geoffrey holds a pair of cola nuts in one hand and a lemon &amp; lime (used to flavor 7\u00a0Up) in the other hand and describes them as \"Uncola nuts\".\nIn 1987, 7\u00a0Up introduced Spot, the red-orange dot in the 7\u00a0Up logo anthropomorphized into a mascot. The character was used heavily in advertising and licensed items across the U.S., including the 1993 platformer video game \"Cool Spot\", and its 1995 sequel, \"Spot Goes to Hollywood\".\nThe cartoon character Fido Dido was used as a mascot in international areas from the late 1980s through the early 1990s, and was reintroduced in international markets in the early 2000s. Since PepsiCo did not own the rights to 7\u00a0Up in the US, certain ads featuring Fido Dido were instead reworked to advertise the company's Slice brand of lemon-lime soda.\nIn the early 2000s, Orlando Jones served as the spokesperson for 7\u00a0Up in the United States in a series of commercials. Notably, one commercial had him wear a t-shirt that had 7\u00a0Up's then-slogan \"Make 7\u00a0Up Yours\" divided between the front and back with the double entendre on the back that featured the \"Up Yours\" part; 7\u00a0Up would sell the shirt through specialty retailer Spencer Gifts for many years.\nCorporate sponsorship.\nIn 1974, 7 Up became The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon's first corporate sponsor; this was at a time when its sponsorship was generally limited to trade unions and civic organizations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has the 26th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of .\nViti Levu, the largest island, covers about 57% of the nation's land area, hosts the two official cities (the capital Suva, and Lautoka) and most other major towns, such as Nausori, Vaileka, Ba, Tavua, Kororvou, Nasinu, and Nadi (the site of the international airport), and contains some 69% of the population. Vanua Levu, to the northeast of Viti Levu, covers just over 30% of the land area though is home to only some 15% of the population. Its main towns are Labasa and Savusavu. In the northeast it features Natewa Bay, carving out the Loa peninsula.\nBoth islands are mountainous, with peaks up to rising abruptly from the shore, and covered with tropical forests. Heavy rains (up to annually) fall on the windward (southeastern) side, covering these sections of the islands with dense tropical forest. Lowlands on the western portions of each of the main islands are sheltered by the mountains and have a well-marked dry season favorable to crops such as sugarcane.\nOther islands and island groups, which cover just 12.5% of the land area and house some 16% of the population, include Taveuni southeast off Vanua Levu and Kadavu Island, south off Viti Levu (the third and fourth largest islands respectively), the Mamanuca Group (just off Nadi) and Yasawa Group (to the north of the Mamanucas), which are popular tourist destinations, the Lomaiviti Group (just off Suva) with Levuka, the former capital and the only major town on any of the smaller islands, located on the island of Ovalau, and the remote Lau Group over the Koro Sea to the east near Tonga, from which it is separated by the Lakeba Passage.\nTwo outlying regions are Rotuma, to the north, and the uninhabited coral atoll and cay Ceva-i-Ra or Conway Reef, to the southwest of main Fiji. Culturally conservative Rotuma with its 2,000 people on geographically belongs to Polynesia, and enjoys relative autonomy as a Fijian dependency.\nFiji Television reported on 21 September 2006 that the Fiji Islands Maritime and Safety Administration (FIMSA), while reviewing its outdated maritime charts, had discovered the possibility that more islands could lie within Fiji's Exclusive Economic Zone.\nMore than half of Fiji's population lives on the island coasts, either in Suva or in smaller urban centers.

Suva, the capital city, receives more rainfall than Nadi or the other side of Viti Levu. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events have significant impacts on rainfall. Tropical cyclones can impact Fiji and in some cases they can cause severe damage and many deaths. In 2016, Cyclone Winston caused widespread destruction and affected hundreds of thousands of people after striking Fiji. A few years later, Cyclone Harold also caused widespread damage. \nClimate change in Fiji is an exceptionally pressing issue for the country \u2013 as an island nation, Fiji is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, coastal erosion and extreme weather. These changes, along with temperature rise, will displace Fijian communities and will prove disruptive to the national economy \u2013 tourism, agriculture and fisheries, the largest contributors to the nation's GDP, will be severely impacted by climate change causing increases in poverty and food insecurity.

It is the second-largest confectionery brand in the world, after Mars. Cadbury is internationally headquartered in Greater London, and operates in more than 50 countries worldwide. It is known for its Dairy Milk chocolate, the Creme Egg and Roses selection box, and many other confectionery products. One of the best-known British brands, in 2013 \"The Daily Telegraph\" named Cadbury among Britain's most successful exports.\nCadbury was founded in 1824 in Birmingham, England, by John Cadbury (1801\u20131889), a Quaker who sold tea, coffee and drinking chocolate. Cadbury developed the business with his brother Benjamin, followed by his sons Richard and George. George developed the Bournville estate, a model village designed to give the company's workers improved living conditions. Dairy Milk chocolate, introduced by George Jr in 1905, used a higher proportion of milk in the recipe than rival products. By 1914, it was the company's best-selling product. Successive members of the Cadbury family have made innovations with chocolate products. Cadbury, Rowntree's and Fry's were the big three British confectionery manufacturers throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nCadbury was granted its first royal warrant from Queen Victoria in 1854. It held a royal warrant from Elizabeth II from 1955 to 2022. Cadbury merged with J. S. Fry &amp; Sons in 1919, and Schweppes in 1969, known as Cadbury Schweppes until 2008, when the American beverage business was split as Dr Pepper Snapple Group; the rights ownership of the Schweppes brand had already differed between various countries since 2006. In 1992, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the company for 24 years, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world. Cadbury was a constant constituent of the FTSE 100 on the London Stock Exchange from the index's 1984 inception until the company was bought by Kraft Foods Inc. in 2010.\nHistory.\n1800\u20131900: Early history.\nOn 4 March 1824, John Cadbury, a Quaker, began selling tea, coffee and drinking chocolate in Bull Street in Birmingham, England. From 1831, he moved into the production of a variety of cocoa and drinking chocolates, made in a factory in Bridge Street and sold mainly to the wealthy because of the high cost of production. In 1842, he started selling chocolate for eating, perhaps the first in Britain. In 1847, John Cadbury became a partner with his brother Benjamin and the company became known as \"Cadbury Brothers\". In 1847, Cadbury's competitor Fry's of Bristol produced the first chocolate bar (which would be mass-produced as Fry's Chocolate Cream in 1866). Cadbury introduced his brand of the chocolate bar in 1849, and that same year, Cadbury and Fry's chocolate bars were displayed publicly at a trade fair in Bingley Hall, Birmingham. The Cadbury brothers opened an office in London, and, in 1854, they received the royal warrant as manufacturers of chocolate and cocoa to Queen Victoria. The company went into decline in the late 1850s.\nJohn Cadbury's sons Richard and George took over the business in 1861. At the time of the takeover, the business was in rapid decline: the number of employees had reduced from 20 to 11, and the company was losing money. By 1866, Cadbury was profitable again. The brothers had turned around the business by moving the focus from tea and coffee to chocolate, and by increasing the quality of their products.\nThe firm's first major breakthrough occurred in 1866, when Richard and George introduced an improved cocoa into Britain. A new cocoa press developed in the Netherlands removed some of the unpalatable cocoa butter from the cocoa bean. The firm began exporting its products in the 1850s. In 1861, the company created Fancy Boxes (a decorated box of chocolates) and, in 1868, they were sold in boxes in the shape of a heart for Valentine's Day. Boxes of filled chocolates quickly became associated with the holiday.\nCadbury manufactured their first Easter egg in 1875, creating the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could be moulded into smooth shapes. By 1893, Cadbury had 19 different varieties of chocolate Easter egg on sale.\nIn 1878, the brothers decided to build new premises in countryside from Birmingham. The move to the countryside was unprecedented in business. Better transport access for milk that was shipped inward by canal, and cocoa that was brought in by rail from London, Southampton and Liverpool docks was taken into consideration. With the development of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway along the path of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, they acquired the Bournbrook estate, comprising of countryside south of Birmingham. Located next to the Stirchley Street railway station, which itself was opposite the canal, they renamed the estate Bournville and opened the Bournville factory in 1879. In 1891, the Cadbury brothers filed a patent for a chocolate-coated biscuit.\nIn 1893, George Cadbury bought of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a model village which would 'alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions'. By 1900, the estate included 314 cottages and houses set on of land. As the Cadbury family were Quakers, there were no pubs in the estate.\nIn 1897, following the lead of Swiss companies, Cadbury introduced its own line of milk chocolate bars. In 1899, Cadbury was incorporated as a private limited company at the Companies House in London.\n1900\u20131969.\nIn 1905, Cadbury launched its Dairy Milk bar, a high quality product with a greater proportion of milk than previous chocolate bars. Developed by George's son, George Cadbury Jr (along with his research and development team), it was the first time a British company had been able to mass-produce milk chocolate. From the beginning, it had the distinctive purple wrapper. It was a great sales success, and became the company's best-selling product by 1914. The stronger Bournville Cocoa line was introduced in 1906. Cadbury Dairy Milk and Bournville Cocoa were to provide the basis for the company's rapid pre-war expansion. In 1910, Cadbury sales overtook those of Fry for the first time.\nCadbury's Milk Tray was first produced in 1915 and continued in production throughout the remainder of the First World War. More than 2,000 of Cadbury's male employees joined the British Armed Forces, and to support the British war effort, Cadbury provided chocolate, books and clothing to the troops. George Cadbury handed over two company-owned buildings for use as hospitals \u2013 \"The Beeches\" and \"Fircroft\", and the management of both hospitals earned the War Office's highest award. Factory girls, dubbed 'The Cadbury Angels', volunteered to do the laundry of injured soldiers recovering in the hospitals. After the war, the Bournville factory was redeveloped and mass production began in earnest. In 1918, Cadbury opened their first overseas factory in Hobart, Tasmania. A trainline was also built for easier access to Hobart. Of the 16 women who came to Tasmania to set up the factory, seven are known to have returned to the UK, two married and stayed in Tasmania, two did not marry but stayed and five left no record.\nIn 1919, Cadbury merged with Fry's, resulting in the integration of well-known brands such as Fry's Chocolate Cream and Fry's Turkish Delight. In 1921, the many small Fry's factories around Bristol were closed down, and production was consolidated at a new Somerdale Factory, outside Bristol.\nCadbury expanded its product range with Flake (1920), Creme eggs (1923), Fruit and Nut (1928), and Crunchie (1929, originally under the Fry's label). By 1930, Cadbury was the 24th-largest British manufacturing company as measured by estimated market value of capital. Cadbury took direct control of the under-performing Fry in 1935. Dairy Milk Whole Nut arrived in 1933, and tins of Roses were introduced in 1938 (competing with Quality Street launched by Mackintosh's in 1936). Roses has become a very popular Christmas (and Mother's Day) gift.\nBy the mid-1930s, Cadbury estimated that 90 percent of the British population could readily afford to buy chocolate as it was no longer considered a luxury item for the working classes. By 1936, Dairy Milk accounted for 60 per cent of the UK milk chocolate market. Between the two world wars Cadbury sent test packages to British schoolchildren in exchange for their opinions on new products, one of whom, Roald Dahl, would later write the children's novel \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\".\nDuring the Second World War, parts of the Bournville factory were turned over to war work, producing milling machines and seats for fighter aircraft. Workers ploughed football fields to plant crops. As chocolate was regarded as an essential food, it was placed under government supervision for the entire war. The wartime rationing of chocolate ended in 1950, and normal production resumed. Cadbury subsequently invested in new factories and had an increasing demand for their products. In 1952 the Moreton factory was built.\nIn 1967, Cadbury acquired an Australian confectioner, MacRobertson's, beating a rival bid from Mars. As a result of the takeover, Cadbury built a 60 per cent market share in the Australian market.\nCadbury was a holder of a royal warrant issued by Queen Elizabeth II from 1955 to 2022. A warrant from King Charles III was held for a further two years, but was dropped in 2024.\nSchweppes merger (1969).\nCadbury merged with drinks company Schweppes to form Cadbury Schweppes in 1969. Head of Schweppes, Lord Watkinson, became chairman, and Adrian Cadbury became deputy chairman and managing director. The benefits of the merger were to prove elusive. The merger put an end to Cadbury's close links to its Quaker founding family.\nIn 1978, the company acquired Peter Paul, the third largest chocolate manufacturer in the United States for $58 million, which gave it a 10 per cent share of the world's largest confectionery market. The successful Wispa chocolate bar was launched in the North East of England in 1981, and nationwide in 1984. In 1982, trading profits were greater outside of Britain than in the UK for the first time.\nIn 1986, Cadbury Schweppes sold its Beverages and Foods division to a management buyout known as Premier Brands for \u00a397 million. This saw the company divest itself of such brands as Typhoo Tea, Kenco, Smash and Hartley Chivers jam. It also saw Premier take the licence for production of Cadbury brand biscuits and drinking chocolate.\nMeanwhile, Schweppes switched its alliance in the UK from Pepsi to Coca-Cola, taking a 51 per cent stake in the joint venture Coca-Cola Schweppes. The acquisition of Canada Dry doubled its worldwide drinks market share, and it took a 30 per cent stake in Dr Pepper. As a result of these acquisitions, Cadbury Schweppes became the third largest soft drinks manufacturer in the world. In August 1988, the company sold its U.S. confectionery operations to Hershey's for $284.5 million cash plus the assumption of $30 million in debt.\nIn 1992, company chairman Sir Adrian Cadbury produced the Cadbury Report (via the Cadbury committee set up by the London Stock Exchange), a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world. In 1993, Cadbury Schweppes acquired A&amp;W. In 1995, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies. In 1999, Cadbury Schweppes sold its worldwide beverage businesses to The Coca-Cola Company except in North America and continental Europe for $700 million.\nSnapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45\u00a0billion. In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc. In 2003, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Adams, the US chewing gum operations of Pfizer Inc., for $4.2\u00a0billion, making Cadbury the world's biggest confectionery company. In 2005, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Green &amp; Black's for \u00a320 million.\nSchweppes demerger.\nIn March 2007, it was revealed that Cadbury Schweppes was planning to split its business into two separate entities: one focusing on its main chocolate and confectionery market; the other on its US drinks business. The demerger took effect on 2 May 2008, with the drinks business becoming Dr Pepper Snapple Group and Cadbury Schweppes plc becoming Cadbury plc. In December 2008 it was announced that Cadbury was to sell its Australian beverage unit to Asahi Breweries.\n2007\u20132010.\nIn October 2007, Cadbury announced the closure of the Somerdale Factory, in Keynsham, Somerset, formerly part of Fry's. Between 500 and 700 jobs were affected by this change. Production transferred to other plants in England and Poland.\nIn 2008, Monkhill Confectionery, the Own Label trading division of Cadbury Trebor Bassett was sold to Tangerine Confectionery for \u00a358\u00a0million. This sale included factories at Pontefract, Cleckheaton and York and a distribution centre near Chesterfield, and the transfer of around 800 employees.\nIn mid-2009, Cadbury replaced some of the cocoa butter in their non-UK chocolate products with palm oil. Despite stating this was a response to consumer demand to improve taste and texture, there was no \"new improved recipe\" claim placed on New Zealand labels. Consumer backlash was significant from environmentalists and chocolate lovers in both Australia and New Zealand, with consumers objecting to both the taste from the cheaper formulation, and the use of palm oil given its role in the destruction of rainforests. By August 2009, the company announced that it was reverting to the use of cocoa butter in New Zealand and Australia, although palm oil is still listed as an ingredient in Cadbury's flavoured sugar syrup based fillings (where it referred to as 'vegetable oil'). In addition, Cadbury stated it would source cocoa beans through Fair Trade channels. In January 2010 prospective buyer Kraft pledged to honour Cadbury's commitment.\nAcquisition and subsidiary (2009\u20132023).\nOn 7 September 2009, Kraft Foods made a \u00a310.2\u00a0billion (US$16.2 billion) indicative takeover bid for Cadbury. The offer was rejected, with Cadbury stating that it undervalued the company. Kraft launched a formal, hostile bid for Cadbury, valuing the firm at \u00a39.8\u00a0billion on 9 November 2009. The UK Business Secretary Peter Mandelson warned Kraft not to try to \"make a quick buck\" from the acquisition of Cadbury.\nOn 19 January 2010, it was announced that Cadbury and Kraft Foods had reached a deal and that Kraft would purchase Cadbury for \u00a38.40 per share, valuing Cadbury at \u00a311.5bn (US$18.9bn). Kraft, which issued a statement stating that the deal will create a \"global confectionery leader\", had to borrow \u00a37\u00a0billion (US$11.5bn) in order to finance the takeover.\nThe Hershey Company, based in Pennsylvania, manufactures and distributes Cadbury-branded chocolate (but not its other confectionery) in the United States and has been reported to share Cadbury's \"ethos\". Hershey had expressed an interest in buying Cadbury because it would broaden its access to faster-growing international markets. But on 22 January 2010, Hershey announced that it would not counter Kraft's final offer.\nThe acquisition of Cadbury faced widespread disapproval from the British public, as well as groups and organisations including trade union Unite, who fought against the acquisition of the company which, according to Prime Minister Gordon Brown, was very important to the British economy. Unite estimated that a takeover by Kraft could put 30,000 jobs \"at risk\", and UK shareholders protested over the mergers and acquisitions advisory fees charged by banks. Cadbury's M&amp;A advisers were UBS, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Controversially, RBS, a bank 84% owned by the United Kingdom Government, funded the Kraft takeover.\nOn 2 February 2010, Kraft secured over 71% of Cadbury's shares thus finalising the deal. Kraft had needed to reach 75% of the shares in order to be able to delist Cadbury from the stock market and fully integrate it as part of Kraft. This was achieved on 5 February, and the company announced that Cadbury shares would be de-listed on 8 March. On 3 February, the Chairman Roger Carr, chief executive Todd Stitzer and chief financial officer Andrew Bonfield all announced their resignations. Stitzer had worked at the company for 27 years. On 9 February, Kraft announced that it was planning to close the Somerdale Factory, Keynsham, with the loss of 400 jobs. The management explained that existing plans to move production to Poland were too advanced to be realistically reversed, though assurances had been given regarding sustaining the plant. Staff at Keynsham criticised this move, suggesting that they felt betrayed and as if they have been \"sacked twice\". On 22 April 2010, Phil Rumbol, the man behind the famous Cadbury \"Gorilla\" advertisement, announced his plans to leave the Cadbury company in July following Kraft's takeover.\nThe European Commission decided that Kraft would have to divest Cadbury's confectionery businesses in Poland (Wedel) and Romania (Kandia). In June 2010, the Polish division, Cadbury-Wedel, was sold to Lotte of Korea. As part of the deal Kraft kept the Cadbury, Hall's and other brands along with two plants in Skarbimierz. Lotte took over the plant in Warsaw along with the E Wedel brand. Kandia was sold back to the Meinl family, which had owned the brand from 2003 to 2007.\nOn 4 August 2011, Kraft Foods announced it would be splitting into two companies beginning on 1 October 2012. The snack and confectionery business of Kraft became Mondelez International, of which Cadbury would become a subsidiary.\nIn response to diminishing margins in early 2014, Mondelez hired Accenture to implement a US$3 billion cost-cutting programme of the company's assets including Cadbury and Oreo. Beginning in 2015, Mondelez began closing Cadbury factories in several developed countries including Ireland, Canada, the United States, and New Zealand and shifting production to \"advantaged\" country locations like China, India, Brazil, and Mexico. The closure of Cadbury factories in centres such as Dublin, Montreal, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Dunedin in New Zealand generated outcries from the local populations. The plan received approval from several market shareholders including the Australian and New Zealand banks Westpac and ASB Bank.\nIn January 2017, Cadbury became the official snack partner of the Premier League, and sponsored the Premier League Golden Boot and Premier League Golden Glove awards.\n200th anniversary: 2024\u2013present.\nOn 8 January 2024, Mondelez International announced plans to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Cadbury, including: promotions, celebrations, and seven retro packaging designs for its Cadbury Dairy Milk bars.\nOn 17 March 2024, Cadbury celebrated their bicentenary by unveiling their newly refurbished UK archive. The new archive which cost \u00a3350,000, documents over 50,000 Cadbury items including; packaging history, artworks, and discontinued products. With Mondel\u0113z International planning on opening the archive to the public at a later date.\nOn 23 December 2024, it was announced that after 170 years of its association with the British monarchy, since the reign of Queen Victoria, Cadbury would now no longer hold its Royal Warrant under King Charles III. \nWhile no reason was given, the King had been urged by campaign group B4Ukraine to withdraw warrants from companies \"still operating in Russia\" after the invasion of Ukraine, with Mondelez and consumer goods firm Unilever (who also lost its royal warrant) among those named. In a statement by a Mondelez spokesperson: \"Whilst we are disappointed to be one of hundreds of other businesses and brands in the UK [...] to not have a new warrant awarded, we are proud to have previously held one, and we fully respect the decision.\"\nOperations.\nHead office.\nCadbury has its head office at Cadbury House in the Uxbridge Business Park in Uxbridge, Greater London, England.\nThe company occupies of leased space inside Building 3 of the business park, which it shares with Mondelez's UK division. After acquiring Cadbury, Kraft confirmed that the company would remain at Cadbury House.\nCadbury relocated to Uxbridge Business Park from its previous head office at 25 Berkeley Square in Mayfair, City of Westminster in 2007 as a cost-saving measure. In 1992, the company leased the space for \u00a355 per square foot (0.093 m2); by 2002 this had reached \u00a368.75 per square foot.\nProduction sites.\nBournville.\nLocated south of Birmingham in England, the Cadbury plant in Bournville was opened in 1879 by company founder John Cadbury's son George, whose aim was that one-tenth of the Bournville estate should be \"laid out and used as parks, recreation grounds and open space.\" It subsequently became known as \"the factory in a garden\". Cadbury's dark chocolate bar, Bournville, is named after the model village, and was first sold in 1908.\nBournville employs almost 1,000 people. In 2014, Mondelez announced a \u00a375 million investment in the site, with Cadbury stating it \"reinforces Bournville's position at the heart of the British chocolate industry\".\nBournville is home to Mondelez's Global Centre of Excellence for chocolate research and development, so every new chocolate product created by Cadbury starts life at the Birmingham plant.\nMarkets.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe confectionery business in the UK is called Cadbury (formerly Cadbury Trebor Bassett) and, as of August 2004, had eight factories and 3,000 staff in the UK. Mondelez also sells biscuits bearing the Cadbury brand, such as Cadbury Fingers. Mondelez also owns Fry's and Maynards Bassetts (created by merging Bassett's with Maynards).\nIce cream based on Cadbury products, like 99 Flake, is made under licence by Frederick's Dairies. Cadbury cakes and chocolate spread are manufactured under licence by Premier Foods, but the cakes were originally part of Cadbury Foods Ltd with factories at Blackpole in Worcester and Moreton on the Wirral, with distribution depots throughout the UK.\nOther Kraft subsidiaries in the UK include Cadbury Two LLP, Cadbury UK Holdings Limited, Cadbury US Holdings Limited, Cadbury Four LLP, Cadbury Holdings Limited, and Cadbury One LLP.\nAccording to the environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy, Cadbury chocolate wrappers along with Walkers crisps packets and Coca-Cola cans were the three top brands that were the most common pieces of rubbish found in UK streets in 2013. In 2014, Cadbury Dairy Milk was ranked the best-selling chocolate bar in the UK. A 2018 YouGov poll saw Cadbury's Chocolate Digestives ranked the second most popular biscuit in the UK after McVitie's Chocolate Digestives.\nIreland.\nCadbury Ireland Limited is based in Coolock in Dublin, where the headquarters of Cadbury Ireland are located, and Rathmore, County Kerry. Products made by Cadbury in Ireland include Cadbury Dairy Milk Range, Cadbury Twirl, Cadbury Cadbury Snacks Range Flake and Boost (formerly Moro). Cadbury used to produce the Time Out bar in Ireland for the European market however this production was moved to Poland.\nUnited States.\nCadbury Adams USA produces candy, gum, breath mints and cough drops. It is headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey. The company was formed after the then Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Adams brand from Pfizer in December 2002 for US$4.2 billion.\nAmerican Chicle was purchased by Warner\u2013Lambert in 1962; Warner-Lambert renamed the unit Adams in 1997 and merged with Pfizer in 2000.\nPrevious Operations.\nIn 1978, Cadbury USA merged with Peter Paul, makers of Mounds and Almond Joy. In 1988, Cadbury US was sold to The Hershey Company for $300\u00a0million. As part of the deal, Hershey acquired the U.S. rights to manufacture Cadbury products, causing complaints by consumers, who claim the Hershey-made products are inferior to the originals. Before the May 2008 demerger, the North American business also contained beverage unit Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages. In 1982, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Duffy-Mott Company.\nCadbury products in the US.\nMaynards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChocolate-related (Made by Hershey)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGum\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther\nDiscontinued products\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAustralia.\nCadbury's products were first imported into Australia as early as 1853, when three cases of Cadbury's cocoa and chocolate were advertised for sale in Adelaide. Cadbury's first overseas order in 1881 was made for the Australian market. In 1919, as part of its plans to expand internationally, the company decided to build a factory in Australia. Tasmania was chosen as the location of Cadbury's first factory outside of the United Kingdom, due to its close proximity to the city of Hobart, good source of inexpensive hydro-electricity and plentiful supply of high-quality fresh milk. Cadbury's Claremont was modelled on Bournville, with its own village and sporting facilities.\nThe first products from Claremont were sold in 1922.\nCadbury's Claremont was once a popular tourist attraction and operated daily tours; however, the factory ceased running full tours mid-2008, citing health and safety reasons.\nCadbury has been upgrading its manufacturing facility at Claremont, Tasmania, Australia, since 2001.\nCadbury's Claremont is the largest chocolate factory in the Southern Hemisphere, producing a company-record of over of chocolate in 2021. Cadbury also operates a milk-processing plant in Cooee, Tasmania and two other factories in Melbourne, Victoria (Ringwood and Scoresby).\nOn 27 February 2009, the confectionery and beverages businesses of Cadbury Schweppes in Australia were formally separated and the beverages business began operating as Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd. In April 2009, Schweppes Australia was acquired by Asahi Breweries.\nIn 2015, the Australian Cadbury factory, located in Hobart, reduced its work force by 80 and in 2017 closed its visitor's centre. In August 2017, Cadbury announced that 50 workers will be shed from its Hobart factory. Within Australia there is debate regarding halal certification. Many of Cadbury's products are halal certified. This certification has generated controversy, especially from One Nation politician Pauline Hanson.\nNew Zealand.\nCadbury had also operated a factory in Dunedin in New Zealand's South Island until its closure in March 2018. In 1930, Cadbury partnered with local confectionery businessman Richard Hudson, who owned a chocolate, confectionery, biscuit factory on Castle Street. Hudson's factory was rebranded as Cadbury Hudson and later became known as the Cadbury Confectionery. Cadbury later established a second factory in Auckland in the North Island. In 2003, Cadbury established a tourist attraction on the premises of the Dunedin factory known as Cadbury World, which featured a large chocolate waterfall. In 2007, Cadbury closed down its Auckland factory, leading to the loss of 200 jobs. In 2009, the Cadbury Dunedin factory attracted criticism from consumers and local environmentalists when it replaced cocoa butter with palm oil. In response, the company backtracked but still retained palm oil as a filling in some ingredients. Over the next several years, Cadbury began downsizing its products, including trimming chocolate blocks in 2015.\nOn 16 February 2017, it was reported that Cadbury would be closing its factory in Dunedin, New Zealand by March 2018. This is estimated to lead to the loss of 350 jobs. Amanda Banfield, Mondelez's vice-president for Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, clarified that the closure was done due to Mondelez's decision to shift chocolate manufacturing to Cadbury's Australian factories. However, Mondelez has also confirmed that Dunedin's Cadbury World tourist attraction would remain open due to its popularity with tourists.\nFollowing four weeks of consultations with local Cadbury employees, the Mayor of Dunedin Dave Cull, and local trade union representatives, Banfield confirmed that the closure would go ahead the following year due to the lack of viable options to continue production in New Zealand. She also confirmed that Cadbury would offer a redundancy support package to staff and would also sponsor staff willing to move to Australia to work. Mondelez also confirmed that it was looking for a third-party manufacturer to continue making Cadbury's New Zealand brands Pineapple Lumps, Jaffas, Chocolate Fish and Buzz Bar. In early June 2017, local city councillor Jim O'Malley and a group of volunteers launched a crowdfunding campaign to keep the Dunedin factory running on a portion of the site. They formed a group called Dunedin Manufacturing Holdings (DMH). Despite generating NZ$6 million in funds, DMH abandoned its bid on 22 June due to Mondelez's stringent production and supply requirements and difficulties in acquiring manpower and machinery. Mondelez has also indicated that it is negotiating with two local chocolate companies to ensure the production of iconic local brands such as Pineapple Lumps, Jaffas, Chocolate Fish, Buzz Bars, and Pinky Bars in New Zealand.\nOn 17 October 2017, Cadbury announced that it would be shifting all production of its New Zealand brands to Australia after failing to find a local supplier. The termination of New Zealand production took effect in March 2018. Mondelez's New Zealand country head James Kane confirmed the shift on the grounds that the production of Cadbury products would require certain technologies, production processes and skills that local New Zealand manufacturers lacked.\nOn 4 May, it was reported that the Dunedin Cadbury World would be closing down after the Ministry of Health purchased the entire former Cadbury factory site to make way for a new public hospital. Mondelez area vice-president Banfield confirmed that Cadbury had sold the former factory site to the Ministry of Health for an undisclosed amount.\nCanada.\nCadbury's Canadian head office is located in Toronto. Cadbury Canada produce and import several products that are sold under the Cadbury and Maynards labels, including the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCadbury Canada is now part of Mondelez Canada and products are featured on the Snackworks website.\nIndia.\nIn 1948, Cadbury India began its operations in India by importing chocolates. On 19 July 1948, Cadbury was incorporated in India. It now has manufacturing facilities in Thane, Induri (Pune) and Malanpur (Bhind), Hyderabad, Bangalore and Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) and sales offices in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. The corporate head office is in Mumbai. The head office is presently situated at Pedder Road, Mumbai, under the name of \"Cadbury House\". Since 1965 Cadbury has also pioneered the development of cocoa cultivation in India. For over two decades, Cadbury has worked with the Kerala Agricultural University to undertake cocoa research.\nCurrently, Cadbury India operates in five categories \u2013 Chocolate confectionery, Beverages, Biscuits, Gum and Candy. Its products include Cadbury Dairy Milk, Dairy Milk Silk, Bournville, Temptations, Perk, Eclairs, Bournvita, Celebrations, Gems, Bubbaloo, Cadbury Dairy Milk Shots, Halls, Bilkul, Tang, and Oreo.\nIt is the Indian market leader in the chocolate confectionery business with a market share of over 70%. On 21 April 2014, Cadbury India changed its name to Mondelez India Foods Limited. In 2017, Cadbury/Mondelez agreed to pay a $13 million FCPA penalty for making illicit payments to government officials to obtain licences and approvals to build a factory in Baddi.\nIssues.\nIn 2003, \"Businessworld\" in India reported there were 'Insects found in Cadbury's chocolates'. In 2021, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) carried out raids in Haryana and Himachal on Cadbury India Ltd premises. CBI filed FIR against Cadbury for corruption in connection with obtaining Himachal factory licence. CBI said Cadbury allegedly conspired with central excise officials between 2009 and 2011 and availed excise benefits to the tune of Rs 241 crore for its new unit in Himachal Pradesh.\nMalta.\nIn 2012, Alf Mizzi &amp; Sons Marketing (Ltd) took over the importation and distribution of Cadbury, as well as several other Mondelez brands. Most of the Cadbury products are imported directly from the UK. The advertising of the brand was taken over by Sloane Ltd., which proved to be highly successful in creating market specific commercials, reaching more of the Maltese population than ever through digital advertising.\nSouth Africa.\nCadbury was introduced to South Africa in 1903 by the Cadbury brothers, Richard and George. The brothers appointed a sales agent to sell their products to the locals. The brand's popularity grew such that in 1926, the South African arm of Cadbury was formed and plans were made to construct a local chocolate manufacturing plant.\nCadbury broke ground with a chocolate plant in Port Elizabeth in 1930. By 1938, the first locally produced moulded Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate slabs were produced. The first slabs of chocolate produced were the \"Milk, Nut Milk, Milk Fruit, Nut Brazil, Fruit &amp; Nut and Bournville\" variety of Cadbury products.\nIn the 1950s, the Port Elizabeth factory was expanded to include a new laboratory in order to start producing new products, such as the \"Flake\" and \"Crunchie Bar\" (1960s). By the 1970s, the factory was expanded again to add a new Raw Materials Store and crumb silos. These have since become a local landmark. The same factory still produces some of the supply of Cadbury chocolate in South Africa.\nIn 2011, Kraft Foods, the company that then owned Cadbury, announced that it would be launching a fair-trade Dairy Milk chocolate bar on the South African market. The product had been available in other countries where Cadbury operated since 2009. The South African operation of Cadbury has a completely Africa-based supply chain, with cocoa beans bought in Ghana and the chocolate bars made in the factory at Port Elizabeth.\nAdvertising.\nThe Cadbury script logo is derived from the signature of William Cadbury, the founder's grandson, in 1921. It was adopted as the worldwide logo in the 1970s. Adopting purple as the company's colour in 1905 to honour Queen Victoria who had died four years prior, Cadbury famously trademarked purple for chocolates with registrations in 1995 and 2004. However, the validity of these trademarks is the matter of an ongoing legal dispute following objections by Nestl\u00e9.\nIn 1928, Cadbury's introduced the \"glass and a half\" slogan to accompany the Cadbury Dairy Milk bar, to advertise the bar's higher milk content. The Creme Egg slogan, \"How do you eat yours?\", inviting people to think about how they eat their eggs, was introduced in 1985. The brand has used immersive experiential marketing campaigns which include a Double Decker fun bus, Joy Generator machine and pop-up cafes. Cadbury has had famous names on their products, such as a Paddington Bear-branded chocolate bar in 1977, and Spice Girls-branded chocolate (chocolate bars, selection boxes, Easter Eggs) at the height of their 1990s success.\nFour commercials for Cadbury products on British television featured in the top 50 of Channel 4's 2000 UK poll of the \"100 Greatest Adverts\". Cadbury Flake, featuring Flake Girl from 1959 onward, was ranked 26th, Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit &amp; Nut, featuring the slogan \"Everyone's a fruit and nutcase\" from 1977 onward, sung by comedian Frank Muir, ranked 36th, Fry's Turkish Delight, with the slogan \"Full of Eastern Promise\" from 1957 onward, which included model Jane Lumb, ranked 37th, and Cadbury Milk Tray (which since 1968 has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to secretively deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady), the \"Avalanche\" advert where he races ahead of it to deliver the chocolates, ranked 48th. The 2007 \"Gorilla\" television commercial promoting Cadbury Dairy Milk \u2013 featuring Phil Collins \"In the Air Tonight\" \u2013 won numerous awards, including Gold at the British Television Advertising Awards in 2008.\nEvery year Cadbury also launches a Secret Santa campaign which features offline and online advertisements. The brand also tours the UK's major cities encouraging people to anonymously give their loved ones a free chocolate bar. Cadbury has specifically designed booths for the occasion but in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic the campaign was done virtually.\nProducts.\n \nMajor chocolate brands produced by Cadbury include the bars Dairy Milk, Crunchie, Double Decker, Caramel, Wispa, Boost, Picnic, Flake, Curly Wurly, Chomp, and Fudge; chocolate Buttons; the boxed chocolate brand Milk Tray; and the twist-wrapped chocolates Heroes which are most popular around holidays, such as Christmas and Halloween (Cadbury Goo Heads (similar to Creme Eggs) are released for Halloween). Selection boxes (containing a selection of Cadbury bars and sweets) is a staple Christmas gift of chocolate, a tradition that in Britain goes back over a century (as are Cadbury Roses since the late 1930s). Creme Eggs are only sold between New Year's Day (or sometimes Boxing Day) and Easter\u2014it is the most popular chocolate in the UK during this period, outselling its closest rival by 2 to 1.\nAs well as Cadbury's chocolate, the company also owns Maynards and Halls, and is associated with several types of confectionery including former Trebor and Bassett's brands or products such as Liquorice Allsorts, Jelly Babies, Flumps, Mints, Black Jack chews, Trident gum, and Softmints. Global sales of Cadbury products amounted to \u00a3491\u00a0million in the 52 weeks to 16 August 2014.\nNotable product introductions include:\nIncidents.\n2006 salmonella scare.\nOn 20 January 2006, Cadbury Schweppes detected a strain of the \"Salmonella\" montevideo (SmvdX07) bacteria, affecting seven of its products. The contamination was caused by a leaking pipe, from which waste water dripped onto a chocolate crumb production line at the company's plant in Marlbrook, Herefordshire. It was not until around six months after the leak was detected that Cadbury Schweppes notified the Food Standards Agency, a delay which Cadbury Schweppes was unable to explain satisfactorily, and for which it was criticised. The Food Standards Agency ordered the company to recall more than a million chocolate bars. In December 2006, the company announced that the cost of dealing with the incident reached \u00a330 million.\nIn April 2007, Birmingham City Council announced that it would be prosecuting Cadbury Schweppes in relation to three alleged offences of breaching food safety legislation. At that time, the Health Protection Agency identified 37 people who had been infected with Salmonella montevideo. One of the alleged victims had to be kept on a hospital isolation ward for five days after eating a Cadbury's caramel bar. An investigation that was carried by Herefordshire Council led to a further six charges being brought. The company pleaded guilty to all nine charges, and was fined one million pounds at Birmingham Crown Court \u2014 the sentencing of both cases was brought together. Analysts have said the fine is not material to the group, with mitigating factors limiting the fine being that the company quickly admitted its guilt and said it had been mistaken that the infection did not pose a threat to health.\n2007 recalls.\nOn 10 February 2007, Cadbury recalled some of its Easter eggs due to a labelling error. The products were produced in a factory handling nuts, potential allergens, but this was not made clear on the packaging. Cadbury said the products were \"perfectly safe\" for people without nut allergies to eat.\nOn 14 September 2007, Cadbury Schweppes investigated a manufacturing error over allergy warning, recalling for the second time in two years thousands of chocolate bars. A printing mistake at Somerdale Factory resulted in the omission of tree nut allergy labels from 250g Dairy Milk Double Chocolate bars.\n2008 melamine contamination in China.\nOn 29 September 2008, Cadbury withdrew all of its 11 chocolate products made in its three Beijing factories, on suspicion of contamination with melamine. The recall affected the mainland China markets, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia. Products recalled included Dark Chocolate, a number of products in the 'Dairy Milk' range and Chocolate Eclairs.\n2014 pork traces in Malaysia.\nCadbury recalled two chocolate products after it was tested positive for traces of pork DNA, namely Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut and Cadbury Dairy Milk Roast Almond. The traces were found during a periodic check for non-halal ingredients in food products by the Ministry of Health in Malaysia which on 24 May 2014 said two of three samples of the company's products may contain pork traces.\nOn 2 June 2014, Malaysia's Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM) declared that the sample did not contain pig DNA, as claimed in earlier reports. This statement was made after new tests were conducted.\nJAKIM reportedly said in a statement that it tested 11 samples of Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut, Cadbury Dairy Milk Roast Almond and other products from the company's factory but none of them tested positive for pork. The investigation followed reports that unscheduled checks had shown that two chocolates produced by Mondelez International Inc., the parent company of Cadbury, violated Islamic law and led to a boycott of all its products in the country.\n2017 \"Easter\" controversy.\nIn 2017, the Church of England condemned the company and the National Trust for rebranding their annual \"Easter Egg Trails\" as \"Cadbury Egg Hunts\". Prime Minister Theresa May called the rebranding \"absolutely ridiculous\"; however, Cadbury dismissed the criticism, with a spokesperson saying, \"it is clear to see that within our communications we visibly state the word Easter. It is included a number of times across promotional materials.\" An ensuing controversy followed in Australia, where Cadbury was accused of removing the word 'Easter' from the packaging of its Easter eggs. Cadbury Australia responded that Easter was mentioned on \"the back of [the] pack\", and that its eggs were obviously Easter eggs.\n2019 \"Cadbury Treasures\" campaign.\nIn the run-up to Easter 2019, Cadbury launched a \"Treasures\" promotion in the UK and Ireland that, as well as listing treasure exhibits in various museums, unintentionally encouraged people to engage in illegal metal-detecting and digging at protected archaeological sites around the British Isles in search of further treasure. This prompted a highly critical reaction from archaeologists.\n2022 Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" child labour claims.\nIn 2022, \"Cadbury Exposed: Dispatches\" aired on Channel 4 revealed child labour in cocoa farming for Cadbury chocolate. Mondelez International initially refused to comment before releasing a statement after the programme had aired. The network's journalists claimed Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put had \"refused to be interviewed\" but the company \"did not dispute our findings (and were) deeply concerned by the incidents documented by Dispatches and would launch an investigation.\"\n2023 Listeria recall.\nIn May 2023, Muller recalled six Cadbury desserts because of the possible presence of listeria, described as a \"precautionary measure\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

The Fijian Bureau of Statistics (FBOS) has performed this task since 1996, the first enumerated Fiji census when an independent country. The 2017 census found that the permanent population of Fiji was 884,887, compared to 837,271 in the 2007 census. The population density at the time in 2007 was 45.8\u00a0inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Fiji was 67\u00a0years. Since the 1930s the population of Fiji has increased at a rate of 1.1% per year. Since the 1950s, Fiji's birth rate has continuously exceeded its death rate. The population is dominated by the 15\u201364 age segment. The median age of the population was 27.9, and the gender ratio of the total population was 1.03\u00a0males per 1\u00a0female.\nIndigenous Fijians, the native inhabitants of Fiji, are a mixture of Polynesian and Melanesian, resulting from the original migrations to the South Pacific over time. The Indo-Fijian population increased rapidly from the 61,000 people brought from the Indian subcontinent (modern day India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) between 1879 and 1916 to work in the sugarcane fields, many who later would lease/own the sugar cane plantations.\nIn 1977 \"The Economist\" reported that ethnic Fijians were a minority of 255,000, in a total population of 600,000 of which fully half were of Indian descent, with the remainder Chinese, European and of mixed ancestry.\nThe native Fijians live throughout the country, while the Indo-Fijians reside primarily near the urban centres and in the cane-producing areas of the two main islands. Nearly all of the indigenous Fijians are Christian, with some two-thirds being Methodist. The Indo-Fijians, by contrast, have a similar religious mix as India today: some 76.7% percent of the Indo-Fijians are Hindu, with a further almost 16% being Muslim and 6\u00a0percent Christian. There are also a few Sikhs.\nA national census is supposed to be conducted every ten years, but the census intended for 2006 was postponed until 2007. Finance Minister Ratu Jone Kubuabola announced on 27 October 2005 that the Cabinet had decided that it would not be in the country's interest to have a census and a general election in the same year. \"Peoples\u2019 focus on the elections could have an impact on their cooperation with census officials\", he said. The Statistics Office supported Kubuabola's announcement, saying that public interest in the general election would likely distract people's attention from the census, making it problematic to conduct.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStructure of the population.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population by Sex and Age Group (Census 17.IX.2017):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population Estimates by Sex and Age Group (17.IX.2021):\nRegistered births and deaths.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nEthnic groups.\nAt the time of the 2017 census the largest ethnic group of Fiji was the iTaukei (Indigenous Fijians) with 555,499 members (62.8%), followed by the Indo-Fijian population with 289,237 members (32.7%), while other ethnicities constituted 40,151 individuals combined (4.5%). Other ethnicities include Chinese, European, Jewish, as well as non-Fijian Pacific Islanders ethnicities, including the Banaban people in Rabi Island. The only autochthonous minority are Rotumans from Fiji dependency Rotuma island with 1,594 people (of all ethnicities) living at Rotuma itself (2017 census) and ~9,000 or up to 20,000 Rotumans living across the Fiji archipelago.\nCompared to previous censuses, the 2017 census indicated that the iTaukei population had been growing during the 1996-2017 period at the rate of 1.6-1.7% per annum, while the Indo-Fijian population had been slowly declining at the rate of 0.8% per year.\nAccording to the 2007 Census of Fiji, the number of iTaukei Fijians increased from 393,575 in 1996 to 475,739, while the number of Indo-Fijians decreased from 338,818 to 313,798. According to government statistics, the latest estimated population of Indigenous Fijians is counted at 511,838, while there are 290,129 Indians and 56,071 Others (January 2012).\nReligion.\n\u2020 Includes atheists and agnostics.\nSource: https://\nAs of the end of 2006 the LDS church reports 14,448 members in Fiji, which equal about 1.4% of the population.

{"id": "54575", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54575", "title": "Politics of Fiji", "text": "The politics of Fiji take place within the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic. Fiji has a multiparty system with the Prime Minister of Fiji as head of government. The executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Parliament of Fiji. The judiciary is mostly independent of the executive and the legislature.\nFollowing the 2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat, the power was subsumed by the military. Nominal head of state Ratu Josefa Iloilo abolished the Constitution of Fiji and dismissed all Courts, after the Court of Appeal ruled that the post-coup Bainimarama government was illegal. A new Constitution was made known to the public in September 2013, and a general election was held in September 2014, won by Bainimarama's FijiFirst Party.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated Fiji as a \"hybrid regime\" in 2018.\nConstitutional structure.\nExecutive branch.\nFiji's Head of State is the president. He is elected by Parliament of Fiji after nomination by the prime minister or the Leader of the Opposition, for a three-year term. Although his role is largely an honorary one, modelled after that of the British Monarchy, the president has certain \"reserve powers\" that may be used in the event of a national crisis. In practice, attempts by the president to assert the reserve powers have proved problematic. In 2000, in the midst of a civilian coup d'\u00c9tat against the elected government, President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara announced on 27 May that he was assuming executive authority, but was evidently forced to resign two days later by the military commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama.\nThe president is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\nActual executive power is in the hands of the cabinet, presided over by the prime minister. The prime minister is elected by Parliament, under the 2013 Constitution of Fiji.\nUnder the former constitution, which was abrogated at the behest of the military-backed interim government in 2009, the prime minister was formally appointed by the president, but had to be acceptable to a majority of the House of Representatives. In practice, this usually reduced the president's role to little more than a formality, with the position automatically going to the leader of the political party or coalition that controlled a majority of seats.\nThere were times, however, when there was no clear majority in the House of Representatives. The parliamentary election of 1992 was inconclusive, and the position of the largest party, the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei, was further undermined by subsequent defections. On such occasions, the president had to take on the role of an arbitrator. After consulting with all the parliamentary factions, he would appoint as prime minister the person he judged to be the most acceptable to the majority in the House of Representatives. If no such person could be found, the president was required to order a new election.\nAnother situation requiring presidential intervention arose following the 1999 election. The People's Coalition won a landslide victory; with the largest party in the coalition, the Fiji Labour Party, winning a majority in its own right. Some of the smaller parties in the coalition expressed unease at the prospect of Mahendra Chaudhry, the Labour Party leader and an Indo-Fijian, becoming prime minister, saying that he would be unacceptable to indigenous Fijian voters that they represented. President Mara, however, persuaded them to accept Chaudhry as prime minister.\nThe cabinet, consisting of around 10 to 25 ministers, is formally appointed by the president on the nomination of the prime minister.\nAccording to the former 1997 constitution, the cabinet was supposed to reflect the political composition of the House of Representatives, with every party holding more than 8 seats in the House entitled to proportionate representation in the cabinet. In practice, this rule was never strictly implemented. In 1999, Chaudhry refused to give Ministerial posts to the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), saying that its demands were unacceptable. From 2001 to 2004, Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, whose coalition dominated by his Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua had narrowly won the 2001 election, refused to include the Fiji Labour Party in his cabinet, and avoided implementing several subsequent Supreme Court verdicts ordering him to do so by appealing each successive verdict, until the Labour Party announced late in 2004 that it was no longer interested in joining the cabinet. Under the 2013 Constitution, the Cabinet is no longer required to reflect the political composition of Parliament.\nThe FijiFirst party, led by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, won outright majority in the country\u2019s 51-seat parliament both in 2014 election and narrowly in 2018 election. In October 2021, Tui Macuata Ratu Wiliame Katonivere was elected the new president of Fiji by the parliament.\nOn 24 December 2022, Sitiveni Rabuka, the head of the People\u2019s Alliance (PAP), became Fiji\u2019s 12th prime minister, succeeding Bainimarama, following the December 2022 general election.\nLegislative branch.\nUnder the 2013 Constitution, Fiji's Parliament is unicameral. Its 50 members are elected for four-year terms by Party-list proportional representation, with the entire country voting as a single constituency. To win election to Parliament, a political party (or an independent candidate) must win five percent of the total valid vote nationwide. Fiji's system differs from that of many other countries using the party-list system, however, in that voters do not vote for a party, as such, but for an individual candidate. Each voter is allowed to vote for only one candidate. The votes for all candidates on a party ticket are pooled, their aggregate as a percentage of the total valid vote (minus votes cast for parties falling short of the five-percent threshold) determining the number of seats in Parliament to which their party is entitled. The eligible number of candidates from a political party are elected in the order of the number of votes they received individually. In the 2014 elections, for example, the FijiFirst Party polled 59.2 percent of the valid vote. When votes for small parties polling less than the five-percent threshold were excluded, this entitled FijiFirst to 32 of the 50 seats. These were filled by the 32 FijiFirst candidates who polled the highest number of votes as individuals.\nBefore the adoption of the 2013 Constitution, Fiji's Parliament consisted of two houses. The more powerful of the two chambers, the House of Representatives, had 71 members, elected for five-year terms. 25 were elected by universal suffrage. The remaining 46 were reserved for Fiji's ethnic communities and were elected from communal electoral rolls: 23 Fijians, 19 Indo-Fijians, 1 Rotuman, and 3 \"general electors\" (Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities). The House chose a Speaker, who was not allowed to be a present member of the House.\nThe \"upper chamber\", the Senate, was primarily a house of review: it could not initiate legislation, but could amend or reject it. The 32 senators were formally appointed by the president on the nomination of the Great Council of Chiefs (14), the prime minister (9), the Leader of the Opposition (8), and the Council of Rotuma (1). Senators as well as Representatives could serve as cabinet Ministers.\nWhen the Parliament was bicameral, the attorney-general, Fiji's top legal official who sits in the cabinet, was the only member of Parliament permitted to attend sessions of both chambers. The attorney-general had voting rights only in the chamber they were elected or appointed to and authorised to attend and participate in debates in the other chamber.\nJudicial branch.\nFiji maintains an independent judiciary, with judicial power vested in three courts (the High Court, Court of Appeal, and Supreme Court) established by the Constitution, which also makes provision for other courts to be set up by Parliament; Magistrates' Courts have accordingly been set up. The High Court and the Supreme Court are both presided over by the Chief Justice (currently Kamal Kumar); the Chief Justice is barred, however, from membership of the Court of Appeal, which comprises three judges. The Appeal Court, which did not exist prior to the 1997 Constitution, has the power \"to hear and determine appeals\" from judgements of the High Court; decisions of this court may be further appealed to the Supreme Court, whose decision is final. The judiciary managed to maintain its independence from political control in the aftermath of the coups of 1987. Following the 2000 coup, however, its integrity was compromised, in the eye of many, when three judges (including Daniel Fatiaki, who later became Chief Justice) advised then-President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara to abrogate the constitution. Mara refused and resigned; a military administration replaced him. Then Chief Justice recognised the military government, triggering widespread disappointment to those who had seen the judiciary as a model of independence. On 15 November 2000, however, the High Court forced the reinstatement of the 1997 Constitution, which had been abrogated in June following the forced resignation of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara on 29 May.\nFollowing the military coup of 2006, the Military dismissed Chief Justice Daniel Fatiaki and appointed the more pliable Anthony Gates in his place. Following a Court of Appeal decision in 2009 that the Military-backed interim government was illegal, President Ratu Josefa Iloilo abrogated the constitution, dismissed all judges, and reappointed the interim government. Some judges were subsequently reappointed and some were not.\nLocal government.\nThere are four administrative divisions (Central, Eastern, Northern and Western), each under the charge of a commissioner appointed by the central government. The divisions are further subdivided into fourteen provinces, each of which has a provincial council. In addition, the island of Rotuma has the status of a \"dependency\", and enjoys a degree of internal autonomy, with its own island council.\nEthnic Fijians have their own administration in which councils preside over a hierarchy of provinces, districts, and villages. The councils deal with all matters affecting ethnic Fijians. The 55\u2011member Great Council of Chiefs \"(Bose Levu Vakaturaga\" in Fijian) included 3 representatives from each of Fiji's 14 provinces and 1 dependency, 3 ex-officio members (the President, Vice-President, and Prime Minister), and 6 government appointees; former prime minister Sitiveni Rabuka was a life-member. The Great Council of Chiefs advised the government, and also functioned as an electoral college to appoint the president of the republic, as well as 14 of the 32 Senators. This prerogative of the Council was delegated to the 14 provincial councils, each choosing one senator. It was a constitutional oddity that even though Fiji became a Republic in 1987, Queen Elizabeth II was by the Great Council of Chiefs as the Tui Viti, the Paramount Chief, until 2012, when the council was disestablished.\nSuva, Lautoka, and nine other towns have municipal governments, with city or town councils, each chaired by a mayor. These are responsible for the local affairs of all citizens, and are elected by universal suffrage.\nContentious issues.\nMost of Fiji's political controversies are related to the ethnic fault line that characterises Fijian politics. Fiji's former constitution imposed disabilities on a group that constitutes a large part of the population on the pretended basis of race. It has caused an exodus of the Indians, who until the late 1980s formed a slight majority in Fiji.\nLand tenure.\nOne of the main issues that has fuelled the contention over the years is land tenure. Indigenous Fijian communities very closely identify themselves with their land. In 1909 near the peak of the inflow of indentured Indian labourers, the land ownership pattern was frozen and further sales prohibited. Today over 80% of the land is held by indigenous Fijians, under the collective ownership of the traditional Fijian clans. Indo-Fijians produce over 90% of the sugar crop but must lease the land they work from its ethnic Fijian owners instead of being able to buy it outright. The leases have been generally for 10 years, although they are usually renewed for two 10\u2011year extensions. Many Indo-Fijians argue that these terms do not provide them with adequate security and have pressed for renewable 30\u2011year leases, while many ethnic Fijians fear that an Indo-Fijian government would erode their control over the land.\nThe Indo-Fijian parties' major voting bloc is made up of sugarcane farmers. The farmers' main tool of influence has been their ability to galvanise widespread boycotts of the sugar industry, thereby crippling the economy.\nCitizenship and residency issues.\nMultiple citizenship, previously prohibited under the 1997 constitution (abrogated April 2009), has been permitted since the April 2009 Citizenship Decree and established as a right under Section 5(4) of the September 2013 Constitution.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nevertheless, Fiji is a developing country endowed with forest, mineral and fish resources. The country has a large agriculture sector heavily based on subsistence agriculture. Sugar exports and the tourism industry are the main sources of foreign exchange. There are also light manufacturing and mining sectors. Currently Fiji embraces a market economy, years ago however Fiji advocated for a mixed economic system.\nThe country's petroleum production remains at zero despite previous hints at reserves, and it relies entirely on imports to meet its refined petroleum product needs.\nAs of 2025, Fiji's population was estimated to be approximately 949,992, reflecting a 0.73% increase from the previous year. The country's tallest building is the 30-story Grand Fijian Tower in Suva.\nDevelopment plan.\nIn September 2002, the government announced a 20-year development plan. Among other things, it aimed to give indigenous Fijians a greater stake in the economy. The plan envisages tax-relief to businesses owned or managed by ethnic Fijians, along with greater protection for indigenous land and fishery rights.\nA major aim of the Fijian government is to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. Cattle farming, fishing, and forestry (especially pine trees) are being encouraged to diversify the economy; the leading manufacturing industries involve the processing of primary products. On 14 April 2005, the Cabinet approved Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's proposal to develop a biofuels industry. Under the plan, ethanol is to be developed as a complement to the sugar industry, with the hope of alleviating Fiji's dependence on imported fossil fuel such as petrol.\nOn 15 August, Qarase said that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) had granted assistance to Fiji to develop its biofuels project. Transformation of the Fiji Sugar Corporation into an energy and sugar company would result in a turnover of F$1 billion by 2025, he said, and would cut imports of crude oil, generate export earnings, and provide a source of electricity. Energy could be produced from copra, forest, and agricultural products, as well as sugar. He touted the scheme as necessary for diversifying and strengthening the sugar industry for its own survival, as well as for the national economy. He said that the government of India had loaned F$86 million for upgrading of Fiji's sugar mills, which would be completed in time for the 2007-2008 crushing season.\nOn 28 December 2005, John Teiwa of the Coconut Industry Development Authority announced that a 20-year plan for the coconut industry would be launched in 2006. Financing from international investors, including the government of India, would be sought to develop processing of virgin and extra virgin coconut oil, with a view to venturing into foreign health markets. The government expected an annual profit of F$120 million from the venture, Fiji Village reported. Trials for the generation of fuel from coconut oil were also in progress, Teiwa said.\nSectors.\nAgriculture and forestry.\nFiji has a large subsistence agriculture sector, which accounts for 18% of gross domestic product, although it employed some 70% of the workforce as of 2001. Sugarcane is the main agricultural product grown in Fiji. Other agricultural products grown in Fiji include coconuts, copra, ginger, cassava, bananas, rice, sweet potatoes, taro, pickles, kava, pineapples, and plantains. Livestock such as cattle, pigs, and goats are also reared for meat. Fishing is important to the economy as well, with fish products accounting for almost one-tenth of revenue from exports in the early 21st century. Lumber is another major industry, with timber being Fiji's third-largest export commodity.\nIn 2018 Fiji produced:\nIn 2019 Fiji produced 41,892 tons of meat.\nManufacturing.\nSugarcane processing makes up a significant portion of industrial activity. Fiji also has successful garment manufacturing and mineral water bottling industries. Other manufacturing activities include boat building, particularly the construction of fishing boats and pleasure craft, cement making, brewing, and paint manufacturing. Fiji is also a manufacturer and net exporter of wood products such as pine chips, sawnwood and wood-based panels.\nMining.\nGold, silver, and copper are mined in Fiji.\nTourism.\nTourism has expanded rapidly since the early 1980s and is the leading economic activity in the islands accounting for 24.4% of GDP in 2019. Excluding cruise ship passengers, more than 960,000 people visited Fiji in 2019. An increase of over 500,000 since 1999 when 409,000 tourists visited.\nIn 1999 a quarter of tourists came from Australia, with large contingents also coming from New Zealand, Japan, the United States and United Kingdom. Over 62,000 of the tourists were American, a number that had steadily increased since the start of regularly scheduled non-stop air service from Los Angeles. Tourism earned more than $300 million in foreign exchange for Fiji in 1998, an amount exceeding the revenue from its two largest goods exports (sugar and garments).\nThe effects of the Asian financial crisis led to a sharp drop in the number of Asian tourists visiting Fiji in 1997 and 1998, which contributed to a substantial drop in gross domestic product. Positive growth returned in 1999, however, aided by a 20% devaluation of the Fijian dollar. 2005 was a record year for the tourism sector, with 9% growth according to Viliame Gavoka, Chief Executive of the Fiji Visitors Bureau.\nHigh-tech.\nFiji has a high-tech industry with a number of software development companies present in the country. In 2021, Fiji's high-tech exports were worth about $1.95 million.\nTrade.\nFiji runs a persistently large trade deficit. Imports in 1998 accounted for US$721 million, and exports for US$510 million, resulting in a US$116 million deficit. Tourism revenue yields services surplus, however, which keeps the current account of its balance of payments roughly in balance ($13 million in 1998). Australia accounts for between 35% and 45% of Fiji's trade, with New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan varying year-by-year between 5% and 15% each.\nFoodstuffs, machinery, mineral fuels, beverages, tobacco, and manufactured goods are the principal imports. The two largest exports are sugar and garments, which each accounted for approximately one-quarter of export revenue in 1998 (roughly $122 million each). The sugar industry suffered in 1997 due to low world prices and rent disputes between farmers and landowners, and again in 1998 from drought, but recovered in 1999.\nThe Fijian garment industry has developed rapidly since the introduction of tax exemptions in 1988. The industry's output has increased nearly tenfold since that time. Fish, lumber, molasses, coconut oil and ginger are also important exports, although the last two are in decline. Forestry became important as an export trade in the mid-1980s, when the pine plantations planted in the 1950s and 1960s began to mature. They sell much fish.\nAustralia's Trade Commissioner Ross Bray revealed on 26 January 2006 that Fiji's exports to Australia are achieving an annual growth rate of 5%. More than 31,000 Australian companies were trading in the Pacific, half of them in Fiji, Bray said. Fiji is progressing very rapidly.\nInvestment.\nThe government's policy of awarding tax concessions to large multinational companies investing in Fiji has not proved universally popular. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has criticized it, saying that the concessions have been abused and have not generated long-term investment. An ADB report in 2005 accused foreign entrepreneurs of leaving as soon as their concessions expired, and alleged that administration of the concessions encouraged corruption and bribery.\nThe leader of the Fiji Labour Party Mahendra Chaudhry echoed the view of the ADB on 31 December 2005, saying that foreign companies repatriated much of the profit made in Fiji, rather than investing it locally, while taking advantage of the infrastructure funded by Fijian taxpayers without paying any taxes themselves. Such policy discriminated against local businesses, he claimed.\nEconomic problems.\nFiji's economic difficulties have been compounded by the effects of four coups since the 1980s.\nEmigration.\nSince 1987, when the country was destabilized by two military coups, Fiji has suffered a very high rate of emigration, particularly of skilled and professional personnel. More than 70,000 people left the country in the aftermath of the coups, majority of whom were Indo-Fijians. With the continuing expiration of land leases and ongoing instability in the aftermath of another coup in 2000, a further outflow of skilled workers has taken place.\nA report in 2004 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, published on 29 June 2005, found that 61% of Fiji's skilled workers have either emigrated or gone abroad as guest workers. Fiji's loss of skilled workers was the world's fourth highest, behind Guyana, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago. Fiji's Bureau of Statistics recorded 3595 workers as having left the country between January and August 2004. Of these, 414 held professional or technical jobs, 263 were in administrative or managerial positions, and were clerks, supervisors, or related workers, and 118 were sales workers. \nFiji's economy is increasingly reliant on remittances from citizens working overseas. Personal remittances now run to more than F$200 million a year, earning more than traditional sectors like sugar and garment manufacturing. Recruitment of Fijians by foreign private military companies is a growing source of revenue. By mid-2005, there were over 1,000 Fijians working in Iraq and Kuwait as soldiers, security guards, drivers and labourers. In addition in 2006 there were more than 2,000 Fijian soldiers in the British Army, and in 2004 the British defence ministry even sent recruiting teams to Fiji to do initial fitness and aptitude tests, cutting the costs of selection for poor Fijian villagers who could not afford to fly to London to sign up.\nProperty laws and investment problems.\nLow investment has been a long-term problem in Fiji, and property rights are sometimes thought to be part of this problem because, by law, five sixths of the land is owned communally by indigenous Fijians and may only be leased, not purchased outright. However, the leasehold system is often misunderstood.\nLeasehold tenure has not been a problem for the property sector. Houses all over Fiji on communally owned land are on 99-year leases, which have proved satisfactory as a basis for house ownership. Hotels also enjoy 99-year leases. The prestigious Denarau development involving major hotels and resorts and luxury properties is situated on communally owned land. It delivers significant income to native owners and secure title to developers and their customers.\nIn agricultural sector, there have been problems even though agricultural leases are mandated at 30 years, following the extension by legislation (the Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act or ALTA) of all ten-year leases to thirty years in 1977. The problem experienced in agriculture is the non-renewal leases as landowners have been unhappy with the provisions in the ALTA for indexing of rents to cope with inflation. That is an ongoing problem which calls for urgent attention.\nNatural disasters.\nDrought in 1998 further damaged the sugar industry, but its recovery in 1999 contributed to robust GDP growth. Further damage to the economy (estimated at US$30 million) was wrought by a cyclone that hit the northern island of Vanua Levu in January 2003. Apart from the economic devastation, there were food shortages and outbreaks of disease due to the pollution of the water supply.\nTourism woes.\nThe aftermath of the political turmoil in 2000 resulted in a 10-percent shrinkage in the economy, as investor confidence plummeted and tourist numbers dropped more than 15% from 544,000 visitors in 1999 to under 434,000 by the end of 2000. An estimated 7500 jobs were lost. There has been a gradual recovery since 2001, when the was restored and free elections held.\nThe possibility of a return to a racially discriminatory constitution led to fears that Fiji might forfeit its preferential arrangements with the European Union for its sugar exports, and with Australia for its clothing industry, but those fears have largely (but not entirely) subsided.\nHomelessness.\nIn June 2003, a survey revealed a disturbingly high percentage of squatters, about a tenth of Fijian citizens. 82,350 individuals in 13,725 households were estimated to live in 182 squatter settlements, with Suva and Nausori being the worst-affected areas. The number of squatter settlements had increased 14% since January 2001, and 73% since 1996. Urban migration, unemployment, the expiry of land leases, and the breakdown of nuclear and extended families were among the factors blamed for the trend. The report projected the population of squatters to grow to 90,000 in the Suva-Nausori corridor by 2006, putting increasing strain on supplies of water, electricity, sewage, and road services. On 14 September, Prime Minister Qarase said that the squatter problem had become so serious that the government was looking abroad for funding.\nHuman Development Index.\nOn 11 September 2005, the publication of the United Nations Human Development Index downgraded Fiji from 81st in 2004 to 92nd in 2005, behind Pacific neighbours Tonga and Samoa. Incomes had improved, the report said, with gross domestic product rising from F$5440 to F$5880, but other aspects of the quality of life enjoyed by Fiji Islanders had deteriorated. Life expectancy had declined from 72.9 in 2000 to 69.6 in 2004 and 67.8 in 2005, while literacy remained unchanged at 93%.\nJoji Kotobalavu, the chief executive of the Prime Minister's Office, branded the report \"a joke.\" His dismissal drew strong reaction from Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who said that whereas Kotobalavu was paid to be the Prime Minister's spin doctor, the HDI report was put together by professionals who had no hidden agendas, and should therefore be taken very seriously.\nSince 2005, the Human Development Index of Fiji has steadily risen from a reading of 0.687 to 0.743, just above the global median for all countries of 0.74. As of 2020 Fiji ranked 90th out of 183 countries on the Human Development Index.\nEconomic statistics.\nIncome.\nGross national product (GNP): US$101.48 billion; US$1820 per capita (2000)\nGross domestic product (GDP): US$5.48 billion; $US 6,202.2 per capita (2018)\npurchasing power parity - US$9.61 billion; US$11450 per capita (2020 estimate)\nGDP \u2013 real growth rate:\n-6.6% (2008 est.)\nGDP \u2013 composition by sector:\n\"agriculture:\"\n8.9%\n\"industry:\"\n13.5%\n\"services:\"\n77.6% (2006 est.) \nPopulation below poverty line:\n25.5% \nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n\"lowest 10%:\"\nNA%\n\"highest 10%:\"\nNA%\nInflation rate (consumer prices).\n1.6% (2002 est.)\n3.8% (2017 est.)\nWorkforce.\nLabor force:\n360,000\nFemale labor force: 33.1%\nLabor force \u2013 by occupation:\nsubsistence agriculture 67%, wage earners 18%, salary earners 15% (1987)\nUnemployment rate:\n5.24% (2021 est.)\nBudget.\n\"revenues:\"\n$540.65 million\n\"expenditures:\"\n$742.65 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (1997 est.)\nIndustries.\ntourism, sugar, clothing, copra, gold, silver, lumber, small cottage industries\nIndustrial production growth rate:\n2.9% (1995)\nElectricity.\nElectricity \u2013 production:\n1000 GWh (2020)\nElectricity \u2013 production by source:\n\"fossil fuel:\"\n420 GWh, 42% of total (2020)\n\"hydro:\"\n500 GWh, 50% of total (2020)\n\"solar:\"\n20 GWh, 2% of total (2020)\n\"other:\"\n60 GWh, 6% of total (2020)\n\"nuclear:\"\n0%\nElectricity \u2013 consumption:\n1,0002 GWh (2019)\nElectricity \u2013 exports:\n0 kWh (2020)\nElectricity \u2013 imports:\n0 kWh (2020)\nRural electrification.\nThe Fiji Rural Electrification Policy 1993 has been used by the Fiji Department of Energy in the implementation of rural electrification projects which includes diesel schemes for villages, micro hydro projects, house wiring, biofuel projects, solar home systems and grid extension.

The Hatcher family took sole ownership and the name was changed to the Hatcher Grocery Store in 1903. The grocery store was located at what was 22 West 10th Street. Today's address (after house number changes) is 15 West 10th Street. At the same time, the popularity of bottled soft drinks rose rapidly, and grocery store owners wished to maximize their profit. As a grocery wholesaler, Claud A. Hatcher purchased a large volume of Coca-Cola syrup from the local company salesman, Columbus Roberts. Hatcher felt that the company deserved a special reduced price for the syrup since it purchased such large volumes. Roberts would not budge on the cost, and a bitter conflict between the two erupted. Hatcher told Roberts he would win the battle by never purchasing any more Coca-Cola, and was determined to develop his own soft drink formula. He started developing products in the basement of the store with a recipe for ginger ale.\nHatcher launched the Union Bottling Works in his family's grocery store. The first product in the Royal Crown line was Royal Crown Ginger Ale in 1905, followed by Royal Crown Strawberry, and Royal Crown Root Beer. Cherry-flavored Chero-Cola was introduced in 1907. The company was later renamed Chero-Cola in 1910. Its new fruit-flavored beverage, Nehi was introduced in 1924, and the company renamed to Nehi, Inc. in 1925. Founder Claud A. Hatcher's died in 1933 and Chero-Cola was reformulated in 1934 by chemist Rufus Kamm. The company reintroduced the \"Royal Crown\" to launch Royal Crown Cola, and went on to change its name from Nehi, Inc. to Royal Crown Cola Company in 1951.\nRoyal Crown Cola and Moon Pies were a popular \"working man's lunch\" in the American South in the 1950s. Royal Crown was the first company to sell soft drinks in a tin can in 1954, and later the first company to sell soft drinks in an aluminum can. The company introduced the Diet Rite brand of dietetic beverages in 1954, with the cola variety being its flagship.\nRoyal Crown Cola Company developed their international presence during the 1970s, including countries in Asia and Europe. The Raffel family sold Arby's to the Royal Crown Cola Company for $18\u00a0million in 1976.\nCaffeine- and sugar-free cola RC 100 was launched in April 1980. RC Cola accounted for approximately 4\u20135% of soft drink sales in the United States, behind Coke, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, and 7 Up in 1984. Cherry RC would be introduced in July 1985, with Diet RC and its caffeine-free counterpart being announced that December, to debut in January 1986.\nRoyal Crown Draft Cola was released as the first premium draft cola in 1995. It was made with pure cane sugar as a sweetener (instead of high fructose corn syrup), the finest kola nuts, all-natural flavors and pure filtered water. Offered only in 12-ounce bottles, it was discontinued, due largely to the inability of the RC bottling network to get distribution for the product in single-drink channels, and it was discontinued with the exceptions of Australia, New Zealand, and France. It was later available only in New Zealand, parts of Australia, Thailand, and Tajikistan. The company also released Cherry RC, a cherry-flavored version of the RC soft drink to compete with Cherry Coke and Wild Cherry Pepsi.\nOwnership changes.\nRoyal Crown Cola Company was purchased by Triarc Companies, Inc. adding approximately $25 million a year to the marketing budget in 1993. The company was acquired by Cadbury Schweppes (which owned Dr Pepper) through its acquisition of Triarc's beverages business (which also included Snapple) in 2000. Cadbury Schweppes' US-based beverage business (including RC) was spun off as \"Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPSG)\" in 2008. DPSG merged with Keurig Green Mountain in 2018 as Keurig Dr Pepper, the current owners of the RC Cola brand.\nAll non-US businesses were sold to Cott Beverages of Canada in 2001 and operated as Royal Crown Cola International. Cott sold Royal Crown Cola International to Refresco for US$50 million in 2021. Simultaneously, Refresco sold to Royal Crown Cola International to RC Global Beverages Inc.\nIn the Philippines, RC Cola was formerly manufactured and distributed by Cosmos Bottling Corporation under a licensing agreement until 2001 when RFM Corporation sold Cosmos to Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Corp. and San Miguel Corporation ending the license agreement. During its production under Cosmos, RC Cola was only sold in some Visayan markets.\nPhilippine-based Macay Holdings announced in 2022 it will acquire 100% of RC Global Beverages Inc., subject to the finalization of a share purchase agreement and other closing conditions. The transaction was completed in January 17, 2023 for approximately $47 million, comprising a $21.4 million cash payment for equity and the assumption of approximately $26 million of obligations.\nAdvertising campaigns.\nThe RC Cola brand has been marketed through many campaigns. In the 1930s, Alex Osborn, with BBDO, made an ad campaign, including the slogan \"The season's best.\"\nIn 1940, a publicity campaign was run, which saw Hollywood celebrities, next to the slogan \"Best By Taste Test\". Actress Lizabeth Scott as the face, next to the slogan \"RC tastes best, says Lizabeth Scott\".\nIn 1966, Royal Crown Cola collaborated with Jim Henson on an ad campaign for Royal Crown Cola which featured two birds called Sour Bird (performed by Jim Henson) and Nutty Bird (performed by Henson and assisted by Frank Oz) to promote the drinks. Nutty Bird would promote Royal Crown Cola by touting its benefits. The puppet for Nutty Bird was designed by Jim Henson and built by Don Sahlin. Sour Bird appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" with the Rock and Roll Monster.\nNancy Sinatra was featured in two Royal Crown Cola commercials in her one-hour TV special, \"Movin' With Nancy\", which featured various singers and David Winters choreography in December 1967. She sang, \"It's a mad, mad, mad Cola...RC the one with the mad, mad taste!...RC!\" The company was the official sponsor of New York Mets on and off at times from the team's inception in 1962 until the early 1990s. A television commercial in the New York area featured Tom Seaver, New York Mets pitcher, and his wife, Nancy, dancing on top of a dugout at Shea Stadium and singing the tune from the Sinatra campaign.\nRC sponsored two Porsche 917/10 Can-Am race cars during the 1972\u201373 season. In the mid-1970s, Royal Crown ran the \"Me &amp; My RC\" advertisements. Others featured people in scenic outdoor locations. Louise Mandrell sang the jingle \"Me and my RC / Me and my RC /'Cause what's good enough / For other folks / Ain't good enough for Me and My RC...\"\nRC was introduced to Israel in 1995 with the slogan \"RC: Just like in America!\" During the Cola Wars of the 1980s, RC used the 'Decide for yourself' campaign and would remind people 'There's more to your life than Coke and Pepsi.\"\nIn the Philippines, RC Cola released advertisements with artists popular in the country. In 2009, these had Maja Salvador and Kim Bum as celebrity endorsers. The Philippine marketing of the brand also painted the front of sari-sari stores with slogans like \"RC ng (insert municipality/city)\" (RC of my [town/city]). In 2019, the advertisements tapped Joshua Garcia to be the year's celebrity endorser and launched the https:// campaign. In 2020, RC Cola had a campaign \"Basta\", which featured a boy confronting his mother if he is adopted due to glasses embedded on his back. This campaign led to numerous awards such as a bronze award for Film at the Cannes Lion 2021, a bronze award at the 2021 Asia Pacific Effie Awards for the Youth Marketing category, a silver award at the 2022 Asia Pacific Effie Awards for the Beverages, Non-Alcohol category and the Short Video Marketing category, and a bronze award for Film at the 2022 Clio Awards.\nAndretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti had RC Cola as his primary sponsor during the 2012 and 2013 IndyCar Series.\nIn 2022, RC Cola launched its WHY NOT? campaign, featuring three adults who upon taking a sip of RC Cola, would be transported to a world filled with endless imagination.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded by Fred DeLuca and financed by Peter Buck in 1965 as Pete's Super Submarine Sandwiches in Bridgeport, Connecticut. After several name changes, it was renamed Subway in 1972, and a franchise operation began in 1974 with a second restaurant in Wallingford, Connecticut.\nIt was the fastest-growing franchise in the world in 2015 and, as of September 2023, has over 37,000 locations in more than 102 countries and territories. More than half its locations (21,796 or 61.1%) are in the United States. It is the largest single-brand restaurant chain and the largest restaurant operator in the world. Its international headquarters are in Shelton, Connecticut.\nHistory.\nFoundation and early years.\nIn 1965, Fred DeLuca borrowed $1,000 from his friend Peter Buck to start \"Pete's Drive-In: Super Submarine Sandwiches\" at 3851 Main Street in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and in the following year, they formed Doctor's Associates Inc. to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded. The holding company derives its name from DeLuca's goal to earn enough from the business to pay tuition for medical school, as well as Buck's having a doctorate in physics. In 1968, the sandwich shop was renamed Subway. In 1976, a franchise operation began with a restaurant in Wallingford, Connecticut.\nThe first Subway on the West Coast was opened in Fresno, California, in 1978. The first Subway outside of North America opened in Bahrain in December 1984. The first Subway in Canada opened in St. John's in 1986. The first Subway in the United Kingdom opened in Brighton in 1996.\nIn 1989, Subway acquired Cajun Joe's, a Boston, Massachusetts-based chain which sold fried chicken and Cajun cuisine. The venture proved unsuccessful, and most were closed by the end of the 1990s.\nDevelopment since the 2000s.\nIn 2004, Subway began opening stores in Walmart supercenters, and surpassed the number of McDonald's locations inside U.S. Walmart stores in 2007. Since 2007, Subway has consistently ranked in the \"Entrepreneur\" Franchise 500. In 2015, it ranked third on the \"Top Global Franchises\" list, and first as the \"Fastest Growing Franchise.\" At the end of 2010, Subway became the largest fast food chain worldwide\u2013 with 33,749 restaurants; 1,012 more than McDonald's.\nIn January 2015, Suzanne Greco became president and CEO. Her brother Fred DeLuca, the company's first CEO, had been ill for two years and died of leukemia in September 2015. In 2016, Subway closed hundreds of restaurants in the United States, experiencing a net loss in locations for the first time. However, with 26,744 locations, it remained the most ubiquitous restaurant chain in the United States (with McDonald's in the #2 spot).\nIn July 2017, Subway unveiled redesigned restaurants, dubbed 'Fresh Forward', with new company branding. The company installed self-order kiosks, USB charging ports at tables, and added new menu items.\nIn 2017, Subway closed more than 800 U.S. locations. In April 2018, it announced it would close about 500 more that year. According to Abha Bhattarai of \"The Washington Post\", this was a result of three consecutive years of falling profits and a 25 percent reduction in foot traffic in Subway stores since 2012. Franchisees also complained that the company's deep promotions further ate away at profits. In January 2018, Subway invested $25 million in a re-branding campaign targeting young consumers to revitalize its image and boost sales. In 2019, John Chidsey joined Subway as the company's first CEO who was not a founding family member. He focused on improving established U.S. locations rather than building new restaurants. In December 2020, Subway partnered with ezCater to offer a new online catering platform.\nIn 2023, the family announced that they were in the process of selling the company to private ownership. The company enlisted the help of JP Morgan with the sale. The price of the company was reported to be around $10 billion. Several potential buyers made offers for the company. These included the asset management division of investment bank Goldman Sachs, TDR Capital, and TPG Inc. On August 24, Subway announced that Roark Capital would purchase the company for $9.6 billion. The deal's reported value would make it the third-biggest US acquisition in restaurant history, behind Burger King's 2014 acquisition of Tim Hortons for $11.4 billion and Inspire Brands' purchase of Dunkin' Brands in 2020 for $11.3 billion.\nIn November 2023, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was looking into investigating the deal as it would possibly give Roark a monopoly in the sandwich shop industry via the firm's existing ownership of Subway's competitors McAllister's Deli &amp; Jimmy John's. On April 30, 2024, Roark officially acquired Subway after the FTC determined that Roark did not have an unfair advantage.\nOn March 19, 2024, Subway signed a 10-year deal with PepsiCo that began on January 1, 2025, ending the restaurant chain's partnership with The Coca-Cola Company that was first signed in 2003, went into effect the following year in 2004, and the Coke switchover was completed by 2005. Subway's international locations had already gone back to serving Pepsi products between 2015 and 2018. Pepsi previously had a deal with them when they were founded that lasted until the Coca-Cola switchover.\nBy the end of March 2024, the company's Brazilian unit went into bankruptcy with over BRL 482 million (nearly $100 million) in debt. SouthRock Capital, operator of Brazilian Subway restaurants, later declared Chapter 15 bankruptcy in June 2024.\nCorporate affairs.\nOwnership.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], Subway was owned by the private equity group Roark Capital. Prior to that, Subway had been owned by its founding families for six decades. In 2019, John Chidsey joined Subway as the first chief executive officer outside of the DeLuca family.\nStructure.\nAs of 2017, the Subway Group of companies was organized as follows:\nHeadquarters.\nSubway's international headquarters are in Shelton, Connecticut. The company is in the Enterprise Corporate Park, where it takes of space on three floors. This facility began operations in 2023. The company stated that it chose Shelton due to proximity to various locations in Connecticut as well as proximity to points of interest.\nPreviously the headquarters were in Milford, Connecticut, taking up three land portions. In 2024 the former buildings were razed.\nThere are five regional centers supporting the company's international operations. The regional offices for European franchises are located in Amsterdam (Netherlands); the Australian and New Zealand locations are supported from Brisbane (Australia); the Asian locations are supported from offices in Beirut (Lebanon) and Singapore; and the Latin American support center is in Miami (US).\nFranchising.\nThe startup cost of owning a Subway franchise is significantly lower than competitors, beginning at around $200,000 to $500,000. However, Subway franchisees also pay some of the highest percentages of profits (around 12.5%) back to Subway compared to competitors.\nLocations.\nAs of February 2023, Subway had approximately 37,000 locations in more than 100 countries, all independently owned and operated by a network of franchisees. Subway has the highest concentration of locations in North America with more than 20,000 in the United States, 2,881 in Canada, and 758 in Mexico, as of 2019. This was almost as many U.S. locations as McDonald's and Starbucks combined, as of 2018. Outside North America, the countries with the most locations are Australia (1,215), Brazil (1,643), and the United Kingdom (2,195), as of 2019.\nProducts.\nOverview.\nSubway's core product is the submarine sandwich (or \"sub\"). It also sells wraps, salad, paninis, and baked goods (including cookies, doughnuts, and muffins). Subway also sells breakfast sandwiches, English muffins, and flatbread. In 2006, \"personal pizzas\" debuted in some US markets. These are made to order (like the subs) and heated for 85 seconds. Breakfast and pizza items are only available in select locations. In November 2009, Subway signed a deal to serve exclusively Seattle's Best Coffee coffee as part of its breakfast menu in the US.\nSubway's best-selling sandwich, the B.M.T. (short for \"Biggest, Meatiest, Tastiest\"), contains pepperoni, salami and ham. It was introduced as a reference to Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit, connecting to the \"subway\" name.\nIn April 2017, Subway announced the addition of paninis to its menu. Chipotle Steak &amp; Cheese, Triple Cheese, Chicken Cordon Bleu, and Italian B.M.T. Melt were the four variations announced. In September 2018, Subway debuted the Chipotle Cheesesteak sandwich for a limited time. Regional testing of a crispy chicken sandwich also began taking place in Arkansas. In January 2024, Subway debuted Sidekicks, a new range of footlong baked goods in partnership with Cinnabon and Auntie Anne's.\nSubDog.\nSubway's SubDog is an American-style hotdog, topped with mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce and a limited-edition tangy mustard, in which started as an April Fool's joke in 2022 but due to popular demand Subway brought the SubDog to reality as a limited-time offer. Subway announced the return of the SubDog in Australia for a limited time in 2024 between 2 September to 6 October.\nRegional variations.\nSubway's menu varies between countries, most significantly where religious requirements relate to the meats served.\nIn 2006, the first kosher Subway restaurant in the United States opened in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio in the Mandel Jewish Community Center of Cleveland. Former Subway spokesman Jared Fogle attended the opening. A press release stated, \"With slight modifications, such as no pork-based products, and the use of soy-based cheese product, the menu is virtually identical to that of any other Subway restaurant.\" Other openings soon followed, briefly making Subway one of the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chains. At their peak, twelve kosher Subway locations were open in the U.S., including Kansas City and 5 in New York. As of 2023, only one kosher Subway remains, in Miami, FL. Franchisees who failed noted a lack of support from the parent location in advertising, higher costs of kosher food and supervision, the inability to remain open on Saturdays, and that customers who do not keep kosher prefer the original menu and prices.\nSubway opened its first restaurant in India in 2001 in New Delhi. In deference to Hindu beliefs, Subway restaurants in India do not serve beef products; on the other hand, the country's large number of vegetarians induced Subway's Indian outlets to offer a much-extended range of vegetarian options. As of January 2017, there were 591 Subway restaurants in 68 Indian cities. On September 4, 2012, Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Jalandhar, Punjab. On March 6, 2013, Subway opened its second all-vegetarian outlet also offering Jain food in Paldi, Ahmedabad.\nNutritional content.\nIn 2011, Subway introduced gluten-free bread and brownies to some locations in Texas. It also cut the salt content of its sandwiches by 15 percent in 2011.\nMarketing.\nSubway is the second-biggest fast food advertiser in the United States, behind only McDonald's. It spent US$516,000,000 on measurable advertising in 2011.\nSubway used the advertising slogan \"Eat Fresh\" and focused on how its sandwiches were made from freshly baked bread and fresh ingredients, in front of customers to their exact specifications, by employees which Subway called \"Subway Sandwich Artists\".\nIn 2005, Subway scrapped its \"Sub Club\" stamp promotion, citing a growing number of counterfeit stamps due to online auction sites and the increasing availability of high-quality printers.\nIn November 2007, Subway's US commercials featured the cartoon character Peter Griffin (from FOX's \"Family Guy\") promoting its new Subway Feast sandwich.\nSubway ran a product placement campaign in the US TV series \"Chuck\" since its first season. As ratings dwindled in the second season, a campaign to \"save Chuck\" was launched for fans, encouraging them to purchase a footlong sub from Subway on April 27, 2009, the date of the season finale. Tony Pace, Subway's marketing officer, called it the best product placement the restaurant chain has done \"in several years.\"\nTo celebrate National Sandwich Day on November 3, 2015, Subway offered a Buy One sandwich, Give One sandwich free promotion.\nMost Subway locations feature a promotion named \"Sub of the Day\" where a different submarine sandwich is featured each day of the week at a discounted price. In the past they had a monthly promotion that featured a specialty sub sandwich at a discounted price for the entire month.\nJared Fogle.\nBeginning in January 2000, Jared Fogle was a national spokesman for the company in the United States, giving talks on healthy living and appearing in advertisements. Fogle first came to attention in his native Indiana by claiming that he lost over in part by eating at Subway. After 2008, he was featured less often as the company marketed with more emphasis on its \"5 dollar footlong\" campaign. Subway attributed between one-third and one-half of its growth from 1998 to 2011 to Fogle, the equivalent of a tripling in size. Subway ended its relationship with Fogle in 2015 after he was charged with possession of child pornography and illicit sexual conduct with minors. After pleading guilty in August 2015, he was sentenced to more than 15 years in federal prison three months later.\nIn December 2015, following the removal of Fogle from its marketing, Subway introduced a new marketing campaign, \"Founded on Fresh\". The campaign focuses on Subway's establishment and early history and features Fred DeLuca, as played by his son, Jonathan. The new campaign downplays the use of jingles and celebrity endorsements (besides \"targeted\" sports marketing) in favor of focusing on the qualities of its products and specific products. Chief advertising officer Chris Carroll explained that the focus on fat, calories, and weight loss were \"what fresh used to be\" and that the new campaign would focus more on the sourcing of Subway's ingredients, such as its phase-out of antibiotic-treated meat. Carroll also explained that the new strategy was being developed prior to the controversy involving Fogle.\n$5 footlongs.\nIn 2008, Subway began to offer all its regular submarine sandwiches (excluding the premium and double-meat varieties) for five dollars (equivalent to $ in 2024), in the continental United States and Canada, as a \"limited time only\" promotion. \"Five Dollar Footlongs\" quickly became the company's most successful promotion ever. Upon the initial promotion's completion, customer response prompted Subway to create a \"$5 Footlong Everyday Value Menu\" that offered some footlong sandwiches for $5. Since 2011, there has been a monthly rotating $5 footlong. In October 2011, a similar promotion was launched in the United Kingdom. Customers can buy one of nine subs and any drink for \u00a33 (for a sub) or \u00a35 (for a footlong).\nIn 2012, San Francisco restaurants discontinued the five-dollar footlong promotion due to the higher cost of doing business in the city. From June 2014 to the end of that year, some Subway locations began discontinuing the $5 promotion. On November 1, 2014, Subway discontinued the five-dollar footlong promotion, replacing it with the Simple $6 Menu which included a six-inch select with a drink and a choice of cookies or chips.\nIn February 2016, Subway announced that all classic footlongs would be priced at $6 each. In January 2018, the $5 promotion returned with a $4.99 footlong menu of five subs at participating locations. In September 2018, Subway announced that it would discontinue the $5 footlong promotion to boost franchise profits.\nItalian Hero.\nIn early 2017, Subway introduced its Italian Hero and advertised it with a campaign describing it as an authentic Italian(-American) sandwich. Created by their national creative agency MMB, two comedic spots feature Italian-American characters on and around the stoop of a tenement building, one including a cameo by sportscaster Dick Vitale. Another ad features Food Network's Jeff Mauro, the \"Sandwich King\", who is also Italian-American, discussing the nature and role of the different Italian meats and other ingredients.\n\"Refresh\".\nIn July 2021, Subway debuted its \"Refresh\" campaign featuring: Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, Serena Williams, and Megan Rapinoe. Subway franchisees requested Rapinoe be pulled from the ads following the 2020 Olympics, claiming her testimonial caused sales to dip and harmed the stores' reputation.\nSponsorships.\nSubway has sponsored a number of sports events, particularly NASCAR races, including the Subway 300 (2001), Subway 400 (2002\u20132004), Subway 500 (2003\u20132007), Subway Fresh 500 (2005\u20132013) and the Subway Firecracker 250 (2009\u20132016). Subway sponsored the Subway Super Series ice hockey tournament from 2009 to 2014. In September 2022, Subway secured a three-year partnership deal with Football Australia for the naming rights of the men's national football teams as the Subway Socceroos, Subway Olyroos, Subway Young Socceroos, and Subway Joeys. The deal also includes Subway becoming the official partner of the Matildas and the Australia Cup.\nAnimal welfare.\nIn December 2015, Subway committed to eliminating battery cage eggs from its North American supply chain by the end of 2025. In January 2022, it was criticized by the animal welfare organization the Open Wing Alliance for failing to report progress on its cage-free transition. In August 2025, a representative of The Humane League stated that Subway leadership refused to engage with the organization about its cage-free commitment. A month later, Subway announced that it would eliminate caged eggs from its U.S. locations by November 2025 and its Canadian locations by the end of the year.\nIn 2017, Subway faced a nationwide campaign against its use of fast-growing broiler chickens led by high school activist Lia Hyman in coordination with The Humane League. On April 20, 2017, Hyman and a group of activists delivered more than 53,000 signatures from campaign supporters at a demonstration outside Subway's headquarters in Connecticut.\nFollowing the demonstration, Subway released a chicken welfare policy requiring its U.S. chicken products to be produced in alignment with Global Animal Partnership (GAP) standards by 2024, including enhanced living environments, increased activity levels, optimized stocking density, and improved slaughter methods. However, World Animal Protection reported in 2024 that Subway continued to practice low broiler welfare standards in its European supply chain.\nControversies.\nHepatitis A contamination.\nIn September 1999, at least 32 customers in Seattle contracted hepatitis A after eating food contaminated with the virus at two Subway outlets. The virus, which is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with infected feces, infects the liver causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever. Subsequent investigations found that staff failed to adhere to thorough hand washing and the use of plastic gloves during food preparation. A class-action lawsuit on behalf of 31 victims was resolved for $1.6 million. The most seriously affected victim\u2014a 6-year-old boy\u2014suffered acute liver failure and required a liver transplant. He was awarded $10 million in an out-of-court settlement in 2001. A previous outbreak of hepatitis A in 1996 had also involved a Subway outlet in Seattle, although no legal action had resulted.\nIn April 2015, the Arkansas Department of Health issued a warning to the public that customers who had eaten at the Subway outlet in Morrilton, Arkansas, may have been exposed to infection after an employee tested positive for the virus.\nSandwich size.\nOn February 2, 2007, KNXV-TV (with the help of the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures) reported that three of Subway's \"Giant Sub\" sandwiches, normally each long, were actually only long. Under Arizona regulations, objects cannot be more than 3% shorter than their advertised length; a \"three-foot\" sub must be at least long. The report also showed the boxes designed to store these sandwiches were in length; shorter than the maximum allowable variance. In response to the report, Subway said it was reevaluating its advertising, training, and packaging materials with regard to the specific or implied length of Giant Subs and was advising its franchisees to only discuss with customers the approximate number of expected servings and not a specific length of measurement.\nIn January 2013, an Australian teen, Matt Corby, complained on Facebook that Subway's \"footlong\" sandwich was only long, rather than . Subway responded by saying, \"With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'Subway Footlong' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length.\" Discovery during a subsequent class-action lawsuit revealed that most Subway sandwiches were the advertised length. A $530,000 settlement was thrown out of court in 2017 for being \"utterly worthless\" to consumers.\nFranchise relations.\nIn 1995, Subway Sandwich Shops, Fred DeLuca, Peter Buck, and Doctor's Associates Inc. were held liable for breach of contract. An Illinois jury awarded more than $10 million in damages to Nicholas and Victoria Jannotta after finding lease and contract violations. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants had misrepresented the asset value of Subway Sandwich Shops (a leasing company used by Doctor's Associates for franchising purposes) while negotiating a 1985 lease agreement.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' small business committee studied the franchise industry from 1992 to 1998. Dean Sagar noted, \"Subway is the biggest problem in franchising and emerges as one of the key examples of every abuse you can think of.\" In 1989, the U.S. Small Business Administration refused small business loans to Subway franchise owners until Subway removed a contract clause which gave it the power to seize and purchase any franchise without cause. \"The Dallas Morning News\" reported Subway had seized American soldier Leon Batie Jr.'s Subway stores in 2006 while he was serving in Afghanistan. He had been deployed to support Operation Enduring Freedom in March 2005, three years after buying his first restaurant. Batie alleged Subway had violated the U.S. Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. He filed a federal lawsuit against Subway, which was dismissed. He then filed suit in state court in Dallas County, Texas. Both parties settled on \"mutually agreeable\" and confidential terms in January 2010.\nUnited Kingdom VAT treatment.\nIn October 2010, Subway franchisees in the United Kingdom lost a high court appeal against paying standard VAT on all toasted subs, as required by HM Revenue and Customs. Thus, in the United Kingdom, a toasted sub attracts VAT, whereas a cold sub, eaten off the premises, does not. Competitors such as Quiznos and McDonald's do not pay VAT on similar food.\nIn March 2012, Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne announced plans to close the loophole that allows Subway competitors to offer hot food without paying VAT. This legislation was expected to come into force from October 2012 onward, but on May 28, 2012, the government withdrew plans to charge VAT on originally hot food being allowed to cool naturally. In June 2012, Subway launched the \"Toast the Tax\" campaign to put pressure on the government to drop VAT on toasted sandwiches, as it has done for hot savouries.\nFootlong trademark disputes.\nOn January 31, 2011, Subway lawyer Valerie Pochron wrote to Casey's General Stores, a chain of Iowa-based convenience stores, demanding that the small chain cease using the term \"footlong\" in advertisements for its 12-inch sandwiches. Subway threatened to sue. Consequently, in February 2011, Casey's General Stores Inc. filed a petition in a U.S. District Court in Des Moines, seeking a legal declaration that the word \"footlong\" does not violate Subway's rights. Casey's further sought a declaration that the word \"footlong\" is a generic description of a sandwich measuring one foot. Before serving its complaint on Subway, Casey's voluntarily dismissed its action, ending the litigation.\nSubway's trademark application for \"footlong\" has yet to be approved by the federal government. Subway has attempted to register it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office twice. It filed on November 8, 2007, and June 4, 2009. Both filings have been abandoned, on November 20, 2013, and August 21, 2014, respectively. Yum Brands (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and non-Canadian A&amp;W locations), Long John Silver's, and other competitors opposed the applications.\nIngredients.\nSubway removed azodicarbonamide from its bread after food blogger and activist Vani Hari gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a petition drive. Before Vani Hari's petition, Subway had used azodicarbonamide as a bread conditioner, to whiten the dough and allow sandwich bread to bake more quickly. As of 2016[ [update]], the ingredient was still used by other fast food restaurants.\nIn August 2015, Vani Hari again petitioned Subway in conjunction with Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, the Center for Food Safety, U.S. Public Interest Research Group to commit to buying meat produced without the routine use of antibiotics and to provide a timeline for doing so. In October 2015, Subway announced it would transition to chicken raised without antibiotics in 2016 and turkey within the following 2\u20133 years, and would also transition beef and pork raised without antibiotics by 2025.\nIn 2020, the Supreme Court of Ireland ruled that Subway bread had too high a sugar content to be classed as bread for VAT reasons, with its recipe including sugar equal to 10% of the weight of the flour.\nIn 2021, a lawsuit was filed against the company alleging that the ingredient Subway bills as \"tuna\" was a mixture of \"various concoctions that do not constitute tuna, yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna\". The company's senior director for global food safety and quality said in a statement that \"Our restaurants receive pure tuna, mix it with mayonnaise and serve on a freshly made sandwich to our guests.\" The investigative TV show \"Inside Edition\" sent samples of Subway's tuna salad to Applied Food Technologies, a Florida company that carries out DNA testing of seafood. According to that company, \"Yes, we confirmed that tuna was definitely in all three samples we received.\" Subway established a website, SubwayTunaFacts.com, to refute the claims that they did not use real tuna, which they have denied unambiguously.\nSoy protein in chicken products.\nIn an investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s consumer affairs television series \"Marketplace\" aired in February 2017, chicken from five fast-food restaurants was lab-tested to determine constituents. While DNA testing found between 84.9% and 89.4% of the DNA from other restaurants' chicken products to be chicken DNA, with the remaining being unidentifiable plant DNA, on the two Subway chicken items tested, 53.6% and 42.8% of the DNA was found to be chicken, with the remainder being mostly soy. Although ingredients listings did show soy protein to be a constituent of both of the chicken products, Subway states that the proportion is less than or equal to 1% and that the finding of about 50% soy DNA is not representative of the actual amount of soy in the product. Subway has called CBC's report \"absolutely false and misleading\" and demanded that it be retracted. Meanwhile, however, Subway Canada stated that it was investigating with its supplier to ensure that the proportion of soy protein was as per expectations.\nAccording to Subway's website, U.S. stores' ingredients may differ from those in Canadian stores. Both countries include soy protein in chicken strips, but only the U.S. version states that it is present in quantities of 2% or less. The Canadian version includes soy as an ingredient in its chicken patty, but the United States version does not.\nIn April 2017, Subway sued the CBC, as well as the reporter and two producers, for $210 million, alleging the CBC acted \"recklessly and maliciously\" and that \"these false statements... were published and republished, maliciously and without just cause or excuse, to a global audience, which has resulted in pecuniary loss to the plaintiffs.\" The CBC stood by its reports, stating that the DNA tests were done by independent and credible experts. The CBC's Emma B\u00e9dard stated that Subway had not provided an alternative explanation for the DNA test results obtained by the CBC.\nIn November 2019, Subway's lawsuit against the CBC was dismissed through anti-SLAPP legislation, as CBC's reporting was deemed to be a matter of public interest. In January 2021 the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the decision dismissing the lawsuit. The Supreme Court of Canada denied leave for appeal, so the matter has been returned to the Superior Court of Justice for trial.\nUnderpaying workers.\nIn 2019, the Fair Work Ombudsman found that 17 Australian-based Subway franchises had underpaid workers. The lengthy investigation by the Ombudsman specifically found that franchises failed to pay the employees minimum wages, casual loadings, holiday and overtime rates, and did not issue proper pay slips or keep proper employment records. The investigation resulted in over $81,000 being recovered in unpaid wages for over 160 employees. Subway responded by introducing a rolling audit of franchisee employment records and commented that franchise agreements could be terminated if franchisees failed to meet Australian workplace laws and Subway's internal standards of operation.\nCalls for boycott over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Subway was criticized for not divesting or scaling back its operations in Russia, unlike most of its competitors. Subway issued a statement saying its corporate office does not own any of the 446 Subway stores in Russia, and issued a statement saying, \"In addition to working with our franchisees across Europe to provide meals to refugees, we will redirect any profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts supporting Ukrainians who have been affected by the war. Our restaurants in Russia are all independently owned and operated by local franchisees and managed by an independent master franchisee.\" Nevertheless, Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention stated that Subway continues advertising in Russia and collecting payments from its Russian franchisees, and listed Subway among International Sponsors of War in January 2024. Despite the list being withdrawn following diplomatic pressure, in June 2024, Subway announced the termination of its Russian franchise agreements, and in August 2025, the former Russian franchisee, having lost the Subway trademark rights, rebranded to \"Subjoy\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Most Amungme live in Mimika and Puncak, in valleys like Noema, Tsinga, Hoeya, Bella, Alama, Aroanop, and Wa. A related group lives in Beoga Valley, Puncak and they are called Damal people.\nTheir language, Uhunduni, has several dialects. Amung-kal is spoken mostly in the southern regions and in the north, it is called Damal-kal. Additionally, they have symbolic languages called Aro-a-kal and Tebo-a-kal. Tebo-a-kal is only spoken in sacred areas.\nThe traditional beliefs of the Amungme people are animistic. The Amungme people did not have the idea of \"gods\" that are separate from nature where spirits and nature are the same. They see themselves as the eldest child of God \"Nagawan Into\", hence conqueror and ruler of the world \"Amungsa\".\nThe position of Amungme leader is not inherited by lineage.\nThe Amungme people practice shifting agriculture, supplementing their livelihood by hunting and gathering. The Amungme are very tied to their ancestral land and consider the surrounding mountains to be sacred.\nThis has led to friction with the Indonesian government and the American mining company Freeport-McMoRan, which is eager to exploit the vast mineral deposits contained there. Major changes in the Amungme of the highlands and Kamoro of the lowlands lifestyle have been brought about by the Grasberg mine, situated in the heart of Amungme territory and owned by Freeport-McMoRan, the region's largest single employer.\nExtensive gold and copper mining have altered the landscape, and the presence of the mine and its infrastructure has attracted numerous other economic migrants from regions in Indonesia including other Papuans, some of whom have tried to settle on traditional Amungme lands. This has caused a land dispute regarding customary land rights between the Amungme people against the Freeport mining company in Timika. In the last 35 years, the Amungme have seen their sacred mountain destroyed by the Freeport mine and watched as their relatives are killed and caught in the conflict between Indonesian soldiers and Free Papua Movement rebels, while the Kamoro have more than 200,000 tons of mining waste pumped into their rivers each day. All these factors have created complex social and political stresses and led to somewhat frequent protests and/or social conflicts, some of which have been violently suppressed by the Indonesian police or military.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54583", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54583", "title": "Enxet", "text": "Group of indigenous people in South America\nThe Enxet are an indigenous people of about 17,000 living in the Gran Chaco region of western Paraguay. Originally hunter-gatherers, many are now forced to supplement their livelihood as laborers on the cattle ranches that have encroached upon their dwindling natural forest habitat. Nevertheless, the Enxet are engaged in an ongoing conflict with the government and ranchers, who want to destroy what remains of the forest to open the land for massive settlement. Today, only a handful of Enxet are still maintain their traditional way of life, while the majority live in small settlements sponsored by various missionary organizations. The Enxet and Enlhet languages are still vigorous.\nLand ownership.\nIn 2006, 90 Enxet families, the Sawhoyamaxa, won a legal battle to 14,404 hectares of their traditional lands, bought up by Heribert Roedel. The land was signed over in 2011.\nLingering Effects of the Chaco War on the Enxet People.\nThe Enxet tribe suffered devastating blows during the Chaco War period (1932-1935). The Chaco War was fought between Bolivia and Paraguay over control of natural resources in the Chaco region of South America. The front of this war stretched directly through Chaco territory, ravaging ancestral lands and severely disrupting cultural way of life.\nDuring the military colonization of Chaco, the Enxet verbal history was damaged, as members of the tribe were killed before sharing their history. To make matters worse, they were struck with a brutal smallpox epidemic in 1932, which resulted in the deaths of nearly half of the Enxet population. The Paraguayans also abused the Enxet natives, with a first hand Enxet report stating: \"They {Paraguayans} wanted the women. If a man refused they would kill him, even if he was a leader. The Paraguayans had no qualms about shooting an Enxet.\" Though no conscription is overly reported, the Enxet population was targeted by both Bolivia and Paraguay due to fears revolving around the Natives being spies. This would lead to further devastation among the populace of the Chaco region.\nIn the aftermath of Paraguay's victory in the Chaco War, the government became more committed to settling and developing the Chaco. Subsequently, much of Enxet land would be divided, deforested, and given to cattle farmers. The deforestation coupled with the overgrazing of cattle left the land forever scarred. Today, the Enxet hold title to approximately 2.8 percent of the area they occupied before the start of the Chaco War. Their population has yet to recover, and is currently only about 8,200 strong.\nCourt case, water and other rights.\nThe right to water was considered in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights case of the \"Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay\". The issues involved the states failure to acknowledge indigenous communities' property rights over ancestral lands. In 1991, the state removed the indigenous Sawhoyamaxa community from the land resulting in their loss of access to water, food, schooling and health services. This fell within the scope of the American Convention on Human Rights; article 4, encroaching the right to life. Water is included in this right, as part of access to land. The courts required the lands to be returned, compensation provided, and basic goods and services to be implemented, while the community was in the process of having their lands returned.\nRe-occupation.\nIn 2013, the land still not being vacated, the Sawhoyamaxa re-occupied the land.\nSupreme court ruling.\nIn 2014 the Paraguay Supreme Court rejected a claim that government expropriation of the land (in order to transfer it to the Sawhoyamaxa), was unconstitutional.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bellisario, that aired on NBC for five seasons, from March 26, 1989, to May 5, 1993. The series stars Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a physicist who, believing he has invented a way to travel through time, voluntarily subjects himself to an experiment that he believes will prove the validity of his controversial theories. Sam \u201cleaps\u201d into the fluid of spacetime and apparently disappears forever. However, it is soon revealed that Beckett's consciousness is alive and able to transfer to and inhabit the bodies of other people existing on his timeline. The artificially intelligent computer he created, called Ziggy, operates with the assumption that in order to return home, Sam must change events in the past in order to \"correct\" the future course of events.\nDean Stockwell co-stars as Rear Admiral Al Calavicci, Sam's womanizing, cigar-smoking companion and best friend, who appears only as a hologram. Al is able to research the life Sam currently inhabits, providing advice when needed, and he is the only person able to see Sam when Sam has travelled through time. \nThe series, which combines humor, drama, romance, social commentary, and science fiction, was ranked number 19 on \"TV Guide\"'s \"Top Cult Shows Ever\" in 2007.\nA revival series, following the original show's continuity, ran on NBC from 2022 to 2024.\nPremise and characters.\nIn the very near future, physicist Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) theorizes that time travel within one's own lifetime is possible, and obtains government support to build project \"Quantum Leap\". Some years later, having already spent $43 billion, the government threatens to halt funding, as apparently no progress has been made. Sam then decides to test the project accelerator himself to save the project, telling no one. He is immediately thrown back in time, but upon awakening, finds that while he physically exists in the past, he appears to everyone else as a person into whom he has \"leapt\", and has a partial amnesia related to his own identity.\nA hologram of his best friend, United States Navy Rear Admiral Al Calavicci (Dean Stockwell), appears, visible and audible only to Sam, who explains to Dr. Beckett that it appears he must fix something that \"went wrong\" in time. Al is aided by project Quantum Leap\u2019s artificially intelligent supercomputer, nicknamed Ziggy, who is described as a \"parallel hybrid computer with a massive ego\". Despite successfully changing the past in episode 1, Sam continues to leap, seemingly guided by what is eventually described as \u201can unknown force\" that wants him to put right events in the past that once went wrong, for reasons unknown. Thence forth, Dr. Samuel Beckett leaps from life to life and time to time, attempting to \"put right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap home.\"\nSam has six doctoral degrees, a black belt in kung fu, a photographic memory, and near-virtuosic musical talent, allowing him to easily slip into the shoes of almost anyone in the past. The somewhat bookish and naive Sam is contrasted by Al, who is, among other things, a womanizing, cigar-smoking, five-time divorc\u00e9 who spent his early years in an orphanage, was active in the civil rights movement, became a naval aviator, and was even a prisoner of war in Vietnam.\nSam and Al are the only characters to appear in every episode. The supporting characters of each episode are the friends, family, and acquaintances of the person Sam has leapt into. With a few exceptions, such as two-part or sequential episodes, these characters appear only once, though several actors have played multiple characters. Occasionally, Sam runs into real-life historical figures such as Buddy Holly, Michael Jackson, Sylvester Stallone, Donald Trump, Marilyn Monroe, and Ruth Westheimer, the last of whom played herself.\nThe other members of the Quantum Leap team, though mentioned often, appear in only a handful of episodes. They include head programmer Irving \"Gooshie\" Gushman (Dennis Wolfberg), psychiatrist Dr. Verbena Beeks (Candy Ann Brown), medical technician (and Al's lover) Tina Martinez (Gigi Rice), and Sam's wife, Dr. Donna Eleese (Teri Hatcher/Mimi Kuzyk), the project's director in his absence. The latter does not exist as Sam\u2019s wife until Dr. Beckett changes history.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe main premise for \"Quantum Leap\" was inspired by such movies as \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" (1941) and \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1978), as well as the 1960s TV show, \"The Time Tunnel\". Series creator, Donald P. Bellisario, saw its potential as an original anthology series, though at the time, similarly themed shows were unpopular with the major networks.\nThe series ran on NBC for five seasons, from March 1989 through May 1993.\nSoundtrack.\nThe theme for the series, written by Mike Post, was later rearranged for the fifth season, except for the series-finale episode, which featured the original theme music. Scores for the episodes were composed by Post and Velton Ray Bunch.\nA soundtrack album was first released in 1993, titled \"Music from the Television Series 'Quantum Leap' \", dedicated to John Anderson, who played Pat Knight in \"The Last Gunfighter\". It was released by GNP Crescendo on CD and cassette tape.\nEpisodes.\nBroadcast history.\nThe \"Quantum Leap\" series, though initially scheduled to air on Friday nights, was almost immediately moved to Wednesday evenings. Later on, as the show became more successful, it was moved to Fridays. In late 1992, it began to air on Tuesdays. The series finale aired on a Wednesday in May, 1993.\nThe most frequent time slot for the series is indicated by \"italics\":\nIn the United Kingdom, the show began on BBC Two on February 13, 1990, airing Tuesday evenings at 9:00 pm. The final episode was scheduled to be aired on June 14, 1994, but altered schedules after the death of British dramatist Dennis Potter earlier that month delayed the airing until June 21, 1994. Repeat episodes continued on the channel at various times until December 28, 1999.\nQuantum Leap Week.\nDuring the summer of 1990, NBC scheduled a \"Quantum Leap Week\". Over the course of five consecutive nights, repeat episodes of the show were broadcast in an effort to drum up interest in the fledging series. The \"Quantum Leap Week\" was repeated during the summer of 1991. Each of the weekly events was supported by a series of advertisements. In each were a series of \"man-on-the-street\" attempting to say \"Quantum Leap Week\" fast, with varied levels of success.\nHome media.\nUniversal Studios has released the entire, digitally remastered, \"Quantum Leap\" series on DVD. Some controversy arose when fans discovered that many songs had been replaced from the soundtrack due to music rights issues. For the fifth season, Universal included all of the original music.\nOn April 13, 2016, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that it had acquired the rights to the series and re-released the first two seasons on DVD on June 7, 2016.\nOn February 7, 2017, Mill Creek re-released \"Quantum Leap - the Complete Series\" on DVD and also released the complete series on Blu-ray for the first time. The 18-disc set contains all 97 episodes of the series, as well as most of the original music restored for all seasons.\nFinal episode.\nAt the end of season five, Bellisario was told to write an episode that could serve as a season finale or series finale, as it was unclear whether \"Quantum Leap\" would be renewed. The episode contained some answers to long-standing questions about the show, but contained enough ambiguity for a season six. When the show was not renewed, two title cards were attached to the end of the last episode. The first read that Al's first wife Beth never remarried, so they were still married in the present day and had four daughters. The second said Sam \"never returned home.\" The finale was met by viewers with mixed feelings.\nA few years after the airing of the finale, a script for an alternate ending was leaked on the internet. It implied that Al, through encouragement of his wife Beth, would become a leaper to go after Sam. Bellisario has said no script exists and that he does not know where this idea came from. In 2018, however, fan Allison Pregler purchased on-set publicity stills taken from season five that contained some shots of Al and Beth together; this implies that part of the alternate ending was, in fact, shot and gives credibility to the alternate-ending scenario. In May 2019, a video of the lost footage was uploaded to Reddit. Scott Bakula confirmed that several endings were shot and that the footage was authentic.\nReception.\nThe series had a slow start in the ratings, and its timeslot was moved often, but it did well in the 18\u201349 demographic. The finale was viewed by 13 million American households. In 2004 and 2007, \"Quantum Leap\" was ranked number 15 and 19, respectively, on \"TV Guide\"'s \"Top Cult Shows Ever\".\nAwards.\nAlong with 43 nominations, \"Quantum Leap\" received 17 awards (listed below).\nOther media.\nComics.\nInnovation Publishing produced a series of comic books that ran for 13 issues from September 1991 through August 1993. As with the television series, each issue ended with a teaser preview of the following issue and Sam's exclamation of \"Oh, boy.\" Among the people into whom Sam found himself leaping in this series were:\nFew of the comic stories referenced episodes of the television series, with the exception of the ninth issue, \"Up Against a Stonewall\".\nContinuation.\nProposed films.\nTelevision film.\nIn July 2002, the Sci-Fi Channel (which at the time was airing reruns of the show) announced development of a two-hour television film based on \"Quantum Leap\" that would have served as a backdoor pilot for a new series, with Bellisario as executive producer.\nFeature film.\nIn July 2010 during the \"TV Guide\" panel at San Diego Comic-Con, Scott Bakula said that Bellisario was working on a script for a projected \"Quantum Leap\" feature film. Bellisario confirmed in October 2017 at the L.A. Comic Con that he had finished the script.\nRevival.\nIn January 2020, Jeff Bader, NBC's head of program planning and strategy, announced that the network was considering a reboot of \"Quantum Leap\" for the launch of its Peacock streaming service.\nIn January 2022, NBC greenlit a pilot episode of a \"Quantum Leap\" sixth season revival. Bellisario is involved, while the showrunners include Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt, with Deborah Pratt and Martin Gero as executive producers. The pilot will take place 30 years after the conclusion of the original series, with a new team reviving Project Quantum Leap to understand both it and the fate of Sam Beckett. Raymond Lee was signed to star in the pilot in the role of Dr. Ben Song, the person that ends up traveling back in time through the Quantum Leap project. Ernie Hudson was cast as Herbert \"Magic\" Williams, the lead of the new Quantum Leap program and a Vietnam War veteran whom Sam leaped into in the season three episode \"The Leap Home (Part 2) \u2013 Vietnam\". NBC gave the green light for a full season order in May 2022. In July 2022, it was announced that Dean Georgaris joined as showrunner. It premiered on September 19, 2022, airing on Monday nights.\nIn September 2022, original series star Scott Bakula confirmed that he had been asked by producers to reprise his role as Sam Beckett in the revival, but ultimately decided against it, saying in a statement on Instagram, \"As the show has always been near and dear to my heart, it was a very difficult decision to pass on the project\".\nOn April 5, 2024, it was confirmed that the series had been canceled after two seasons.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Source Code\", a 2011 science-fiction action thriller film, was directed by Duncan Jones. Jones said in reading its script that he was reminded of \"Quantum Leap\" and as a reference to the show, cast Bakula in a voice cameo role, including giving him one line of \"Oh, boy\" in the script.\nSpecial episodes of ' (\", 2002) and ' (\", 2014), both series that featured Bakula as lead, included Stockwell as a guest star to reunite the two actors from \"Quantum Leap\". Further, \"Chasing Ghosts\" was directed by James Whitmore Jr., who had directed 15 episodes, and acted in three episodes, of \"Quantum Leap\".\nThe 2017 episode \"The Gang Turns Black\" of the series \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" features numerous \"Quantum Leap\" references. When the gang finds themselves in different bodies, Sweet Dee suggests that they are \"quantum leaping\". Bakula has a guest appearance, as himself, supposedly researching an upcoming role, but in fact working as a retirement home custodian due to lack of residuals.\nIn the 2019 film \",\" Scott Lang brings the show up as one of many examples of time travel in fiction allowing one to change one's own past, contrasting Bruce Banner's explanation that time travel works differently in their universe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It started out as a type of small beer that was brewed. Now root beer is typically a soft drink manufactured to be typically, but not exclusively, non-alcoholic, caffeine-free, sweet, and carbonated. It usually has a thick and foamy head.\nSince safrole, a key component of sassafras, was banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1960 due to its carcinogenicity, most commercial root beers have been flavored using artificial sassafras flavoring, but a few (e.g. Hansen's) use a safrole-free sassafras extract. There are many major root beer producers. A common use is to add vanilla ice cream to make a root beer float.\nHistory.\nRoot beer has been drunk in the United States since at least the eighteenth century. It has been sold in confectionery stores since at least the 1840s, and written recipes for root beer have been documented since the 1830s. In the nineteenth century, it was often consumed hot and was often used with medicinal intent. It was combined with soda as early as the 1850s; at that time it was sold as a syrup rather than a ready-made beverage.\nBeyond its aromatic qualities, the medicinal benefits of sassafras were well known to both Native Americans and Europeans, and druggists began marketing root beer for its medicinal qualities.\nPharmacist Charles Elmer Hires was the first to successfully market a commercial brand of root beer. Hires developed his root tea made from sassafras in 1875, debuted a commercial version of root beer at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876, and began selling his extract. Hires was a teetotaler who wanted to call the beverage \"root tea\". However, his desire to market the product to Pennsylvania coal miners caused him to call his product \"root beer\", instead.\nIn 1886, Hires began to bottle a beverage made from his famous extract. By 1893, root beer was distributed widely across the United States. Non-alcoholic versions of root beer became commercially successful, especially during Prohibition.\nNot all traditional or commercial root beers were sassafras-based. One of Hires's early competitors was Barq's, which began selling its sarsaparilla-based root beer in 1898 and was labeled simply as \"Barq's\".\nIn 1919, Roy Allen opened his root-beer stand in Lodi, California, which led to the development of A&amp;W Root Beer. One of Allen's innovations was that he served his homemade root beer in cold, frosty mugs. IBC Root Beer is another brand of commercially produced root beer that emerged during this period and is still well-known today.\nSafrole, the aromatic oil found in sassafras roots and bark that gave traditional root beer its distinctive flavor, was banned in commercially mass-produced foods and drugs by the FDA in 1960. Laboratory animals that were given oral doses of sassafras tea or sassafras oil that contained large doses of safrole developed permanent liver damage or various types of cancer. While sassafras is no longer used in commercially produced root beer and is sometimes replaced with artificial flavors, natural extracts with the safrole distilled and removed are available.\nA Museum of Root Beer opened in Wisconsin Dells in 2021.\nTraditional method.\nOne traditional recipe for making root beer involves cooking a syrup from molasses and water, letting the syrup cool for three hours, and combining it with the root ingredients (including sassafras root, sassafras bark, and wintergreen). Yeast was added, and the beverage was left to ferment for 12 hours, after which it was strained and rebottled for secondary fermentation. This recipe usually resulted in a beverage of 2% alcohol or less, although the recipe could be modified to produce a more alcoholic beverage (such variation is called \"hard root beer\").\nFoam.\nRoot beer was originally made with sassafras root and bark which, due to its mucilaginous properties, formed a natural, long lasting foam, a characteristic feature of the beverage. Root beer was originally carbonated by fermentation. As demand and technology changed, carbonated water was used. Some manufacturers used small amounts of starch (e.g. from cassava) with natural surfactants to reproduce the familiar foaming character of sassafras-based root beer. Some brands of root beer have distinctive foaming behaviors, which has been used as part of their marketing identity.\nIngredients.\nCommercial root beer is now produced in Canada and every U.S. state. Although this beverage's popularity is greatest in North America, some brands are produced in or imported by other countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Argentina, Germany, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Sweden, Vietnam, and Thailand. The flavor of these beverages may vary from typical North American versions, or be similar to those found in North America. While no standard recipe exists, the primary ingredients in modern root beer are filtered water, sugar, and safrole-free sassafras extract, which complements other flavors. Common flavorings are vanilla, caramel, wintergreen, black cherry bark, licorice root, sarsaparilla root, nutmeg, acacia, anise, molasses, cinnamon, sweet birch, and honey. Soybean protein or yucca are sometimes used to create a foamy quality, and caramel coloring is used to make the beverage brown.\nIngredients in early and traditional root beers include allspice, birch bark, coriander, juniper, ginger, wintergreen, hops, burdock root, dandelion root, spikenard, pipsissewa, guaiacum chips, sarsaparilla, spicewood, wild cherry bark, yellow dock, prickly ash bark, sassafras root, vanilla beans, dog grass, molasses and licorice. Many of these ingredients are still used in traditional and commercially produced root beer today, which is often thickened, foamed or carbonated.\nMost major brands other than Barq's are caffeine-free (Barq's contains about 1.8 mg of caffeine per fluid ounce).\nRoot beer can be made at home with processed extract obtained from a factory, or it can also be made from herbs and roots that have not yet been processed. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic traditional root beers make a thick and foamy head when poured, often enhanced by the addition of yucca extract, soybean protein, or other thickeners.\nAlcoholic root beers produced in the 2000s have included Small Town Brewery's Not Your Father's Root Beer; Coney Island Brewing Co.'s hard root beer; and Best Damn Brewing Co.'s Best Damn Root Beer.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54588", "revid": "12347213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54588", "title": "Captain Kangaroo", "text": "American children's television series\nCaptain Kangaroo is an American children's television series that aired weekday mornings on the American television network CBS for 29 years, from 1955 to 1984, making it the longest-running children's program on a commercial network. In 1986, the American Program Service (now American Public Television, Boston) integrated some newly produced segments into reruns of past episodes, distributing the newer version of the series to PBS and independent public stations until 1993.\nConception.\nThe show was conceived by Bob Keeshan, who also played the title character \"Captain Kangaroo\", and who based the show on \"the warm relationship between grandparents and children\". Keeshan had portrayed the original Clarabell the Clown on NBC's \"The Howdy Doody Show\" during the network's early years.\nShow structure.\n\"Captain Kangaroo\" had a loose structure, built around life in the \"Treasure House\" where the Captain (the name \"kangaroo\" came from the bigger pockets in his coat) would perform storytelling, meet guests, and indulge in silly stunts with regular characters, both humans and puppets. Keeshan performed as the Captain more than 9,000 times over the nearly 30-year run of the show.\nChanges in setting and duration.\nThe May 17, 1971, episode had two major changes on the show: The Treasure House was renovated and renamed \"The Captain's Place\" and the Captain replaced his navy blue coat with a red coat. In September 1981, CBS shortened the hour-long show to a half-hour, briefly retitled it \"Wake Up with the Captain\", and moved it to an earlier time slot; it\u00a0was moved to weekends in September 1982, and returned to an hour-long format. CBS canceled \"Captain Kangaroo\" at the end of 1984.\nLongevity record.\n\"Captain Kangaroo\" was the longest-running American network children's television show until 1997 when it was surpassed by \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", which itself was surpassed by \"Sesame Street\" in 2003. \"Captain Kangaroo\" is still far and away the longest-running children's TV series by episode count with 6,090 episodes. When one counts the 65 edited versions (severely altered re-runs) that aired on PBS the episode count goes up to 6,155. As of October 2024, second-place holder \"Sesame Street\" has aired 4,731 episodes.\nFormat.\nThe show takes place in and around the Treasure House, later called the Captain's Place, where the Captain would interact with puppets, guests, and other members of the cast. Even the opening sequence changed.\nEach episode began with the theme music playing, then the Captain makes his entrance to the studio by unlocking and opening the doors of the Treasure House from the inside, where viewers would catch their first glimpse of him. Then he puts the Treasure House keys on a nail, and the music ends. On rare occasions, the Captain could not get the keys to stay on the nail, and when they fell off, the theme song plays again. One never knew exactly what would happen from one episode to the next, although at certain times of the year, such as the Christmas season, paper cutout versions of such stories as \"The Littlest Snowman\" would be shown.\nCartoons.\nSeveral cartoon shorts were featured over the course of the series' run, including:\nA cartoon starring a funnel-capped shapeshifting boy named \"Tom Terrific\" was part of the show in the 1950s and 1960s. Tom had a sidekick named Mighty Manfred the Wonder Dog, and an archenemy, Crabby Appleton (\"I'm rotten to the core!\"). Other cartoons included \"Lariat Sam\", who (aided by his loyal horse \"Tippytoes\"), confronted his nemesis \"Badlands Meanie\" and his sidekick \"Bushwhack\". \"The Adventures of Lariat Sam\" was developed by veteran game show announcer Gene Wood, then a show staffer (who also sang the cartoon's theme song).\nThe British cartoon \"Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings\" appeared in the 1970s, featuring a child with magic chalk who could create all sorts of short-lived creations in short adventures. The original version featured a British narrator, Bernard Cribbins, but Keeshan's voice was dubbed onto the cartoons for their U.S. airing.\nAnother British-produced cartoon, \"Ludwig\", about a magical egg-shaped robot, was also included around the same time as \"Simon\". The cartoon's musical score consisted of selections from the works of Beethoven.\nAlso appearing in the 1970s was \"The Most Important Person\", a series of five-minute segments on the importance of life, and \"The Kingdom of Could Be You\", a series of five-minute segments on the importance of careers and the work world.\nThe cartoon series called \"The Toothbrush Family\" was based on an extended family of hygiene utensils, as the name suggests; they would embark on adventures based in the bathroom, like water skiing in the tub, or rescuing friends caught in the drain. Episodes were generally a few minutes each and basically revolved around teaching children the importance of oral hygiene.\nA silent cartoon in the 1970s named \"Crystal Tipps and Alistair\" featured the adventures of a young girl and her dog. Later reruns were narrated by the voice of Mr. Moose. Another British favorite, \"The Wombles\", was also featured.\n\"The Red and the Blue\" shorts from Italy, as well as \"The Undersea Adventures of Captain Nemo\", featuring a family of sea explorers, were also shown.\n\"Good morning, Captain!\".\nStarting in 1974, the show opened with different people wishing the Captain \"good morning\". Many of the openings featured noncelebrities, but some featured stars from TV shows, most of which broadcast over CBS. The montage of \"good mornings\" always ended with the Captain himself returning the greeting before the opening sequence.\nRegular features.\nOther regular features included \"The Magic Drawing Board\" and the Captain's \"Reading Stories\" sessions, which introduced kids to stories such as \"Curious George\", \"Make Way for Ducklings\", \"Stone Soup\", \"Caps for Sale\", and \"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel.\" The Sweet Pickles books were also featured.\nSongs were a regular part of the show, from \"Captain Kangaroo\" to many traditional tunes to popular songs interpreted by puppets. Carmino Ravosa was a songwriter on the show from 1975 to 1977.\nOn the first show of every month, the Captain had a birthday cake for all of the children with birthdays that month.\nKeeshan also had a recurring role as the Town Clown, a pantomime piece that took place in and around the exposed wagon home of a tramp-like circus clown. Like the character Clarabelle that he played on \"Howdy Doody\", the Town Clown never spoke.\nFavorite characters on the show were Grandfather Clock (voiced by Cosmo Allegretti), Bunny Rabbit, Rollo the Hippo, and Dancing Bear. Dancing Bear was mute and only appeared in short subject features. He often danced waltzes to background music.\nOne of the show's long-running gags was the \"Ping-Pong Ball Drop\", instigated by the telling of a joke (usually a knock-knock joke) by Mr. Moose, in which the punchline included the words \"ping-pong balls\". At the mention of those three words, a shower of ping-pong balls was released from above on the Captain.\nThe show often had simple black light theatre segments using paper or cardboard cutouts. A notable recording of a popular song, such as Judy Garland's Decca recording of \"Over the Rainbow\" (from \"The Wizard of Oz\"), Mary Martin singing \"Never Never Land\" (from the original cast recording of the musical \"Peter Pan\"), or Danny Kaye singing \"Inchworm\" (from the Decca recording of the songs from \"Hans Christian Andersen\") were heard while the cutouts played on the screen, animated by a concealed puppeteer. On other occasions, full-fledged hand puppets \"performed\" to the song being played (as in the case when a hand puppet dressed in Spanish clothing performed to a recording of tenor Allan Jones singing \"The Donkey Serenade\").\nAlso, about two or three times in an episode, short film clips on certain topics played over a song about that particular topic.\nEspecially in later seasons, the show also featured a running gag in selected episodes during which the Captain would try to perform a particular activity three or four times, only to fail in a different way with each attempt.\nFamiliar props included a mockup of a talking cathedral-style radio that Keeshan simply called Radio. Keeshan would turn the large knobs on Radio to get a conversation going. Reminiscent of the old Atwater Kent cathedrals, Radio had a rather interesting conversation with a smaller transistor radio in one show. Also featured was a huge Colgate toothpaste box with a large windup or clockwork key on the side. Keeshan turned the key to play a jingle (\"Colgate Fluoride M-F-P/Helps Prevent the Cavity/And it Tastes Great, Naturally!\") for the show's sponsor, Colgate Toothpaste.\nAt the end of each episode, the Captain always encouraged parents watching the show to spend some quality time with their children every day, and he often demonstrated various creative ways in which to do so. In later seasons, that changed to him saying, \"Well, what would you like to do today? You know it could be a good day for...\" then a song would list many different activities while short film clips of each corresponding activity are presented, then the song ended with the singers saying, \"There's so much to do. These things are just a few.\" Then it would cut back to the Captain, who would sign off with, \"So whatever \"you\" do, have a great day!\"\nTheme song.\nThe first theme song for \"Captain Kangaroo\" titled \"Puffin' Billy\" was used from the show's debut in 1955 until 1974. It was an instrumental piece of light music, written by Edward G. White and recorded by the Melodi Light Orchestra. The track was from a British stock music production library known as the Chappell Recorded Music Library, which was sold through a New York agency called Emil Ascher. The tune's original title referred to a British steam locomotive. The tune was used on various programs on both sides of the Atlantic and was already popular in the United Kingdom: for example, two years before \"Captain Kangaroo\", it served as the wrap-up music for an episode of the radio program \"Rocky Fortune\" called \"Murder Among the Statues\". In the United Kingdom, it became famous as the theme to the weekly BBC radio program \"Children's Favourites\" from 1952 to 1966, and is still widely recognised by the postwar generation. It was later used in the Enid Blyton parody \"Five Go Mad in Dorset\" and in a number of British TV advertisements, including a Captain Sensible spot. The \"Puffin' Billy\" theme played as the opening of each episode, with the music continuing until the Captain hung his large ring of keys on a nail, which seemed to act as a switch to end the music abruptly. If the Captain's keys ever slipped off the nail, the music plays again. In 1957, lyricist Mary Rogers penned lyrics to the tune, creating a newly titled \"Captain Kangaroo\" song.\nIn 1974, a new theme song titled \"Good Morning, Captain\" was composed for \"Captain Kangaroo,\" written by Robert L. Brush. As the new theme used similar melodic elements from the original theme, Edward G. White's name was added to the song credits. However, due to copyright issues, the song was re-recorded in 1979 without the portion of \"Puffin' Billy\" featured in the first version. During the brief \"Wake Up With the Captain\" era, a theme titled \"Wake Up\" was used, but was dropped after the program moved to weekends. For the show's later seasons from 1982 to 1984 and subsequent PBS run, \"Schoolhouse Rock\" mainstay Lynn Ahrens (who composed and performed a few \"Captain Kangaroo\" songs herself) wrote a new theme, entitled \"Here Comes Captain Kangaroo\".\nThe theme song for \"The All New Captain Kangaroo\" used the opening notes and part of the melody of the original theme as its introduction. Bob Keeshan also recorded music for both Columbia Records and Golden Records, aimed at introducing all kinds of music to children.\nSchedule history.\nWhile \"Captain Kangaroo\" was still in planning stages, CBS executives had the idea of hiring Al Lewis, who was hosting a popular kids' show at WCPO-TV in Cincinnati, to host their program. But when station management refused to release Lewis from his contract, they selected Keeshan to host. Lewis' own program, \"The Uncle Al Show\", ended its run in Cincinnati a year after \"Captain Kangaroo\" left CBS.\nCBS aired the program on weekday mornings, initially telecast live in the Eastern and Central time zones at 8:00 am (ET)/7:00 am (CT) for its first four years (it would eventually be scheduled for 8:00 am in all time zones). Same-day episodes would be broadcast on kinescope for Western audiences, as Keeshan would not perform the show live three times a day. For the first three months, \"Captain Kangaroo\" was only seen on weekday mornings. From December 1955 until 1968, the show was also seen on Saturday mornings, except in the 1964\u20131965 season, when it was replaced by a Keeshan vehicle called \"Mr. Mayor\". Except for pre-emption by news or special events, notably the four-day continuous coverage which followed the November 22, 1963, assassination of John F. Kennedy, and a few shows that were 45\u00a0minutes, the show aired a full 60\u00a0minutes on weekday mornings until 1981.\nThe audience of children could never compete in the ratings with such entertainment/news shows as NBC's \"Today\", although \"Captain Kangaroo\" won Emmy Awards three times as Outstanding Children's entertainment series in 1978\u20131979, 1982\u20131983, and 1983\u20131984. In the fall of 1981, to make more room for the expansion of \"The CBS Morning News\", the Captain was moved to an earlier time slot of 7:00 am and cut to 30\u00a0minutes, sporting the new title \"Wake Up with the Captain\". The show was moved again in the spring of 1982 to 6:30\u00a0am, a time when few children (or adults) were awake. In the fall of 1982, it returned to an hour format, but was moved to Saturday mornings at 7:00 am ET and 6:00 am in other time zones. Reruns from the previous season were offered to CBS affiliates to run Sunday morning in place of the cartoon reruns offered before, but most declined. One-third of affiliates no longer ran the show at all after 1982, and it was again reduced to a half-hour in the fall of 1984. Angered over the reduction of his program for the second time, Keeshan chose to step down at the end of 1984, after his contract with CBS expired. After the show ended, Children's Television Workshop hired some of its staff to work on \"Sesame Street\".\nJust over a year later, on September 1, 1986, \"Captain Kangaroo\" returned in reruns on PBS, with funding from public television stations, School Zone Publishing Company, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. American Public Television, then known as the Interregional Program Service, distributed the show, along with Britder Associates (Keeshan's production company).\nThe original director of the program was Peter Birch, who helmed the program for its first 25\u00a0years. Producer Jimmy Hirschfeld took over as director following Birch's heart attack in 1980 and continued directing, as well as producing throughout the rest of the show's run, including the new segments inserted into the PBS reruns, until it went off the air in 1993.\nThe cast of \"Captain Kangaroo\" also hosted the CBS coverage of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade for several years in the 1960s.\nSchwinn marketing.\nFrom the late 1950s, the Schwinn Bicycle Company made use of children's television programming to expand its dominance of the child and youth bicycle markets. The company was an early sponsor (from 1958) of \"Captain Kangaroo\". The Captain himself was enlisted to sell Schwinn-brand bicycles to the show's audience, typically six years old and under. At the end of each live Schwinn marketing promotion, Bob Keeshan would intone, \"Schwinn bikes\u2014the quality bikes\u2014are best!\" and \"Prices slightly higher in the South and in the West\". The on-air marketing program was deemed successful by Schwinn, and the company increased its market share of child and youth bicycles throughout the 1960s.\nThe marketing program continued through the 1971 season, when the Federal Trade Commission's Staff Report, \"Guidelines on Advertising to Children\", recommended against Schwinn's on-air marketing practices using the show's host. In response, Schwinn and the show's writers altered the format in 1972. The Captain no longer insisted that his viewers purchase a Schwinn, but instead made regular on-air consultations of a new character, Mr. Schwinn Dealer. A 1973 internal company news article concluded that the show's child audience had difficulty separating Schwinn's sales pitch from the regular content of the show.\n1997 reboot.\nIn 1997\u20132000, a rebooted series titled \"The All New Captain Kangaroo\" was produced by Saban Entertainment in association with TLC Entertainment. Eric S. Rollman, who also served as President of Saban and Fox Family Productions, was executive producer. George Taweel and Rob Loos of TLC produced the series. John McDonough played the Captain on this version, which was shot in Tampa, Florida, and featured animal segments shot at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and Seaworld in Orlando. Keeshan was invited to appear as a special guest called \"The Admiral\", but declined. Thirteen episodes were produced for syndication with an additional twenty-seven episodes serving as the centerpiece for a programming block on Fox, Fox Kids Network (later known as Fox Kids), and The Family Channel (later known as Fox Family Channel) dubbed \"Captain Kangaroo's Treasure House\", from 1997 to 2000; the block also featured reruns of \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\" and \"Magic Adventures of Mumfie\", as well a spin-off show, \"Mister Moose's Fun Time\", which included cartoon segments from around the world, as well as clips from The Wiggles. When Disney bought Fox Family, the company shelved \"The All New Captain Kangaroo\" and \"Mister Moose's Fun Time\", allegedly due to the fact the reboot advertised Busch Gardens and SeaWorld, rivals of Walt Disney World. \nTrademark.\nIn 2011, the trademark for the Captain Kangaroo name was acquired by the Cashin Comedy Co. In a blog, the Captain is portrayed by Pat Cashin, an entertainer and professional clown. Cashin died in 2016 at the age of 48, leaving the rights to this version with his estate. Creative Artists Agency, the successor to \"Captain Kangaroo\"'s previous rights holders Marvin Josephson Associates and ICM Partners, is the current owner of the series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He created and played the title role in the children's television program \"Captain Kangaroo\", which ran from 1955 to 1984, the longest-running nationally broadcast children's television program of its day. He also played the original Clarabell the Clown on the \"Howdy Doody\" television program.\nEarly life.\nRobert James Keeshan was born to Irish parents in Lynbrook, New York. After an early graduation in 1945 from Forest Hills High School in Queens, New York, during World War II, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, but was still in the United States when Japan surrendered. He attended Fordham University on the GI Bill. He received his bachelor's degree in education in 1951.\nAn urban legend claims that actor Lee Marvin said on \"The Tonight Show\" that he had fought alongside Keeshan at the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Over time, this legend has been published verbatim. Other legends had compounded on it, such that Keeshan was a trained killer, that he was awarded the Navy Cross, that he was a tough sergeant who saved the lives of dozens of men and women in the war, and that he destroyed a German tank in action in North Africa (an apparent confusion with a similarly named British soldier). However, Marvin never made the statement (he never served in Iwo Jima, but was wounded during the Battle of Saipan). Keeshan never saw combat in Europe or Japan, having enlisted too late to serve overseas. The Naval Historical Center in Washington, D.C, still receives calls asking for verification of Keeshan's \"heroic\" war service. Keeshan continuously dispelled the rumors.\nTelevision career.\nNetwork television programs began shortly after the end of the war. \"Howdy Doody\", which premiered in 1947 on NBC, was one of the first. Starting on January 3, 1948, Keeshan played Clarabell the Clown, a silent Auguste clown who communicated by honking several horns attached to a belt around his waist. One honk meant \"yes\"; two meant \"no\". Clarabell often sprayed Buffalo Bob Smith with a seltzer bottle and played practical jokes. Keeshan had conflicts with Smith and in late 1952 left the show, or possibly was fired, after hiring an agent for himself and other workers on the show.\nBy September 21, 1953, Keeshan came back to local TV on WABC-TV, Channel 7 in New York City, in a new children's show, \"Time for Fun\". He played Corny the Clown, and this time he spoke. Later that same year, in addition to \"Time for Fun\", he began \"Tinker's Workshop\", a program aimed at preschoolers, where he played the grandfather-like Tinker.\nDeveloping ideas from \"Tinker's Workshop\", Keeshan and his long-time friend Jack Miller submitted the concept of \"Captain Kangaroo\" to the CBS network, which was looking for innovative approaches to children's television programming. CBS approved the show, and Keeshan starred as the title character when it premiered on CBS on October 3, 1955. He described his character as based on \"the warm relationship between grandparents and children\". The show was an immediate success, and he served as its host for nearly three decades.\nRecurring characters included his sidekick (and fan favorite) Mr. Green Jeans (played by Hugh \"Lumpy\" Brannum), Dennis (played by Cosmo Allegretti), and puppets such as Bunny Rabbit and Mr. Moose.\n\"The New York Times\" commented: \"Captain Kangaroo, a round-faced, pleasant, mustachioed man possessed of an unshakable calm ... was one of the most enduring characters television ever produced.\"\nKeeshan also had a Saturday morning show called \"Mister Mayor\" during the 1964\u201365 season. Keeshan, in his role as the central characters in both \"Captain Kangaroo\" and \"Mister Mayor\", heavily promoted the products of the Schwinn Bicycle Co., a sponsor, directly on-air to his audience. By 1972, he had introduced another character on \"Captain Kangaroo\" to recommend Schwinn products: Mr. Schwinn Dealer, due to the Federal Trade Commission ruling against children's show hosts directly endorsing their sponsor's products during their programs after 1969.\nKeeshan had a longtime close friendship with Fred Rogers of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\". Each paid visits to the other's show in 1970, and they appeared together on the PBS special \"Springtime with Mister Rogers\" in 1980. The following year, Rogers appeared briefly in Keeshan's TV special \"Good Evening, Captain\" (following Keeshan's 1981 heart attack); Rogers and Dick Clark presented Keeshan with flowers at the end of the show.\nKeeshan did voice recordings for a number of albums for Columbia Records, Golden Records and RCA-Victor. Several were of children's songs performed with other characters from \"Captain Kangaroo\", but other albums included \"A Child's Introduction to Jazz\", narration for \"Peter and the Wolf\" conducted by Leopold Stokowski, and \"Captain Kangaroo Introduces You to the Nutcracker Suite\".\nHeart attack and retirement.\nKeeshan suffered a severe heart attack just moments after stepping off a plane at Toronto Pearson International Airport on July 11, 1981, which pushed the start of a revamped version of his show back to at least mid-August. He had come to the city to accept a children's service award.\nKeeshan underwent triple-bypass surgery and received an estimated 5,000 get-well wishes from fans during his hospitalization.\nFollowing the heart attack, Keeshan received three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in 1982, 1983, and 1984. Despite these accolades, Keeshan's show was shortened from its hour-long format to 30 minutes in 1981, to make room for the expansion of the \"CBS Morning News\" lineup. The program was retitled \"Wake Up with the Captain\", and moved to a new 7:00 am time slot. At the start of 1982, the show was rescheduled to an even earlier slot of 6:30 am. In the fall of 1982, CBS installed it as a weekend-only hour offering, and two years later, in the fall of 1984, the show became a Saturday half-hour entry.\nTired of CBS's constant reductions of his show, Keeshan left \"Captain Kangaroo\" when his contract with the network ended in December 1984, just nine months shy of the show's 30th anniversary. By 1987, repeats of the show were airing daily on many PBS stations.\nKeeshan's show was given a farewell of sorts with \"Captain Kangaroo and Friends\", a primetime network TV special that aired in 1985.\nLater life.\nAfter \"Captain Kangaroo\" ended, Keeshan hosted 1985's \"CBS Storybreak\", which featured animated versions of children's literature. He appeared in framing sequences for the animated stories, showcasing the book versions and suggesting similar books for the viewers to seek out. In 1987, he founded Corporate Family Solutions with former Tennessee Republican governor Lamar Alexander, which provided day-care programs to businesses.\nHe was a strong advocate against video game violence and took part in congressional hearings in 1993. He also joined with parents' groups in the 1980s who protested children's TV shows based on toys like He-Man and Transformers, feeling that toys turned into TV shows did not teach children anything about the real world. He also made a rare film appearance in \"The Stupids\" in 1996.\nIn 1997, he starred as the Wizard in the St. Louis Muny outdoor theater production of \"The Wizard of Oz\".\nIn the 1990s, Keeshan expressed an interest in bringing back a new version of \"Captain Kangaroo\" as a gentler and kinder answer to the violent cartoons on children's television. Despite having sponsors and television stations lined up, he was unable to obtain permission from ICM, the company that owned the rights to \"Captain Kangaroo\" at that time. In 1994, Keeshan was featured as a semi-regular on the FX daytime talk show \"Breakfast Time\".\nPersonal life.\nKeeshan was married to Anne Jeanne Laurie Keeshan for 45 years, until her death February 25, 1996. They had three children: Michael Derek, Laurie Margaret, and Maeve Jeanne.\nKeeshan resided on Melbury Road in Babylon, Long Island, New York, before moving to spend the last 14\u00a0years of his life in Norwich, Vermont, where he became a children's advocate, as well as an author. His memoirs, \"Good Morning, Captain\", were published in 1995 by Fairview Press. Bob Keeshan died in Windsor, Vermont, on January 23, 2004, at age 76. He was buried in Saint Joseph's Cemetery in Babylon, New York.\nKeeshan's grandson, Britton Keeshan, became the youngest person at that time to have climbed the Seven Summits by climbing Mount Everest in May 2004. He carried photographs of his grandfather on that ascent, and he buried a photo of the two of them at the summit.\nAwards.\nKeeshan received many honors and awards, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54592", "revid": "38205273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54592", "title": "Cicada", "text": "Superfamily of insects\nThe cicadas () are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. The superfamily is divided into two families, the Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and the Cicadidae, with more than 3,000 species described from around the world; many species remain undescribed. Nearly all cicada species are annual cicadas with the exception of the few North American periodical cicada species, genus\u00a0\"Magicicada\", which in a given region emerge en masse every 13 or 17 years.\nCicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song, produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drum-like tymbals. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees, feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue, and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic. The vast majority of species are active during the day as adults, with some calling at dawn or dusk. Only a rare few species are known to be nocturnal.\nOne exclusively North American genus, \"Magicicada\" (the periodical cicadas), which spend most of their lives as underground nymphs, emerge in predictable intervals of 13 or 17 years, depending on the species and the location. The unusual timing and synchronization of their emergence may reduce cicada losses to predation by making them less reliable prey and by overwhelming predators with sheer numbers before significant losses occur.\nThe annual cicadas are species that emerge every year. Though these cicadas' life cycles can vary from 1 to 9 or more years as underground nymphs, their emergence above ground as adults is not synchronized, so some members of each species appear every year.\nCicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer's \"Iliad\" and as motifs in art from the Chinese Shang dynasty. They have also been used in myth and folklore as symbols of carefree living and immortality. The cicada is also mentioned in Hesiod's \"Shield\" (ll.393\u2013394), in which it is said to sing when millet first ripens. Cicadas are eaten by humans in various parts of the world, including China, Myanmar, Malaysia, central Africa and parts of Mexico.\nEtymology.\nThe name is directly from the onomatopoeic Latin \"cicada\".\nTaxonomy and diversity.\nThe superfamily Cicadoidea is a sister of the Cercopoidea (the froghoppers). Cicadas are arranged into two families: the Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae. The two extant species of the Tettigarctidae include one in southern Australia and the other in Tasmania. The family Cicadidae is subdivided into the subfamilies Cicadettinae, Cicadinae, Derotettiginae, Tibicininae (or Tettigadinae), and Tettigomyiinae, and they are found on all continents except Antarctica. Some previous works also included a family-level taxon called the Tibiceninae. The largest species is the Malaysian emperor cicada \"Megapomponia imperatoria\"; its wingspan is up to about . Cicadas are also notable for the great length of time some species take to mature.\nAt least 3,000 cicada species are distributed worldwide, in essentially any habitat that has deciduous trees, with the majority being in the tropics. Most genera are restricted to a single biogeographical region, and many species have a very limited range. This high degree of endemism has been used to study the biogeography of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and Asia. There are several hundred described species in Australia and New Zealand, around 150 in South Africa, over 170 in America north of Mexico, at least 800 in Latin America, and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific.\nAbout 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe, and a single species was known from England, the New Forest cicada, \"Cicadetta montana\", which also occurs in continental Europe. Many species await formal description and many well-known species are yet to be studied carefully using modern acoustic analysis tools that allow their songs to be characterized.\nMany of the North American species are the annual or jarfly or dog-day cicadas, members of the \"Neotibicen\", \"Megatibicen\", or \"Hadoa\" genera, so named because they emerge in late July and August. The best-known North American genus, however, may be \"Magicicada\". These periodical cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 or 17 years, with adults suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.\nAustralian cicadas are found on tropical islands and cold coastal beaches around Tasmania, in tropical wetlands, high and low deserts, alpine areas of New South Wales and Victoria, large cities including Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, and Tasmanian highlands and snowfields. Many of them have common names such as cherry nose, brown baker, red eye, greengrocer, yellow Monday, whisky drinker, double drummer, and black prince. The Australian greengrocer, \"Cyclochila australasiae\", is among the loudest insects in the world.\nMore than 40 species from five genera populate New Zealand, ranging from sea level to mountain tops, and all are endemic to New Zealand and its surrounding islands (Kermadec Islands, Chatham Islands). One species is found on Norfolk Island, which technically is part of Australia. The closest relatives of the NZ cicadas live in New Caledonia and Australia.\nPalaeontology.\nFossil Cicadomorpha first appeared in the Late Triassic. The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families. The Upper Permian Dunstaniidae are found in Australia and South Africa, and also in younger rocks from China. The Upper Triassic Mesogereonidae are found in Australia and South Africa. This group, though, is currently thought to be more distantly related to Cicadomorpha than previously thought.\nThe Palaeontinidae or \"giant cicadas\" (though only distantly related to true cicadas) come from the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of Eurasia and South America. The first of these was a fore wing discovered in the Taynton Limestone Formation of Oxfordshire, England; it was initially described as a butterfly in 1873, before being recognised as a cicada-like form and renamed \"Palaeontina oolitica\".\nTettigarctidae and Cicadidae had diverged from each other prior to or during the Jurassic, as evidenced by fossils related to both lineages present by the Middle Jurassic (~165 million years ago). The morphology of well preserved fossils of early relatives of Cicadidae from the mid Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar suggests that unlike many modern cicadids, they were either silent or only made quiet sounds. Most fossil Cicadidae are known from the Cenozoic, and the oldest unambiguously identified modern cicadid is \"Davispia bearcreekensis\" (subfamily Tibicininae) from the Paleocene, around 56\u201359 million years ago.\nBiology.\nDescription.\nCicadas are large insects made conspicuous by the courtship calls of the males. They are characterized by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and three to six segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on the rear of the fore wing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hind wing.\nCicadas are feeble jumpers, and nymphs lack the ability to jump altogether. Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the fore limbs of nymphs for underground life. The relict family Tettigarctidae differs from the Cicadidae in having the prothorax extending as far as the scutellum, and by lacking the tympanal apparatus.\nThe adult insect, known as an imago, is in total length in most species. The largest, the empress cicada (\"Megapomponia imperatoria\"), has a head-body length around , and its wingspan is . Cicadas have prominent compound eyes set wide apart on the sides of the head. The short antennae protrude between the eyes or in front of them. They also have three small ocelli located on the top of the head in a triangle between the two large eyes; this distinguishes cicadas from other members of the Hemiptera. The mouthparts form a long, sharp rostrum that they insert into the plant to feed. The postclypeus is a large, nose-like structure that lies between the eyes and makes up most of the front of the head; it contains the pumping musculature.\nThe thorax has three segments and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have two pairs of membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy, or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen. The abdomen is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.\nThe surface of the fore wing is superhydrophobic; it is covered with minute, waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a water-repellent film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, the cicada leaps several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. Bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled; rather, their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.\nTemperature regulation.\nDesert cicadas such as \"Diceroprocta apache\" are unusual among insects in controlling their temperature by evaporative cooling, analogous to sweating in mammals. When their temperature rises above about , they suck excess sap from the food plants and extrude the excess water through pores in the tergum at a modest cost in energy. Such a rapid loss of water can be sustained only by feeding on water-rich xylem sap. At lower temperatures, feeding cicadas would normally need to excrete the excess water. By evaporative cooling, desert cicadas can reduce their bodily temperature by some 5\u00a0\u00b0C. Some non-desert cicada species such as \"Magicicada tredecem\" also cool themselves evaporatively, but less dramatically. Conversely, many other cicadas can voluntarily raise their body temperatures as much as 22\u00a0\u00b0C (40\u00a0\u00b0F) above ambient temperature.\nSong.\nThe \"singing\" of male cicadas is produced principally and in the majority of species using a special structure called a tymbal, a pair of which lies below each side of the anterior abdominal region. The structure is buckled by muscular action and, being made of resilin, unbuckles rapidly on muscle relaxation, producing their characteristic sounds. Some cicadas, however, have mechanisms for stridulation, sometimes in addition to the tymbals. Here, the wings are rubbed over a series of midthoracic ridges. In the Chinese species \"Subpsaltria yangi\", both males and females can stridulate. The sounds may further be modulated by membranous coverings and by resonant cavities.\nThe male abdomen in some species is largely hollow, and acts as a sound box. By rapidly vibrating these membranes, a cicada combines the clicks into apparently continuous notes, and enlarged chambers derived from the tracheae serve as resonating chambers with which it amplifies the sound. The cicada also modulates the song by positioning its abdomen toward or away from the substrate (their perch). Partly by the pattern in which it combines the clicks, each species produces its own distinctive mating songs and acoustic signals, ensuring that the song attracts only appropriate mates. The tettigarctid (or hairy) cicadas have rudimentary tymbals in both sexes and do not produce airborne sounds, rather, both males and females produce vibrations that are transmitted through the tree they perch upon. They are considered as representing the original state from which other cicada communication has evolved.\nAverage temperature of the natural habitat for the South American species \"Fidicina rana\" is about . During sound production, the temperature of the tymbal muscles was found to be significantly higher. Many cicadas sing most actively during the hottest hours of a summer day; roughly a 24-hour cycle. Most cicadas are diurnal in their calling and depend on external heat to warm them up, while a few are capable of raising their temperatures using muscle action and some species are known to call at dusk. \"Kanakia gigas\" and \"Froggattoides typicus\" are among the few that are known to be truly nocturnal and there may be other nocturnal species living in tropical forests.\nCicadas call from varying heights on trees. Where multiple species occur, the species may use different heights and timing of calling. While the vast majority of cicadas call from above the ground, two Californian species, \"Okanagana pallidula\" and \"O. vanduzeei\" are known to call from hollows made at the base of the tree below the ground level. The adaptive significance is unclear, as the calls are not amplified or modified by the burrow structure, but this may avoid predation.\nAlthough only males produce the cicadas' distinctive sounds, both sexes have membranous structures called tympana (singular \u2013 tympanum) by which they detect sounds, the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120\u00a0dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song is loud enough to cause permanent hearing loss in humans should the cicada be at \"close range\". In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.\nFor the human ear, telling precisely where a cicada song originates is often difficult. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.\nThe songs of cicadas are considered by entomologists to be unique to a given species, and a number of resources exist to collect and analyse cicada sounds.\nLife cycle.\nIn some species of cicadas, the males remain in one location and call to attract females. Sometimes, several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move from place to place, usually with quieter calls, while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs. Both male and female cicadas die within a few weeks after emerging from the soil. Although they have mouthparts and are able to consume some plant liquids for nutrition, the amount eaten is very small and the insects have a natural adult lifespan of less than two months.\nWhen the eggs hatch, the newly hatched nymphs drop to the ground and burrow. Cicadas live underground as nymphs for most of their lives at depths of about . Nymphs have strong front legs for digging and excavating chambers near to roots, where they feed on xylem sap. In the process, their bodies and interior of the burrow become coated in anal fluids. In wet habitats, larger species construct mud towers above ground to aerate their burrows. In the final nymphal instar, they construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge. They then molt (shed their skins) on a nearby plant for the last time, and emerge as adults. The exuviae or abandoned exoskeletons remain, still clinging to the bark of the tree.\nMost cicadas go through a life cycle that lasts 2\u20135 years. Some species have much longer life cycles, such as the North American genus, \"Magicicada\", which has a number of distinct \"broods\" that go through either a 17-year (Brood XIII), or in some parts of the region, a 13-year (Brood XIX) life cycle The long life cycles may have developed as a response to predators, such as the cicada killer wasp and praying mantis. A specialist predator with a shorter life cycle of at least two years could not reliably prey upon the cicadas; for example, a 17-year cicada with a predator with a five-year life cycle will only be threatened by a peak predator population every 85 (5 \u00d7 17) years, while a non-prime cycle such as 15 would be endangered at every year of emergence. An alternate hypothesis is that these long life cycles evolved during the ice ages so as to overcome cold spells, and that as species co-emerged and hybridized, they left distinct species that did not hybridize having periods matching prime numbers. The 13- and 17-year cicadas only emerge in the midwestern and eastern US in the same year every 221 years (13 \u00d7 17), with 2024 being the first such year since 1803.\nDiet.\nCicada nymphs drink sap from the xylem of various species of trees, including oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple. While common folklore indicates that adults do not eat, they actually do drink plant sap using their sucking mouthparts. \nCicadas excrete fluid in streams of droplets due to their high volume consumption of xylem sap. The jets of urine that cicadas produce have a velocity of up to 3 meters per second, making them the fastest among all assessed animals, including mammals like elephants and horses.\nLocomotion.\nCicadas, unlike other Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight, but they do not walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel distances greater than a few centimetres.\nPredators, parasites, and pathogens.\nCicadas are commonly eaten by birds and mammals, as well as bats, wasps, mantises, spiders, and robber flies. In times of mass emergence of cicadas, various amphibians, fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds change their foraging habits so as to benefit from the glut. Newly hatched nymphs may be eaten by ants, and nymphs living underground are preyed on by burrowing mammals such as moles. In northern Japan, brown bears prey on final instar nymphs of cicadas during summer by digging up the ground. In Australia, cicadas are preyed on by the Australian cicada killer wasp (\"Exeirus lateritius\"), which stings and stuns cicadas high in the trees, making them drop to the ground, where the cicada hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100 m, until they can be shoved down into its burrow, where the numb cicadas are placed onto one of many shelves in a \"catacomb\", to form the food stock for the wasp grub that grows out of the egg deposited there. A katydid predator from Australia is capable of attracting singing male cicadas of a variety of species by imitating the timed click replies of sexually receptive female cicadas, which respond in pair formation by flicking their wings. Their prime-number life cycle prevents predators with a life cycle of two or more years from synchronising with their emergence.\nSeveral fungal diseases infect and kill adult cicadas, while other fungi in the genera \"Ophiocordyceps\" and \"Isaria\" attack nymphs. \"Massospora cicadina\" specifically attacks the adults of periodical cicadas, the spores remaining dormant in the soil between outbreaks. This fungus is also capable of dosing cicadas with psilocybin, the psychedelic drug found in magic mushrooms, as well as cathinone, an alkaloid similar to various amphetamines. These chemicals alter the behaviour of the cicadas, driving males to copulate, including attempts with males, and is thought to be beneficial to the fungus, as the fungal spores are dispersed by a larger number of infected carriers.\nPlants can also defend themselves against cicadas. Although cicadas can feed on the roots of gymnosperms, it has been found that resinous conifers such as pine do not allow the eggs of \"Magicicada\" to hatch, the resin sealing up the egg cavities.\nAntipredator adaptations.\nCicadas use a variety of strategies to evade predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are extremely well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight. Being coloured like tree bark and disruptively patterned to break up their outlines, they are difficult to discern; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.\nSome cicadas such as \"Hemisciera maculipennis\" display bright deimatic flash coloration on their hind wings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the cicadas time to escape. Most cicadas are diurnal and rely on camouflage when at rest, but some species use aposematism-related Batesian mimicry, wearing the bright colors that warn of toxicity in other animals; the Malaysian \"Huechys sanguinea\" has conspicuous red and black warning coloration, is diurnal, and boldly flies about in full view of possible predators.\nPredators such as the sarcophagid fly \"Emblemasoma\" hunt cicadas by sound, being attracted to their songs. Singing males soften their song so that the attention of the listener gets distracted to neighbouring louder singers, or cease singing altogether as a predator approaches. A loud cicada song, especially in chorus, has been asserted to repel predators, but observations of predator responses refute the claim.\nIn human culture.\nIn art and literature.\nCicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer's \"Iliad\", and as motifs in decorative art from the Chinese Shang dynasty (1766\u20131122 BCE). They are described by Aristotle in his \"History of Animals\" and by Pliny the Elder in his \"Natural History\"; their mechanism of sound production is mentioned by Hesiod in his poem \"Works and Days\": \"when the Skolymus flowers, and the tuneful \"Tettix\" sitting on his tree in the weary summer season pours forth from under his wings his shrill song\". In the classic 14th-century Chinese novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", Diaochan took her name from the sable (\"di\u0101o\") tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas (\"ch\u00e1n\"), which adorned the hats of high-level officials.\nIn the Japanese novel \"The Tale of Genji\", the title character poetically likens one of his many love interests to a cicada for the way she delicately sheds her robe the way a cicada sheds its shell when molting. Cicada exuviae play a role in the manga \"Winter Cicada\". Cicadas are a frequent subject of \"haiku\", where, depending on type, they can indicate spring, summer, or autumn. Shaun Tan's illustrated book \"Cicada\" tells the story of a hardworking but underappreciated cicada working in an office. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins's play \"Appropriate\" takes place on an Arkansas farm in summer, and calls for the sounds of mating cicadas to underscore the entire show.\nIn fashion.\nBeing lightweight, and with hooklike legs, the exuviae of cicadas can be used as hair or clothing accessories.\nAs food and folk medicine.\nCicadas were eaten in Ancient Greece, and are consumed in selected regions in modern China, both as adults and (more often) as nymphs. Cicadas are also eaten in Malaysia, Burma, North America, and central Africa, as well as the Balochistan region of Pakistan, especially in Ziarat. Female cicadas are prized for being meatier. Shells of cicadas are employed in traditional Chinese medicines, claiming that they possess anti-convulsive, sedative, and hypothermic effects. The 17-year \"Onondaga Brood\" \"Magicicada\" is culturally important and a particular delicacy to the Onondaga people, and are considered a novelty food item by modern consumers in several states.\nIn music.\nCicadas are featured in the protest song \"Como La Cigarra\" (\"Like the Cicada\") written by Argentinian poet and composer Mar\u00eda Elena Walsh. In the song, the cicada is a symbol of survival and defiance against death. The song was recorded by Mercedes Sosa, among other Latin American musicians.\nIn North America and Mexico, there is a well-known song, \"\" (\"The Cicada\"), written by , which is a song in the Mariachi tradition, that romanticises the insect as a creature that sings until it dies.\nBrazilian artist Lenine with his track \"Malvadeza\" from the album \"Ch\u00e3o\", creates a song built upon the sound of the cicada that can be heard along the track.\nCicada sounds heavily feature on the 2021 album \"Solar Power\" by New Zealand artist Lorde. She described cicada song as being emblematic of the New Zealand summer.\nIn mythology and folklore.\nCicadas have been used as money, in folk medicine, to forecast the weather, to provide song (in China), and in folklore and myths around the world. In France, the cicada represents the folklore of Provence and the Mediterranean cities.\nThe cicada has represented insouciance since classical antiquity. Jean de La Fontaine began his collection of fables \"Les fables de La Fontaine\" with the story \"La Cigale et la Fourmi\" (\"The Cicada and the Ant\") based on one of Aesop's fables; in it, the cicada spends the summer singing, while the ant stores away food, and the cicada finds herself without food when the weather turns bitter.\nIn Chinese tradition, the cicada (, \"ch\u00e1n\") symbolises rebirth and immortality. In the Chinese essay \"Thirty-Six Stratagems\", the phrase \"to shed the golden cicada skin\" () is the poetic name for using a decoy (leaving the exuviae) to fool enemies. In the Chinese classic novel \"Journey to the West\" (16th century), the protagonist Priest of Tang was named the Golden Cicada.\nIn Japan, the cicada is associated with the summer season. For many Japanese people, summer hasn't officially begun until the first songs of the cicada are heard. According to Lafcadio Hearn, the song of \"Meimuna opalifera\", called \"tsuku-tsuku boshi\", is said to indicate the end of summer, and it is called so because of its particular call.\nIn the Homeric \"Hymn to Aphrodite\", the goddess Aphrodite retells the legend of how Eos, the goddess of the dawn, requested Zeus to let her lover Tithonus live forever as an immortal. Zeus granted her request, but because Eos forgot to ask him to also make Tithonus ageless, Tithonus never died, but he did grow old. Eventually, he became so tiny and shriveled that he turned into the first cicada. The Greeks also used a cicada sitting on a harp as an emblem of music.\nIn Kapampangan mythology in the Philippines, the goddess of dusk, Sisilim, is said to be greeted by the sounds and appearances of cicadas whenever she appears.\nAs pests.\nCicadas feed on sap; they do not bite or sting in a true sense, but may occasionally mistake a person's arm for a plant limb and attempt to feed. Male cicadas produce very loud calls that can damage human hearing.\nCicadas are not major agricultural pests, but in some outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugarcane, which affects the crop adversely, and in a few isolated cases, females have oviposited on cash crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus, and cotton.\nCicadas sometimes cause damage to ornamental shrubs and trees, mainly in the form of scarring left on tree branches where the females have laid their eggs. Branches of young trees may die as a result.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has a younger brother and a younger sister. He attended Jefferson College,&lt;ref name=\"http://www.websterkirkwoodtimes.com\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the University of Kansas for a time, but left, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...because I was offered a tour of \"Godspell\", a national tour that was from St. Louis. I thought that sounded great, and I went to my parents and I said \"I want to do this tour\", and they said, \"Go ahead, maybe it will get it out of your system. And you come back to school in a year or two, you come back.\" The tour was gonna start in August and the tour never started and school did, and then the tour fell apart, and there I was sitting at home. So I was left holding the bag, basically, and then had to decide where to go from there. And I applied, was applying to other schools. I was gonna go to a Mormon theatrical kind of school, and the more I looked at it the more I spent time examining the school side of it. I just realized what I really needed to do was just pick up, pack up and go to New York.\nCareer.\nBakula moved to New York City in 1976. He made his professional debut in the 1977 national tour of the musical \"Shenandoah\". He made his Broadway debut in 1982 as an understudy in the short-lived musical \"Is There Life After High School?\" The following year, he appeared as baseball legend Joe DiMaggio in \"\", which only ran 17 performances. He received a shared Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Ensemble Acting for his performance in the 1985 Off-Broadway production of \"Three Guys Naked from the Waist Down\"; he would later appear in its Pasadena Playhouse production. The success of \"Three Guys\" Off-Broadway brought him attention, and when his next show, the musical \"Nightclub Confidential\", which co-starred his wife Krista Neumann, moved to Los Angeles, he moved there at the urging of his California agent, Maggie Henderson, and his New York agent, Jerry Hogan. As Bakula recalled in 2000:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I call [Henderson] up and said I got a show, I'm gonna be out there, I'm coming out in January. So it'll work out because it's time for pilot season and I'll be doing something so people can come and see me. ... And then I coincidentally had done a Disney Sunday Night ABC movie that was gonna come out some time in the winter. It was the time to go. Came out here on New Year's Day, 1986. The show I did turned out to be a big hit out here. It got me a lot of attention out here and I jumped onto the TV sitcom \"Designing Women\" in the beginning and was able to do that pilot\u00a0... and things kind of took off.\nHe was cast in two short-lived series: \"Gung Ho\" and \"Eisenhower &amp; Lutz\".

His artistic approach had much in common with European Symbolism. His work, alongside that of his wife Margaret Macdonald, was influential on European design movements such as Art Nouveau and Secessionism and praised by great modernists such as Josef Hoffmann. Mackintosh was born in Glasgow, Scotland and died in London, England. He is among the most important figures of the Modern Style.\nEarly life and education.\nCharles Rennie Mackintosh was born at 70 Parson Street, Townhead, Glasgow, on 7 June 1868, the fourth of eleven children and second son of William McIntosh, a superintendent and chief clerk of the City of Glasgow Police. He attended Reid's Public School and the Allan Glen's Institution from 1880 to 1883. William's wife Margaret Mackintosh n\u00e9e 'Rennie' grew up in the Townhead and Dennistoun (Firpark Terrace) areas of Glasgow.\nName.\nHe changed the spelling of his name from 'McIntosh' to 'Mackintosh' for unknown reasons, as his father did before him, around 1893. Confusion continues to surround the use of his name with 'Rennie' sometimes incorrectly substituted for his first name of 'Charles'. The modern use of 'Rennie Mackintosh' as a surname is also incorrect and he was never known as such in his lifetime; 'Rennie' being a middle name (his mother's maiden name) which he used often in writing his name. Signatures took various forms including 'C.R. Mackintosh' and 'Chas. R. Mackintosh.' The usage of \"Rennie Mackintosh\" to refer to him is therefore incorrect and he should instead be referred to as \"Charles Rennie Mackintosh\" or \"Mackintosh\". Mackintosh is also sometimes referred to affectionately as 'Toshie', a nickname seen in correspondence and other contemporary literature written by friends and family members.\nCareer and family.\nMackintosh entered the architectural profession in 1884 as an apprentice to John Hutchinson in Glasgow and in the evenings studied at Glasgow School of Art (situated then in Sauchiehall Street) where he became a prize-winning student. In 1889 he joined Honeyman and Keppie (John Honeyman and John Keppie), a major architectural practice as a draughtsman and designer, where in 1901 he became a partner.\nHis early design work as a draughtsman and lead designer can be seen from 1893 in the interior of Craigie Hall, Dumbreck, and in the new saloon and gallery of Glasgow Art Club, 185 Bath Street for which he signed the drawings.\nAround 1892, Mackintosh met fellow artist Margaret Macdonald at the Glasgow School of Art. He and fellow student Herbert MacNair, also an apprentice at Honeyman and Keppie, were introduced to Margaret and her sister Frances MacDonald by the head of the Glasgow School of Art, Francis Henry Newbery, who saw similarities in their work. Margaret and Charles married on 22 August 1900. The couple had no children. MacNair and Frances also married the previous year. The group worked collaboratively and came to be known as \"The Four\", and were prominent figures in Glasgow Style art and design. Mackintosh and Margaret married, setting up their first home in Mains Street on Blythswood Hill, the street later being renamed as Blythswood Street, Glasgow. Subsequently, they moved to Southpark Avenue, close to Glasgow University.\nIn the early 1910s the partnership known from 1901 as Honeyman, Keppie &amp; Mackintosh declined in profitability, and in 1913 Mackintosh resigned from the partnership and attempted to open his own practice.\nDesign influences.\nMackintosh lived most of his life in the city of Glasgow, located on the banks of the River Clyde. During the Industrial Revolution the city had one of the greatest production centres of heavy engineering and shipbuilding in the world. As the city grew and prospered, a faster response to the high demand for consumer goods and arts was necessary. Industrialized, mass-produced items started to gain popularity. Along with the Industrial Revolution, Asian style and emerging modernist ideas also influenced Mackintosh's designs. When the Japanese isolationist regime softened, they opened themselves to globalisation resulting in notable Japanese influence around the world. Glasgow's link with the eastern country became particularly close with shipyards at the River Clyde being exposed to Japanese navy and training engineers. Japanese design became more accessible and gained great popularity. In fact, it became so popular and so incessantly appropriated and reproduced by Western artists, that the Western world's fascination and preoccupation with Japanese art gave rise to the new term Japonisme or Japonism.\nThis style was admired by Mackintosh because of its restraint and economy of means rather than ostentatious accumulation; its simple forms and natural materials rather than elaboration and artifice; and its use of texture and light and shadow rather than pattern and ornament. In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner; the value of the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it. In the Japanese arts, furniture and design focused on the quality of the space, which was meant to evoke a calming and organic feeling to the interior.\nAt the same time a new philosophy concerned with creating functional and practical design was emerging throughout Europe: modernism. The central aim in modernism was to develop a purity of expression with designs explicitly responsive to intended building use. Ornament and traditional styles were demoted. Although Mackintosh has been counted as a pioneer of modernism, his work always retained a decorative sensibility and features ornament. Mackintosh took his inspiration from his Scottish upbringing and blended them with the flourish of Art Nouveau and the simplicity of Japanese forms.\nWhile working in architecture, Charles Rennie Mackintosh developed his own style: a contrast between strong right angles and floral-inspired decorative motifs with subtle curves (for example, the Mackintosh Rose motif), along with some references to traditional Scottish architecture. The project that helped make his international reputation was the Glasgow School of Art (1897\u20131909). During the early stages of the Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh also completed the Queen's Cross Church project in Maryhill, Glasgow. It is the only built Mackintosh church design and is now the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society headquarters. As with his contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright, Mackintosh's architectural designs often included extensive specifications for the detailing, decoration, and furnishing of his buildings. \nIt has been suggested that this detailing may have been carried out in part by his wife Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh whom Charles had met when they both attended the Glasgow School of Art. However scholarly evidence for this is scant relying on stylistic analysis or speculation; little documentary material is extant. Their work was shown at the eighth Vienna Secession Exhibition in 1900. Mackintosh's architectural career was a relatively short one, but of significant quality and impact. All his major commissions were between 1895 and 1906, including designs for private homes, commercial buildings, interior renovations and churches.\nUnbuilt designs.\nAlthough moderately popular (for a period) in his native Scotland, most of Mackintosh's more ambitious designs were not built. Designs for various buildings for the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition were not constructed, neither was his \"Haus eines Kunstfreundes\" (Art Lover's House) of the same year. He competed in the 1903 design competition for Liverpool Cathedral, but failed to gain a place on the shortlist (the winner was Giles Gilbert Scott).\nOther unbuilt Mackintosh designs include:\n\"The House for An Art Lover (1901)\" was built in Bellahouston Park, Glasgow after his death (1989\u20131996).\n\"An Artist's Cottage and Studio (1901)\", known as \"The Artist's Cottage\", was completed at Farr by Inverness in 1992. The architect was Robert Hamilton Macintyre acting for Dr and Mrs Peter Tovell. Illustrations can be found on the RCAHMS Canmore site.\nThe first of the unexecuted \"Gate Lodge, Auchinbothie (1901)\" sketches was realised as a mirrored pair of gatehouses to either side of the Achnabechan and The Artist's Cottage drives, also at Farr by Inverness. Known as \"North House\" and \"South House\", these were completed 1995\u20131997.\nMackintosh's architectural output was small, but he did influence European design. Popular in Austria and Germany, his work received acclaim when it was shown at the Vienna Secession Exhibition in 1900. It was also exhibited in Budapest, Hungary, Munich, Germany, Dresden, Venice, Italy and Moscow, Russia.\nDesign work and paintings.\nMackintosh, his future wife Margaret MacDonald, her sister Frances MacDonald, and Herbert MacNair met at evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art (see above). They became known as a collaborative group, \"The Four\", or \"The Glasgow Four\", and were prominent members of the \"Glasgow School\" movement. The group exhibited in Glasgow, London, England and Vienna, Austria. These exhibitions helped establish Mackintosh's reputation. The so-called \"Glasgow\" style was exhibited in Europe and influenced the Viennese Art Nouveau movement known as \"Sezessionstil\" (in English, the Vienna Secession) around 1900. \nMackintosh also worked in interior design, furniture, textiles and metalwork. Much of this work combines Mackintosh's own designs with those of his wife, whose flowing, floral style complemented his more formal, rectilinear work. The publishing house Blackie and Son commissioned him in the 1920s to work on bindings for their publications. One of these works was an abstract design that was intended for a new uniform of G. A. Henty's novels. It was instead used for \"Yarns on the Beach\" by Henty, and for a series entitled \"The Boys and Girls Bookshelf\", c.\u20091926. Both Newbolt and Floyer speculate that Mackintosh may have designed the cover for another series by Blackie.\nLater life.\nLater in life, disillusioned with architecture, Mackintosh worked largely as a watercolourist, painting numerous landscapes and flower studies (often in collaboration with Margaret, with whose style Mackintosh's own gradually converged). They moved to the Suffolk village of Walberswick in 1914. There Mackintosh was suspected of being a German spy and briefly arrested in 1915 during World War I.\nBy 1923, the Mackintoshes had moved to Port Vendres, a Mediterranean coastal town in southern France with a warm climate that was a comparably cheaper location in which to live. Mackintosh had entirely abandoned architecture and design and concentrated on watercolour painting. He was interested in the relationships between man-made and naturally occurring landscapes and created a large portfolio of architecture and landscape watercolour paintings. Many of his paintings depict Port Vendres, a small port near the Spanish border, and the landscapes of Roussillon. The local Charles Rennie Mackintosh Trail details his time in Port Vendres and shows the paintings and their locations. The couple remained in France for two years, before being forced to return to London in 1927 due to illness.\nThat year, Mackintosh had developed a lump in his tongue and a doctor friend in Port Vendres recommended that he return to London for treatment. In London, after a diagnosis of tongue cancer, a friend Jessie Newbery arranged for treatment at Westminster Hospital where the lump was surgically removed. Their friends Randolph &amp; Birdie Schwabe found a home for Mackintosh to convalesce on Willow Road in Hampstead, where he could sit under a willow tree that reminded him of Sauchiehall Street. Another friend Margaret Morris visited him there, and firstly tried to help him with voice exercises to strengthen his voice which had been weakened by the surgery, but when that failed she tried to teach him sign language. A dispute with the upstairs neighbours in Hampstead forced Mackintosh and his wife to quickly seek other lodgings, and another friend Desmond Chapman-Huston offered his home at 12 Porchester Square, Bayswater, returning the hospitality that they had shown him whenever he had visited them in Glasgow. After a relapse Mackintosh was admitted to a nursing home just along the road at 26 Porchester Square where he died on 10 December 1928 at the age of 60. He was cremated the next day at Golders Green Crematorium in London. His ashes were scattered, in accordance with his wishes, over the Mediterranean at Port Vendres from one of the rocks he had painted.\nRetrospect.\nMackintosh's work grew in popularity in the decades following his death. A number of posthumous presentations of his designs have been implemented. The Mackintosh House (1981) is a dedicated structure by William Whitfield to house the reconstructed interiors of the Mackintoshes former Glasgow home (sited nearby and demolished in 1963). The house forms an integral part of The University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery home to the world's largest collection of Mackintosh's work. The Artist's Cottage project, three unrealised designs from 1901, were constructed as interpretations near Inverness in 1992 and 1995. The House for an Art Lover was built in Glasgow's Bellahouston Park in 1996 as an interpretation of a design competition portfolio by Mackintosh and Macdonald from 1901. Mackintosh's design language continues to be echoed in modern buildings in Glasgow - for instance the replacement Glasgow Sheriff Court, built in the 1980s to a design by the successor firm to Mackintosh's old employer - Keppie Design - incorporates many interior features which are a modern interpretation of Mackintosh's style.\nThe Glasgow School of Art building (now \"The Mackintosh Building\") is cited by architectural critics as among the finest buildings in the UK. On 23 May 2014 the building was ravaged by fire. The library was destroyed, but firefighters managed to save the rest of the building. On 15 June 2018, about a year before completion of the restoration of the building the School was again struck by fire. This second fire caused catastrophic damage, effectively destroying all the interiors and leaving the outer walls so structurally unstable that large sections of them had to be taken down to prevent uncontrolled collapse. Such was the global concern that a public commitment to faithfully rebuild The Mackintosh Building was made post-fire by then Director of The Glasgow School of Art, Tom Inns.\nThe Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society encourages greater awareness of the work of Mackintosh as an architect, artist and designer. The rediscovery of Mackintosh as a significant figure in design has been attributed to the designation of Glasgow as European City of Culture in 1990, and exhibition of his work which accompanied the year-long festival. His enduring popularity since has been fuelled by further exhibitions and books and memorabilia which have illustrated aspects of his life and work. The growth in public interest has led to refurbishment of long-neglected buildings and increased public access: Scotland Street School Museum housed in Mackintosh's 1906 school building opened in 1990. 78 Derngate Northampton opened as a visitor attraction in 2003. The Willow Tea Rooms re-opened following an extensive restoration in 2018.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City held a major retrospective exhibition of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's works from 21 November 1996 to 16 February 1997. In conjunction with the exhibit were lectures and a symposium by scholars, including Pamela Robertson of the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow art gallery owner Roger Billcliffe, and architect J. Stewart Johnson, and screening of documentary films about Mackintosh.\nCharles Rennie Mackintosh was commemorated on a series of banknotes issued by the Clydesdale Bank in 2009; his image appeared on an issue of \u00a3100 notes.\nIn 2012, one of the largest collections of art by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow Four Glasgow School was sold at auction in Edinburgh for \u00a31.3m. The sale included work by Mackintosh's sister-in-law Frances Macdonald and her husband Herbert MacNair.\nIn July 2015 it was announced that Mackintosh's designs for a tearoom would be reconstructed to form a display in Dundee's new V&amp;A museum.

The Mackintosh raincoat (the variant spelling is now standard) is named after him.\nBiography.\nMacintosh was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of George Macintosh and Mary Moore, and was first employed as a clerk. Charles devoted his spare time to science, particularly chemistry, and before he was 20 resigned his clerkship to study under Joseph Black at the University of Edinburgh, and to take up the manufacture of chemicals. In this he was highly successful and invented various new processes. His experiments with naphtha led to his invention of waterproof rubberized fabric; the essence of his patent was the cementing of two thicknesses of cloth together with natural rubber. The rubber is made soluble by the action of the naphtha. The naphtha was prepared by distillation of coal tar, with the Bonnington Chemical Works being a major supplier.\nMacintosh married Mary Fisher in 1790, daughter of Alexander Fisher, a Glasgow merchant. They had one son, George Macintosh (1791\u20131848) and one daughter, Mary Scott Macintosh.\nIn 1823, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society for his chemical discoveries. In 1828, he became a partner with James Beaumont Neilson in a firm to exploit the latter's patent for the hot blast blowing of blast furnaces, which saved considerably on their fuel consumption.\nCharles died in 1843 and was buried in the Glasgow Cathedral graveyard. He is buried with his parents in the ground of his great-grandfather, John Anderson of Douhill, Lord Provost of Glasgow. His name is added to the 17th century monument which stands against the eastern boundary wall. A late 19th century secondary memorial also exists, in polished red granite, slightly to the north, where Charles is again mentioned on the grave of his son, George.\nLegacy.\nOn 29 December 2016, the search engine Google marked the 250th anniversary of the birth of the inventor of the modern raincoat with a Google doodle of Macintosh in the rain.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was created by Apple programmer Bryan Stearns with later versions created by Stearns and Francis Stanbach. TeachText was one of the only applications included with System 7, leading to its frequent role as the application to open \"ReadMe\" files. It was named \"TeachText\" as a nod to this role in tutorials and other introductory materials.\nTeachText was derived from the Edit application, which was a simple text editor for the early pre-System 6 Apple Macintosh computers. Edit was included with early versions of the basic system software to demonstrate the use of the Macintosh user interface, and as the primary code editing tool for the original 68000 Macintosh Development System. While Edit was a tool and demonstration program for developers, TeachText was used mainly by users to display ReadMe documents.\nSince the first Macintosh models came with a full-featured word processor, MacWrite, software publishers commonly shipped documentation in its native format. When Apple stopped bundling MacWrite, ownership was transferred to Claris, so developers could not distribute it on their programs' installation floppy disks. With no text program present on the disks, owners without a second floppy disk drive or hard disk could be left with no way to view documentation or installation instructions. Apple supplied TeachText as a small, freely distributable program to address this need.\nTeachText could only operate on a single document at a time and supported only the default text font (12-point Geneva at the time) in the MacRoman encoding, with formatting such as bold, italic and underline. It also included rudimentary support for embedded images; the images were stored in PICT format in the file's resource fork in ascending numbers from zero, instances of non-breaking spaces in the text loaded up the appropriately numbered image, the first instance loading image \"0\", the second space loading image \"1\", and so on.\nTeachText was automatically associated with all TEXT type codes for files with an unknown Creator code. That is, if a user attempted to open any text file and the original program that created it was not known on the local computer, TeachText would be asked to open the file in its place. In this respect, TeachText was the \"default editor\" of the Mac system, playing a role similar to Notepad under Microsoft Windows.\nThe underlying text engine was the TextEdit Manager built into Mac OS. TextEdit had originally been written to support very small runs of editable text, like those found in Save as... dialogs and similar roles. As such, it had been written with a short integer as a length counter, and could thus only handle up to 32 kB of text in a file. This conflicted with the \"default editor\" role when it was asked to open files longer than 32k, resulting in an error.\nTeachText was later replaced by SimpleText, and with the arrival of Mac OS X, both were replaced in turn by the TextEdit application inherited from OPENSTEP.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was originally hosted by Joan Rivers and featured panelists George Kotsiopoulos, Giuliana Rancic, and Kelly Osbourne commenting on celebrity fashions.\nBackground.\nIn 2010, the series premiered on E! with the program running the day after events, rather than airing live from the red carpet. The series became a weekly program on September 10, 2010, where they continued to discuss the dos and don\u2019ts of celebrity fashion. The show started as a half-hour program but expanded to one hour on March 9, 2012.\nRivers died on September 4, 2014; two weeks later, it was announced that the series would continue without her. On December 1, 2014, E! announced that comedian Kathy Griffin would replace Rivers as host starting in January 2015. She was joined by celebrity fashion stylist Brad Goreski, who replaced panelist George Kotsiopoulos. Griffin's debut episode, following the 2015 Golden Globes, was watched by 912,000 viewers. The episode following the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, on January 26, 2015, was watched by 686,000 viewers.\nKathy Griffin succeeded Rivers after a three-month hiatus following Rivers' death in September 2014, while Brad Goreski replaced Kotsiopoulos upon its relaunch. Osbourne departed the program in late February 2015 after the post-Oscars special show on February 23, citing her decision to \"pursue other opportunities\". Shortly after, Griffin announced her departure from the show in March 2015 after filming only seven episodes. \nIn March 2015, E! announced that the show would remain on hiatus until September 2015, in order to revamp the series and replace the vacant panelist positions, following the departure of Griffin and Osbourne.\nIn June 2015, it was announced the series would return on August 31, 2015, and would feature Melissa Rivers as a new co-host and would return for six episodes with both Goreski and Rancic returning, with a search commencing for a fourth panelist. For the sixth season, Margaret Cho and NeNe Leakes joined the panel.\nThe final episode of the series aired on November 27, 2017 with 457,000 viewers.\nHosts.\nDepartures.\nIn March 2015, Kelly Osbourne departed the program in late February 2015 after the February 23rd post-Oscars special show, citing her decision to \"pursue other opportunities\". Shortly after, Griffin announced her departure from the show in March 2015 after filming only seven episodes. E! announced that the show would remain on hiatus until September 2015, in order to revamp the series and replace the vacant panelist positions, following the departure of Griffin and Osbourne.\nSegments.\nRegular segments include:\nNew segments from March 9, 2012, along with an all-new hour of truth of \"Fashion Police\":\nCriticism.\nWriters' wages controversy.\nIn early April 2013, writers for the show complained to the state of California, alleging that the network was breaking state law by not compensating them for regular wages and overtime. According to the writers, their paychecks state that they worked eight hours each week, regardless of their actual working time. In response to the complaint, the network said \"E! values our \"Fashion Police\" writers and we pay them fairly and in full legal compliance.\" On April 13, the writers at the show went on strike.\nZendaya controversy.\nOn February 27, 2015, E! confirmed Osbourne's exit, citing her decision to \"pursue other opportunities\". However, days earlier, Osbourne had tweeted that she was upset and was questioning whether she would stay with the show, following jokes made by Rancic concerning singer and Disney Channel star Zendaya, in reference to her hair smelling of \"patchouli oil\" and \"weed\" at the 87th Academy Awards. She also tweeted: \"you guys do realize that @Zendaya is my friend right?\". On March 12, 2015, it was announced that Griffin would also be departing the series after only seven episodes. Griffin cited that she felt her style of humor \"did not fit well\" with the series' creative direction. The network announced in March 2015 their decision to keep the series on hiatus until September 2015, in order to revamp the series with new panelists.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54626", "revid": "170032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54626", "title": "Lysander", "text": "Spartan military and political leader (died 395 BC)\nLysander (; ; c. 454 BC \u2013 395 BC) was a Spartan commander and statesman who was one of the leading military and political leaders of Sparta during the Peloponnesian Wars. He destroyed the Athenian fleet at the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC, forcing Athens to capitulate and bringing the Peloponnesian Wars to an end. He then played a key role in Sparta's domination of Greece for the next decade until his death at the Battle of Haliartus.\nLysander's vision for Sparta differed from most Spartans; he wanted to overthrow the Athenian Empire and replace it with Spartan hegemony.\nEarly life.\nLittle is known of Lysander's early life. His year of birth is estimated at 454 BC. Some ancient authors record that his mother was a helot or slave. Lysander's father was Aristocritus, who was a member of the Spartan Heracleidae; that is, he claimed descent from Heracles but was not a member of a royal family. According to Plutarch, Lysander grew up in poverty and showed himself obedient, conformed to norms, and had a \"manly spirit\".\nIt was custom in the Spartan upbringing for a young adult to be assigned as the \"inspirer\" (\"eispnelas\") or \"lover\" (\"erastes\") of an adolescent, and Lysander was matched in this role with the future king Agesilaus, the younger son of Archidamus II. Nothing is known of Lysander's actual career before he was elected, in 408 BC, to Sparta's annual office of admiral, to conduct the long-running Peloponnesian War against Athens.\nAdmiral.\nFrom Gythium on the southern shore of the Peloponnese, Lysander set out with 30 triremes. He sailed to Rhodes, where he collected some more ships, and made his way to Cos, Miletus, Chios, gathering ships, until he finally arrived at Ephesus, which he turned into the Peloponnesian League's main naval base for the Aegean. His arrival was shortly followed by that of Cyrus, young son of the Persian king Darius, who had been appointed by his father as governor of the provinces of Asia Minor in response to an earlier Spartan embassy requesting increased aid in the war against Athens. Lysander promptly went to meet Cyrus at his headquarters in nearby Sardis, and with calculated deference made a deep impression on the young prince, developing with him a close friendship that was to have a decisive effect in the course of the war. Cyrus began funding Sparta's war effort on a large scale, and was encouraged to increase the pay of Lysander's crews from three to four obols, increasing their morale and Lysander's popularity among them. Once back in Ephesus, Lysander summoned a conference of influential oligarchs from all over the Greek cities in the Aegean, encouraged them to organize into political clubs (\"hetaireiai\"), and promised to put them in power in their respective cities in the event of Athens' defeat. In doing so, Lysander created in effect a network of clients who were loyal to him personally and contributed to Sparta's war effort with increased eagerness.\nAs Lysander was fitting out his vessels at Ephesus, an Athenian fleet roughly the size of his own, led by the famous Alcibiades, set up anchor at the nearby port of Notium. At first, the Spartan was content to refuse battle and let his higher wages, funded by Cyrus, encourage desertions among the enemy crews. Eventually, however, one of the Athenian officers, despite orders to stay put, was drawn into a fight with an advance party of Peloponnesian ships. Lysander gave a timely order for his entire fleet to advance, and drove off the intruder before they had properly deployed for battle, inflicting modest losses. Alcibiades, who had been away on urgent business, returned upon hearing of this setback and again offered battle off Ephesus, but Lysander once more refused, and the Athenians had to withdraw.\nHowever, Lysander ceased to be the Spartan navarch after this victory and, in accordance with the Spartan law, was replaced by Callicratidas. Callicratidas' ability to continue the war at sea was neatly sabotaged when Lysander returned all the donated funds to Cyrus when he left office.\nVice-admiral.\nAfter Callicratidas was defeated and killed at the Battle of Arginusae, Cyrus and the oligarchic clubs which Lysander had sponsored all sent embassies to Sparta requesting the former admiral's return to command. The Spartan government consented, a sign of confidence in his ability and an endorsement of his policy of supporting oligarchies in the Greek cities. As Spartan law did not allow an admiral to hold office twice, Lysander was instead appointed the secretary (\"epistoleus\") or second-in-command to Callicratidas's eventual successor, Aracus, with the understanding that the latter would allow Lysander to take the lead. Making his base at Ephesus again, the Spartan began gathering and rebuilding the remnants of the Peloponnesian fleet in the Aegean, once again with the full cooperation of his Greek allies and Cyrus. In the meantime, Lysander visited Miletus, an ally of Sparta, and deceitfully massacred some leading democrats during the festival of Dionysus in early 405 BC to place his own adherents in power; replacing Miletus' democracy with an Oligarchy. In the summer, Lysander's principal benefactor, Cyrus, was summoned to the deathbed of his father, the King, and, before departing, took the extraordinary step of entrusting the Spartan with his entire treasury and with the revenues from the Persian-ruled cities under his administration.\nLysander finally set sail with some 125\u2013150 ships, and among his early actions, which are variously reported by the sources, were the massacre and enslavement of the population of Iasus and Cedreae, allies of Athens. He continued toward the Hellespont to threaten the route of grain transports to Athens from the Black Sea, forcing the Athenians to send their fleet, 180 ships, in pursuit. Lysander set up anchor at Lampsacus and plundered it, while the Athenians took up a position at Aegospotami in the opposing shore of the straits. For several days Lysander refused battle, studying the opponent's moves, until, during a moment of enemy carelessness, he surprised the Athenians and captured most of their vessels as they were still ashore and unmanned. The entire Athenian fleet was gone, and Sparta had finally won the Peloponnesian War.\nNow in full command of the seas, Lysander began touring the Aegean to receive the surrender of enemy strongholds, ordering all captured Athenian garrisons and cleruchs (colonists) home in order to overcrowd the city and hasten its surrender through famine. In many Greek cities, he installed ten-man governing boards (decarchies) whose members were selected from the oligarchic clubs he had sponsored earlier, supported and supervised by a Spartan harmost (military governor). Democrats and other opponents of his narrow oligarchies were often massacred or banished. In a propaganda gesture he restored places like Aegina, Melos and Scione to populations whom the Athenians had forcibly uprooted throughout the course of the war.\nFollowing an unsuccessful attempt to bring about Athens's surrender with a show of force off Attica in autumn 405 BC, Lysander began establishing contacts with Athenian oligarchic exiles and sponsored their return to the city as one of the conditions for peace, which was finally concluded in spring 404 BC. Lysander received the surrender of the last of Athens's allies, Samos, in the summer of 404 BC, after which he went in person to Athens in response to an appeal by Athenian oligarchs. On the anniversary of the Battle of Salamis, Lysander sailed into the Piraeus, ordered the razing of Athens's city walls and the burning of its fleet, and sent for female flautists from the city to play music as the deed was carried out. He also oversaw a meeting of the Athenian assembly which effectively abolished Athens's democracy and replaced it with a governing board of thirty oligarchs (the Thirty Tyrants).\nCommand in Athens.\nAfter storming and seizing Samos, Lysander returned to Sparta. Alcibiades, the former Athenian leader, emerged after the Spartan victory at Aegospotami and took refuge in Phrygia, northwestern Asia Minor with Pharnabazus, its Persian satrap. He sought Persian assistance for the Athenians. However, the Spartans decided that Alcibiades must be removed and Lysander, with the help of Pharnabazus, arranged the assassination of Alcibiades.\nLysander amassed a huge fortune from his victories against the Athenians and brought the riches home to Sparta. For centuries the possession of money was illegal in Lacedaemonia, but the newly minted navy required funds and Persia could not be trusted to maintain financial support. Roman historian Plutarch strongly condemns Lysander's introduction of money; despite being publicly held, he argues its mere presence corrupted rank-and-file Spartans who witnessed their government's newfound value for it. Corruption quickly followed; while general Gylippus ferried treasure home, he embezzled a great amount and was condemned to death in absentia.\nResistance by Athens.\nThe Athenian general Thrasybulus, who had been exiled from Athens by the Spartans' puppet government, led the democratic resistance to the new oligarchic government. In 403 BC, he commanded a small force of exiles that invaded Attica and, in successive battles, defeated first a Spartan garrison and then the forces of the oligarchic government (which included Lysander) in the Battle of Munychia. The leader of the Thirty Tyrants, Critias, was killed in the battle.\nThe Battle of Piraeus was then fought between Athenian exiles who had defeated the government of the Thirty Tyrants and occupied Piraeus and a Spartan force sent to combat them. In the battle, the Spartans defeated the exiles, despite their stiff resistance. Despite opposition from Lysander, after the battle Pausanias the Agiad King of Sparta, arranged a settlement between the two parties which allowed the re-establishment of democratic government in Athens.\nFinal years.\nLysander still had influence in Sparta despite his setbacks in Athens. He was able to persuade the Spartans to select Agesilaus II, his younger lover, as the new Eurypontid Spartan king following the death of Agis II, and to persuade the Spartans to support Cyrus the Younger in his unsuccessful rebellion against his older brother, Artaxerxes II of Persia.\nHoping to restore the juntas of oligarchic partisans that he had put in place after the defeat of the Athenians in 404 BC, Lysander arranged for Agesilaus II, the Eurypontid Spartan king, to take command of the Greeks against Persia in 396 BC. The Spartans had been called on by the Ionians to assist them against the Persian King Artaxerxes II. Lysander was arguably hoping to receive command of the Spartan forces not joining the campaign. However, Agesilaus had become resentful of Lysander's power and influence. So Agesilaus frustrated the plans of his former mentor and left Lysander in command of the troops in the Hellespont, far from Sparta and mainland Greece.\nBack in Sparta by 395 BC, Lysander was instrumental in starting a war with Thebes and other Greek cities, which came to be known as the Corinthian War. The Spartans prepared to send out an army against this new alliance of Athens, Thebes, Corinth and Argos (with the backing of the Achaemenid Empire) and ordered Agesilaus to return to Greece. Agesilaus set out for Sparta with his troops, crossing the Hellespont and marching west through Thrace.\nDeath.\nThe Spartans arranged for two armies, one under Lysander and the other under Pausanias of Sparta, to rendezvous at and attack the city of Haliartus in Boeotia. Lysander arrived before Pausanias and persuaded the city of Orchomenus to revolt from the Boeotian League. He then advanced to Haliartus with his troops. In the Battle of Haliartus, Lysander was killed after bringing his forces too near to the walls of the city.\nFollowing Lysander's death, Agesilaus II \"discovered\" an abortive scheme by Lysander to increase his power by making the Spartan kingships collective and that the Spartan king should not automatically be given the leadership of the army. There is argument amongst historians as to whether this was an invention to discredit Lysander after his death. However, in the view of Nigel Kennell, the plot fits with what we know of Lysander.\nLegacy.\nLysander is one of the main protagonists of the history of Greece by Xenophon, a contemporary. For other (later) sources he remains an ambiguous figure. For instance, while the Roman biographer Cornelius Nepos charges him with \"cruelty and perfidy\", Lysander \u2013 according to Xenophon \u2013 nonetheless spared the population of captured Greek poleis such as Lampsacus.\nThe Westland Lysander aircraft was named after him.\nCommemoration.\nAccording to Duris of Samos, Lysander was the first Greek to whom the cities erected altars and sacrificed to him as to a god and the Samians voted that their festival of Hera should be called Lysandreia. He was also the first Greek who had songs of triumph written about him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2016 Arena was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM).\nIn March 2019, the Government of Australia appointed Arena as a board member of the Australia Council for the Arts for a three-year term.\nLife and career.\n1967\u20131987: Early life and career beginnings.\nArena was born in the Melbourne suburb of Keilor East, to Giuseppe \"Joe\" Arena and Francesca \"Franca\" Catalfamo (both from Valguarnera, Sicily), Sicilian immigrants, in Melbourne on 1 November 1967. Giuseppe was a rural worker in Sicily and then a cane cutter in Cairns in 1955. By the following year he was a labourer in Melbourne and later worked for Victorian Railways. Arena grew up in Keilor East, Victoria with two sisters, Nancy and Silvana; As a child, she listened to Spanish, Italian and French songs that were in her family's record collection. At the age of six, she was the flower girl at her cousin Gaetano's wedding, and at the reception she urged her father to approach the host so that she could sing\u2014Daryl Braithwaite's version of \"You're My World\"\u2014it was her first public performance.\nArena's family call her Pina, which is her shortened first name. She changed her first name from Filippina to \"Tina\", her stage name becoming \"Tina Arena\", when she appeared as a child performer on the national television talent show \"Young Talent Time\" in 1976, at age 8. For secondary schooling, she attended a Catholic girls' college, St. Columba's College, Essendon, in Melbourne. Recalling her upbringing, Arena says, \"It was a very Italian household, it was a very traditional household. There was a lot of love but there was a lot of discipline. And there was no room for pretentiousness. Really, there just wasn't.\"\n\"Young Talent Time\" years.\nArena received singing lessons from Voila Ritchie who recommended her to appear on a television talent quest and variety show, \"Young Talent Time\", an Australian weekly television variety program produced by Lewis-Young Productions and screened on Network Ten.\nWhen Arena was selected to appear on \"Young Talent Time\" in 1974, the producers at Lewis-Young Productions and Network Ten asked her to change her first name from Filippina to \"Tina\"\u2014creating her stage name, \"Tina Arena\"\u2014so as to be more relatable to the wider national audience. In the mid-1970s, there was a minority of ethnic diversity represented in the Australian mainstream media, especially on primetime television. Initially appearing as a \"Young Talent Time\" contestant in 1974, Arena went on to permanently join the cast as a regular member of the show's Young Talent Team in 1976. She then quickly, and affectionately, became known on the show by her nickname \"Tiny Tina\". For her first appearance she performed ABBA's \"Ring Ring\".\nAs a core member of the Young Talent Team performing live on Australian national television each week, Arena sang cover versions of popular music tracks. In 1977, she released a split album, \"Tiny Tina and Little John\", alternating tracks with fellow Young Talent Team member, John Bowles.\nAs a member of the Young Talent Team, Arena appeared in TV specials, in TV commercials, at shopping centres and on tourist venues. In September 1982, she became a \"coach\" for new team members, Danielle Minogue and Mark McCormack; Arena told \"The Australian Women's Weekly\"'s Debbie Byrne that \"They seem to be settling down a lot quicker than I did. They both have a really professional attitude.\" At 14, she told Byrne \"my aim: to be a recording artist and actress but, now, I have to concentrate simply on what I'm doing and that can take enough effort.\"\nArena left the \"Young Talent Time\" show in October 1983, ahead of her 16th birthday, due to the Network Ten \"Young Talent Time\" series age-limit contract stipulation to give way for younger members. Arena performed the songs \"The Way We Were\" and \"MacArthur Park\" for her finale set on her farewell \"Young Talent Time\" episode. Arena starred in \"Young Talent Time\" from 1976 to 1983\u2014making her the show's longest-serving cast member.\nArena completed her Higher School Certificate (final year of secondary school) and was hired as an insurance clerk; however, she resigned after three months to pursue a music career.\nSpeaking at her BIGSOUND keynote address in 2017, Arena described her childhood to teenage experience on \"Young Talent Time\" as an inclusive apprenticeship into the television light-entertainment and musical industry in Australia, Arena noted:\nIt was 40 years ago and there were no ethnic faces on [Australian] television. It was an extraordinary apprenticeship. Young Talent Time was inclusive and welcoming. The only downside of Young Talent Time was when I was trying to transition to an adult.\nStarting a solo recording career.\nAt age 17, Arena signed a record deal with Graffiti Records, which released her debut single, \"Turn Up the Beat\", in 1985. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as having a \"dance-pop\" style. \"The Sydney Morning Herald\"'s Tim Elliott said that it \"failed to impress\". It had been recorded in the previous year with Brian Cadd producing at Flagstaff Studios in Melbourne. When the single did not appear in the top\u00a050 her planned album was scrapped.\nFollowing her 1985 recording, Arena sang advertising jingles and worked on the pub and club circuit to earn a living. She performed solo shows and in bands, including as a member of a nine-piece ensemble, Network. She also appeared in musicals. In 1987, she supported American artist Lionel Richie on his Australian tour following a number of charity performances.\n1988\u20131993: Debut solo album \u2013 \"Strong as Steel\".\nDuring 1988, Arena appeared as a guest on Australian TV shows recalling her tenure on \"Young Talent Time\" and looking for a new record label. In 1990, she had a singing and dancing role in the David Atkins' musical, \"Dynamite\", for a 10-month run. Also that year she signed with EMI and reinvented her image as a raunchy disco diva. In April she issued a single, \"I Need Your Body\", which peaked at No.\u00a03 on the ARIA Singles Chart. McFarlane described it as \"uptempo\" with the associated music video \"projecting a raunchy disco-diva persona\u00a0... flaunting a pouting rock starlet with bouncing cleavage and attitude to burn.\" Australian journalist Ed Nimmervoll noticed that she used \"raunchy videos showing off her cleavage as if to prove she was a woman now.\"\nThe artist followed with another single, \"The Machine's Breaking Down\", in July 1990, which peaked in the top\u00a030. Her debut solo album, \"Strong as Steel\", was released in October, and peaked at number\u00a017 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Most of the album was produced by Ross Inglis. Penelope Layland of \"The Canberra Times\" opined that \"the frantic single, 'I Need Your Body', is quite uncharacteristic of much of the music on Tina Arena's album, \"Strong As Steel\". In fact, it is one of the weakest tracks on an album which bounces with potential pop hits.\"\nAccording to music historian Ed Nimmervoll, Arena \"was not comfortable. This was not her. This was not what she wanted to be for the rest of her life. Tina went into seclusion while she decided what to do next, moving to Los Angeles to be a nobody again.\" She relocated to LA in 1991, where she took more singing lessons and started songwriting. Upon return to Australia, in 1993, she performed in the local December 1992 to February 1993 musical theatre production, \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\", as the Narrator, at the State Theatre, Melbourne. In 1992 Arena sang background vocals on the debut album by Australian singer-songwriter Rick Price, titled \"Heaven Knows\", which was released in July 1992, and she appeared in the 1993 music video by Price for the single \"A House Divided\".\n1994\u20131996: Second solo album \u2013 \"Don't Ask\".\nArena's second solo studio album, \"Don't Ask\", was released on 14 November 1994. It was produced by David Tyson for Columbia Records. According to Nimmervoll, during recording \"Tina nearly broke down. This was an all-important moment in her career.\" Arena co-wrote all 10 tracks of the original Australian version.\nIan McFarlane noticed it demonstrated a \"more mature, sophisticated, soul-tinged style and approach\u00a0... [and] her powerful, crystal clear voice more than adequately matched the material on offer.\" Kelvin Hayes of AllMusic felt that \"a lot of \"Don't Ask\" remains twee. However, there are good moments.\" It peaked at No.\u00a01 on the ARIA Albums Chart\u2014a year after its release\u2014and remained in the top\u00a050 for 83\u00a0weeks. It reached No.\u00a011 on the UK Albums Chart and No.\u00a012 in New Zealand.\n\"Don't Ask\" was the highest-selling album of 1995 in Australia and one of the biggest-selling albums by an Australian female singer to date. It has sold over two million copies worldwide and was certified 10\u00a0times platinum by ARIA in 2011 for shipment of over 700,000 copies in that country alone. The success of the record made her a \"priority artist\" for Sony, who marketed her in the US. Her European success was realised: \"Don't Ask\" charted in Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.\nThe lead single, \"Chains\", was issued ahead of the album in August 1994 and peaked at No.\u00a04 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It also reached No.\u00a06 in the UK, No.\u00a07 in New Zealand, No.\u00a09 in Ireland, No. 38 in the U.S., and No.\u00a020 in Canada. In 1995, she toured Europe, appearing on \"Top of the Pops\" which broadcast to an audience of 60\u00a0million people. In the European market Arena was an unknown and a fresh commodity, she opined: \"I loved every minute of that\u2014of people not knowing who I was. I guess it was tiring fighting the individual thing. It was good to not be a part of a past and being accepted as an artist. Not having to carry this \"Young Talent Time\" luggage which was constantly shoved in my face.\" Five additional singles were released, \"Sorrento Moon (I Remember)\" (January 1995), \"Heaven Help My Heart\" (May), \"Wasn't It Good\" (September), \"Show Me Heaven\" (November) and \"That's the Way a Woman Feels\" (February 1996).\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, Arena was nominated in six categories and won four trophies: Best Pop Release and Song of the Year for \"Chains\"; and Album of the Year and Best Female Artist for \"Don't Ask\". At the 1996 ceremony she received five more nominations and won Highest Selling Album for \"Don't Ask\". Other accolades she earned were Variety Club Entertainer of the Year, an Advance Australia Foundation award, and a World Music Award.\n1997\u20132000: \"In Deep\" and the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\nArena relocated to Los Angeles in 1996 and 1997, to record her third solo studio album, \"In Deep\" (18 August 1997), which became her second number-one album in Australia. For the Australian version of the album Arena co-wrote eleven of its twelve tracks\u2014her fellow writers include Mick Jones (of Foreigner), David Tyson, Christopher Ward, Dean McTaggart, Pam Reswick and Steve Werfel. The album included her cover version of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is\", originally written by Jones who produced Arena's version. \"In Deep\" \"was recorded predominantly live in the studio in an attempt to bring the material closer to Tina's stage performance persona\" with four tracks produced by Tyson and the rest by Jones. \"In Deep\" was certified 3\u00d7 platinum in Australia. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic found the US version of the album showed that \"Her own songs, co-written with a team of others, are perfectly good contemporary pop/rock, and she sings them with passionate commitment\" and it was \"brimming with potential hit singles (it spawned three in Australia).\"\n\"In Deep\", in its different versions, provided ten singles, with the lead one, \"Burn\", appearing in July 1997, which had some US airplay. The track was co-written by Arena with Reswick and Werfel. In Australia it debuted at No.\u00a02 and was certified gold upon its release. It was also a hit in Asia. Besides the English-language version she also recorded it in Spanish and Italian (in the form of \"Ti Voglio Qui\"). The second single, \"If I Didn't Love You\" (November) appeared in the ARIA top\u00a050. In April of the following year she issued \"Now I Can Dance\", which peaked at No.\u00a013. In the UK Arena released \"Whistle Down the Wind\" (June 1998) as a cover version single, it was the title track from the 1996 musical of the same name, her version reached the UK Singles Chart top\u00a030.\nIn April 1998, Arena performed at the 50th birthday celebration for Andrew Lloyd Webber at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Arena performed at the celebration, along with John Farnham, and featured musical performances by Elaine Paige.\nArena's duet with US artist, Marc Anthony, \"I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You\", from the feature film soundtrack for \"The Mask of Zorro\" (July 1998), gained her European chart success. The track was issued as a non-album single in Australia in September, but did not reach the top\u00a050. It was included on the French release version of \"In Deep\", appearing in October, which peaked at No.\u00a03 on the French Albums Chart\u2014a year after its first entry\u2014and spent 88 weeks on that chart. It also reached the top\u00a010 in Belgium and top\u00a040 in Switzerland. It was certified 3\u00d7 platinum by Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique (SNEP) in May 2001 for sales in France. \"I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You\" had been issued in Europe in September 1998, it peaked at No.\u00a03 in France\u2014her first charting single in that market. It also reached No.\u00a03 in the Netherlands and top\u00a010 in Belgium.\nArena toured the US from March 1999, to promote the album's local release, as well as another single, \"If I Was a River\", which did peak in the UK top\u00a040. Sony attempted to \"break\" Arena into the US market by the release of \"If I Was a River\", penned by Diane Warren. Ruhlmann felt the label had an \"obvious plan is to turn her into a down-under Celine Dion\" however the album and its singles \"had no commercial impact upon release in the U.S.\" and \"must be considered a disappointment.\" Her US foray included appearances on TV shows such as \"Donny &amp; Marie\". In February 1999, she teamed with label-mate Donna Summer to perform a cover version of \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\"; the duet appeared on Summer's live album, \"Live &amp; More Encore\" (June 1999).\nArena's first French-language single, \"Aller plus haut\" (English: \"Go Higher\", July 1999), appeared on the continental version of \"In Deep\", which peaked at No.\u00a02 on the local singles chart. It also became her first number-one hit on the Belgian Singles Chart. Her second French-language single was a cover version of \"Les trois cloches\" (English: \"The Three Bells\", January 2000), which reached No.\u00a04 in France and another number-one hit in Belgium. From May that year she lived in London while she appeared in the lead role of Esm\u00e9ralda for the stage musical, \"Notre Dame de Paris\" during a six-month run. Carr, by now her ex-husband, had claimed in \"Business Review Weekly\" (2000) that Arena was paid $200,000 per week when she was performing in \"Notre Dame de Paris\".\nArena sang \"The Flame\" (written by John Foreman) at the 2000 Opening Ceremony of the Sydney Olympics on 15 September. Seven Network covered the national broadcast across Australia, which become the highest rating TV telecast in Australian history. John Farnham, Olivia Newton-John, Vanessa Amorosi, Human Nature and Julie Anthony were some of the other Australian artists who appeared at the opening ceremony and contributed to the various artists' album, \"\" (September 2000). She recalled, \"When I sang at the Olympics, I cared about the fact that I was Australian. And I was touched because I was an ethnic girl, of ethnic blood but that WAS Australian. Because I was born here, this is where I grew up, this is where I learned everything.\"\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 in October, Arena received an Outstanding Achievement Award. In the following month she issued her first compilation album, \"Souvenirs\", which reached the ARIA top\u00a040.\n2001\u20132007: \"Just Me\", \"Never (Past Tense)\" and \"Un autre univers\".\nArena's fourth solo studio album, \"Just Me\", was released on 12 November 2001 and debuted at No.\u00a07 in Australia; it reached the top\u00a050 in France and top\u00a070 in Switzerland.

The album explored different genres, containing more upbeat tracks as opposed to her two previous studio records which featured her soprano voice on slow pop ballads. Although written after the divorce from Carr, she said that the record is not angry nor bitter but rather a \"celebration of womanhood\". It was certified gold by ARIA and by SNEP (France).\nTo promote \"Just Me\" she showcased it for 150 people, mostly Australian TV and media personalities, in Melbourne. The record provided four singles including \"Symphony of Life\" (September 2002), which peaked at No.\u00a08 in Australia and top\u00a050 (as \"Symphonie de l'\u00e2me\") in France.

Arena will make her debut at the prestigious Cambridge Theatre in Covent Garden in April playing the infamous murderess who exploits the media to escape prosecution.

Arena premiered the single by performing on the live television show \"Dancing with the Stars\" on 4 September 2015.\nArena's album \"Eleven\" is so named because it is the 11th album of her recording career, but also because she likes its astrological implications, 11 being a figure of enlightenment and artistic sensitivity. Like its predecessor, 2013's \"Reset\", \"Eleven\"is a pop-heavy collection featuring songwriting collaborations with, among others, Kate Miller-Heidke, Hayley Warner and Evermore's Jon Hume. The album was recorded in Sydney, Melbourne, London and Stockholm, as well as in Paris. The \"Eleven\" album is a mix of atmospheric electronica (Unravel Me, Overload), smouldering anthems (Wouldn't Be Love If It Didn't, Love Falls, Not Still in Love with You) and dance-friendly pop (Magic). Arena's most recent release, \"Eleven\", became her seventh Top 10 album in Australia by debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album chart in November 2016, and is now certified gold.\nIn September 2015, Arena hosted shows on SmoothFM Radio Stations from 4:00\u00a0pm every Saturday on Sydney's SmoothFM 93.5 and on Melbourne's SmoothFM 91.5.\nOn 25 October 2015, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) announced that Arena was due to be inducted into their Hall of Fame in the annual awards ceremony in November as a member of the Australian music industry ARIA Hall of Fame.

Arena looked forward to enjoying the acknowledgment of her peers at the Australian music industry's gala celebration on 26 November 2015. She was quick to point out that receiving the honour doesn't mean she was entering the twilight of her career. \"It's not the end,\" she says, \"Not yet\", adding, \"I don't have another 40 years in me, I don't know how long it's going to last, but I'm touched by the recognition. It will be an emotional night\".

She has the pipes. She could teach us all a lesson.\" This was a nod to Arena's entire career, as one of the Australia's highest-selling female artists, and her childhood fame on \"Young Talent Time\" from 1976 to 1983\u2014making her the show's longest-serving cast member.\nSpeaking with MOZA Music in a January 2019 interview, Arena stated that:\nOne of my favourite moments was the Arias hall of fame induction in 2015. For myself that moment meant that I could speak freely about the industry, which I obviously love, but feel that there are far too many inequalities. Also the sheer volume of music that is made available to people makes it difficult to financially exist.\nOn Australia Day, 26 January 2016, Arena was recognised in the \"Australia Day Honours\", which the country's sovereign awards its citizens for actions or deeds that benefit the nation.

The album is a 2-CD set\u2014the first contains 17 of Arena's hits; the second is an album of interpretations.The interpretations disc includes a duet with Dannii Minogue, singing with Arena for the first time since \"Young Talent Time\".\nArena announced her \"Innocence to Understanding Tour\" in conjunction with the release of her \"Greatest Hits &amp; Interpretations\", starting in Brisbane on Wednesday, 6 September 2017, and concluding in early October.

Arena has stated that when she records in the French language, she is careful not to record French versions of her English-language hits, as lyric meanings in French and English differ. Arena notes that too often the intention of the song gets \"lost in translation\", therefore she has always chosen to write in both languages.\nOn 17 November 2017, Arena released on digital preview platforms a new song recording, \"Tant que tu es l\u00e0\" (translates as \"As long as you're around\"), as the lead single for \"Quand tout Recommence\".\nIn an April 2018 interview with \"Webmedia SAS Pure Charts\" (France), Arena defined what pulled her into the French Pop music after a decade away, recording and performing in her homeland Australia and in selective international showcase tours, Arena explains, \"I wanted to re-do music in French. Everything started from there with this project. The desire\". She is motivated by the desire to reconnect with the success of her French Pop hits, \"Go higher\" and \"Love to the impossible\". On her 2018 \"Quand tout Recommence\" album, Arena offers ten new songs recorded in the language of Moli\u00e8re, \"L'ombre de ma voix\" (Translates to: The Shadow of My Voice\").

Recalling her former residency in French Pop Music, yet, her inaugural entry on the French Music Charts was in 1998, and was her first French platinum record.

With all that happened.\" Good, is what happens with Arena, and France.\nOn 16 February 2018, Arena released on digital preview platforms the next single, \"L'ombre de ma voix\" (\"The Shadow of My Voice\"), from her new album \"Quand tout Recommence\".\nOn 6 April 2018, the new French-language album, \"Quand tout Recommence\" was released on the francophone market, with the album peaking on the French album chart Top 150 at No.62, and also peaking on the Belgium album chart at No.46.

The music video director is Michael Westbrook with production by Positive Dream R\u00e9alisation.\nThe video thematically delivers a nostalgic mood, as Arena traces her 40-year career in the music industry, showing a montage of video footage and TV clips across her lifespan as a live performer. Capturing the visual evolution of Arena's artistry, beginning in 1974 for the then-eight-year-old child performer on \"Young Talent Time\".\nIn the \"Quand tout Recommence\" music video, Arena appears multiple times in every frame, and it doubles and triples; Arena is seen as the artist she is today, in the recording studio, and throughout the footage of clips revolving around her, as she is evolving through her career. The montage chronicles Arena's childhood, and adolescence, to womanhood\u2014including childhood piano lessons, roller-skating, backstage rehearsals, signing autographs with fans, to singing live at the Sydney Olympic Games 2000, and more. Clearly, Tina Arena has always got to work, sung her heart out and in again, and she keeps working. The song title, \"The Shadow of My Voice\", makes a report on 40 years her a career, composed of ups and downs, and mixes childhood images, live performances, and studio sessions. The opportunity is taken by the Australian to prove that she is still active and far from relying on her previous success.\n2018\u2013present.\nIn January 2018, Arena performed as part of the live-music program at the Australian Open 2018 Grand Slam tennis tournament at Melbourne Park.\nIn February 2018, Arena featured as the portrait guest in an episode of the Australian TV series \"Anh Do's Brush with Fame\" with comedian and artist Anh Do, on the ABC network.

She said that she felt \"blessed to work with someone who has had the kind of career that Hal Prince has had\". Arena also says she felt the time was right to tackle the role: \"I have been approached to do this role on a couple of occasions. I never felt emotionally ready for it.

Arena also notes that she felt the time was right to tackle the role:\nI have been approached to do this role on a couple of occasions. I never felt emotionally ready for it. I felt I had a lot of living and learning before I could get up and take on the enormity of the story and the human spirit she possessed. I don't think I was ready in my 30s to play Eva Per\u00f3n at all. Playing the role of Eva Per\u00f3n at 50, is much more suited to the life experience that I have had.\nArena talked of knowing about Per\u00f3n since she was a girl and about feeling privileged to recount the story and embrace the complex role.\nOpening night: Sydney Opera House.\nThe official opening night of the \"Evita\" at the Sydney Opera House was on 13 September 2018. \"Evita's\" lyricist, Sir Tim Rice, attended, having travelled to Australia for the event a week after joining the EGOT winners club. Arena received a prolonged standing ovation for the portrayal as Eva Per\u00f3n. Sydney's \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that \"Arena soars in a sublime performance of the First Lady of Argentina. Even those who don't know the musical \"Evita\", are probably familiar with the song 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' and it was at this point on opening night that Arena really powered into her own as Eva Per\u00f3n.\"\nNational tour: Arts Centre Melbourne.\nThe Victorian tour leg of the \"Evita\" tour was at the State Theatre at the Arts Centre Melbourne in December 2018.\nIn February 2019, it was reported that the production had become the highest selling show ever staged at the State Theatre. Claire Spencer, CEO of the Arts Centre Melbourne, noted that \"It is fantastic to have such an accomplished cast, including cherished global star Tina Arena perform Evita at Arts Centre Melbourne. Tina is particularly close to our hearts as one of the 'Patrons of the Australian Music Vault' at Arts Centre Melbourne.\"\nCritical reception.\nOn 19 September 2018, the ABC's classical music and arts magazine \"Limelight\"'s theatre reviewer, Angus McPherson, gave a four-star review of \"Evita\" at the Sydney Opera House. The review, \"Evita \u2013 Tina Arena gives us a vocally high flying Evita in Hal Prince's original production\", stated that, \"The role of the tough, ambitious, Evita isn't an easy sing, and it comes with baggage\u2014anyone taking it on is walking in the footsteps of the likes of Elaine Paige, Patti LuPone and Madonna (in the 1996 film with Antonio Banderas)\u2014but Arena proves herself more than equal to the vocal demands. She doesn't have the heavy belt of a LuPone, but she's got a deliciously sultry low register and she handles the lighter high notes with confidence, letting rip when it's called for\u2014her rallying oration in 'A New Argentina', buoyed by the chorus, is a rousing finale to the show's first act. Brazilian opera singer Paulo Szot, brings a magisterial baritone to Juan Per\u00f3n. Arena comes into her own in the second act, with highlights including the show's hit Don't Cry For Me Argentina (in quite a broad rendition), as well as Rainbow High, Waltz for Eva and Che and You Must Love Me\u2014which was written for Madonna in the film and inserted here, Arena alone onstage, 'in concert' style. The show ends on a sombre note, and if Evita's final moments don't quite hit home emotionally, her assumption of power is thrillingly done, Arena's vocals capturing her commanding power and charisma.\"\nOn 19 September 2018, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" theatre reviewer, Joyce Morgan, gave a four-star review of \"Evita\". The review, \"Evita review: Don't cry for Tina Arena's timely Eva\", states that \"What you do get is a show with renewed currency about the rise and demise of one of Latin America's most intriguing and controversial figures, Eva Peron. You also get a woman at the height of her musical powers in the show-stopper scene as Tina Arena, in the title role, steps regally along the presidential balcony to deliver with melting clarity and conviction the anthemic 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina'. In this 40th-anniversary restaging of the original Harold Prince production, the misogyny, sexism and patronising disdain by the powerful forces arrayed against our heroine takes the breath away. Not least because some of the abuse seems as current as that excreted by social media trolls. Rice's lyrics still pack a punch.\"\nOn 20 September 2018, \"The Guardian\"'s musicals reviewer, Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore, gave a four-star review of \"Evita\". The review, \"Tina Arena is Resplendent and Tough as Designer Dictator\", stated that \"In Opera Australia's production, Eva Per\u00f3n wins over a nation with a Christian Dior dress and steely determination, and a killer ballad steals the show. At the centre of it all is Evita, played with a resplendent toughness by Arena. It is to her credit that in a few hours she can turn from a naive, if plucky, teenager eager to leave her poor upbringing behind to a grown woman ravaged by illness and yet still desperate to cling to the last vestiges of power. The score stands the test of time too, Under director Harold Prince's deft hands, the song, 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina', shows its true colours: it is designed as a master class in political manipulation.\"\nIn February 2019, it was reported that the production had become the highest-selling show ever staged at the State Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne. Claire Spencer, the Arts Centre Melbourne CEO, said that \"It is fantastic to have such an accomplished cast, including cherished global star Tina Arena perform Evita at Arts Centre Melbourne. Tina is particularly close to our hearts as one of the Patrons of the Australian Music Vault at Arts Centre Melbourne.\"\nOn 2 May 2019, \"Limelight\" reported that Opera Australia published its annual report for 2018, stating that \"Opera Australia posts a (AU)$5.6 million profit for 2018.\" Details published that \"overall attendance was 543,498 from 637 total performances, with the numbers bolstered by the musical \"My Fair Lady\". Seasons of the musical \"Evita\" in Sydney and Melbourne led the charge in 2018, followed by the Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour production of \"La boh\u00e8me\".\"\nIn June 2019, Arena was nominated in the category of Best Female Actor in a Musical at the annual Helpmann Awards for her role as Eva Per\u00f3n in \"Evita\".

She also said, \"Tina Arena has a powerhouse voice and when she hits her marks, she hits them with forcefulness and verve.\" Spiritworks Australia says, \"Whether she's singing spine-tingling renditions of contemporary classics by Lulu, Dusty Springfield or Blondie or her self-penned hits Sorrento Moon, Chains or Burn, Tina Arena is acclaimed as one of the world's most versatile and magnificent vocal interpreters. Her voice is smooth, rich and streaming with emotion.\"\nThe Queensland Music Festival team says, \"Tina sparkles with vivacity and class, possessing an outstanding vocal range and a voice that belies her petite stature\u2014endlessly powerful and always resonant with heart and honesty.\" Queensland Music Festival artistic director, James Morrison said \"Tina Arena has one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard.\" Time Out magazine had a brief description of Tina's voice as it says, \"Tina Arena truly boasts two incredible assets\u2014her voice and her versatility\u00a0...\" Melbourne's 89.9 Light FM declared that Arena is \"undisputedly one of Australia's finest voices\". Sharyn Hamey, an online music reviewer says that \"Arena has an angelic, beautiful and a powerful voice.\"\nFellow Australian celebrities have praised Arena's vocal prowess with Delta Goodrem saying, \"Her voice has strength whilst keeping its feminine warmth to draw you in.\" Melbourne singer-songwriter, Michael Paynter hailed Arena as \"simultaneously the most natural and supernatural female Australian voice ever. She is technically and emotionally perfect, but somehow always has enough of a sniff of imperfection and rawness to make you not only believe every word, but be hanging off them too.\" Ricki-Lee Coulter also says that \"She has so much control and power\". Missy Higgins also commented that, \"Tina Arena is one of our best singers ever. She could sing the balls off anyone, and she's miniature.\" Brian Mannix says, \"Tina Arena has a tasteful voice. She sells the lyrics with her big voice but never over-sings.\" Birds of Tokyo frontman Ian Kenny says, \"Tina Arena can sing the shit out of anything, and do it in four different languages!\" Anthony Callea added, \"Technically, she is faultless and her tone is unique and warm.

She has stated that she does not record French versions of her English-language popular hits, because too often the intention of the song gets \"lost in translation\"; therefore, she has always chosen to write in both languages.\nArena's musical influences include Barbra Streisand, Carole King, Dusty Springfield, Petula Clark, Aretha Franklin and various Italian singers. She has noted that in a non-musical perspective, Princess Diana inspired her and called her \"a great role model for women\".\nLegacy.\nArena's tracks have been covered by country music artists, including Wynonna Judd (\"Heaven Help My Heart\", \"Love's Funny That Way\"), Jo Dee Messina (\"Burn\"), Pam Tillis (\"If I Didn't Love You\"), Terri Clark (\"Unsung Hero\"), Kellie Coffey, Kathie Baillie (\"Love's Funny That Way\") and LeAnn Rimes (\"You Made Me Find Myself\").\nYounger artists have covered Arena's songs in singing competitions, such as the winner of the second season of \"Australian Idol\", Casey Donovan, who recorded Arena's \"Symphony of Life\" for her album \"For You\" and both Filipino artist Sarah Geronimo and Australian Anthony Callea, who admits to being a fan of Arena's, recorded \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" including the bridge that was written specifically for Arena's version.

With her partner Vincent Mancini and their son, she moved back, full-time, at the end of October 2012, after almost two decades living in France and London.\nIn 2019, Arena stated to MOZA Music, \"I've been fortunate to have been around the pre-digital world. My story's unique, I'm aware of that and don't take it for granted. How do I define success? I define it by the fact that I'm still around; and that I've managed to survive\".\nViews.\nMusic industry politics.\nArena has been a supporter of female artists in the music industry, particularly celebrating the long-term careers of mature women artists. Arena believes we should embrace and celebrate ageing and not fall victim to ageism\u2014especially in the music industry where mature women are not seen as viable or relevant.\nTo the British newspaper \"The Guardian\", Arena described herself as somebody with \"certain points on the board\"\u2014someone who has been \"tenacious, resilient, hung around for a long time\" and \"done everything in their power to hone their craft\". It is from the place\u2014as one of Australia's great musical dames\u2014that she makes abrasive critiques of what constitutes a career in music today. \"I've struggled with the phantasmal aspect that has been a part of what we do\" she says. \"The fact that it has been really glamourised, glorified, also dumbed down as well.\" Thus, she argues that the music industry has been peddling shoddy wares, saying \"It's a business template they've used. They've told people that you can be a star and sold that dream to everybody. I think it's been a huge irresponsibility\".\nIn December 2016, in the \"Rolling Stone\" video series \"Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena\", she discusses how the music industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature. \"You've got to give me a really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, why on earth they should stop? Are you going to tell a male who is at the top of his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?\". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says \"Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams.\"\nTime's Up movement and the Australian music industry.\nIn December 2017, Arena joined over 600 high-profile female artists from the Australian music industry\u2014including Missy Higgins, the Veronicas, Sarah Blasko, and Jenny Morris\u2014in signing an open letter called \"#MeNoMore\" demanding change in the music industry, in support of Time's Up to fight workplace sexual harassment and assault. The authors of the open letter stated they are motivated to organise the letter as an Australian response to the #MeToo campaign movement triggered by the accounts of sexual abuse in the wider entertainment industry. Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group responded with words of support.\nFollowing the January 2018 creation of US Time's Up campaign by a collective of Hollywood female artists to fight workplace sexual harassment and assault, Arena joined with more than 30 high-profile women from the Australian media and entertainment industries\u2014including Deborah Mailman, Sarah Blasko and Danielle Cormack\u2014to spearhead a new national organisation, NOW Australia, led by broadcaster Tracey Spicer, to tackle sexual harassment, abuse and assault in workplaces across Australia. On Twitter, the Australian #MeToo campaign has encouraged stories of workplace harassment and assault following her public call-out on Twitter in October 2017.\nIn March 2018, in support of the Time's Up and #MeToo campaigns, Arena authored an op-ed article titled \"The music industry must join us with #thetimeisNOW\", published by News Corp Australia. Arena state her views on how the Australian music industry has enabled \"a stagnant perspective towards females\". Arena stated future social goals in the op-ed, that \"We need to raise the bar of our emotional intelligence because this is not a whinge, it's not a social media trend, and NOW Australia is going to keep the issue of sexual harassment at the forefront and do everything we possibly can to change the mentality that allows it to happen. We've got a lot of work to do here.\"\nAnti-lockdown sentiments.\nIn September 2021, Arena appeared on Australian daytime television program Studio 10 to highlight the disparity between the art community and sporting events in relation to COVID-19. During this interview, she advocated that the arts sector should no longer support charitable causes and that Victorian lockdowns should be ended. Arena cited as her reasons in the interview the double standards in how the arts and sports are treated, as large scale music events are cancelled \"but never the footy match\" and her belief that no one wants to help out the artistic community after \"the artistic community has done what they needed to do and always rolled up our sleeves\".\nMemoir.\nArena's memoir, \"Now I Can Dance\", published by HarperCollins, was released on 14 October 2013 in hardback, paperback and eBook format. Arena authoured her memoir with co-writer Jude McGee. The text is billed by HarperCollins as \"Honest and intimate, funny and frank\", adding: \"\"Now I Can Dance\" is the long-awaited memoir from the very special, much-loved singer, songwriter and pop diva, Tina Arena.\" She told Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia that \"I don't need to put a book out to put food on the table. It started to dawn on me in the last year that I have had an unbelievable life and I want people to know it's been hilarious, there's been a lot of laughter in my journey.\" Publisher: HarperCollins Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd (14 October 2013).\nThe title of her memoir is taken from the third single, \"Now I Can Dance\", from Arena's third studio album \"In Deep\" (1997). The track was written by Arena while living in L.A. and is a love letter from her to her family, as she explained in her memoir. The song was successful in her native Australia, reaching No. 13 on the ARIA Singles Chart.\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation shop described Tina Arena's memoir as an \"honest, gritty, funny, frank and totally revealing memoir from much loved songstress Tina Arena, who is about to celebrate a phenomenally successful 40 years as a singer-songwriter.\"\nHarperCollins said, \"Tina has amassed a cache of amazing stories. The artist who gave us \"Chains\", \"Sorrento Moon\" and \"Symphony of Life\" has sold eight million albums, won a swag of awards, encountered extraordinary people, fallen in and out of love, and experienced incredible highs and lows.\"\nIn 2017, Arena updated her memoir with the release of a new edition of \"Now I Can Dance\" with new content covering her relocation from France back to Australia, being inducted into the 2015 ARIA Hall of Fame, the release of new music, and new musical ventures.\nCharities.\nArena has used her fame to help several causes and is a patron to two charities in Australia: child protection organisation Barnardos, and Soldier On, which supports rehabilitation for veterans. In her support, she is an official patron for a charitable organisation Soldier On, which assists mentally and physically wounded Australian soldiers. Arena said, \"It's vital that Australian soldiers have access to support when they return from overseas, and 'Soldier On' will make a much needed difference in the lives of wounded veterans and their families. 'Soldier On' is the first charity of its kind in Australia and I am honoured to be a Patron.\"\nIn July 2013, Arena performed at the Melbourne Asbestos Cancer Fundraiser, which donated funds raised to support Mesothelioma research undertaken at the Olivia Newton-John Cancer &amp; Wellness Centre and the Austin Hospital, Melbourne. She was also a participant, with partner Damian Whitewood, in the 13th Australian season of \"Dancing with the Stars\" which commenced in September 2013 and nominated Barnardos Australia as her charity; the pair finished in third place.\nArena took part in Australia's biggest TV charity appeal, \"Telethon\", in Perth on 20 October 2013. On 21 December 2013, she opened Sydney's annual Carols in the Domain concert with \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" and performed her single \"Reset All\" at the closing of the event. She has also performed at several benefit concerts, including Live 8 in Paris and for Queensland Flood Relief in 2013.\nIn November 2014, Arena released a cover version of 10cc's 1976 song \"The Things We Do For Love\", with funds raised going towards the National Breast Cancer Foundation.\nArena, reflecting on nearly 40 years in the music industry, relates all of her achievements back to her Australian beginnings: \"If it wasn't for Australia, I would never have been able to have been catapulted internationally and to have done the things that I've been able to do. It was because of Australia that I've done that\". she told AAP, in 2013.\nIn May 2019, Arena was awarded the perennial \"Excellence in Community Award\" by the Australian Music in the House Organisation. The award was presented at Support Act Limited's annual Music in the House event on 29 May 2019. The award recognises \"members of the music industry who, by their tireless efforts and charitable works, have made a difference and enriched the fabric of the broader Australian community\".\nDiscography.\nStudio albums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTelevision.\nList of notable TV appearances Arena has made over the years.\nAwards.\nArena has won several awards, including seven ARIA Awards and the World Music Award for best-selling Australian artist, which she received in both 1996 and 2000.

No later than the 2nd century, the Romans named Saturday (\"Saturn's Day\") for the god Saturn. His planet, Saturn, controlled the first hour of that day, according to Vettius Valens. The day's name was introduced into West Germanic languages, and is recorded in the Low German languages such as Middle Low German , \"saterdach\", Middle Dutch (Modern Dutch ), and Old English , \"S\u00e6ternd\u00e6\u0121\" or .\nOrigins.\nThe seven-day week originated in Babylon and was adopted by Judaism, with the seventh day observed as a Sabbath day. Via the influence of Christianity, the seven-day week was adopted by the Roman Empire, gradually replacing the eight-day Roman nundinal cycle\nbetween the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. The astrological order of the days was explained by Vettius Valens and Dio Cassius (and Chaucer gave the same explanation in his \"Treatise on the Astrolabe\"). According to these authors, it was a principle of astrology that the heavenly bodies presided, in succession, over the hours of the day. The association of the weekdays with the respective deities is thus indirect, the days are named for the planets, which were in turn named for the deities.\nThe Germanic peoples adapted the system introduced by the Romans but glossed their indigenous gods over the Roman deities in a process known as \"interpretatio germanica\". In the case of Saturday, however, the Roman name was borrowed directly by West Germanic peoples, apparently because none of the Germanic gods was considered to be a counterpart of the Roman god Saturn. Otherwise Old Norse and Old High German did not borrow the name of the Roman god (Icelandic , German ).\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saturdays are days on which the Theotokos (Mother of God) and All Saints are commemorated, and the day on which prayers for the dead are especially offered, in remembrance that it was on a Saturday that Jesus lay dead in the tomb. The Octoechos contains hymns on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Saturdays throughout the year. At the end of services on Saturday, the dismissal begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the intercessions of his most-pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and right victorious Martyrs, of our reverend and God-bearing Fathers\u2026\". For the Orthodox, Saturday \u2014 with the sole exception of Holy Saturday \u2014 is never a strict fast day. When a Saturday falls during one of the fasting seasons (Great Lent, Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast, Dormition Fast) the fasting rules are always lessened to an extent. The Great Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross and the Beheading of St. John the Baptist are normally observed as strict fast days, but if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the fast is lessened.\nName and associations.\nToday, Saturday has two names in modern Standard German. The first word, , is always used in Austria, Liechtenstein, and the German-speaking part of Switzerland, and generally used in southern and western Germany. It derives from Old High German , the first part (\"sambaz\") of which derives from Greek , and this Greek word derives from Hebrew , . However, the current German word for Sabbath is . The second name for Saturday in German is , which derives from Old High German , and is closely related to the Old English word . It means literally \"Sun eve\", i.e., \"The day before Sunday\". is generally used in northern and eastern Germany, and was also the official name for Saturday in East Germany. Even if these two names are used regionally differently, they are usually understood at least passively in the other part.\nIn West https:// there are also two words for Saturday. In Wood Frisian it is , and in Clay Frisian it is , derived from , a combination of Old Frisian , meaning \"sun\" and \"joen\", meaning eve.\nIn the Westphalian dialects of Low Saxon, in East Frisian Low Saxon and in the Saterland Frisian language, Saturday is called , also akin to Dutch , which has the same linguistic roots as the English word \"Saturday\". It was formerly thought that the English name referred to a deity named \"S\u00e6tere\" who was venerated by the pre-Christian peoples of north-western Germany, some of whom were the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons. S\u00e6tere was identified as either a god associated with the harvest of possible Slav origin, or another name for Loki a complex deity associated with both good and evil; this latter suggestion may be due to Jacob Grimm. Regardless,modern dictionaries derive the name from \"Saturn\".\nIn most languages of India, Saturday is , meaning day, based on Shani, the Hindu god manifested in the planet Saturn. Some Hindus fast on Saturdays to reverse the ill effects of Shani as well as pray to and worship the deity Hanuman. In the Thai solar calendar of Thailand, the day is named from the Pali word for Saturn, and the color associated with Saturday is purple. In Pakistan, Saturday is , meaning the week. In Eastern Indian languages like Bengali Saturday is called , meaning Saturn's Day and is the first day of the Bengali Week in the Bengali calendar.\nIn Islamic countries, Fridays are considered as the last or penultimate day of the week and are holidays along with Thursdays or Saturdays; Saturday is called , (cognate to Sabbath) and it is the first day of the week in many Arab countries but is the (second-to-)last day in other Islamic countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Central Asian countries.\nIn Japanese, the word Saturday is , , meaning 'soil day' and is associated with , : Saturn (the planet), literally meaning \"soil star\". Similarly, in Korean the word Saturday is , , also meaning earth day. The element Earth was associated with the planet Saturn in Chinese astrology and philosophy.\nThe modern M\u0101ori name for Saturday, , literally means \"washing-day\" \u2013 a vestige of early colonized life when M\u0101ori converts would set aside time on the Saturday to wash their whites for Church on Sunday. A common alternative M\u0101ori name for Saturday is the transliteration .\nQuakers traditionally referred to Saturday as \"Seventh Day\", eschewing the \"pagan\" origin of the name.\nIn Scandinavian countries, Saturday is called , , or , the name being derived from the old word \"laugr/laug\" (hence Icelandic name ), meaning bath, thus \"L\u00f6rdag\" equates to bath-day. This is due to the Viking practice of bathing on Saturdays. The roots \"l\u00f6r\", \"laugar\" and so forth are cognate to the English word \"lye\", in the sense of detergent. The Finnish and Estonian names for the day, and , respectively, are also derived from this term.\nPosition in the week.\nThe international standard ISO 8601 sets Saturday as the sixth day of the week. The Abrahamic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regard Saturday as the seventh day of the week. As a result, many refused the ISO 8601 standards and continue to use Saturday as their seventh day.\nSaturday Sabbath.\nFor Jews, Messianics, Seventh Day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists, the seventh day of the week, known as Shabbat (or Sabbath for Seventh-day Adventists), stretches from sundown Friday to nightfall Saturday and is the day of rest. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches distinguish between Saturday (Sabbath) and the Lord's Day (Sunday). Other Protestant groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold that the Lord's Day is the Sabbath, according to the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8), and not Sunday.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.\u2014\u200a\nHoly Saturday.\nChristian religious observance in the Holy Week, before Easter Sunday.\nCatholic liturgy and devotions on each Saturday.\nIn the Catholic Church, Saturday is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\nIn the Catholic devotion of the Holy Rosary, the Joyful Mysteries are meditated on Saturday and also on Monday throughout the year.\nAstrology.\nIn astrology, Saturn is associated with Saturday, its planet's symbol , and the astrological signs Capricorn and Aquarius.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In countries adopting the \"Monday-first\" convention it is the fifth day of the week. In countries that adopt the \"Sunday-first\" convention, it is the sixth day of the week.\nIn most Western countries, Friday is the fifth and final day of the working week. In some other countries, Friday is the first day of the weekend, with Saturday the second. \nIn Israel, Friday is the sixth day of the week. In Iran, Friday is the last day of the weekend, with Saturday as the first day of the working week. Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait also followed this convention until they changed to a Friday\u2013Saturday weekend on September 1, 2006, in Bahrain and the UAE, and a year later in Kuwait. UAE recently changed its weekend from Friday-Saturday to Saturday-Sunday.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Friday\" comes from the Old English ', meaning the \"day of Frig\", a result of an old convention associating the Germanic goddess Frigg with the Roman goddess Venus, with whom the day is associated in many different cultures. The same holds for ' in Old High German, ' in Modern German, and ' in Dutch.\nThe expected cognate name in Old Norse would be '. The name of Friday in Old Norse is ' instead, indicating a loan of the week-day names from Low German; however, the modern Faroese name is '. The modern Scandinavian form is \"\" in Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish, meaning Freyja's day. The distinction between Freyja and Frigg in some Germanic mythologies is contested.\nThe word for Friday in most Romance languages is derived from Latin ' or \"day of Venus\" (a translation of Greek ', ), such as ' in French, \"venres\" in Galician, ' in Catalan, ' in Corsican, ' in Italian, ' in Romanian, and ' in Spanish and influencing the Filipino ' or ', and the Chamorro '. This is also reflected in the p-Celtic Welsh language as '.\nAn exception is Portuguese, also a Romance language, which uses the word ', meaning \"sixth day of liturgical celebration\", derived from the Latin ' used in religious texts where it was not allowed to consecrate days to pagan gods. Another exception among the Romance languages is also Sardinian, in which the word ' is derived from Latin '. This name had been given by the Jewish community exiled to the island in order to designate the food specifically prepared for Shabbat eve.\nIn Arabic, Friday is ', from a root meaning \"congregation/gathering.\" In languages of Islamic countries outside the Arab world, the word for Friday is commonly a derivation of this: (Malay \"Jumaat\" (Malaysia) or \"Jumat\" (Indonesian), Turkish ', Persian/Urdu , \").\nIn modern Greek, four of the words for the week-days are derived from ordinals. However, the Greek word for Friday is \" () and is derived from a word meaning \"to prepare\" (). Like Saturday (, ) and Sunday (, ), Friday is named for its liturgical significance as the day of preparation before Sabbath, which was inherited by Greek Christian Orthodox culture from Jewish practices.\nFriday was formerly a Christian fast day; this is the origin of the Irish ', Scottish Gaelic ', Manx ' and Icelandic ', all meaning \"fast day\".\nIn both biblical and modern Hebrew, Friday is \"\" meaning \"the sixth day.\"\nIn most Indian languages, Friday is \"Shukrav\u0101ra\", named for , the planet Venus.

The Hungarian word ' is a loan from Pannonian dialect of Slavic language. The n in \"\" suggests an early adoption from Slavic, when many Slavic dialects still had nasal vowels. In modern Slavic languages only Polish retained nasal vowels.\nFolklore.\nFriday is considered unlucky in some cultures. This is particularly so in maritime circles; perhaps the most enduring sailing superstition is that it is unlucky to begin a voyage on a Friday. In the 19th century, Admiral William Henry Smyth described Friday in his nautical lexicon \"The Sailor's Word-Book\" as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The \", on which old seamen were desirous of not getting under weigh, as ill-omened.\n(\" means \"unlucky day\".) This superstition is the root of the well-known urban legend of .\nIn modern times, Friday the 13th is considered to be especially unlucky, due to the conjunction of Friday with the unlucky number thirteen. Such a Friday may be called a \"Black Friday\".\nHowever, this superstition is not universal, notably in Scottish Gaelic culture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Though Friday has always been held an unlucky day in many Christian countries, still in the Hebrides it is supposed that it is a lucky day for sowing the seed. Good Friday in particular is a favourite day for potato planting\u2014even strict Roman Catholics make a point of planting a bucketful on that day. Probably the idea is that as the Resurrection followed the Crucifixion, and Burial so too in the case of the seed, and after death will come life?\nIn astrology.\nIn astrology, Friday is connected with the planet Venus and is symbolized by that planet's symbol \u2640. Friday is also associated with the astrological signs Libra and Taurus.\nReligious observances.\nChristianity.\nIn Christianity, Good Friday is the Friday before Easter. It commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus. As such, adherents of many Christian denominations including the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Methodist and Anglican traditions, observe the Friday Fast, which traditionally includes abstinence from meat, lacticinia, and alcohol on Fridays of the year.\nTraditionally, Roman Catholics were obliged to refrain from eating the meat of warm-blooded animals on Fridays, although fish was allowed. The Filet-O-Fish was invented in 1962 by Lou Groen, a McDonald's franchise owner in Cincinnati, Ohio, in response to falling hamburger sales on Fridays resulting from the Roman Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Fridays.\nIn the present day, episcopal conferences are now authorized to allow some other form of penance to replace abstinence from meat. The 1983 Code of Canon Law states:\nCanon 1250. The days and times of penance for the universal Church are each Friday of the whole year and the season of Lent.\nCanon 1251. Abstinence from meat, or from some other food as determined by the Episcopal Conference, is to be observed on all Fridays, unless a solemnity should fall on a Friday. Abstinence and fasting are to be observed on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.\nCanon 1253. The Episcopal Conference can determine more particular ways in which fasting and abstinence are to be observed. In place of abstinence or fasting it can substitute, in whole or in part, other forms of penance, especially works of charity and exercises of piety.\nThe Book of Common Prayer prescribes weekly Friday fasting and abstinence from meat for all Anglicans.\nIn Methodism, the Directions Given to Band Societies (25 December 1744) mandate for all Methodists fasting and abstinence from meat on all Fridays of the year.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church continues to observe Fridays (as well as Wednesdays) as fast days throughout the year (with the exception of several fast-free periods during the year). Fasting on Fridays entails abstinence from meat or meat products (i.e., quadrupeds), poultry, and dairy products (as well as fish). Unless a feast day occurs on a Friday, the Orthodox also abstain from using oil in their cooking and from alcoholic beverages (there is some debate over whether abstention from oil involves all cooking oil or only olive oil). On particularly important feast days, fish may also be permitted. For the Orthodox, Fridays throughout the year commemorate the Crucifixion of Christ and the (Mother of God), especially as she stood by the foot of the cross. There are hymns in the which reflect this liturgically. These include ' (hymns to the Mother of God) which are chanted on Wednesdays and Fridays called ' (\"Cross-\"). The dismissal at the end of services on Fridays begins with the words: \"May Christ our true God, through the power of the precious and life-giving cross...\"\nQuakers traditionally referred to Friday as \"Sixth Day,\" eschewing the pagan origins of the name. In Slavic countries, it is called \"Fifth Day\" (, Russian: , \"\").\nHinduism.\nThe day is named after the Shukracharya, son of Bhrigu and Kavyamata (Usana). In Sanatana Dharma, special observances are practiced for mother goddesses on Friday. In San\u0101tana dharma, Fridays are important for married ladies. They worship Goddesses on that day.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, Friday (from sun-down Thursday to sun-down Friday, simpler than midnight to midnight in a pre-clock age) is the day of communion, of praying together, often mistaken as the holy day of Muslims corresponding to Sunday in Christianity and Sabbath (Friday evening to Saturday evening) in Judaism and Sabbatarian Christianity; yet the seventh day is the holy day of contemplation and rest also for Muslims, as it is called \u2013 Al-sabt \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u062a in Arabic - the Sabbath. Friday observance includes attendance at a mosque for congregation prayer or Salat AlJumu'ah. It is considered a day of peace and mercy (see Jumu'ah) as well as a day of rest.\nAccording to some Islamic traditions, the day is stated to be the original holy day ordained by God, but that now Jews and Christians recognize the days after. In some Islamic countries, the week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday, just like the Jewish week and the week in some Christian countries. The week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday in most other Islamic countries, such as Somalia, and Iran. Friday is also the day of rest in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. In some Malaysian states, Friday is the first week-end day, with Saturday the second, to allow Muslims to perform their religious obligations on Friday. Sunday is the first working day of the week for governmental organizations.\nMuslims are recommended not to fast on a Friday by itself (\"makruh\", recommended against, but not \"haram\", religiously forbidden), unless it is accompanied with fasting the day before (Thursday) or day after (Saturday), or it corresponds with days usually considered good for fasting (i.e. Day of Arafah or Ashura), or it falls within one's usual religious fasting habits (i.e. fasting every other day), then it's completely permissible.\nMuslims believe Friday as \"Syed-ul-Ayyam\" meaning King of days. A narration in Sahih Muslim describes the importance of Friday as follows.\n\"Abu Huraira reported the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) as saying: The best day on which the sun has risen is Friday; on it, Adam was created. on it he was made to enter Paradise, on it he was expelled from it. And the last hour will take place on no day other than Friday. \n(Sahih Muslim Book 7, Hadith 27)\u201d\nThe Quran also has a sura (chapter) called Al-Jumu'ah (The Friday).\nJudaism.\nJewish Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday and lasts until nightfall on Saturday. There is a Jewish custom to fast on the Friday of the week of Chukat.\nThailand.\nIn Thailand, the color associated with Friday is blue (see Thai calendar).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Estonian it's \"neljap\u00e4ev\", meaning \"fourth day\" or \"fourth day in a week\". The Baltic languages also use the term \"fourth day\" (Latvian \"ceturtdiena\", Lithuanian \"ketvirtadienis\").\nFifth day.\nGreek uses a number for this day: \u03a0\u03ad\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7 \"P\u00e9mpti\" \"fifth,\" as does \"fifth day,\" Hebrew: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u200e (\"Yom Khamishi\" \u2013 day fifth) often written &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;'\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u200e (\"Yom Hey\" \u2013 5th letter Hey day), and Arabic: (\"Yaum al-Kham\u012bs\" \u2013 fifth day). Rooted from Arabic, the Indonesian word for Thursday is \"Kamis\", similarly \"Khamis\" in Malaysian and \"Kemis\" in Javanese.\nIn Catholic liturgy, Thursday is referred to in Latin as \"feria quinta\". Portuguese, unlike other Romance languages, uses the word \"quinta-feira,\" meaning \"fifth day of liturgical celebration\", that comes from the Latin \"feria quinta\" used in religious texts where it was not allowed to consecrate days to pagan gods.\nIcelandic also uses the term \"fifth day\" (\"Fimmtudagur\").\nIn the Persian language, Thursday is referred to as \"panj-shanbeh\", meaning 5th day of the week.\nVietnamese refers to Thursday as (literally means \"day five\").\nQuakers traditionally referred to Thursday as \"Fifth Day\" eschewing the pagan origin of the English name \"Thursday\".\nCultural and religious practices.\nChristian holidays.\nIn the Christian tradition, Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday is the Thursday before Easter \u2014 the day on which the Last Supper occurred. Also known as \"Sheer Thursday\" in the United Kingdom, it is traditionally a day of cleaning and giving out Maundy money there. Holy Thursday is part of Holy Week.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Thursdays are dedicated to the Apostles and Saint Nicholas. The Octoechos contains hymns on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Thursdays throughout the year. At the end of Divine Services on Thursday, the dismissal begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the intercessions of his most-pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostles, of our Father among the saints Nicholas, Archbishop of Myra in Lycia, the Wonder-worker\u2026\"\nAscension Thursday is 40 days after Easter, when Christ ascended into Heaven.\nHinduism.\nIn Hinduism, Thursday is associated with the Navagraha Brihaspati, whom devotees of this graha will fast pray and fast on Thursdays. The day is dedicated to the deity Vishnu or his avatars, such as Rama, Parshurama, Narasimha, Satyanarayan, and Buddha. However, Wednesday is dedicated to his avatars of Krishna and Vithoba. Devotees usually fast on this day in honor of Vishnu and his avatars, especially Vaishnava Hindus.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, Thursdays are one of the days in a week in which Muslims are encouraged to do voluntary fasting, the other being Mondays.\nJudaism.\nIn Judaism, Thursdays are considered auspicious days for fasting. The Didache warned early Christians not to fast on Thursdays to avoid Judaizing, and suggested Fridays instead.\nIn Judaism the Torah is read in public on Thursday mornings, and special penitential prayers are said on Thursday, unless there is a special occasion for happiness which cancels them.\nDruze faith.\nFormal Druze worship is confined to weekly meeting on Thursday evenings, during which all members of community gather together to discuss local issues before those not initiated into the secrets of the faith (the juhh\u0101l, or the ignorant) are dismissed, and those who are \"uqq\u0101l\" or \"enlightened\" (those few initiated in the Druze holy books) remain to read and study their holy scriptures.\nPractices in countries.\nIn Finland and Sweden, pea soup is traditionally served on Thursdays.\nIn Indonesia, and Malaysia, in a week, batik clothing is usually worn on Thursday, especially at education and civil servant institutions.\nFor Thai Buddhist, Thursday is considered the \"Teacher's Day\", and it is believed that one should begin one's education on this auspicious day. Thai students still pay homages to their teachers in specific ceremony always held on a selected Thursday. And graduation day in Thai universities, which can vary depending on each university, almost always will be held on a Thursday.\nIn the Thai solar calendar, the colour associated with Thursday is orange.\nIn the United States, Thanksgiving Day is an annual festival celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.\nConventional weekly events.\nIn Australia, most cinema movies premieres are held on Thursdays. Also, most Australians are paid on a Thursday, either weekly or fortnightly. Shopping malls see this as an opportunity to open longer than usual, generally until 9 pm, as most pay cheques are cleared by Thursday morning.\nIn Norway, Thursday has also traditionally been the day when most shops and malls are open later than on the other weekdays, although the majority of shopping malls now are open until 8 pm or 9 pm every weekday.\nIn the USSR of the 1970s and 1980s Thursday was the \"Fish Day\" (, \"Rybny den\"), when the nation's foodservice establishments were supposed to serve fish (rather than meat) dishes.\nFor college and university students, Thursday is sometimes referred to as the new Friday. There are often fewer or sometimes no classes on Fridays and more opportunities to hold parties on Thursday night and sleep in on Friday. As a consequence, some call Thursday \"thirstday\" or \"thirsty Thursday\".\nElections in the United Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, all general elections since 1935 have been held on a Thursday, and this has become a tradition, although not a requirement of the law \u2014 which merely states that an election may be held on any day \"except Saturdays, Sundays, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Good Friday, bank holidays in any part of the United Kingdom and any day appointed for public thanksgiving and mourning\".\nAdditionally, local elections are usually held on the first Thursday in May.\nThe Electoral Administration Act 2006 removed Maundy Thursday as an excluded day on the electoral timetable, therefore an election can now be held on Maundy Thursday; prior to this elections were sometimes scheduled on the Tuesday before as an alternative.\nAstrology.\nThursday is aligned by the planet Jupiter and the astrological signs of Pisces and Sagittarius.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In countries that adopt the traditional \"Sunday first\" convention, it is the fourth day of the week.\nIn English, the name is derived from Old English and Middle English , 'day of Woden', reflecting the religion practised by the Anglo-Saxons, the English equivalent to the Norse god Odin. In many Romance languages, such as the French , Spanish or Italian , the day's name is a calque of Latin 'day of Mercury'.\nWednesday is in the middle of the common Western five-day workweek that starts on Monday and finishes on Friday.\nEtymology.\nThe name Wednesday continues Middle English . Old English still had , which would be continued as \"*Wodnesday\" (but Old Frisian has an attested ). By the early 13th century, the \"i\"-mutated form was introduced unetymologically.\nThe name is a calque of the Latin 'day of Mercury', reflecting the fact that the Germanic god Woden (Wodanaz or Odin) during the Roman era was interpreted as \"Germanic Mercury\".\nThe Latin name dates to the late 2nd or early 3rd century. It is a calque of Greek (), a term first attested, together with the system of naming the seven weekdays after the seven classical planets, in the \"Anthologiarum\" by Vettius Valens (c. AD 170).\nThe Latin name is reflected directly in the weekday name in most modern Romance languages: (Sardinian), (French), (Italian), (Spanish), (Romanian), (Catalan), or (Corsican), (Venetian). In Welsh it is , meaning 'Mercury's Day'.\nThe Dutch name for the day, , has the same etymology as English \"Wednesday\"; it comes from Middle Dutch , ('Wodan's day').\nThe German name for the day, (literally: 'mid-week'), replaced the former name ('Wodan's day') in the 10th century. (Similarly, the Yiddish word for Wednesday is (), meaning and sounding a lot like the German word it came from.)\nMost Slavic languages follow this pattern and use derivations of 'the middle' (Belarusian , Bulgarian , Croatian , Czech , Macedonian , Polish , Russian , Serbian or , Slovak , Slovene , Ukrainian ). \nThe Finnish name is ('middle of the week'), as is the Icelandic name: , and the Faroese name: ('mid-week day'). Some dialects of Faroese have , though, which shares etymology with Wednesday. Danish, Norwegian, Swedish , ( meaning 'Odin's day').\nIn Japanese, the word for Wednesday is meaning 'water day' and is associated with (): Mercury (the planet), literally meaning 'water star'. Similarly, in Korean the word for Wednesday is ; , also meaning 'water day'.\nIn most of the languages of India, the word for Wednesday is \u2014 meaning 'day' and \"Budha\" being the planet Mercury.\nIn Armenian ( ), Georgian ( ), Turkish (), and Tajik () languages the word literally means 'four (days) from Saturday' originating from Persian ( ).\nPortuguese uses the word , meaning 'fourth day', while in Greek the word is () meaning simply 'fourth'. Similarly, Arabic means 'fourth', Hebrew means 'fourth', and Persian means 'fourth day'. Yet the name for the day in Estonian , Lithuanian , and Latvian means 'third day' while in Mandarin Chinese (), means 'day three', as Sunday is unnumbered.\nReligious observances.\nThe Creation narrative in the Hebrew Bible places the creation of the Sun and Moon on \"the fourth day\" of the divine workweek.\nQuakers traditionally referred to Wednesday as \"Fourth Day\" to avoid the pagan associations with the name \"Wednesday\", or in keeping with the practice of treating each day as equally divine.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church observes Wednesday (as well as Friday) as a fast day throughout the year (with the exception of several fast-free periods during the year). Fasting on Wednesday and Fridays entails abstinence from meat or animal products (i.e., four-footed animals), poultry and dairy products. Unless a feast day occurs on a Wednesday, the Orthodox also abstain from fish, from using oil in their cooking and from alcoholic beverages (there is some debate over whether abstention from oil involves all cooking oil or only olive oil). For the Orthodox, Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year commemorate the betrayal of Jesus (Wednesday) and the Crucifixion of Christ (Friday). There are hymns in the Octoekhos which reflect this liturgically. These include special \"Theotokia\" (hymns to the Mother of God) called ('Cross-Theotokia'). The dismissal at the end of services on Wednesday begins with these words: \"May Christ our true God, through the power of the precious and life-giving cross...\"\nIn Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the name for Wednesday also refers to fasting, as it is in Irish Gaelic and in Scottish Gaelic, which comes from ', meaning 'first', and ', meaning 'fasting', which combined means 'first day of fasting'.\nIn American culture many Catholic and Protestant churches schedule study or prayer meetings on Wednesday nights. The sports calendar in many American public schools reflects this, reserving Mondays and Thursdays for girls' games and Tuesdays and Fridays for boys' games while generally avoiding events on Wednesday evening.\nIn the Catholic devotion of the Holy Rosary, the glorious mysteries are meditated on Wednesday and also Sunday throughout the year.\nWednesday is the day of the week devoted by the Catholic tradition to Saint Joseph.\nIn Hinduism, Budha is the god of Mercury, Wednesday, and of merchants and merchandise. Krishna, Vithoba, and Ganesha are also worshipped on Wednesday.\nCultural usage.\nAccording to the Thai solar calendar, the color associated with Wednesday is green.\nIn the folk rhyme Monday's Child, \"Wednesday's child is full of woe\". In the rhyme Solomon Grundy, Grundy was \"married on Wednesday\". In \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\", the disagreeable nature of the weather is attributed to it being \"Winds-Day\" (a play on \"Wednesday\"). In Richard Brautigan's \"In Watermelon Sugar\" Wednesday is the day when the sun shines grey. Wednesday Friday Addams is a member of the fictional family The Addams Family. Her name is derived from the idea that Wednesday's child is full of woe. Additionally, Wednesday sometimes appears as a character's name in literary works. These include \"Thursday's fictions\" by Richard James Allen, Wednesday Next from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde and Neil Gaiman's novel \"American Gods\". In the 1945 John Steinbeck novel \"Sweet Thursday\", the titular day is preceded by \"Lousy Wednesday\".\nWednesday is sometimes informally referred to as \"hump day\" in North America, a reference to the fact that Wednesday is the middle day\u2014or \"hump\"\u2014of a typical work week. \"Lill\u00f6rdag\", or \"little Saturday\", is a Nordic tradition of turning Wednesday evening into a small weekend-like celebration. Humpday is also a name of a 2009 film.\nIn Poland, Wednesday night is often referred by young people as \"time of vodka\", after song by Bartosz Walaszek \"\u015arodowa noc to w\u00f3dy czas\"\nAstrology.\nThe astrological sign of the planet Mercury, \u263f, represents Wednesday\u2014 to the Romans, it had similar names in Latin-derived languages, such as the Italian ( means 'day'), the French , and the Spanish . In English, this became \"Woden's Day\", since the Roman god Mercury was identified by Woden in Northern Europe and it is especially aligned by the astrological signs of Gemini and Virgo.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to international standard ISO 8601, Monday is the first day of the week; thus, Tuesday is the second day of the week. According to many traditional calendars, however, Sunday is the first day of the week, so Tuesday is the third day of the week. In some Muslim countries, Saturday is the first day of the week and thus Tuesday is the fourth day of the week. \nThe English name is derived from Middle English , from Old English meaning \"T\u012bw's Day\", the day of Tiw or T\u00fdr, the god of single combat, law, and justice in Norse mythology. Tiw was equated with Mars in the , and the name of the day is a translation of Latin .\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Tuesday\" derives from the Old English and literally means \"Tiw's Day\". Tiw is the Old English form of the Proto-Germanic god \"*T\u00eewaz\", or T\u00fdr in Old Norse. \"*T\u00eewaz\" derives from the Proto-Indo-European base \"*dei-\", \"*dey\u0101-\", \"*d\u012bdy\u0101-\", meaning 'to shine', whence comes also such words as \"deity\".\nThe German \"Dienstag\" and Dutch \"dinsdag\" are derived from the Germanic custom of the \"thing\", as Tiw / T\u00fdr also had a strong connection to the thing.\nThe Latin name (\"day of Mars\") is equivalent to the Greek (, \"day of Ares\"). In most languages with Latin origins (Italian, French, Spanish, Catalan, Romanian, Galician, Sardinian, Corsican, but not Portuguese), the day is named after Mars, the Roman parallel of the Ancient Greek Ares ().\nIn some Slavic languages the word Tuesday originated from Old Church Slavonic word meaning \"the second\". Bulgarian and Russian () ( ) is derived from the Bulgarian and Russian adjective for 'second' \u2013 () or ().\nIn Japanese, the second day of the week is (), from (), the planet Mars. Similarly, in Korean the word Tuesday is (), means literally fire day, and Mars the planet is referred to as the fire star with the same words, but this is unrelated to the Roman god Mars, which is referred to phonetically as Mars.\nIn the Indo-Aryan languages Pali and Sanskrit the name of the day is taken from ('one who is red in colour'), a style (manner of address) for Mangala, the god of war, and for Mars, the red planet.\nIn the Nahuatl language, Tuesday is () meaning \"day of Huitzilopochtli\".\nIn Arabic, Tuesday is (), and in Hebrew it is (), meaning \"third day\". When added after the word / ( or ) it means \"the third day\".\nReligious observances.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Tuesdays are dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. The Octoechos contains hymns on this theme, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Tuesdays throughout the year. At the end of Divine Services on Tuesday, the dismissal begins with the words: \"May Christ our True God, through the intercessions of his most-pure Mother, of the honorable and glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John\u2026\"\nIn Hinduism, Tuesday is a popular day for worshipping and praying to Hanuman and Kartikeya, some also worship Kali, Durga, Parvati, and Ganesha. Many Hindus fast during Tuesday. Many Hindu married women also observe the Mangala Gauri Vrat of fasting every Tuesday in the Hindu month of Shravana, as the month is dedicated to Gauri and Shiva. Tuesday is also viewed as the day ruled by Mangala (Mars) in Hinduism.\nCultural references.\nIn the Greek world, Tuesday (the day of the week of the Fall of Constantinople) is considered an unlucky day. The same is true in the Spanish-speaking world; it is believed that this is due to the association between Tuesday and Mars, the god of war and therefore related to death. For both Greeks and Spanish-speakers, the 13th of the month is considered unlucky if it falls on Tuesday, instead of Friday. In Judaism, on the other hand, Tuesday is considered a particularly lucky day, because in Bereshit (parashah), known in the Christian tradition as the first chapters of Genesis, the paragraph about this day contains the phrase \"it was good\" twice.\nIn the Thai solar calendar, the day is named for the Pali word for the planet Mars, which also means \"Ashes of the Dead\"; the color associated with Tuesday is pink.\nIn the folk rhyme \"Monday's Child\", \"Tuesday's child is full of grace\".\nCommon occurrences.\nUnited States.\nTuesday is the usual day for elections in the United States. Federal elections take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November; this date was established by a law of 1845 for presidential elections (specifically for the selection of the Electoral College), and was extended to elections for the House of Representatives in 1875 and for the Senate in 1914. Tuesday was the earliest day of the week which was practical for polling in the early 19th century: citizens might have to travel for a whole day to cast their vote, and would not wish to leave on Sunday which was a day of worship for the great majority of them. However, a bill was introduced in 2012 to move elections to weekends, with a co-sponsor stating that \"by moving Election Day from a single day in the middle of the workweek to a full weekend, we are encouraging more working Americans to participate. Our democracy will be best served when our leaders are elected by as many Americans as possible.\"\nVideo games are commonly released on Tuesdays in the United States, this fact often attributed to the \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\" \"Sonic 2s day\" marketing campaign in 1992. DVDs and Blu-rays are released on Tuesday. Albums were typically released on Tuesdays as well, but this has changed to Fridays globally in 2015.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia meets on the first Tuesday of every month except January. The federal government hands down the federal budget on the second Tuesday in May, the practice since 1994 (except in 1996 and 2016). The Melbourne Cup is held each year on the first Tuesday in November.\nAstrology.\nIn astrology, Tuesday is aligned by the planet Mars and the astrological signs of Aries and Scorpio.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

The original series ran from 1971 until 1988 and was hosted by singer-songwriter and record producer Johnny Young for its entire run. The show was briefly revived by Network Ten in 2012 and was hosted by singer and actor Rob Mills.\nHistory.\nThe series featured a core group of young performers, in the vein of \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", and a weekly junior talent quest. The regular cast known as \"The Young Talent Team\" performed popular classic songs along with the top hit songs of the day. The original program launched the careers of a number of Australian performers including Sally Boyden, Jamie Redfern, Vikki Broughton, Debra Byrne (billed then as Debbie), Tina Arena and Dannii Minogue and spawned numerous hit singles, fifteen Young Talent Time albums, a film, as well as merchandise including swap cards, boardgames, toys, and mugs. The program won numerous Logie Awards.\n\"Young Talent Time\" (1971\u20131988).\nProduction details.\n\"Young Talent Time\" was produced as a joint venture by \"Lewis-Young Productions\" (the production partnership between host Johnny Young and his friend and colleague Kevin Lewis, one of the directors of Festival Records) and was taped mainly at the studios of ATV-10 in Nunawading, Melbourne although occasional shows were taped at the TEN-10 studios in Sydney or on location.\nMany of the episodes from the early- to mid-1970s no longer exist as the tapes were wiped for re-use, being the official Network Ten policy at the time. Some later episodes from the series were repeated by pay TV broadcaster Foxtel in the late 1990s.\nOn average, 44 episodes were produced per year for 18 years. The episodes were broadcast in black and white from April 1971 to April 1975, thereafter in colour. The final episode aired on 23 December 1988.\n\"Caravan Holiday\".\nIn the Christmas break between the first and second seasons of \"Young Talent Time\", Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team shot a 22-minute colour film. (At the time, \"Young Talent Time\" still screened in black and white on Australian television.) Sponsored by the Caravan Trade &amp; Industries Association \"Caravan Holiday\" was completed by early 1972 and released in cinemas across Australia as a supporting feature to Peter Bogdanovich's hugely popular US comedy picture \"What's Up, Doc?\" which starred Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal.\nThe cast featured the then-current line-up of the Young Talent Team (Jamie Redfern, Rod Kirkham, Greg Mills, Philip Gould, Julie Ryles, Debbie Byrne, Vikki Broughton and Jane Scali) prior to Redfern's departure to tour the US with Liberace. Despite not appearing in the film, new team member Trevor Hindmarch turned up to the premiere, as seen in the documentary \"Young Talent Time Tells All\".\nIt featured actor/comedian Buster Fiddess (as Mr Crawley) and Addie Black, and guest appearances by Johnny Young (in multiple cameos as a service station attendant, farmer, caravan site manager and speedboat lake), Evie Hayes and John Farnham (then known as Johnny Farnham) as himself. Fiddess died just a few days after he finished filming his scenes. There was also a film clip made for the Young Talent Team's version of The Cowsills' hit song \"The Rain, The Park and Other Things\", shot in Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens, but despite not appearing on the actual recording, being recorded prior to their recruitment, Mills and Ryles appeared in the clip.\nIt screened on television just once, on Christmas Eve 1972. It was then unseen for three decades until a restored version was featured as a bonus extra on the 2002 DVD \"Young Talent Time: The Collection\" (Universal Pictures - 2002).\nIn the opening credit sequence, Jane Scali's surname is misspelt as Scarli.\n\"Alumni\".\nOver the original run of the show, from 1971 to 1988, there were a total of 40 cast members.\nMembers of the cast who found continued success after leaving the series and continue working as performers include Tina Arena, Vikki Broughton, Jane Scali, Jamie Redfern, Dannii Minogue, Karen Knowles, Sally Boyden, and Debra Byrne, Beven Addinsall and John Bowles.\nThe show had a policy that when team members reached 16 years of age, they had to leave the series and move on, but this rule would subsequently be stretched and broken.\nConcerts and live appearances.\nOver the 18 years of the original show, Johnny Young and the various cast members made numerous live appearances all over Australia, performing full concerts or short publicity appearances at various venues.\nIn 1973, Young, the cast and Denis Walter supported Jamie Redfern in a series of live concerts. \"The Jamie Redfern Show\" sold out a number of shows at Melbourne's Festival Hall.\nIn 1987, an unanticipated audience turnout of over 4,000 people caused trouble at a concert at the Westfield Shopping Centre, Parramatta. Some fans were crushed in the crowd after the concert. Joey Dee had to be treated for a knee injury and Courtney Compagnino had to be treated for shock.\nIn 1988, over 12,000 people attended an outdoor concert held in Brisbane at the 1988 World Expo, which was broadcast on television the following week.\nAt the end of 1988, Young and the cast performed a series of concerts. The final concert was held at the Melbourne Tennis Centre on 23 December, the same night on which the last episode of \"Young Talent Time\" aired on Network Ten.\nLuna Park incident.\nIn the early 1970s the cast performed at Luna Park Sydney. Due to the large crowd in attendance, they were unable to leave. Park management offered to stop the scenic railway so that the cast could exit through the tunnel. According to Greg Mills, the train driver was not told, and the train did not stop. The cast narrowly avoided death by pressing themselves against the wall of the tunnel. If not for Brad Boyden, Sally Boyden's father, neither of the team would have known that the roller coaster train was even approaching. Trevor Hindmarch came the closest to death or injury as his jacket was almost caught on the speeding vehicle as it passed. Fortunately Trevor lost only a button.\nFinal years.\nIn 1988, an episode of Young Talent Time was shot in the United States. The two-hour special, \"Young Talent Time at Universal Studios\", aired on 13 August 1988.\nIn its final years, Young Talent Time began to struggle for ratings, particularly following the decision of the Nine Network to move its popular early morning variety show \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\" to the 6:30 pm slot in 1985, which put it in direct competition to Young Talent Time.\nAfter four years of dwindling ratings, in October 1988 Network Ten finally decided to move \"YTT\" to Friday nights at 7.30 pm, but the change did not help. The show was cancelled three months later. The general manager of Channel 10 Melbourne, Renny Cunnack, announced on 25 January 1989 that \"Young Talent Time\" would \"not be resuming production in 1989\". Cunnack himself was dismissed as General Manager three months later. The following day on Australia Day in 1989, the Young Talent Time cast performed a concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne.\nNear the end of 1988, Johnny Young had invested a large amount of money in building his own TV studio complex in Richmond with the intention of producing the show himself and leasing it to Channel 10 but the termination of the show ended this plan and he was forced to sell his family home to finance his debts.\nNetwork Ten continued airing compilation episodes in early 1989, initially as \"The Best of Young Talent Time\" at 7.30 on Friday nights, then as \"Young Talent Time Favorites\" at 11.00 on Saturday mornings. The last of these aired in Melbourne on Saturday 1 April 1989.\nOn September 26, 2021, Channel 10 aired a special anniversary edition of Young Talent Time. It marked the show's 50th anniversary.\n\"The New Generation\" (1988).\nIn 1988 Johnny Young launched an American version of the show re-titled \"The New Generation\".\nProduced in Australia, it starred the current senior members of the former Young Talent Time cast: Dannii Minogue, Vince Del Tito, Natalie Miller, Lorena Novoa, Beven Addinsall; and a new member, Keith Williams, from Los Angeles. The show also featured regular appearances from the younger members of the former cast, who were billed as \"The Young Generation\": Jamie Churchill, Johnnie Nuich, Joey Dee, Courtney Compagnino, Juanita Coco and Rikki Arnot.\n\"The New Generation\" was hosted by American Michael Young, the host of the Emmy Award winning \"Kids Are People Too\". Thirteen 30-minute episodes were produced by Johnny Young's Television House and Fries Entertainment and screened on CBN Cable Network/The CBN Family Channel (now Freeform) in the US.\n\"Young Talent Time\" (1990).\nIn 1990 Johnny Young self-funded and produced a one-off direct-to-video special titled \"Young Talent Time Now - 1990\". It featured the final six members of the cast (Jamie Churchill, Johnnie Nuich, Joey Dee, Courtney Compagnino, Juanita Coco, and Rikki Arnot) and former cast member Beven Addinsall.\n\"Young Talent Time\" (2012).\nNetwork Ten and Granada Australia - in conjunction with Johnny Young and Johnny Young Music - were the producers of a revival of \"Young Talent Time\". Taped before a live studio audience at Fox Studios in Sydney, the 15-episode series debuted on Network Ten across Australia at 6.30 pm on Sunday 22 January 2012.\nHosted by former \"Australian Idol 2003\" contestant Rob Mills, the 2012 revival featured a regular Young Talent Team (of 10 members) performing a couple of group numbers each week, with one team member featuring in a solo spot each episode to showcase their individual talents. Starting from Episode 10, duets were sung instead of solos as each team member had performed a solo.\nEach weekly episode featured three or four young contestants (or acts) under the age of 16. These solo performers, duos, groups, etc., included singers, dancers (ballet, hip hop, tap, jazz, etc.), musicians, sight acts, illusionists, comedians and so on. The winning contestant (or act) each week received $5,000 from NAB (National Australia Bank) and the Grand Final winner received $100,000.\nSherrynne Johnson a young Tasmanian semi finals Winner was unable to return for the Grand Final due to \nunforeseen family circumstances.\nThe show's two judges/mentors were the original show's longest-serving Young Talent Team member Tina Arena (who appeared from 1977 to 1983 \u2013 six years 6 Months), and Filipino-American choreographer Charles Klapow, one of the winners of the Emmy Award for 'Outstanding Choreography' for \"High School Musical 2\". Better known as 'Chucky' Klapow, he also helped choreograph the films \"Cheetah Girls 2, High School Musical and \" as well as appearing in all three \"High School Musical\" movies as a dancer. He has choreographed for Mick Jagger and dances alongside Michael Jackson in the film \"Michael Jackson's This Is It\". Klapow had previously been a judge on UK talent show \"Don't Stop Believing\". TV Personality Ian Dickson filled in as judge while Tina Arena was ill for one episode. From the beginning of the finals competition he served as a full-time judge.\nWhile the judges decided the winning contestant (or act) of each weekly episode, viewers could vote online for any of the weekly runners-up to become a 'wild-card' entrant, giving them a second chance of making it into the finals. On 20 March, it was announced that \"YTT\" would move to Fridays at 7:30 to 8:30, the current time slot of Glee. It is believed \"YTT\" was moved because of poor ratings on Sunday night resulting in the much more popular program \"The Biggest Loser\" taking the 6:30 to 7:30 timeslot. The YTT team then commenced a tour having shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. The Grand Final episode was aired on 4 May. The talent quest was won by first heat entrants and wildcard winners Lil' Banditz Krew. The all-boys Hip Hop troupe toured with the YTT team and Rob Mills in June and July 2012, visiting various Sydney venues as well as Melbourne and Canberra.\n\"YTT\" was not renewed for a 2013 season because of poor ratings. However, Aydan, Lyndall, Adrien, Michelle and Tia went on to audition for future talent shows while Georgia-May worked with Disney Channel Australia. Aydan appeared on \"Australia's Got Talent\" in 2013 and auditioned for the 2017 and 2018 seasons of The Voice, being unable to turn a chair in 2017 but turning all four chairs in 2018. Aydan joined Joe Jonas' team and ultimately placed 4th place. After the show he started releasing his own music as well as being on Eurovision - Australia Decides in 2019. Aydan also starred in Stan\u2019s streaming series Invisible Boys as Zeke Caligero in 2025. Lyndall auditioned on \"The Voice\" in 2015 and joined Delta Goodrem\u2019s team and made it to the final six before being eliminated. Adrien auditioned for \"The X Factor\" in 2014 and was assigned to the Boys group mentored by Natalie Bassingthwaighte, but was eliminated in week 3. Both Tia and Michelle also auditioned for The Voice in 2017, with Tia unable to turn a chair while Michelle turning three chairs and ultimately joining Kelly Rowland\u2019s team but was eliminated in the knockouts. \nDiscography and videography.\nDVDs.\nA one-hour prime-time television documentary \"Young Talent Time Tells All\" aired on Network Ten on 29 October 2001. Produced and directed by former YTT cast member John Bowles, it was a tremendous ratings success celebrating the show's 30th anniversary. Bowles interviewed over thirty of the original cast members for the programme. Archive footage, including clips thought to have been lost, were interspersed with the YTT kids speaking about their experiences on and off-air.\nA small reunion of \"YTT\" cast and crew members (including Tina Arena, Dannii Minogue and Johnny Young) was held in Melbourne in October 2003 to launch the release of an extended version of the \"Young Talent Time Tells All\" documentary on DVD (through Universal Pictures). The original documentary TV Special was extended, and bonus features and rare footage, not seen in the television version, were added. It was titled \"Young Talent Time: The Collection\".\nBonus features on the DVD include a restored version of the 1972 short film \"Caravan Holiday\" featuring Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team; full biographies of all 40 Team Members and Johnny Young; Nicole Kidman's appearance as a guest on the show to promote her 1983 film \"BMX Bandits\"; assorted television commercials featuring members of the team; footage of some of the Team when they appeared as contestants on the show; and the full-length clip of sisters Dannii Minogue and Kylie Minogue performing the song \"Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves\".\nRare footage includes a nine-year-old Jamie Redfern (pre-\"Young Talent Time\") appearing with Happy Hammond on a Channel Seven test broadcast of colour television in 1968, seven years before Australian television actually began broadcasting in colour.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology and Greco-Roman mythology), as well as numerous songs celebrating the genre and its core audience. The band is also known for a loud and emphatic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that\". In 1984, the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on two occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for five hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria (at Kavarna Rock Fest) in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan \"death to false metal\".\nHistory.\nOrigins (1980\u20131981).\nManowar's history began in 1980 when Joey DeMaio, the future bassist of the band, met guitarist Ross the Boss while working as a bass tech and fireworks manager for Black Sabbath on the Heaven &amp; Hell Tour. Ross the Boss, a former member of the punk rock band the Dictators, was the guitar player in Black Sabbath's support band, Shakin' Street. The two bonded over their shared musical interests, became friends and decided to form a band with the suggestion and advice of Black Sabbath's singer Ronnie James Dio during the tour. At the end of the tour with Black Sabbath, the duo got together to form Manowar. To complete the roster, they hired drummer Donnie Hamzik and singer Eric Adams, a former classmate and friend of DeMaio. Adams's real name is Louis Marullo; Ross the Boss proposed him to use a stage name instead, and he chose \"Eric Adams\" as an homage to his sons Eric and Adam. The name Manowar was suggested to Joey DeMaio and Ross the Boss by their instrument designer, John \"Dawk\" Stillwell, while DeMaio and The Boss were brainstorming possible names. The name is a shortened version of the phrase \"Man of war\", and although it may be understood as a reference to the Man-of-war naval ships, DeMaio simply chose it as a synonym of \"Warrior\".\n\"Battle Hymns\" (1981\u20131982).\nThe band recorded a demo after its creating. It was enough to secure a recording contract with label Liberty Records in 1981. The debut album, \"Battle Hymns\", was released the following year. As the song \"Dark Avenger\" required an introductory narration, the band wanted to include a famous actor in it. Executive producer Bob Currie contacted the manager of Orson Welles, who was open to the idea. He recorded two narrations for the band, \"Dark Avenger\" and \"Defender\".\nSoon after the album's release, Manowar engaged in their first tour. The band played support for hard rocker Ted Nugent, but their collaboration lasted only a few months. Manowar then decided to put together a short tour by themselves and all the arrangements were made in a few weeks by their manager. Despite these setbacks, the band gained domestic fame on this short tour and also began to get their first European fans, particularly in the United Kingdom and in Germany. Stressed from the strain of the continuing performances, Hamzik decided to leave the band at the end of this tour and was replaced with Scott Columbus.\n\"Into Glory Ride\" and mainstream success (1983\u20131988).\nBy 1983, the band left Liberty Records and struck a deal with Megaforce Records in the US and Music for Nations in Europe\u2014signing the contract in their own blood, to make a stance against the music industry they felt slighted by. The signing was a cover story in the 1983 July\u2013August issue No. 47 of \"Kerrang!\".\nWhen Manowar returned home, they immediately went into a recording studio to produce what, in the intentions of the group, would have been a simple EP, but came out instead, due to the quantity and quality of the tracks made in that period, as the band's second album, \"Into Glory Ride\". An EP was actually published in 1983 with the title \"Defender\" containing, as its main track, the eponymous song, which included more work by Orson Welles. The atmosphere of the album evoked classical heroic fantasy and mythology, and served as a predecessor to Viking metal. It contained several innovative features, both in style and sound, and led to a huge increase in the number of fans of the group, particularly in the United Kingdom, where the band planned a long tour that was ultimately canceled. The song \"Defender\" was later re-recorded and included in the \"Fighting the World\" album of 1987.\nTo apologize for the failure of their UK tour, Manowar decided to dedicate their next album to the United Kingdom. The album, \"Hail to England\", was recorded and mixed in just six days and was released in early 1984.\nManowar soon returned to work in the recording studio. After leaving Music for Nations, the quartet released \"Sign of the Hammer\" ten months after their previous album.\nFollowing further disagreements with their new label, the group changed record label to Atlantic Records in 1987. Via Atlantic, they released \"Fighting the World\", which enjoyed more extensive distribution and increased the band's prominence in the international heavy metal scene. Album art was designed by Ken Kelly.\nIn 1988, Manowar released the album \"Kings of Metal\", which is the band's best known work. Songs like \"Heart of Steel\", \"Kings of Metal\" and \"Hail and Kill\" are performed regularly in concerts. \"Kings of Metal\" is Manowar's highest-selling album worldwide.\nManowar embarked on a world tour, for a period of approximately three years, with stops in almost all European nations. During that tour, Joey DeMaio \"fired\" Ross the Boss. According to a 2008 interview with the guitarist, \"Joey felt that Manowar would be better without me\". He was replaced by David Shankle, who was chosen by members of the band after a search among about 150 candidates. Scott Columbus later also decided to leave the band during the Kings of Metal tour. Columbus himself picked his replacement Kenny Earl Edwards (soon nicknamed 'Rhino').\nNew albums, first video, and live publications (1992\u20132002).\nA new musical unit after the recent changes, Manowar released \"The Triumph of Steel\" in 1992. It gained some success and was particularly famous for the presence of a suite lasting no less than 28 minutes entitled \"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts\", inspired by the events of the \"Iliad\" and the hero Achilles. After this release, the band went on a world tour for two years. After the expiration of their contract with Atlantic, the band signed with Geffen Records. In 1994, Shankle unexpectedly left the band to form his own group. He was replaced by Karl Logan, a musician met by DeMaio during a motor meeting. The same year saw the unexpected return of Scott Columbus, who replaced Edwards.\nIn 1996, they released \"Louder Than Hell\", their first new studio album in four years. Despite good sales the album was criticized for its simple style.\nDespite such criticisms, Manowar released a new collection, called \"Anthology\", and their first live album, \"Hell on Wheels\", released by BMG International in the guise of a double CD containing all the most popular songs of the group. Not having the time to record a new studio album because of the ongoing promotional tour, Manowar released a second live album, \"Hell on Stage\".\n\"Warriors of the World\", \"Hell on Earth\", and Magic Circle Music (2002\u20132005).\nIn 2002, six years after the last studio album, Manowar released the \"Warriors of the World\" album. \"Warriors of the World\" presented a sound somewhat renewed in style, but maintained the usual energy and power. The most famous tracks from the album became \"Warriors of the World United\", \"House of Death\" and \"Call to Arms\", in addition to Puccini's aria \"Nessun Dorma\", covered in honor of the Italian fans and sung live for the first time in a concert in Milan, Italy.\nManowar then began a long world tour, called \"Warriors of the World United Tour\" that kept them busy and away from a recording studio for a long time. To compensate for the lack of studio albums, the band released several DVDs: in 2002 the video \"Fire and Blood\", in 2003 \"Hell on Earth Part III\" and in 2005 \"Hell on Earth Part IV\". These (and all DVDs since the year 2000) were directed by Neil Johnson, and have all been certified Gold in Germany.\nIn 2003, DeMaio founded his own record label, Magic Circle Music, which became the official home of the band, having been created to fit the needs of Manowar, and other bands of similar genre. Under the label Magic Circle were also released the EP \"The Sons of Odin\" with footage taken during the Earthshaker Fest 2005.\n\"Gods of War\" and \"Thunder in the Sky\" (2006\u20132009).\nManowar released \"Gods of War\" through Magic Circle Music in 2007. After playing numerous shows in Europe, including a concert that spanned the course of two nights, they worked on a new EP, entitled \"Thunder in the Sky\", which was released in 2009. The EP consisted of two discs: the first playing the regular track list; the second playing the song \"Father\" in fifteen different languages.\nScott Columbus' death, \"Battle Hymns MMXI\", and \"The Lord of Steel\" (2010\u20132013).\nOn June 1, 2010, \"Classic Rock\" magazine published an interview with drummer Scott Columbus who said that he had not worked with the band since April 2008 and had left the band. He also said that statements made in the past, regarding his break in 1990 and 2008 because of an illness and a personal tragedy, were largely untrue and were made without his agreement. On October 15, 2010, Joey DeMaio announced on Facebook that Hamzik was officially a member of Manowar again after a 26-year absence.\nOn April 4, 2011, Columbus died at the age of 54. On April 5, 2020, Columbus' daughter Teresa publicly announced that her father's cause of death was suicide, and urged for more awareness on mental illness and depression.\nManowar's subsequent release was a re-recording of their 1982 debut album \"Battle Hymns\". This album was released on November 26, 2010, with the narration of Sir Christopher Lee and formally entitled \"Battle Hymns MMXI\". On July 21, 2011, the band embarked on a UK tour for the first time in 16 years in November and performed the \"Battle Hymns\" album in its entirety.\nManowar's next studio album, \"The Lord of Steel\", was released worldwide on June 16, 2012, exclusively on iTunes and on the band's own online store. The album sees a reversion from the symphonic elements present on the \"Gods of War\" album back to a more straightforward, heavy metal sound. The song \"El Gringo\" is featured in the soundtrack to the film of the same name.\nAfter the Lord of Steel tour was over in 2013, Manowar released a live EP, titled \"The Lord of Steel Live\", which included six live tracks recorded during the tour.\n\"Kings of Metal MMXIV\" (2013\u20132014).\nOn July 28, 2013, Manowar announced that they would be re-recording their 1988 release \"Kings of Metal\" with an expected release date of late 2013. Brian Blessed recorded his narration for the track \"The Warrior's Prayer\" at Circle (Recording) Studios in Birmingham, England. Like the re-recording of \"Battle Hymns MMXI\", this album allowed the band to use modern day technology.\n\"Kings of Metal MMXIV\" was released through iTunes as a digital download on February 4, 2014. Hard copies of the album were released on February 28.\nThe embarked on a world tour in support of the album in 2014.\nUpcoming twelfth studio album, Logan's arrest, and continued touring (2015\u2013present).\nOn May 22, 2015, Manowar announced that they were currently working on a new studio album that was set to be released in early 2016. This album was not released, and instead they went to Europe in early 2016 for the \"Gods and Kings World Tour 2016\" which included their first concerts in Slovakia, Latvia and Belarus.\nOn May 25, 2016, the band announced that they would embark on their next world tour dubbed \"The Final Battle\". They would later recruit drummer Marcus Castellani from the tribute band Kings of Steel as their drummer for the tour.\nOn October 25, 2018, it was revealed that guitarist Karl Logan was arrested on August 9 in Charlotte, North Carolina, for allegedly possessing child pornography and was charged with six counts of third-degree exploitation of a minor ultimately resulting in a conviction and a prison sentence. Manowar issued a statement shortly after saying that Logan would not perform with them. They then said that their upcoming album and tour would not be affected. Following Logan's arrest, former guitarist David Shankle expressed interest in rejoining the band.\nOn January 1, 2019, Manowar announced that guitarist E. V. Martel would join them on their tour. On March 22, 2019, the band announced that they would release a trilogy of EP's based upon The Final Battle World Tour. The first EP, \"The Final Battle I\", was released on March 29 in an exclusive pre-sale at the merchandise booth in Frankfurt and also during the European shows. It was then released on iTunes worldwide that day. The EP was digitally and physically released on May 30. Former HammerFall and Yngwie Malmsteen drummer Anders Johansson was announced as the new live drummer shortly after and made his debut at the March 25 show in Brno. Despite the tour's name, bassist Joey DeMaio dismissed any claims of Manowar's retirement, mainly due to the fans' demands to have them continue to perform.\nIn June 2019, the band's appearance at Hellfest was cancelled for undisclosed reasons. Fans who were to attend the show expressed their disappointment towards their cancellation. Manowar stepped in and said that they did not cancel their performance, but that it was the festival's organizers who cancelled their appearance in an announcement that appeared on their website. Swedish band Sabaton replaced Manowar in the lineup. Joey DeMaio later said that the band filed a lawsuit against the Hellfest organizers.\nIn May 2020, Manowar announced that they would embark on a tour, beginning in April 2021 in Europe, to celebrate their 40th anniversary. However, the band did not tour in 2020 and 2021.\nOn June 4, 2022, the day of the first show of their 2022/23 tour, it was announced drummer Anders Johansson could not perform with the band on their upcoming \"Crushing the Enemies of Metal Anniversary Tour '22/'23\" due to family commitments, and was replaced by Dave Chedrick for the tour. On September 2, 2022, following the announcement by guitarist E. V. Martel that he would not be available for touring next year, the band announced Michael Angelo Batio as their touring guitarist for their upcoming 2023 \"Crushing the Enemies of Metal\" anniversary Tour. \nOn October 15, 2023, the band announced that in 2024 they will re-record their album \"Sign of the Hammer\" to be released under the title \"Sign of the Hammer 2024\", while also confirming that their new long-awaited still-untitled studio album will be released in 2025. However, as of 2025 there is no news about this re-recording of \"Sign of the Hammer\". In January 2025, the band started their new tour called \"The Blood of Our Enemies Tour 2025\" where at first they will play a mix of \"Hail to England\" and \"Sign of the Hammer\" plus their greatest hits and starting in early February they will start performing the albums in their entirety on alternating nights.\nMusical style.\nManowar's sound is categorized as power metal. According to James Christopher Monger of AllMusic: \"Emerging in 1980, the group's approach was designed to be the raw, Viking antithesis of classic rock, and their music followed suit, based on urgent melodic riffs and fantastical lyrics that focused on themes of war, honor, death, and the primal power of rock &amp; roll.\" He also noted that the band's sound contains \"classical touches.\"\nBand members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Faceless Warrior.\nThe Faceless Warrior, also known as the King of Metal, is the band's mascot. The character first appeared in 1988 on the cover of the album \"Kings of Metal\", and has since appeared in the cover artwork of almost every following Manowar album, as well as on merchandise and in almost every Manowar live show to follow.\nIn a May 2002 interview with Metal-Rules.com, vocalist Eric Adams was asked, \"Who is that guy in your album cover? Do you have any name for him?\". He replied, \"No because he is you, he is her, he is this person he is that person and so on. He has no face and that was in [sic] purpose because everyone needs a heroes [sic] in their life and our music is all about heroes and you know being the leader not the follower. It's picture [sic] of hero and you being that hero is that what it is all about. So there is no real name for it. It's a fantasy world man. Put your face there are you are the hero!\"\nThe Sign of the Hammer.\n\"The Sign of the Hammer\" is a cultural gesture developed in the early years of the band, after the release of their fourth album of the same name, and serves as a signature of the band: It is formed by raising the right fist above the head, while using the left hand to grab the back of the right wrist. The sign is most likely to have been shaped from the vocalist Eric Adams. The Media Company \"Heilbronner Stimme\" published an article describing the Sign of the Hammer as, \"the striking greeting. A gesture that unites. A gesture that fits the pathos of the self-proclaimed Kings of Metal. A gesture that has become the trademark of the group founded in 1980\".\nThe first official appearance of the gesture was on the front cover of the band's fifth album, \"Fighting the World\", where vocalist Eric Adams is shown making the gesture in a drawing of the band members. The gesture then appeared in the official music video for \"Blow Your Speakers\", shown being made by the band members and crowd during a concert, as well as in the full cover art of the album \"The Triumph of Steel\". Since then, the sign has been featured in almost every official music video of the band.\nAwards.\nMetal Hammer Golden Gods Awards\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\nLegacy.\nManowar have an important place in the history and evolution of heavy metal music and are a significant influence in the heavy metal genre especially on subgenres such as: power metal, epic/ symphonic/ melodic metal, viking metal, pagan metal, folk metal, doom metal, gothic metal and death metal and \"on every power metal band to emerge in the past 25 years\".\nManowar has influenced heavy metal bands and artists around the world, such as Sabaton, Rhapsody of Fire, Brothers of Metal, Amon Amarth Battle Beast, Beast in Black, Death, Elvenking, Symphony X, Firewind, Abbath, Exmortus, Jack Starr's Burning Starr, T\u00fdr, Wizard, HammerFall, Van Canto, Ensiferum, Avatar, Trivium, Majesty, Angra, Burning Point, Crystal Viper, Imperial Age, Therion, Hercules, Lost Horizon, Atlantean Kodex, Grand Magus, Doomsword, Orden Ogan, Pegazus, Moonspell, Trick or Treat, Hysterica, Stormwarrior, Arch Enemy, Korpiklaani, Seven Witches, Steel Attack, Stormwarrior, White Skull, Khemmis, Seven Kingdom, Wintersun, Falconer, Children of Bodom, Destroy Destroy Destroy, Holy Dragons, Sons of Apollo, Sulphur Aeon, Unleash the Archers, Crom, Coronatus, Brainstorm, Immortal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Flares occur in active regions and are often, but not always, accompanied by coronal mass ejections, solar particle events, and other eruptive solar phenomena. The occurrence of solar flares varies with the 11-year solar cycle.\nSolar flares are thought to occur when stored magnetic energy in the Sun's atmosphere accelerates charged particles in the surrounding plasma. This results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The typical time profile of these emissions features three identifiable phases: a \"precursor phase\", an \"impulsive phase\" when particle acceleration dominates, a \"gradual phase\" in which hot plasma injected into the corona by the flare cools by a combination of radiation and conduction of energy back down to the lower atmosphere, and a currently unexplained \"EUV late phase\" \nthat occurs in some flares.\nThe extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from solar flares is absorbed by the daylight side of Earth's upper atmosphere, in particular the ionosphere, and does not reach the surface. This absorption can temporarily increase the ionization of the ionosphere which may interfere with short-wave radio communication. The prediction of solar flares is an active area of research.\nFlares also occur on other stars, where the term \"stellar flare\" applies.\nPhysical description.\nSolar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation originating in the Sun's atmosphere. They affect all layers of the solar atmosphere (photosphere, chromosphere, and corona). The plasma medium is heated to &gt;107 kelvin, while electrons, protons, and heavier ions are accelerated to near the speed of light. Flares emit electromagnetic radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays.\nFlares occur in active regions, often around sunspots, where intense magnetic fields penetrate the photosphere to link the corona to the solar interior. Flares are powered by the sudden (timescales of minutes to tens of minutes) release of magnetic energy stored in the corona. The same energy releases may also produce coronal mass ejections (CMEs), although the relationship between CMEs and flares is not well understood.\nAssociated with solar flares are flare sprays. They involve faster ejections of material than eruptive prominences, and reach velocities of 20 to 2,000 kilometres per second.\nCause.\nFlares occur when accelerated charged particles, mainly electrons, interact with the plasma medium. Evidence suggests that the phenomenon of magnetic reconnection leads to this extreme acceleration of charged particles. On the Sun, magnetic reconnection may happen on solar arcades\u2014a type of prominence consisting of a series of closely occurring loops following magnetic lines of force. These lines of force quickly reconnect into a lower arcade of loops leaving a helix of magnetic field unconnected to the rest of the arcade. The sudden release of energy in this reconnection is the origin of the particle acceleration. The unconnected magnetic helical field and the material that it contains may violently expand outwards forming a coronal mass ejection. This also explains why solar flares typically erupt from active regions on the Sun where magnetic fields are much stronger. \nAlthough there is a general agreement on the source of a flare's energy, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. It is not clear how the magnetic energy is transformed into the kinetic energy of the particles, nor is it known how some particles can be accelerated to the GeV range (109 electron volt) and beyond. There are also some inconsistencies regarding the total number of accelerated particles, which sometimes seems to be greater than the total number in the coronal loop.\nPost-eruption loops and arcades.\nAfter the eruption of a solar flare, post-eruption loops made of hot plasma begin to form across the neutral line separating regions of opposite magnetic polarity near the flare's source. These loops extend from the photosphere up into the corona and form along the neutral line at increasingly greater distances from the source as time progresses. The existence of these hot loops is thought to be continued by prolonged heating present after the eruption and during the flare's decay stage.\nIn sufficiently powerful flares, typically of C-class or higher, the loops may combine to form an elongated arch-like structure known as a post-eruption arcade. These structures may last anywhere from multiple hours to multiple days after the initial flare. In some cases, dark sunward-traveling plasma voids known as supra-arcade downflows may form above these arcades.\nFrequency.\nThe frequency of occurrence of solar flares varies with the 11-year solar cycle. It can typically range from several per day during solar maxima to less than one every week during solar minima. Additionally, more powerful flares are less frequent than weaker ones. For example, X10-class (severe) flares occur on average about eight times per cycle, whereas M1-class (minor) flares occur on average about 2,000 times per cycle.\nIn 1984 Erich Rieger and coworkers discovered an approximately 154-day period in the occurrence of gamma-ray emitting solar flares at least since the solar cycle 19. The period has since been confirmed in most heliophysics data and the interplanetary magnetic field and is commonly known as the \"Rieger period\". The period's resonance harmonics also have been reported from most data types in the heliosphere. \nThe frequency distributions of various flare phenomena can be characterized by power-law distributions. For example, the peak fluxes of radio, extreme ultraviolet, and hard and soft X-ray emissions; total energies; and flare durations (see ) have been found to follow power-law distributions.\nClassification.\nSoft X-ray.\nThe modern classification system for solar flares uses the letters A, B, C, M, or X, according to the peak flux in watts per square metre (W/m2) of soft X-rays with wavelengths , as measured by GOES satellites in geosynchronous orbit. \nThe strength of an event within a class is noted by a numerical suffix ranging from 1 up to, but excluding, 10, which is also the factor for that event within the class. Hence, an X2 flare is twice the strength of an X1 flare, an X3 flare is three times as powerful as an X1. M-class flares are a tenth the size of X-class flares with the same numeric suffix. An X2 is four times more powerful than an M5 flare. X-class flares with a peak flux that exceeds 10\u22123 W/m2 may be noted with a numerical suffix equal to or greater than 10.\nThis system was originally devised in 1970 and included only the letters C, M, and X. These letters were chosen to avoid confusion with other optical classification systems. The A and B classes were added in the 1990s as instruments became more sensitive to weaker flares. Around the same time, the backronym \"moderate\" for M-class flares and \"extreme\" for X-class flares began to be used.\nImportance.\nAn earlier classification system, sometimes referred to as the \"flare importance\", was based on H-alpha spectral observations. The scheme uses both the intensity and emitting surface. The classification in intensity is qualitative, referring to the flares as: faint (f), normal (n), or brilliant (b). The emitting surface is measured in terms of millionths of the hemisphere and is described below. (The total hemisphere area \"AH\" = 15.5 \u00d7 1012 km2.) \nA flare is then classified taking S or a number that represents its size and a letter that represents its peak intensity, v.g.: Sn is a normal sunflare.\nDuration.\nA common measure of flare duration is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) time of flux in the soft X-ray bands measured by GOES. The FWHM time spans from when a flare's flux first reaches halfway between its maximum flux and the background flux and when it again reaches this value as the flare decays. Using this measure, the duration of a flare ranges from approximately tens of seconds to several hours with a median duration of approximately 6 and 11 minutes in the bands, respectively.\nFlares can also be classified based on their duration as either impulsive or long duration events (LDE). The time threshold separating the two is not well defined. The SWPC regards events requiring 30 minutes or more to decay to half maximum as LDEs, whereas Belgium's Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence regards events with duration greater than 60 minutes as LDEs.\nEffects.\nThe electromagnetic radiation emitted during a solar flare propagates away from the Sun at the speed of light with intensity inversely proportional to the square of the distance from its source region. The excess ionizing radiation, namely X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation, is known to affect planetary atmospheres and is of relevance to human space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life. \nSolar flares also affect other objects in the Solar System. Research into these effects has primarily focused on the atmosphere of Mars and, to a lesser extent, that of Venus. The impacts on other planets in the Solar System are little studied in comparison. As of 2024, research on their effects on Mercury have been limited to modeling of the response of ions in the planet's magnetosphere, and their impact on Jupiter and Saturn have only been studied in the context of X-ray radiation back scattering off of the planets' upper atmospheres.\nIonosphere.\nEnhanced XUV irradiance during solar flares can result in increased ionization, dissociation, and heating in the ionospheres of Earth and Earth-like planets. On Earth, these changes to the upper atmosphere, collectively referred to as \"sudden ionospheric disturbances\", can interfere with short-wave radio communication and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as GPS, and subsequent expansion of the upper atmosphere can increase drag on satellites in low Earth orbit leading to orbital decay over time.\nFlare-associated XUV photons interact with and ionize neutral constituents of planetary atmospheres via the process of photoionization. The electrons that are freed in this process, referred to as \"photoelectrons\" to distinguish them from the ambient ionospheric electrons, are left with kinetic energies equal to the photon energy in excess of the ionization threshold. In the lower ionosphere where flare impacts are greatest and transport phenomena are less important, the newly liberated photoelectrons lose energy primarily via thermalization with the ambient electrons and neutral species and via secondary ionization due to collisions with the latter, or so-called \"photoelectron impact ionization\". In the process of thermalization, photoelectrons transfer energy to neutral species, resulting in heating and expansion of the neutral atmosphere. The greatest increases in ionization occur in the lower ionosphere where wavelengths with the greatest relative increase in irradiance\u2014the highly penetrative X-ray wavelengths\u2014are absorbed, corresponding to Earth's E and D layers and Mars's M1 layer.\nRadio blackouts.\nThe temporary increase in ionization of the daylight side of Earth's atmosphere, in particular the D layer of the ionosphere, can interfere with short-wave radio communications that rely on its level of ionization for skywave propagation. Skywave, or skip, refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted off of the ionized ionosphere. When ionization is higher than normal, radio waves get degraded or completely absorbed by losing energy from the more frequent collisions with free electrons.\nThe level of ionization of the atmosphere correlates with the strength of the associated solar flare in soft X-ray radiation. The Space Weather Prediction Center, a part of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, classifies radio blackouts by the peak soft X-ray intensity of the associated flare.\nSolar flare effect.\nDuring non-flaring or solar quiet conditions, electric currents flow through the ionosphere's dayside E layer inducing small-amplitude diurnal variations in the geomagnetic field. These ionospheric currents can be strengthened during large solar flares due to increases in electrical conductivity associated with enhanced ionization of the E and D layers. The subsequent increase in the induced geomagnetic field variation is referred to as a solar flare effect (sfe) or historically as a magnetic crochet. The latter term derives from the French word meaning \"hook\" reflecting the hook-like disturbances in magnetic field strength observed by ground-based magnetometers. These disturbances are on the order of a few nanoteslas and last for a few minutes, which is relatively minor compared to those induced during geomagnetic storms.\nHealth.\nLow Earth orbit.\nFor astronauts in low Earth orbit, an expected radiation dose from the electromagnetic radiation emitted during a solar flare is about 0.05 gray, which is not immediately lethal on its own. Of much more concern for astronauts is the particle radiation associated with solar particle events.\nMars.\nThe impacts of solar flare radiation on Mars are relevant to exploration and the search for life on the planet. Models of its atmosphere indicate that the most energetic solar flares previously recorded may have provided acute doses of radiation that would have been harmful or almost lethal to mammals and other higher organisms on Mars's surface. Furthermore, flares energetic enough to provide lethal doses, while not yet observed on the Sun, are thought to occur and have been observed on other Sun-like stars.\nObservational history.\nFlares produce radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, although with different intensity. They are not very intense in visible light, but they can be very bright at particular spectral lines. They normally produce bremsstrahlung in X-rays and synchrotron radiation in radio.\nOptical observations.\nSolar flares were first observed by Richard Carrington and Richard Hodgson independently on 1 September 1859 by projecting the image of the solar disk produced by an optical telescope through a broad-band filter. It was an extraordinarily intense \"white light flare\", a flare emitting a high amount of light in the visual spectrum.\nSince flares produce copious amounts of radiation at H-alpha, adding a narrow (\u22481 \u00c5) passband filter centered at this wavelength to the optical telescope allows the observation of not very bright flares with small telescopes. For years H\u03b1 was the main, if not the only, source of information about solar flares. Other passband filters are also used.\nRadio observations.\nDuring World War II, on February 25 and 26, 1942, British radar operators observed radiation that Stanley Hey interpreted as solar emission. Their discovery did not go public until the end of the conflict. The same year, Southworth also observed the Sun in radio, but as with Hey, his observations were only known after 1945. In 1943, Grote Reber was the first to report radioastronomical observations of the Sun at 160\u00a0MHz. The fast development of radioastronomy revealed new peculiarities of the solar activity like \"storms\" and \"bursts\" related to the flares. Today, ground-based radiotelescopes observe the Sun from c. 15\u00a0MHz up to 400\u00a0GHz.\nSpace telescopes.\nBecause the Earth's atmosphere absorbs much of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun with wavelengths shorter than 300\u00a0nm, space-based telescopes allowed for the observation of solar flares in previously unobserved high-energy spectral lines. Since the 1970s, the GOES series of satellites have been continuously observing the Sun in soft X-rays, and their observations have become the standard measure of flares, diminishing the importance of the H-alpha classification. Additionally, space-based telescopes allow for the observation of extremely long wavelengths\u2014as long as a few kilometres\u2014which cannot propagate through the ionosphere.\nExamples of large solar flares.\nThe most powerful flare ever observed is thought to be the flare associated with the 1859 Carrington Event. While no soft X-ray measurements were made at the time, the magnetic crochet associated with the flare was recorded by ground-based magnetometers allowing the flare's strength to be estimated after the event. Using these magnetometer readings, its soft X-ray class has been estimated to be greater than X10 and around X45 (\u00b15).\nIn modern times, the largest solar flare measured with instruments occurred on 4 November 2003. This event saturated the GOES detectors, and because of this, its classification is only approximate. Initially, extrapolating the GOES curve, it was estimated to be X28. Later analysis of the ionospheric effects suggested increasing this estimate to X45. This event produced the first clear evidence of a new spectral component above 100\u00a0GHz.\nPrediction.\nCurrent methods of flare prediction are problematic, and there is no certain indication that an active region on the Sun will produce a flare. However, many properties of active regions and their sunspots correlate with flaring. For example, magnetically complex regions (based on line-of-sight magnetic field) referred to as \"delta spots\" frequently produce the largest flares. A simple scheme of sunspot classification based on the McIntosh system for sunspot groups, or related to a region's fractal complexity is commonly used as a starting point for flare prediction. Predictions are usually stated in terms of probabilities for occurrence of flares above M- or X-class within 24 or 48 hours. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issues forecasts of this kind. MAG4 was developed at the University of Alabama in Huntsville with support from the Space Radiation Analysis Group at Johnson Space Flight Center (NASA/SRAG) for forecasting M- and X-class flares, CMEs, fast CME, and solar energetic particle events. A physics-based method that can predict imminent large solar flares was proposed by Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE), Nagoya University.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term usually refers to the Sun's chromosphere, but not exclusively, since it also refers to the corresponding layer of a stellar atmosphere. The name was suggested by the English astronomer Norman Lockyer after conducting systematic solar observations in order to distinguish the layer from the white-light emitting photosphere. \nIn the Sun's atmosphere, the chromosphere is roughly in height, or slightly more than 1% of the Sun's radius at maximum thickness. It possesses a homogeneous layer at the boundary with the photosphere. Narrow jets of plasma, called spicules, rise from this homogeneous region and through the chromosphere, extending up to into the corona above.\nThe chromosphere has a characteristic red color due to electromagnetic emissions in the \"H\"\u03b1 spectral line. Information about the chromosphere is primarily obtained by analysis of its emitted electromagnetic radiation. The chromosphere is also visible in the light emitted by ionized calcium, Ca II, in the violet part of the solar spectrum at a wavelength of 393.4 nanometers (the Calcium K-line).\nChromospheres have also been observed on stars other than the Sun. On large stars, chromospheres sometimes make up a significant proportion of the entire star. For example, the chromosphere of supergiant star Antares has been found to be about 2.5 times larger in thickness than the star's radius.\nPhysical properties.\nThe density of the Sun's chromosphere decreases exponentially with distance from the center of the Sun by a factor of roughly 10 million, from about at the chromosphere's inner boundary to under at the outer boundary. The temperature initially decreases from the inner boundary at about to a minimum of approximately , but then increasing to upwards of at the outer boundary with the transition layer of the corona (see ).\nThe density of the chromosphere is 10\u22124 times that of the underlying photosphere and 10\u22128 times that of the Earth's atmosphere at sea level. This makes the chromosphere normally invisible and it can be seen only during a total eclipse, where its reddish colour is revealed. The colour hues are anywhere between pink and red. Without special equipment, the chromosphere cannot normally be seen due to the overwhelming brightness of the photosphere.\nThe chromosphere's spectrum is dominated by emission lines when observed at the solar limb. In particular, one of its strongest lines is the \"H\"\u03b1 at a wavelength of ; this line is emitted by a hydrogen atom whenever its electron makes a transition from the \"n\"=3 to the \"n\"=2 energy level. A wavelength of is in the red part of the spectrum, which causes the chromosphere to have a characteristic reddish colour. \nPhenomena.\nMany different phenomena can be observed in chromospheres.\nPlage.\nA plage is a particularly bright region within stellar chromospheres, which are often associated with magnetic activity.\nSpicules.\nThe most commonly identified feature in the solar chromosphere are spicules. Spicules rise to the top of the chromosphere and then sink back down again over the course of about 10 minutes.\nOscillations.\nSince the first observations with the instrument SUMER on board SOHO, periodic oscillations in the solar chromosphere have been found with a frequency from to , corresponding to a characteristic periodic time of three minutes. Oscillations of the radial component of the plasma velocity are typical of the high chromosphere. The photospheric granulation pattern usually has no oscillations above ; however, higher frequency waves (, or a period) were detected in the solar atmosphere (at temperatures typical of the transition region and corona) by TRACE.\nLoops.\nPlasma loops can be seen at the border of the solar disk in the chromosphere. They are different from solar prominences because they are concentric arches with maximum temperature of the order (too low to be considered coronal features). These cool-temperature loops show an intense variability: they appear and disappear in some UV lines in a time less than an hour, or they rapidly expand in 10\u201320 minutes. Foukal studied these cool loops in detail from the observations taken with the EUV spectrometer on Skylab in 1976. When the plasma temperature of these loops becomes coronal (above ), these features appear more stable and evolve over longer times.\nNetwork.\nImages taken in typical chromospheric lines show the presence of brighter cells, usually referred to as the \"network\", while the surrounding darker regions are named \"internetwork\". They look similar to granules commonly observed on the photosphere due to the heat convection.\nOn other stars.\nChromospheres are present on almost all luminous stars other than white dwarfs. They are most prominent and magnetically active on lower-main sequence stars, on brown dwarfs of F and later spectral types, and on giant and subgiant stars.\nA spectroscopic measure of chromospheric activity on other stars is the Mount Wilson S-index.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It featured adolescent and teenage actors performing in a sketch comedy format similar to America's \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\" and Canada's \"Second City Television\". Each episode had a specific theme, typically relating to the popular culture of the time.\nThe series was produced by and aired on Ottawa's CTV station CJOH-TV. Initially a local program, it was marketed specifically for a North American-wide audience from its third season on. It was staple on the early years of the American cable network Nickelodeon, becoming most famous for introducing the network's iconic green slime. The channel aired reruns through 1994, when they were replaced with the similarly-themed domestic sketch comedy variety program \"All That\". The show was notable for launching the careers of many performers, including alternative rock musician Alanis Morissette, filmmaker Patrick Mills, and television producer and screenwriter Bill Prady.\nThe show is the subject of the 2004 documentary \"You Can't Do That on Film\", directed by David Dillehunt. Filmed in August 2004, the documentary was released in North America by Shout! Factory in 2012 and reissued in 2022 by MVD Entertainment. The film's tour of Studio D at CJOH was the final production made in the original studio, as the space had been sealed for tax purposes by station management. The building was demolished in 2011 following a fire in February 2010.\nThe first 21 half-hour episodes were released on iTunes and Amazon in three volumes, beginning in December 2012, but these volumes are no longer available. In 2021, the first 14 half-hour episodes were made available on Paramount+. Outside of the 1989 \"Worst of You Can't Do That on Television\" VHS from Elektra Video, the series has never been formally released on home media.\nHistory.\nLocal television.\n\"You Can't Do That on Television\" premiered on February 3, 1979, on CJOH-TV in Ottawa. It was a locally produced, one-hour, low-budget variety program with some segments performed live. The show consisted of comedy sketches, music videos, and live phone-in contests in which the viewer could win prizes such as transistor radios, record albums, model kits, etc. The format also included performances by local disco dancers and special guests such as Ottawa-based cartoonist Jim Unger. Each week, the show took its \"roving camera\" to hangouts around town, recording kids' jokes or complaints about life, which were played on the following week's broadcast. The show also benefited from links with popular Top 40 Ottawa radio station CFGO. For example, station personality Jim Johnson emceed the disco-dance segments and shared tidbits about the artists featured in music videos.\nVeteran comedy actor Les Lye played numerous recurring characters and was initially the only adult to perform in the show's sketches. He was the only actor to appear for the entire series' run. Actress Abby Hagyard, who played the maternal character \"Valerie\" opposite Lye's paternal role \"Lance,\" joined the series in 1982. Occasionally, the older children in the cast (including Christine McGlade, Sarah West or Cyndi Kennedy) played adult characters.\nThe show offered programming for children on Saturday mornings that made no attempt to be an educational program. The idea was successful, as (according to one episode) the show scored a 32 share of the ratings for CJOH in its 10:30\u00a0a.m. Saturday time slot. The studio masters for the first-season episodes no longer exist, and all but three of the episodes from the first season were believed lost until early 2013, when copies of the missing episodes from off-air recordings were contributed by Roger Price and posted on YouTube.\nThe format was similar to \"You Must Be Joking!\" and \"You Can't Be Serious\", children's sketch variety shows that Price created and produced for Thames Television in Britain from 1974 to 1978.\nNational television in Canada.\nAfter a successful first season, a national network version of \"You Can't Do That on Television\" entitled Whatever Turns You On was produced for CTV and debuted in September 1979 (its hour-long pilot episode had aired in May). The show's creators shortened it to 30 minutes, removed local content, and added a laugh track. They replaced music videos with live performances from popular Canadian artists including Trooper, Max Webster, Ian Thomas, Ottawa's own Cooper Brothers (one of whose members, Dick Cooper, later became a writer for \"YCDTOTV\") and disco singer Alma Faye Brooks. Ruth Buzzi joined the cast playing many of the adult female characters, including a strict schoolteacher named Miss Fidt and the studio secretary Miss Take. In addition, the 22 children from the first season were trimmed down to seven: Christine McGlade, Lisa Ruddy, Jonothan Gebert, Kevin Somers, Kevin Schenk, Rodney Helal and Marc Baillon. Another first-season cast member, Elizabeth Mitchell, only appeared in the pilot episode. The show was placed in the 7:00\u00a0p.m. timeslot on Tuesday nights, and some CTV affiliates opted not to carry the show, possibly because of concerns about its content. As a result, CTV cancelled the show in December 1979 following poor ratings after only 13 episodes.\nIn January 1981, production on \"YCDTOTV\" resumed, and a new set of episodes aired locally on CJOH through May 1981. The format of the 1981 episodes was similar to that of the inaugural 1979 season, but each episode featured sketches that revolved around a certain topic (something that carried over from \"Whatever Turns You On\"). As disco's popularity had waned, the dancers were replaced by video-game competitions.\nAt that time, Price and Darby tried to syndicate \"YCDTOTV.\" They edited each 1981 episode into a half-hour format similar to that of \"Whatever Turns You On\". Some scenes were reshot to remove any specifically Canadian content, and the half-hour syndicated edits became entirely sketch comedy. The 1981 season was rerun on CJOH in early 1982 in the half-hour syndicated format. To compensate for the removal of local content, Price and Darby created a new local show for CJOH titled \"Something Else\", which featured many of the \"YCDTOTV\" cast in a game show/variety format similar to that of \"The Price Is Right\". The \"YCDTOTV\" team also made a pilot television film for Disney in 1981 titled \"Bear Rapids\" that was never picked up.\nFour of the hour-long CJOH episodes from the 1981 season (\"Strike Now\", \"Sexual Equality\", \"Crime and Vandalism\", and \"Peer Pressure\") are available for public viewing on YouTube. The rest are only currently available in the half-hour edits.\nNickelodeon.\nPeak years.\nIn 1981, the new American youth-oriented cable network Nickelodeon took an interest in \"YCDTOTV\". Nickelodeon originally aired several episodes in the edited half-hour syndicated format as a test run. The response was positive, and in January 1982, Nickelodeon began airing the entire edited season. By 1983, \"YCDTOTV\" was the network's highest-rated show.\nProduction on new episodes of \"YCDTOTV\" resumed full-time in 1982 in the half-hour all-comedy format, with Nickelodeon and CJOH as production partners. Over the next few years, the series was screened nationally in Canada. CTV, the network CJOH-TV was affiliated with, broadcast the show on Saturday mornings between 1982 and 1990, with little publicity. However, \"YCDTOTV\" continued to expand its audience in the United States on Nickelodeon, where it initially aired five times a week and eventually every day. The series gained broader exposure in its native Canada in 1988 when it was added by the newly established youth-oriented YTV cable channel. It was heavily promoted and aired daily during peak viewing hours.\nViewers in the United States were given the opportunity to enter the Slime-In, a contest hosted by Nickelodeon that flew the winner to the set of \"You Can't Do That on Television\" to be slimed. The contest was later replicated by Canada's YTV as the Slime Light Sweepstakes.\nIn 1983 at WGBH-TV in Boston, Massachusetts, Roger Price created a version of \"YCDTOTV\" for American public television network PBS titled \"Don't Look Now\" (originally to be titled \"Don't Tell Your Mother!\"). The show was similar to episodes from the 1979 season of \"YCDTOTV\", including music videos and several earlier \"YCDTOTV\" sketches and motifs (including a variation on the show's trademark green slime gag called \"Yellow Yuck\"). Despite high ratings, the series ended after its five-episode trial run in October 1983, possibly because of complaints from parents about its content. Nickelodeon was also concerned that if \"Don't Look Now\" was successful, it could mean the end of \"YCDTOTV\". The series was believed lost until all five episodes surfaced in early 2013. They have been posted on YouTube, excluding the copyrighted music videos.\nPrice created another show for Nickelodeon in 1985, the less successful \"Turkey Television\". It featured several main cast members of \"YCDTOTV\" including Les Lye, Christine McGlade, Kevin Kubusheskie and Adam Reid. By this time, McGlade, now in her twenties and eager to move on with her life, had moved to Toronto and was flying back to Ottawa for \"YCDTOTV\" taping sessions. \"Turkey Television\" also marked McGlade's debut as a producer, a career that she continued after leaving \"YCDTOTV\" in 1986. Another Price production using \"YCDTOTV\" cast members, \"UFO Kidnapped\", was made in 1983. Although the pilot aired on Nickelodeon, the series was not picked up.\nChanging of the guard and controversies.\nBy 1987, many of the veteran cast members such as Matthew Godfrey, Douglas Ptolemy, Vanessa Lindores and Adam Reid had grown too old for the show. Longtime host Christine McGlade (\"Moose\") had departed the previous year, as had Alasdair Gillis (who had been promoted to co-host with McGlade in 1985 before leaving toward the end of the 1986 season). Lisa Ruddy (\"Motor Mouth\"), McGlade's longtime sidekick on the show, left at the end of the 1985 season. Only five episodes were filmed for the 1987 season, tying with the 1990 season as the shortest during the show's 15-year run.\nThe episode \"Adoption,\" was so controversial that it was banned after being shown twice. A \"DO NOT AIR\" sticker was placed on the master tape at CJOH. \"Adoption\" is the only episode that was banned in the United States. Co-creator Geoffrey Darby has stated that he felt the episode went too far, and that the writers were unaware of the sensitive nature of the material. In Canada, the \"Divorce\" episode was banned. However, the \"Adoption\" episode was shown with edits. In the sketch in which Senator Prevert calls the adoption agency to send his son back after using him to do chores all day, the line in which he calls the adoption agency officer a \"damn bureaucrat\" was excised.\nIn addition, Nickelodeon had removed the half-hour edits of the 1981 episodes of \"You Can't Do That on Television\" from its daily rotation, along with the 1982 \"Cosmetics\" episode. The 1981 episodes were set to air for the last time during a 1985-week-long promotion called \"Oldies but Moldies,\" with contests in which viewers could win prizes such as \"tasty, fresh chocolate syrup\". Instead, the episodes continued to air until the end of 1987, but not often. Reportedly, this was because Nickelodeon's six-year contract to air the 1981 season expired in 1987. As Nickelodeon was beginning to aim for a younger demographic, and many of the 1981 episodes dealt with topics more relevant to teenagers (such as smoking, drugs, sexual equality and peer pressure), the network opted not to renew the contract. Nickelodeon allegedly removed the \"Cosmetics\" episode from rotation for the latter reason (although the \"Addictions\" episode from that same season was not dropped). By contrast, when Canada's YTV began airing the series in 1989, they continued airing the 1981 season as part of the package, as well as \"Whatever Turns You On\", which was never shown in the United States.\nFinal years.\nRoger Price moved to France following production of the 1987 season after being informed that Nickelodeon was not planning to order more episodes. Production was suspended for 1988. When Price eventually returned to Canada, he wanted to resume production of \"You Can't Do That on Television\" from Toronto, but was convinced by the cast and crew to return to Ottawa and CJOH. Nickelodeon ordered more \"YCDTOTV\" episodes for the 1989 season. Auditions were held at CJOH in the spring of 1988, and taping began that fall. Amyas Godfrey and Andrea Byrne were the only child cast members to transition from 1987 to 1989. However, a few minor 1986 cast members returned for episodes, including Rekha Shah and James Tung.\nOpinions regarding the 1989 and 1990 episodes of \"YCDTOTV\" are mixed among longtime fans of the show, particularly regarding the new episodes' increasing reliance on bathroom humor and more slime and water gags (which was supposedly at the request of Nickelodeon executives). The show did not completely sever ties to its past, as many former cast members reappeared during the 1989 season in cameo roles, most notably in the \"Age\" episode, which was hosted by Vanessa Lindores (who was slimed twice during it) and also featured cameos by Doug Ptolemy, Alasdair Gillis, Christine McGlade and Kevin Kubusheskie (who by that time had become a stage producer on the show). Gillis also appeared briefly in the \"locker jokes\" segment during the \"Fantasies\" episode, and Adam Reid, who by this time had become an official writer for \"YCDTOTV\", also appeared (and was slimed) at the very end of the episode \"Punishment.\"\nThe show's ratings declined throughout 1989 and 1990. The network's desire to produce more of its own shows at its new studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, coupled with low ratings, caused production of \"You Can't Do That on Television\" to officially end in 1990 after only five episodes (tying 1990 with 1987 as the shortest season of the series). Though ratings declined, Nickelodeon continued to air reruns until January 1994, at which point it was only aired on weekends.\nOn October 5, 2015, Nickelodeon's sister network TeenNick brought the show back in reruns as the first program on The Splat, its expanded classic-themed block. The airings began with the first two 1981 episodes, \"Work\" and \"Transportation,\" marking the first time that those episodes had aired on American television in 30 years. However, only two additional episodes (\"Christmas\" and \"Holidays\" from the 1984 season) have been aired since. As of March 23, 2021, the 1981 season has been made available to stream on Paramount+.\nInternational airings.\n\"YCDTOTV\" was aired in Australia with great success on ABC Television in the mid-1980s, beginning with 1981's \"Work, Work, Work.\" It aired at 5:30 PM on weekdays until August 1987 when the initial run ended. After its first two runs, it was moved to a 7:00 AM weekday morning timeslot in 1989. It continued to run periodically on ABC Television for the next few years, mainly as a filler during the school holidays until the rights expired in the early 1990s. The show was aired in its entirety, including the final two seasons of 1989\u201390.\nThe series was also seen in European countries and reportedly in countries in the Middle East (with Arabic dubbing), although no French-dubbed version for distribution in either France or countries in the Francophone world is known to exist. Nor were any local adaptations based on the \"YCDTOTV\" format known to have been made.\n\"YCDTOTV\" was also broadcast in several other countries, such as the United Kingdom (on the former satellite and cable children's network The Children's Channel), New Zealand (on TV3), Germany (on Armed Forces Network with the original English audio), Saudi Arabia (on the country's former English-language channel Saudi 2) and the Philippines (on RPN-9).\nParody.\n\"YCDTOTV\" has been occasionally referenced during episodes of \"Robot Chicken\", including some of the show's trademark gags, such as locker jokes, Barth's Burgery and green slime.\nIn the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High\", Peter Griffin is slimed after saying \"I don't know'\". It was followed immediately by a still shot that is a direct reference to \"YCDTOTV\"'s opening sequence, with the words \"You Can't Do That on Television\" written in red over a man's face. A later episode of the series was titled \"You Can't Do That on Television, Peter\", but contained no overt references to \"YCDTOTV\".\nIn the \"NewsRadio\" episode \"The Song Remains the Same\", Mr. James celebrates April Fools' Day (in February) by having Joe install the \"trigger machines\" from \"YCDTOTV\", and then tricks the cast into getting slimed and doused with water.\nThe \"1981\" episode of VH1's \"I Love the '80s 3-D\" features a segment on \"YCDTOTV\" that features Hal Sparks, Alyson Hannigan and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic all getting slimed after being tricked into saying \"I don't know.\" Wil Wheaton is also slimed during the opening credits.\n\"YCDTOTV\" is also loosely parodied in the 2010 \"How I Met Your Mother\" episode \"Glitter\", with Cobie Smulders' character on the Canadian television show \"Space Teens\" making several references to the show. In reality, Smulders grew up a fan of the show.\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" season 47 episode hosted by John Mulaney features a humorous account of how green slime came to be introduced to \"YCDTOTV\" and ultimately Nickelodeon.\nReunion.\nIn July 2004, to celebrate the program's 25th anniversary, a reunion special called \"Project 131\" with the theme \"Changes\" was produced at CJOH-TV starring five members of the original cast. These included Brodie Osome, Marjorie Silcoff, and Vanessa Lindores (visibly pregnant at the time), Justin Cammy and Alasdair Gillis. It was directed by David Dillehunt.\nProposed reboot.\nIn August 2017, it was announced that \"You Can't Do That on Television\" would be getting a reboot. Original creator Roger Price would serve as executive producer, while Jimmy Fox of Main Event Media would develop the project. However, Fox stated on their Twitter account on September 14, 2019, that the reboot had been called off.\nTrademarks.\nThe show's comedy centered around how kids are treated by adults and the rest of the world. The show's skits gave satirical and exaggerated views of grown-ups as clueless, out of touch, and often using their status as adults to take advantage of kids. Les Lye portrayed several characters in the recurring skits, including \"Ross\", the technical producer and director of the show who constantly cheated and swindled money from everyone, especially the kid actors; \"Barth\", a cook at the fast-food burger place who cooked terrible food for the kids; and the father Lance Prevert, who tried to raise his kids but was utterly clueless about what his kids were doing. The younger characters, meanwhile, differed from other kids' TV shows in the way they often bickered and insulted one another (in their character roles), rather than getting along and enjoying their time together as seen on most other shows for children. Hosts Christine and Alanis frequently insulted each other and each tried to outdo the other in their roles, reflecting the real-life rivalries and competition taking place among kids in everyday life.\nEpisodes of \"YCDTOTV\" included recurring gimmicks and gags. The following is a partial list.\nOpening animation: the Children's Television Sausage Factory.\nOriginally created by Rand MacIvor (under art director John C. Galt), who was inspired by Terry Gilliam's \"gilliamations,\" the opening animation sequence was a sequence of surreal images set to Rossini's \"William Tell Overture\" performed in a Dixieland jazz arrangement by the National Press Club and Allied Workers Jazz Band. Though the arrangement of the theme music stayed the same throughout the entire series run (although there are subtle differences between the themes in various seasons \u2013 especially the closing themes \u2013 and \"Whatever Turns You On\" used a completely different theme song), the opening animation itself changed in different ways.\nPreempted show Intro.\nStarting in season two before the intro, there was usually a title card with a gag show that was \"preempted\" with the announcer Les Lye introducing it (ex: \"Mr. T Thinks He's A Girl will not be seen today, so that we may present a show still trying to find itself.\"\u2014Episode: \"Identity Crisis\"). A lot of 1980s cultural references were used at the time (The A-Team, General Hospital, Rambo, Mister Rogers Neighborhood etc.). Sometimes, the show \"itself\" was preempted (which happened three times). On the episode \"Failure\", they \"failed\" to come up with an intro. Another episode, titled \"Inequalities,\" began with a disclaimer that read, \"The following program contains certain scenes which may not be suitable for mature audiences, Juvenile discretion is advised\" in lieu of a \"pre-empted\" show.\nOpposites.\nEach episode had an \"opposites\" segment (\"Opposite Skits, where the opposite of real life really happens\"), introduced by a visual effect of the screen flipping upside down, shifting left to fade to the next sketch, and then righting itself. Typically, right before this happened, one or more cast members would be interrupted by another cast member saying the opposite of what the monologue (or dialogue) was about, at which the cast would say, \"It must be the introduction to the opposites\", and then the inversion fade would happen. The sketches that followed were a tongue-in-cheek reversal of the show's subject and of daily life, often featuring children having authority over adults or adults encouraging children to behave badly (for example, eating sweets instead of vegetables or wasting money on something frivolous rather than putting the money in the bank).\nSome \"opposites\" features were reversals of the roles and gags related to the show's recurring characters (usually played by Les Lye or Abby Hagyard), such as the cast getting to execute El Captaino at the firing squad or torturing Nasti the dungeon keeper. Inverse tropes related to Mr. Schitdler in the classroom and the principal in detention were also frequent; however, very rarely would an opposite feature the kids getting their revenge on Barth.\nA return to the show's daily subject was indicated by another inversion fade, sometimes accompanied by one of the cast members saying, \"back to reality.\" These would occasionally occur in the middle of a sketch, resulting in the characters inverting whatever they were doing prior to the conclusion of the sketch.\nOpposite sketches were used in the inaugural season of the show (the first one, in Episode 2, was submitted by a viewer), but it was not until \"Whatever Turns You On\" that they became an integral part of the show.\nFiring squad.\nMost episodes, starting in 1981, included one or more firing-squad sketches in which Lye played El Capitano, a Latin American military officer preparing to order a firing squad (whom he addressed as \"the amigos\") to execute one of the child actors tied up standing in front of a firing post. The kid would often trick El Capitano into being shot by the firing squad himself, and, as he keeled over, El Capitano would groan \"That is one sneaky keed.\"\nBarth's Burgers.\nStarting with the 1981 season, most episodes featured sketches with the kids eating at Barth's Burgery, a fast-food burger restaurant run by Barth (Lye), a chain-smoking, unpleasant, disgusting cook who uses unsanitary and questionable methods of cooking burgers. Most of the sketches involve Barth revealing the contents of the burgers to the kids' disgust and them remarking \"Who(or What) do you think is in the burgers\". Barth's trademark catchphrase is \"Duh, I heard that!\" or on one episode \"Duh, I heard thee.\".\nIn the 1981 and 1982 seasons, Barth had a worker, Zilch (played by Darryll Lucas), whom he frequently insulted and abused, often by hitting him with a pan and knocking him out cold.\nLocker jokes.\nDuring the \"locker jokes\" segment of each episode, cast members, standing inside school lockers with the words \"You Can't Do That on Television\" painted on them, told jokes to each other. The person telling the joke would open his or her locker and call another cast member, to whom he or she would tell the joke. For the duration of the joke, those cast members would be the only ones seen with open lockers. After each joke, the actors would close their lockers, allowing the process to start again with different people and a new joke. This was similar to the \"joke wall\" segment on \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In.\" The \"locker jokes\" feature was introduced in the first season and continued until the end of the series. The lockers underwent minor makeovers during the show's early years, but mostly remained the same for the entire run of the show. In 2004, when fans and cast reunited for the show's 25th anniversary, the original lockers were auctioned.\nProduction bumper.\nUsed in a few episodes in the first two seasons and by almost every episode in later seasons, the closing credits of \"You Can't Do That on Television\" are followed by an announcement of the \"company\" that produced the program, with the name generally tying in with the episode's main subject. These announcements are given in the form of \"'You Can't Do That on Television' is a ______ production.\" Examples of the fictional production company include \"Black Eye\" (\"Bullying\"), \"Can't Give It Away\" (\"Marketing\"), \"Split Down the Middle\" (\"Divorce\"), \"Hang Out to Dry\" (\"Malls\") and \"Blood Is Thicker Than Water\" (\"Families\"). The production company's name was announced by Lye, who often included a joke about the show or its producers only to realize that the cameras were still rolling.\nPost-credit scene.\nThe post-credit production bumper was generally followed by one final sketch, also borrowing a concept from \"Laugh-In\", in which the jokes continued for a time after the credits finished rolling. The bumper frequently took place \"backstage\" and broke the fourth wall with remarks about the episode, usually featuring one final humiliation or comeuppance for that episode's main cast member. These scenes were often cut short or removed altogether, especially for airings on Nickelodeon.\nOther.\nOther signature recurring bits on the show include:\nWater, slime and pies.\nAffectionately called \"stage pollution\" by the cast and crew, certain keywords resulted in cast members having unpleasant substances poured onto them from above, or thrown at them from off camera.\nWater.\nWhen someone said the word \"water\", \"wash\" or \"wet\", a large amount of cold water would fall onto them from above. In the earlier years of the show, cast members (especially Christine) were doused pails of water, but starting in 1981, the water would fall from above. By the 1984 season, only the word \"water\" led to a dousing, whereas in earlier seasons, the words \"wet\" and \"H2O\" also did. On occasion, cast members tried to dodge the water by saying \"agua\" (Spanish), \"Wasser\" (German) or \"eau\" (French) instead, only to be soaked anyway. In one episode, characters rehearse a sketch in a made-up foreign language; one of the made-up words is \"pingle-ding\" which apparently means \"water\", as the kid who says \"pingle-ding\" gets drenched (twice).\nWhile the show's green slime changed ingredients and even consistencies, frequently, the water was almost always the same. Occasionally, cast members were doused with variations such as soapy, hot, brown, toilet, or yellow polluted water.\nSlime.\nWhen someone said, \"I don't know,\" green slime would pour down on them from above. This type of prank was known as being \"slimed,\" and it became one of the show's most notable elements. As with waterings, the sliming gag was used in almost every episode, especially from 1982 onward. According to writer-director Geoffrey Darby, the slime gave the kids a \"comeuppance\", so that they wouldn't appear arrogant.\nGreen slime was a fixture of the series from the very beginning, appearing in the show's first episode. In the book \"Slimed! An Oral History of Nickelodeon's Golden Age\", Darby stated that the original slime developed \"by accident\"; Darby had originally planned for a bucket of food leftovers from the CJOH cafeteria, with water added, to be dumped on cast member Tim Douglas, but the production of that first episode was delayed by a week. When the time came to shoot the scene, the contents of the bucket had turned green with mold. Darby authorized the mixture to be dumped on Douglas anyway. Roger Price was furious, but the response from the viewing audience was positive, so Darby and Price wrote an entire 1979 show about the slime which fittingly aired on March 17, 1979, St. Patrick's Day (\"The Green Slime Show\"). In that episode, cast member Lisa Ruddy became the victim of six slimings (a \"YCDTOTV\" record). With that episode, the use of \"I don't know\" as the slime's trigger phrase was introduced, and it quickly became the show's trademark gag.\nMost of the cast did not like getting slimed (Christine McGlade said it was \"gross and challenging\"), and on occasion, they tried to avoid saying \"I don't know.\" This usually backfired, as in the \"Computers\" episode when McGlade said \"insufficient data\" instead of \"I don't know\" and got green slime dumped on her anyway, since, as it was explained by Lisa Ruddy who was with McGlade at the time, the slime for that episode was computer-controlled. Some variations of the magic words also triggered the slime, such as in the \"Blame\" episode when the entire cast got slimed together after one of them said, \"we don't know.\"\nAlthough the slime was usually green, other colors, such as red, blue, yellow and even black and white, were occasionally used. 1981's \"Safety First\" episode, which featured white slime as part of a recurring joke in about \"wearing white at night,\" was the first episode known to have used a slime color other than green. Lisa got slimed with white slime after saying \"I really don't know\". In the 1982 episode \"Television,\" Christine is slimed in green, red, blue, yellow and \"stripes\" (green, red, blue and yellow at once) while trying to explain about green slime to newcomer Vanessa Lindores. (McGlade had the slime washed out by mentioning to Vanessa that it usually comes out with water, and then got dumped on with water.) This sketch was later seen in the opening to the 1987 thriller film \"Fatal Attraction\". In one of the show's crueler pranks, Ross (Les Lye) tricks Christine into getting dumped with a thicker, chunkier blue slime. The 1986 \"Enemies and Paranoia\" episode used the word \"freedom\" as a trigger phrase for red slime after the studio was taken over by Russian communists. Other instances of slime colors other than green include orange slime in the \"Myths\" episode, brown slime in the \"Cosmetics\" episode and black slime in the \"Time\" episode.\nThe recipe for green slime originally consisted of rotten food. However, after continued complaints from the cast about the hazardous ingredients, the recipe was changed to a mixture of lime-green gelatin powder, oatmeal and water. Eventually baby shampoo was added so that it the slime would wash out of the actors' hair more easily after several of the female cast members complained. In the \"Television\" episode, Christine reveals the ingredients as water, gelatin powder, flour and soap. In later years, the recipe consisted simply of green food coloring and cottage cheese, though it spoiled if left too long under hot studio lights.\nEspecially in the later years of the show, cast members who were slimed frequently looked upward into the slime as it was falling so that it covered their faces (the same was also true of the waterings). To avoid damage to the set from water or slime, a clear tarpaulin was laid on the floor, which can occasionally be seen and/or heard underneath the actors, and the loud splatter sound usually heard during a watering or sliming is that of the liquid hitting the tarpaulin. Actors to be slimed or soaked usually appeared barefoot in the scene, and several cast members who were slimed were reportedly paid extra. Scenes involving slimings were the final ones taped during a recording, allowing the actors to immediately rinse after the scene without causing delays.\nGreen slime grew to become a trademark image for Nickelodeon, and the network demanded more slimings on the show as the years went on, resulting in episodes such as 1985's \"Movies\" in which the entire cast (save for Abby Hagyard) is slimed. Nickelodeon later introduced green slime shampoo, which was a frequent parting gift on its game show \"Double Dare\", on which slime was heavily used. Mattel sold Nickelodeon slime and the Gak brand in the 1990s. Slime was also frequently used in the network's advertisements featuring \"YCDTOTV\" cast members as victims of an impromptu sliming. Nickelodeon's former studios in Orlando had a green slime geyser. The network continues to use green slime during its annual Kids' Choice Awards and coverage of the National Football League.\nPies.\nThe original slapstick pie-in-the-face gag was also frequently used on \"YCDTOTV\", although pie scenes were most common during the early years of the show. One whole episode, 1981's \"Drugs\", was constructed completely around the pie-in-the-face gag. To avoid the wrath of the censors, the episode showed the cast getting \"high\" by pieing themselves continuously, comparing the stupidity of hitting oneself with a pie to that of taking drugs. Unlike the slime and water, pies were not usually triggered by any certain word or trigger phrase, although in the earlier years, saying \"let me have it\" or \"give it to me\" would frequently result in a pieing.\nCast.\nApart from the central cast as Les Lye and Abby Hagyard, who played the adult character roles, over 100 pre-teen and teenage actors appeared on \"YCDTOTV\" between 1979 and 1990. Some of the most notable cast members included:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54666", "revid": "44383382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54666", "title": "Anonymous remailer", "text": "Computer server that forwards messages with varying degrees of privacy\nA privacy-focused remailer is a server that receives messages with embedded instructions on where to send them next, and that forwards them while attempting to obscure their origin. There are cypherpunk remailers, mixmaster remailers, and nym servers, among others, which differ in their design and the level of privacy they were intended to provide. It is critical to understand that without integration with an anonymity network like Tor, these systems do not provide anonymity against powerful adversaries. \"Remailing\" as discussed in this article applies to e-mails intended for particular recipients, not the general public. Anonymity in the latter case is more easily addressed by using any of several methods of anonymous publication.\nTypes of remailers.\nThere are several strategies that affect the pseudonymity of the handled e-mail. These classes of remailers differ with regard to the choices their designers/operators have made. These choices can be influenced by the legal ramifications of operating specific types of remailers.\nIt must be understood that every data packet traveling on the Internet contains the node addresses (as raw IP bit strings) of both the sending and intended recipient nodes, and so no data packet can \"ever\" actually be anonymous at this level . In addition, all standards-based e-mail messages contain defined fields in their headers in which the source and transmitting entities (and Internet nodes as well) are required to be included.\nSome remailers change both types of address in messages they forward, and the list of forwarding nodes in e-mail messages as well, as the message passes through; in effect, they substitute 'fake source addresses' for the originals. The 'IP source address' for that packet may become that of the remailer server itself, and within an e-mail message (which is usually several packets), a nominal 'user' on that server. Some remailers forward their anonymized e-mail to still other remailers, and only after several such hops is the e-mail actually delivered to the intended address.\nThere are, more or less, four types of remailers:\nPseudonymous remailers.\nA pseudonymous remailer simply takes away the e-mail address of the sender, gives a pseudonym to the sender, and sends the message to the intended recipient (that can be answered via that remailer).\nCypherpunk remailers.\nA Cypherpunk remailer sends the message to the recipient, stripping away the sender address on it. One can not answer a message sent via a Cypherpunk remailer. The message sent to the remailer can usually be encrypted, and the remailer will decrypt it and send it to the recipient address hidden inside the encrypted message. In addition, it is possible to chain two or three remailers, so that each remailer can't know who is sending a message to whom. Cypherpunk remailers typically do not keep logs of transactions, but their design is vulnerable to traffic analysis.\nMixmaster remailers.\nIn Mixmaster, the user composes an email to a remailer, which is relayed through each node in the network using SMTP, until it finally arrives at the final recipient. Mixmaster can only send emails one way. An email is sent pseudonymously to an individual, but for them to be able to respond, a reply address must be included in the body of the email. Also, Mixmaster remailers require the use of a computer program to write messages. Such programs are not supplied as a standard part of most operating systems or mail management systems. Mixmaster is vulnerable to long-term traffic analysis and is considered obsolete.\nMixminion remailers.\nA Mixminion remailer attempts to address the following challenges in Mixmaster remailers: replies, forward anonymity, replay prevention and key rotation, exit policies, integrated directory servers and dummy traffic. They are currently available for the Linux and Windows platforms. Some implementations are open source. Despite improvements, Mixminion shares the fundamental vulnerability to traffic analysis and requires protection by a network like Tor for meaningful anonymity.\nTraceable remailers.\nSome remailers establish an internal list of actual senders and invented names such that a recipient can send mail to \"invented name\" AT \"some-remailer.example\". When receiving traffic addressed to this user, the server software consults that list, and forwards the mail to the original sender, thus permitting anonymous\u2014though traceable with access to the list\u2014two-way communication. The famous \"penet.fi\" remailer in Finland did just that for several years. Because of the existence of such lists in this type of remailing server, it is possible to break the anonymity by gaining access to the list(s), by breaking into the computer, asking a court (or merely the police in some places) to order that the anonymity be broken, and/or bribing an attendant. This happened to penet.fi as a result of some traffic passed through it about Scientology. The Church claimed copyright infringement and sued penet.fi's operator. A court ordered the list be made available. Penet's operator shut it down after destroying its records (including the list) to retain identity confidentiality for its users; though not before being forced to supply the court with the real e-mail addresses of two of its users.\nMore recent remailer designs use cryptography in an attempt to provide more or less the same service, but without so much risk of loss of user confidentiality. These are generally termed nym servers or pseudonymous remailers. The degree to which they remain vulnerable to forced disclosure (by courts or police) is and will remain unclear since new statutes/regulations and new cryptanalytic developments proceed apace. Multiple anonymous forwarding among cooperating remailers in different jurisdictions may retain, but cannot guarantee, anonymity against a determined attempt by one or more governments, or civil litigators.\nModern Tor-based and Mixnet alternatives.\nDue to the inherent vulnerabilities of classical remailers to traffic correlation and metadata surveillance, the modern approach to anonymous email relies on integrating remailer functionality with robust anonymity networks.\nTor-based remailers: Systems like the Onion Courier Mixnet operate as Tor hidden services. This protects the user's IP address and the remailer's location from network observers. While Tor provides strong protection for network metadata, the mix nodes are adding additional layers of anonymity per hop.\nMixnet-based remailers: The Nym network is designed specifically to resist powerful traffic analysis attacks that threaten older remailers and even Tor in some scenarios. Nym uses a layered mixnet architecture with cover traffic to provide strong anonymity for message timing and metadata. Future anonymous email systems are likely to be built directly on top of mixnets like Nym to provide anonymity against nation-state adversaries.\nFor any meaningful anonymity, the use of such an integrated network is now considered essential; standalone classical remailers do not provide adequate security.\nWeb-based mailer.\nThere are also web services that allow users to send anonymous email messages. These services typically do not provide the strong pseudonymity of cryptographic remailers, let alone anonymity, and they are often easier to use. When using a web-based anonymous email service, its reputation and privacy policy should first be analyzed carefully, since the service stands between senders and recipients. Many such services log the users IP addresses; others may offer superior privacy but still require trust in the operator.\nRemailer statistics.\nIn most cases, remailers are owned and operated by individuals, and are not as stable as they might ideally be. In fact, remailers can, and have, gone down without warning. It is important to use up-to-date statistics, such as those provided by SEC3 when choosing remailers.\nRemailer abuse and blocking by governments.\nWhile most remailers are used responsibly, their pseudonymity has been exploited for illegal activities. A prominent example is the 2012 University of Pittsburgh bomb threats, where an Anonymous-linked remailer was seized by the FBI after being used to send over 100 threatening emails.\nSome remailers disclaim responsibility for abuse, citing technical and ethical limitations that prevent operators from identifying users. Others argue that monitoring for certain abuses would itself be illegal under privacy laws.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nhttp://\n\"Email Security\", Bruce Schneier ()\n\"Computer Privacy Handbook\", Andre Bacard ()"}

He made his appearance in the first issue which was dated 4\u00a0December 1937 and became the magazine's mascot. He is apparently the world's strongest man, able to lift a cow with one hand. The pillow of his (reinforced) bed is filled with building rubble and his beard is so tough he shaves with a blowtorch.\nThe character was created by Dudley D. Watkins, originally as an outlaw or \u2018desperado\u2019 (hence his name), but evolved into a more sympathetic type, using his strength to help the underdog. After Watkins\u2019 death in 1969, the cartoons were drawn by many other artists, principally Ken H. Harrison, though the Watkins canon was often recycled. When the Dandy became digital-only in 2012, the \"Desperate Dan\" strips were drawn by David Parkins.\nThere is a statue of Dan in Dundee, Scotland, where his publishers, D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. are based.\nHistory.\nThe strip was drawn by Dudley D. Watkins until his death in 1969. Although \"The Dandy Annual\"s featured new strips from other artists from then on, the comic continued reprinting Watkins strips until 1983 (though the then Korky the Cat artist Charles Grigg drew new strips for annuals and summer specials), when it was decided to start running new strips. These were initially drawn by Peter Davidson, but Ken H. Harrison soon took over as regular artist. The following year Dan was promoted to the front cover of \"The Dandy\", replacing Korky who had been there since issue 1. In 1993\u20131994, Ladybird Books published two \"Desperate Dan\" books, \"Desperate Dan and the Cactusman\" and \"Desperate Dan: Diamond Disaster\", which were also released on cassette, read by Tony Robinson. Starting from issue 2985, dated 6 February 1999, Cuddles and Dimples replaced Dan on the front cover. This did not last long, however, as after a readers' poll in 2000, Dan returned to the cover. Although Ken Harrison was the main artist from 1983 to 2007, other artists have also occasionally filled in for Harrison, including Tom Williams, David Parkins, Trevor Metcalfe and Anthony Caluori in the early 1990s. John Geering took over the strip between 1994 and 1997, after which Harrison returned as full-time artist (though Steve Bright occasionally acted as a ghost artist as well). When \"The Dandy\" was redesigned and renamed \"Dandy Xtreme\", the writers used reprints of the old comic strips, until Jamie Smart took over drawing and writing the \"Desperate Dan\" comic strips in April 2008. In May 2025, a \"The Dandy\" Summer Special was published, featuring Smart's \"Desperate Dan\" strips.\nDesperate Dan's final appearance left his fate ambiguous after being caught in an oil well explosion.\nCharacteristics.\nDesperate Dan's favourite food is cow pie \u2013 a type of enormous meat pie with the horns sticking out, although the term \"cow pie\" has a different meaning in the American West. Much like Popeye with his spinach, Desperate Dan draws his immense power from eating these pies. Desperate Dan was voted the UK's second favourite superhero after Batman in 2011.\nInitially Dan was a desperado on the wrong side of the law, hence the name \"Desperate\" Dan. Later on, however, he switched sides and become a friendlier character, helping the underdog, although sometimes his great strength caused more harm than good. The first member of his family to appear in the strip was Aunt Aggie (issue 107, dated 16 December 1939) followed by his nephew, Danny (issue 304, dated 27 October 1945) and niece, Katey in 1957. In 2001, Desperate Dan's girlfriend Little Bear, an Indian squaw, was introduced, but she disappeared with the 2004 \"Dandy\" relaunch, when Dan's artwork style changed.\nModernisation.\nWith the first revamp of \"The Dandy\" (from issue 3282, 16 October 2004) Dan, though still drawn by Ken Harrison, was redesigned slightly. His eyes and chin became much bigger and exaggerated. Dan's personality was changed to that of a bumbling fool, a change to which many fans objected. He was originally going to be left out of the revamped issues, but focus group tests objected to his absence.\nBut, as of the \"re-revamp\" in August 2007, the strips became classic reprints on the back cover of Dandy Comix in \"The Dandy Xtreme\". While the first few issues ran them in the original monochrome, they have since been run in coloured form, all reprints were adopted from the 1997 \"Legend of Desperate Dan\" book which was released to celebrate his 60th anniversary. For the \"MegaComix Special\" in February 2008, there were two \"Desperate Dan\" strips. One was the usual Dudley Watkins reprint, the other was a brand new one by Jamie Smart, who later became Dan's artist and writer for 12 issues in April 2008. The MegaComix Special also featured a guide to drawing by Smart, which showed how he drew the \"Desperate Dan\" strip (which was over the page). This didn't actually feature, nor did the comic strip, inside the Comix pullout.\nLater, in early April 2008, Smart took over writing and illustrating the \"Desperate Dan\" comic strips, and changed Dan's personality into a big hearted dope who was constantly getting into trouble because of his fantastic strength. Zeke's personality was also changed into a person who loved 're-refried beans'. Danny and Katey also disappeared.\nA number of spin-off strips have appeared in \"The Dandy\" over the years, including Desperate Dawg in the 1970s and 80s, Danny and Katey in the late 1980s and Aunt Aggie in the 2000s (before the 2004 relaunch). A statue of him (and his dog Dawg) can be found in the High Street of Dundee, Scotland, where \"The Dandy\" publisher D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. is based. According to the writer Norman Watson, the Desperate Dan statue (erected as part of the Dundee Public Art Programme) is the most photographed of 120 pieces of public art in the city.\nDigital Dandy.\nAfter the print \"Dandy\" ended with its 75th anniversary issue (for which Ken H. Harrison returned to draw one final strip, reverting to the art style he had employed during the 1980s and 1990s), \"The Dandy\" relaunched as a digital comic. David Parkins returned to DC Thomson to draw Desperate Dan with Dan's previous artist, Jamie Smart, drawing a relaunch of \"The Numskulls\" from \"The Beezer\".\nNotes.\nAs with many well-known characters, the name and image of Desperate Dan have been borrowed in many contexts. A limited selection is mentioned here.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54670", "revid": "937257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54670", "title": "The Bash Street Kids", "text": "British comic strip series\nThe Bash Street Kids is a comic strip in the British comic magazine \"The Beano\". It also appeared briefly in The Wizard as series of prose stories in 1955. The strip, created by Leo Baxendale as When the Bell Rings!, first appeared in issue 604. It became \"The Bash Street Kids\" in 1956 and has become a regular feature, appearing in every issue. From 1962, until his death in 2023, David Sutherland drew over 3000 strips in his time as illustrator.\nHistory.\nLike many long-running UK comic strips, \"The Bash Street Kids\" is mostly frozen in the era when it began in 1954. It portrays Class 2B of the Bash Street School in Beanotown, where the teacher and headmaster wear gowns and the pupils sit at wood desks with inkwells. They are taught by a stereotypical \"Teacher\", whose wife is \"Mrs Teacher\". The characters were inspired by the view from the D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. office windows, overlooking the High School of Dundee playground. According to Leo Baxendale, \"In fact, the catalyst for my creation of Bash Street was a Giles cartoon of January 1953: kids pouring out of school, heads flying off and sundry mayhems. Straight away, I pencilled a drawing of 'The Kids of Bash Street School' and posted it from my home in Preston to R. D. Low, the managing editor of D.C. Thomson's children's publications in Dundee. I received an offhand response, a dampener. It was only after I'd created Little Plum (April 1953) and Minnie the Minx (September 1953) that the Beano editor George Moonie travelled to Preston on 20 October 1953 and asked me to go ahead with Bash Street (he gave it the provisional title of 'When The Bell Goes'; when it appeared in The Beano in February 1954, it was titled 'When The Bell Rings').\" Over time, the Bash Street School's large number of pupils slowly shrank to its trademark ten. When they first appeared, the strips consisted of the kids outside school; the settings were increasingly inside the school, and the strip was retitled \"The Bash Street Kids\" on 11 November 1956 with \"the kids\" preparing for a pantomime.\nIn 1994 (the Kids' 40th anniversary), it was announced that \"The Bash Street Kids\" would be overhauled to appeal to a more politically correct, modern audience. Changes included the replacement of Danny's trademark school hat by a top hat, Fatty becoming fit and muscular and Tom-boy Toots acting more feminine. The school would be replaced by a technologically advanced \"academy\", and Teacher by a robot. A protest began, accompanied by petitions and publicity stunts throughout Britain, demanding that the characters remain the same. The proposal turned out to be a hoax when the story introducing the new Bash Street Kids saw them in their old ways. Editor Euan Kerr was pleased with the fan response, saying that the publication \"even got death threats!\" Shortly afterwards, an animated adaptation was produced as a segment of \"The Beano Video Stars\".\nBy 2000 \"The Bash Street Kids\" was a feature-length strip, filling an entire \"Beano\" book. Often drawn by Mike Pearce and Kev F. Sutherland, during the late 2000s the strips moved to \"Beano\" sister publication \"BeanoMAX\" (where they were drawn by Nigel Parkinson). These feature-length strips were more detailed, delving into an obscure character's personality and introducing new traits. Spotty was revealed as sarcastic and aggressive, while Plug was a more sympathetic, emotional character. The strips detailed a rivalry between the kids and the comic's cover star, Dennis the Menace. Mike Pearce soon began penciling a spin-off from the original strip, \"The Bash Street Kids \u2013 Singled Out\", a single-page comic concentrating on one \"kid\" a week. Pearce retired, the strips were taken over by Tom Paterson before being mothballed and they were later collected into two annuals.\nAs Dennis the Menace was revamped, he appeared less with other \"Beano\" characters and more by himself due to the popularity of his new TV series. \"The Bash Street Kids\" now has three spin-offs: \"Simply Smiffy\", \"Winston\" and \"The Bash Street Burp\". In the July 2013 75th-birthday edition of \"The Beano\", a lane near Dundee's West Marketgait was named Bash Street; whereas an anniversary strip showed Bash Street School being destroyed; the characters relocated to Beano High.\nIn May 2021, the character \"Fatty\" was renamed \"Freddy\", in an attempt to stop children using the name as an insult for overweight peers. The character \"Spotty\" was renamed \"Scotty\" in December 2021.\nIn June 2021, two new characters, Harsha and Mandi, were introduced to the strip. Harsha already appeared in another strip, Har Har's Joke Shop, which is about her family and the joke shop her father Hari \"Har Har\" Chandra owns. Mandi previously had her own occasional strip that dealt with mental health issues to promote the charity YoungMinds, and as such her main trait is that she worries about things.\nIn June 2022, three more characters, Stevie, Khadija, and Mahira, were introduced to the strip. All three had their own strips prior to their addition. In addition, Cuthbert was given more of a spotlight from this point onwards, as he only showed up in the strip on different occasions throughout the year.\nClass 2B.\nThe strip features Class 2B, which contains fifteen pupils.\nDanny.\nDaniel Deathshead \"Danny\" Morgan, was the first identified member of the roguish members of Class 2B, first appearing in the comic strip's debut and becoming the leader after he gave each kid a wine gum. Danny often devises the kids' pranks and escape routes from school. Although he is clever he does poorly in school, primarily due to his laziness and short attention span. Danny is often described as having the \"soul of a pirate\", the reason he gets caught up in rebellious schemes and boisterous activities. Like most of the other characters he is usually rude to adults, once asking Smiffy to speak up because he couldn't hear him over Teacher. In later strips Danny has some respect for Teacher, often helping him out of trouble. Although he hates school, like the other children he found it hard to cope when the Bash Street School was closed. As the leader Danny is prone to conceit, and in the 2006 \"Beano\" annual he announces that his conker is indestructible in a competition. His swelled head is often deflated by a fellow student. In the present, Danny usually wears a skull and crossbones jumper and a floppy red school cap.\nDanny seems especially close to Toots, calling her his second-in-command, and is most annoyed by Smiffy's stupidity and Spotty's sarcasm. He occasionally enjoys making fun of Plug's looks and Fatty's weight. Danny has an intense rivalry with Dennis the Menace, highlighted in a strip where the two compete to find a treasure under The O2 Arena and ending with Danny outwitting Dennis; they often argue in crossover strips. Although Danny also dislikes Roger the Dodger (although he is willing to use him) and Minnie the Minx, their rivalries are not as intense and he once had a crush on Minnie. He is a central character in \"The Beano Interactive DVD\" with Dennis, Gnasher, Minnie the Minx and Roger the Dodger.\n'Erbert.\nHerbert Henry \"'Erbert\" Hoover is a short-sighted boy who struggles to see even with his spectacles, first appearing in issue 696. 'Erbert is considered the least-mischievous student, Beano Top Trumps \u2013 Erbert is least menacing of all Bash Street Kids and is said to resemble a human mole. Except for Cuthbert, the rest of the class have fun swapping his thick-rimmed glasses with others and seeing the resultant mayhem. In older strips, the character is sometimes called Herbert instead of 'Erbert. His short-sightedness is shared by his parents, who have ended up in different parts of town on many parents' evenings.\nFeature-length strips and crossovers brand most of 'Erbert's mischief as accidental or the result of misdirection. During an escape, 'Erbert is usually bumping into a wall or running in the opposite direction. His short-sightedness is renowned; in \"The Beano Annual 2000\" the characters take a cruise to Perth, only to reach shore at Perth, Scotland. When they go to the captain's quarters, they discover that 'Erbert has put himself in charge of the ship.\nAlthough he is quiet and friendly, 'Erbert can wreak as much havoc as his classmates. He is a source of entertainment for the others; Sidney and Spotty once send him into a field full of cow pats, with misleading directions for getting out. Despite this, they consider him \"one of the kids\". When he moves to the Bash Street Academy 'Erbert receives contact lenses to improve his sight, discarding them when he returns to his old school.\nHis full name is a reference to former United States president Herbert Hoover.\nFreddy.\nFrederick Joseph \"Freddy\" Brown first appeared in issue 607. He is a large, round boy who is always eating, only in later strips is he ridiculed for his weight; he usually reacts by trying to prove the others wrong, but earlier he is indifferent. When Danny tricks Freddy into completing a long assault course to prove his fitness, he breaks the equipment. Although he is usually the only student able to eat school cook Olive's meals without incident, in the 2009 annual her curry makes him ill. Freddy has several stories about him in the Beano Library series. In the academy makeover, he has slimmed down, but regains his former girth after being freed from brainwashing.\nOriginally, Freddy was named \"Fatty\", but he was renamed in 2021 to prevent the old name from being used to taunt overweight children.\nPlug.\nPercival Proudfoot \"Plug\" Plugsley first appeared in issue 606. He is a lanky, gangling character with a large overbite, protruding ears, two buck teeth and a wide nose. On the cover of \"Plug\" his name is given as Percival Proudfoot Plugsey, although in some earlier strips he is named Claude. Plug's real name is only occasionally used in \"The Beano\", such as in \"Singled Out\" when Teacher addresses him by his full name. He is originally known as Pug; according to \"The Beano\", the \"l\" was added when Smiffy had one to spare after misspelling \"silly\".\nDespite, or perhaps because of his appearance Plug is one of the more sympathetic Bash Street Kids, often ready to defend those he feels have been unjustly treated; he once calms Danny down after he loses patience with Smiffy's stupidity. He has on one occasion fainted from seeing his own reflection (after polishing the handles of Teacher's bicycle), and considers himself the most handsome boy in Beanotown.\nPlug had his own comic from 1977 to 1979 featuring him and his two pets (Pug from Pup Parade and Chunkee the Monkey), and was the first Beano character with a spin-off. \"Plug\" was later incorporated into \"The Beezer\".\nHe has two sisters, Plugella and Plugena, who closely resemble him. However, in earlier strips his father was shown to be quite handsome (to the confusion of the other kids) and Plug is described as taking after his mother in appearance. In the September 2014 issue of \"The Beano\" he is described as Jonah's nephew, implying that he is the son of Jonah's sister Jinx.\nWith Kev F. Sutherland, Plug had a more dominant role and was frequently a story's main character. In one he has a girlfriend, making him the first Beano character (except for Walter) to do so.\nAlthough Plug received plastic surgery for the Bash Street Academy makeover, he soon returned to his familiar appearance. When he sees his friends brainwashed into behaving, he saves them by installing a virus on the robot teacher's disc drive.\nToots.\nToots Pye , whose real name is Sydney Kate Pye, was until May 2021 the only girl in Class 2B. Although she is a tomboy, she does have some feminine interests. One of her biggest interests is football, and has been shown to be better than all of the boys in her class at it, even when she is against all of them. She is also a fan of boy bands and has admitted a crush on Dennis the Menace, sending him a valentine. Although most of the kids dislike Dennis, her friendship with Minnie the Minx is also surprising and she is the only kid to show any warmth to either character.\nSurprisingly tough and as bossy as Danny, Toots is the gang's second-in-command and takes charge in Danny's absence. Her bossiness is exemplified in the feature-length \"Queen Toots\", where she discovers she is connected to royalty. When Toots takes advantage of her power, Dennis announces that she cannot boss him around and she puts him in a makeshift prison tower (quickly populated by other \"Beano\" characters and the rest of the kids). She loves music, often pulling a \"boogie box\" (a CD player) behind her or listening to her headphones instead of Teacher.\nAlthough Toots enjoys the boys' company, she sometimes exhibits disdain, naivete or exasperation at their more boyish behaviour. In the academy makeover, she wears a frilly dress and her hair and face are made up.\nSidney.\nSidney Mason Pye is Toots' younger twin brother by three minutes, first appearing in issue 622. His spiked haircut resembles a chimney-sweeping brush. He is a trickster, with Smiffy a frequent target. When the kids rehearse a nativity play, Smiffy asks what sound a sheep makes. Sidney replies \"Woof\", and he and Wilfred go into hysterics when Smiffy ruins the rehearsal. He makes pithy remarks about the other kids, to the amusement of those around him; he and Spotty fight several times when the latter is a target.\nSidney loves animals and has a wide variety of pets, from elephants to mice. His mouse is often part of the kids' plans. During the academy makeover, his chimney-brush hair is shaved off and he is apparently hypnotised.\nSmiffy.\nAristotle John Smiffy first appeared in issue 613, and is portrayed as a jovial scatterbrain. When Teacher calls the roll, instead of saying \"Present, sir\" he says \"Gift, miss\". Although he is sometimes very kind and intuitive (similar to an \"idiot savant\"), most of the time he cannot remember what colour the sky is. In his brief involvement in \"The Wizard\", he is given the name John Smith. Smiffy has appeared in two spin-off strips: the 1971\u201372 \"Says Smiffy\" and the 1985\u201387 \"Simply Smiffy\" (where he appears with his brother, Normal Norman). In 2008 he acquires a pet pebble, Kevin, who has his own feature (\"Where's Kevin?\") in \"The Beano\" number 3604. First appearing in a 2008 \"Singled Out\" story, Kevin appears in \"Bash Street Kids\" stories in 2010 and 2011. In the academy makeover Smiffy has a new brain installed, making him the brightest of the kids.\nScotty (\"Spotty\").\nJames Scott Cameron (formerly nicknamed Spotty, now nicknamed Scotty) is a short boy who wears a blue collared jersey and an extremely long, striped tie. He is proud and protective of the 976 black spots covering his face, fending off any attempts to remove them. Teacher sees him as the mouthiest of the kids; in \"Singled Out\" and feature-length strips, he interrupts the lessons with comments. Scotty is sarcastic, conceited and protective about his masculinity and height. Like Danny he dislikes Dennis the Menace, especially after Dennis menaces him during the latter's 50th-birthday party. In the academy makeover, Scotty's spots and aggressive, sarcastic nature are gone. In late 2021 Scotty declared that he was tired of being defined solely by his spots, leading the other kids to help him choose the new nickname Scotty, taken from his middle name Scott.\nWilfrid.\nWilfrid John Wimble is the smallest and quietest of the Bash Street Kids, and has social anxiety, his thoughts hidden behind a green jumper going up to his nose. He loves turtles, and resembles a tortoise; his neck is never seen, because when he removes his jumper his vest is just as high.\nHe is often simply present in the stories, speaking only occasionally. Unlike 'Erbert, most of Wilfrid's mischief is intentional. He hangs around most often with Spotty and 'Erbert and, occasionally, Sidney. In the academy storyline Wilfrid apparently has a large chin under his jersey, but it is prosthetic and he pulls it off.\nCuthbert.\nCuthbert Jason Cringeworthy, the brightest student in the class, is a teacher's pet and has a name for every letter of the alphabet. First appearing in 1972, he resembles a miniature Teacher (a play on the D. C. Thomson comic tradition that pets resemble their owners, like Dennis the Menace and Gnasher) and Walter the Softy from \"Dennis the Menace\". The first thing Danny said about Cuthbert was, \"He reminds me of someone I don't particularly like\". His character has evolved slightly; although he still swots and is as bright as ever, particularly in longer strips by Mike Pearse and Kev F. Sutherland he is one of the gang (unlike earlier strips, where he seemed to dislike the other kids) and sometimes comes up with intelligent ideas to help their cause or save the school. Cuthbert wants to be like the other kids, but although he is liked he does not quite fit in. The school janitor observes that he will never make any friends. Cuthbert is the only kid who wears the school uniform and turns in homework. A school-dance strip hints at a crush on Toots, but she quickly rejects him. Cuthbert appears in the fewest strips of all the characters.\nHarsha.\nHarsha Chandra, a British girl of Indian descent, joined Class 2B in June 2021. She already appeared in another strip, \"Har Har's Joke Shop\", which is about her family and the joke shop her father Hari \"Har Har\" Chandra owns. She's a prankster similar to Tricky Dicky.\nMandi.\nMandi, full name Mandira Sharma, another British girl of Indian descent, also joined Class 2B in June 2021. She previously had her own occasional strip that dealt with mental health issues to promote a charity, and as such her main trait is that she worries about things.\nStevie.\nSteven \"Super Star\" joined Class 2B in Wednesday 8 June 2022. He has his own strip of the same name. He wants to be famous. He is a black British boy, who is part American, as his Dad's side of the family is from there.\nKhadija.\nKhadija Raad, or Sketch Khad, joined Class 2B in Wednesday 8 June 2022. She is a Muslim and likes to draw on her Sketch pad, with any thing drawn on it coming to life.\nMahira.\nMahira Salim, a British girl of Pakistani descent, joined Class 2B in Wednesday 8 June 2022. She has her own strip called \"Mahira of the Match\". She likes football and is often regarded somewhat as a female version of Ball Boy.\nOther characters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome characters (Teacher and Head, for example) are named after their occupations. The children's parents (who look almost exactly like their children) are called Plug's Dad and so on, even in flashbacks to \"their\" childhoods.\nIn the early years, there were an indeterminate number of students; one page had 28, including:\nThe characters appeared in one-page stories (not comic strips) entitled \"Bash St. School\" in \"The Wizard\" in 1955, and were the full-page cover cartoon on 23 July 1955.\nArtists.\nLeo Baxendale drew the strip until 1962, when David Sutherland replaced him. Sutherland originally used a similar drawing style to Baxendale's, simplifying it later in the decade. He has drawn most of the strips since then, except from 1998 to 2000 (when Nigel Parkinson took over the strip in a style similar to that of David Parkins in \"Dennis the Menace\".) The strips have had a closely connected visual style since the early 1970s, when Sutherland began drawing them both. Although he was apparently easing into semi-retirement, Parkinson moved to \"Dennis the Menace\" in 2000 and Sutherland returned. Sutherland continued drawing the strip until he died in 2023, at the age of 89.\nThe strip has had a number of ghost artists, including Gordon Bell during the early 1970s, John Sherwood later in the decade, Keith Reynolds during the 1980s and Tom Paterson in the early 1990s. Mike Pearse and Kev F. Sutherland (no relation to David Sutherland) have occasionally drawn the strip, long stories in particular. Following Sutherland's death, Shannon Gallant and Mychailo Kazybrid both acted as temporary artists in the following months, before Gallant was appointed as Sutherland's permanent replacement.\nSpin-offs and other appearances.\n\"The Bash Street Kids\" has had a number of spin-offs, including \"Pup Parade\", \"Simply Smiffy\", \"Plug\" and \"Singled Out\". \"The Bash Street Kids Annual\", previously known as \"The Bash Street Kids Book\" and published biannually, is published in August. Summer specials, with solo stories of each character, were also published during the 1990s and were a forerunner to \"Singled Out\". Most were drawn by Tom Paterson, who later drew the \"Singled Out\" strip.\nFrom 1968 to 1972 \"The Beano\" ran a similar series, \"The Belles of St. Lemons\".\n\"The Dandy\" has had two similar series: the 1970s \"Whacko\" (about a teacher who taught in a suit of armour because of his unruly pupils) and \"P5\" from 1998 to 2000, also about a class and their long-suffering teacher. \"P5\" was republished in 2006 as \"Class Act\".\nSingled Out.\nSingled Out was a spin-off comic strip in the UK comic \"The Beano\". Based on The Bash Street Kids, Singled Out focuses on one character each week and builds a one-page story around them. It first appeared in issue 3226, dated 15 May 2004, drawn by Mike Pearse. Mike Pearse has also included other Beano faces in his strips such as Dennis the Menace, Bea and The Three Bears.\nPearse drew the strip until mid-2007, when the job was given to Nigel Parkinson, and then Tom Paterson. David Sutherland also drew a single strip. Paterson's trademark background images, such as the randomly positioned socks, are often included. The bottom left-hand corner of the page no longer shows which character the strip is focused on. Some strips mentioned which character was being featured in the header, but others didn't provide any information on this. After the 2009 Bash Street Kids annual (Space Cadets) was published, Paterson's work on Singled Out was changed to be more like Pearse's style, where before it was akin to David Sutherland's style, while Nigel Parkinson drew it in the Beano's sister comic, BeanoMAX. Several of the early Mike Pearse stories were reprinted in the 2010 Bash Street Kids annual. The strip appeared on an increasingly less regular basis in 2009, and has since ended. There was a Singled Out reprint strip shown a few years later (under the title \"Bash Street Capers\"), but this was (quite oddly as it was labelled No.1) a one-off.\nIn other media.\nVideo.\nThe Bash Street Kids appear in 1993's \"The Beano Video\" and 1994's \"The Beano Videostars\"; they also appear singing two songs: \"The Beano Rap\" and \"We're the Kids From Bash Street School\".\nTheme parks.\nBefore Beanoland became Wild Asia at the Chessington World of Adventures, it included the Bash Street Bus. The kids were also featured in the water-balloon portion of the park, and their standees were posted at a number of locations.\nVideo games.\nPlug is a playable character in \"Beanotown Racing\" for the PC, and the school is a race track.\nToys and games.\nRobert Harrop has designed figures, statues and ornaments based on \"The Bash Street Kids\". A target-practice game featured the characters, and a McDonald's Happy Meal toy set included a number of the kids.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54673", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54673", "title": "Early infanticidal childrearing", "text": "Term used in the study of psychohistory\nEarly infanticidal childrearing is a term used in the study of psychohistory that refers to infanticide in Paleolithic, pre-historical, and historical hunter-gatherer tribes or societies. \"Early\" means early in history or in the cultural development of a society, not to the age of the child. \"Infanticidal\" refers to the high incidence of infants killed when compared to modern nations. The model was developed by Lloyd deMause within the framework of psychohistory as part of a seven-stage sequence of childrearing modes that describe the development attitudes towards children in human cultures The word \"early\" distinguishes the term from late infanticidal childrearing, identified by deMause in the more established, agricultural cultures up to the ancient world.\nThe model.\nThis model is a psychological concept that aims to understand anthropological data, especially from such societies as the Yolngu of Australia, the Gimi, Wogeo, Bena Bena, and Bimin-Kuskusmin of Papua New Guinea, the Raum, the Ok, and the Kwanga, based on observations by G\u00e9za R\u00f3heim, Lia Leibowitz, Robert C. Suggs, Milton Diamond, Herman Heinrich Ploss, Gilbert Herdt, Robert J. Stoller, L. L. Langness, and Fitz John Porter Poole, among others. While anthropologists and psychohistorians do not dispute the data, they dispute its significance in terms of its importance, its meaning, and its interpretation.\nSupporters attempt to explain cultural history from a psycho-developmental point of view, and argue that cultural change can be assessed as \"advancement\" or \"regression\" based on the psychological consequences of various cultural practices. While most anthropologists reject this approach and most theories of cultural evolution as ethnocentric, psychohistorians proclaim the independence of psychohistory and reject the mainstream Boasian view.\nThis \"infanticidal\" model makes several claims: that childrearing in tribal societies included child sacrifice or high infanticide rates, incest, body mutilation, child rape, and tortures, and that such activities were culturally acceptable. Psychohistorians do not claim that each child was killed, only that in some societies there was (or is) a selection process that would vary from culture to culture. For example, there is a large jump in the mortality rate of Papua New Guinean children after they reach the weaning stage. In the Solomon Islands some people reportedly kill their first-born child. In rural India, rural China, and other societies, some female babies have been exposed to death. DeMause's argument is that the surviving siblings of the sacrificed child may become disturbed.\nSome states, both in the Old World and New World, practiced infanticide, including sacrifice in Mesoamerica and in Assyrian and Canaanite religions. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and other members of early states sacrificed infants to their gods, as described in the table of the psychopathological effects of some forms of childrearing.\nAccording to deMause, in the most primitive mode of childrearing of the above-mentioned table, mothers use their children to project parts of their dissociated self onto their children. The infanticidal clinging of the symbiotic mother prevents individuation so that innovation and more complex political organization are inhibited. On a second plane, deMause maintains that the attention paid by mothers of some contemporary societies to their children, such as sucking, fondling, and masturbating, is sexual according to an objective standard; and that this sexual attention is inordinate.\nThe model is based on a reported lack of empathy by infanticidal parents, such as a lack of mutual gazes between parent and child, observed by Robert B. Edgerton, Maria Lepowsky, Bruce Knauft, John W. M. Whiting, and Margaret Mead, among others. Such mutual gazing is widely recognized in developmental psychology as crucial for proper bonding between mother and child.\nCriticism.\nNineteenth-century British anthropology advanced a lineal, evolutionary sequence in a given culture from savagery to civilization. Cultures were seen on a hierarchical ladder. James George Frazer posited a universal progress from magical thinking to science. Most anthropologists of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century studied primitive cultures outside Europe and North America. John Ferguson McLennan, Lewis Henry Morgan, and others argued that there was a parallel development in social institutions. In the 1950s, led by Leslie White, these evolutionist ideas gained influence in American anthropology.\nThe German-born Franz Boas managed to shift the paradigm. His approach, later named cultural relativism, resists universal values of any kind. According to Boas's principle, which represents the mainstream school in contemporary anthropology, a culture's beliefs and activities should be interpreted in the context of its own culture. This principle has been established as axiomatic in contemporary anthropology. The Vietnam War consolidated the Boasian shift in American anthropology.\nSince the psychohistorians' model is analogous to the now discarded unilineal evolution theory, anthropologists have been critical of the negative value judgments, and the lineal progression, in the model currently advanced by psychohistorians as to what constitutes child abuse in primitive or non-Western cultures. Melvin Konner wrote:\nLloyd deMause, then editor of the \"History of Childhood Quarterly\", claimed that all past societies treated children brutally, and that all historical change in their treatment has been a fairly steady improvement toward the kind and gentle standards we now set and more or less meet. [...] Now anthropologists \u2014 and many historians as well \u2014 were slack-jawed and nearly speechless. [...] Serious students of the anthropology of childhood beginning with Margaret Mead have called attention to the pervasive love and care lavished on children in many traditional cultures.\nPsychohistorians accuse anthropologists and ethnologists of having avoided looking more closely at the evidence and having promulgated the myth of the noble savage. They maintain that what constitutes child abuse is a matter of a general psychological law, it leaves its permanent marks on the human brain structure, post-traumatic stress disorder is not a culture dependent phenomenon or a matter of opinion, and that some of the practices that mainstream anthropologists do not focus on, such as beatings of newborn infants, result in brain lesions and other visible neurological and psychological damage.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The basilica was in the Latin West equivalent to a stoa in the Greek East. The building gave its name to the \"basilica\" architectural form.\nOriginally, a basilica was an ancient Roman public building, where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. Basilicas are typically rectangular buildings with a central nave flanked by two or more longitudinal aisles, with the roof at two levels, being higher in the centre over the nave to admit a clerestory and lower over the side-aisles. An apse at one end, or less frequently at both ends or on the side, usually contained the raised tribunal occupied by the Roman magistrates. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the forum and often opposite a temple in imperial-era forums. Basilicas were also built in private residences and imperial palaces and were known as \"palace basilicas\".\nIn late antiquity, church buildings were typically constructed either as martyria, or with a basilica's architectural plan. A number of monumental Christian basilicas were constructed during the latter reign of Constantine the Great. In the post Nicene period, basilicas became a standard model for Christian spaces for congregational worship throughout the Mediterranean and Europe. From the early 4th century, Christian basilicas, along with their associated catacombs, were used for burial of the dead.\nBy extension, the name was later applied to Christian churches that adopted the same basic plan. It continues to be used in an architectural sense to describe rectangular buildings with a central nave and aisles, and usually a raised platform at the end opposite the door. In Europe and the Americas, the basilica remained the most common architectural style for churches of all Christian denominations, though this building plan has become less dominant in buildings constructed since the late 20th century.\nThe Catholic Church has come to use the term to refer to its especially historic churches, without reference to the architectural form.\nOrigins.\nThe Latin word \"basilica\" derives from . The first known basilica\u2014the Basilica Porcia in the Roman Forum\u2014was constructed in 184\u00a0BC by Marcus Porcius Cato (the Elder). After the construction of Cato the Elder's basilica, the term came to be applied to any large covered hall, whether it was used for domestic purposes, was a commercial space, a military structure, or religious building.\nThe plays of Plautus suggest that basilica buildings may have existed prior to Cato's building. The plays were composed between 210 and 184 BC and refer to a building that might be identified with the \"Atrium Regium\". Another early example is the basilica at Pompeii (late 2nd century\u00a0BC). Inspiration may have come from prototypes like Athens's Stoa Basileios or the hypostyle hall on Delos, but the architectural form is most derived from the audience halls in the royal palaces of the Diadochi kingdoms of the Hellenistic period. These rooms were typically a high nave flanked by colonnades.\nThese basilicas were rectangular, typically with central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides. The Roman \"basilica\" was a large public building where business or legal matters could be transacted. Although their form was variable, basilicas often contained interior colonnades that divided the space, giving aisles or arcaded spaces on one or both sides, with an apse at one end (or less often at each end), where the magistrates sat, often on a slightly raised dais. The central aisle \u2013 the nave \u2013 tended to be wider and taller than the flanking aisles, so that light could penetrate through the clerestory windows.\nIn the late Republican era, basilicas were increasingly monumental; Julius Caesar replaced the Basilica Sempronia with his own Basilica Julia, dedicated in 46 BC, while the Basilica Aemilia was rebuilt around 54 BC in so spectacular a fashion that Pliny the Elder wrote that it was among the most beautiful buildings in the world (it was simultaneously renamed the \"Basilica Paulli\"). Thereafter until the 4th century AD, monumental basilicas were routinely constructed at Rome by both private citizens and the emperors. These basilicas were reception halls and grand spaces in which \u00e9lite persons could impress guests and visitors, and could be attached to a large country \"villa\" or an urban \"domus\". They were simpler and smaller than were civic basilicas, and can be identified by inscriptions or their position in the archaeological context. Domitian constructed a basilica on the Palatine Hill for his imperial residential complex around 92 AD, and a palatine basilica was typical in imperial palaces throughout the imperial period.\nRoman Republic.\nLong, rectangular basilicas with internal peristyle became a quintessential element of Roman urbanism, often forming the architectural background to the city forum and used for diverse purposes. Beginning with Cato in the early second century BC, politicians of the Roman Republic competed with one another by building basilicas bearing their names in the Forum Romanum, the centre of ancient Rome. Outside the city, basilicas symbolised the influence of Rome and became a ubiquitous fixture of Roman of the late Republic from c.\u2009100 BC. The earliest surviving basilica is the basilica of Pompeii, built 120 BC. Basilicas were the administrative and commercial centres of major Roman settlements: the \"quintessential architectural expression of Roman administration\". Adjoining it there were normally various offices and rooms housing the \"curia\" and a shrine for the tutela. Like Roman public baths, basilicas were commonly used as venues for the display of honorific statues and other sculptures, complementing the outdoor public spaces and thoroughfares.\nBeside the Basilica Porcia on the \"Forum Romanum\", the Basilica Aemilia was built in 179 BC, and the Basilica Sempronia in 169 BC. In the Republic two types of basilica were built across Italy in the mid-2nd to early 1st centuries BC: either they were nearly square as at Fanum Fortunae, designed by Vitruvius, and Cosa, with a 3:4 width-length ratio; or else they were more rectangular, as Pompeii's basilica, whose ratio is 3:7.\nThe basilica at Ephesus is typical of the basilicas in the Roman East, which usually have a very elongated footprint and a ratio between 1:5 and 1:9, with open porticoes facing the \"agora\" (the Hellenic forum); this design was influenced by the existing tradition of long \"stoae\" in Hellenistic Asia. Provinces in the west lacked this tradition, and the basilicas the Romans commissioned there were more typically Italian, with the central nave divided from the side-aisles by an internal colonnade in regular proportions.\nEarly Empire.\nBeginning with the Forum of Caesar () at the end of the Roman Republic, the centre of Rome was embellished with a series of imperial fora typified by a large open space surrounded by a peristyle, honorific statues of the imperial family (), and a basilica, often accompanied by other facilities like a temple, market halls and public libraries. In the imperial period, statues of the emperors with inscribed dedications were often installed near the basilicas' tribunals, as Vitruvius recommended. Examples of such dedicatory inscriptions are known from basilicas at Lucus Feroniae and Veleia in Italy and at Cuicul in Africa Proconsolaris, and inscriptions of all kinds were visible in and around basilicas.\nAt Ephesus the basilica-\"stoa\" had two storeys and three aisles and extended the length of the civic \"agora\"'s north side, complete with colossal statues of the emperor Augustus and his imperial family.\nThe remains of a large subterranean Neopythagorean basilica dating from the 1st century AD were found near the Porta Maggiore in Rome in 1917, and is known as the Porta Maggiore Basilica.\nAfter its destruction in 60 AD, Londinium (London) was endowed with its first forum and basilica under the Flavian dynasty. The basilica delimited the northern edge of the forum with typical nave, aisles, and a tribunal, but with an atypical semi-basement at the western side. Unlike in Gaul, basilica-forum complexes in Roman Britain did not usually include a temple; instead a shrine was usually inside the basilica itself. At Londinium however, there was probably no temple at all attached to the original basilica, but instead a contemporary temple was constructed nearby. Later, in 79 AD, an inscription commemorated the completion of the basilica at Verulamium (St Albans) under the governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola; by contrast the first basilica at Londinium was only . The smallest known basilica in Britain was built by the Silures at Caerwent and measured .\nWhen Londinium became a , the whole city was re-planned and a new great forum-basilica complex erected, larger than any in Britain. Londinium's basilica, more than long, was the largest north of the Alps and a similar length to the modern St Paul's Cathedral. Only the later basilica-forum complex at Treverorum was larger, while at Rome only the Basilica Ulpia exceeded London's in size. It probably had arcaded, rather than trabeate, aisles, and a double row of square offices on the northern side, serving as the administrative centre of the , and its size and splendour probably indicate an imperial decision to change the administrative capital of Britannia to Londinium from Camulodunum (Colchester), as all provincial capitals were designated \"coloniae\". In 300 Londinium's basilica was destroyed as a result of the rebellion led by the \"Augustus\" of the break-away Britannic Empire, Carausius. Remains of the great basilica and its arches were discovered during the construction of Leadenhall Market in the 1880s.\nAt Corinth in the 1st century AD, a new basilica was constructed in on the east side of the forum. It was possibly inside the basilica that Paul the Apostle, according to the \"Acts of the Apostles\" (\"Acts\" 18:12\u201317) was investigated and found innocent by the Suffect Consul Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, the brother of Seneca the Younger, after charges were brought against him by members of the local Jewish diaspora. Modern tradition instead associates the incident with an open-air inscribed \"bema\" in the forum itself.\nThe emperor Trajan constructed his own imperial forum in Rome accompanied by his Basilica Ulpia dedicated in 112. Trajan's Forum () was separated from the Temple of Trajan, the Ulpian Library, and his famous Column depicting the Dacian Wars by the Basilica. It was an especially grand example whose particular symmetrical arrangement with an apse at both ends was repeated in the provinces as a characteristic form. To improve the quality of the Roman concrete used in the Basilica Ulpia, volcanic scoria from the Bay of Naples and Mount Vesuvius were imported which, though heavier, was stronger than the pumice available closer to Rome. The Bailica Ulpia is probably an early example of tie bars to restrain the lateral thrust of the barrel vault resting on a colonnade; both tie-bars and scoria were used in contemporary work at the Baths of Trajan and later the Hadrianic domed vault of the Pantheon.\nIn early 123, the \"augusta\" and widow of the emperor Trajan, Pompeia Plotina died. Hadrian, successor to Trajan, deified her and had a basilica constructed in her honour in southern Gaul.\nThe Basilica Hilariana (built c.\u2009145\u2013155) was designed for the use of the cult of Cybele.\nThe largest basilica built outside Rome was that built under the Antonine dynasty on the Byrsa hill in Carthage. The basilica was built together with a forum of enormous size and was contemporary with a great complex of public baths and a new aqueduct system running for , then the longest in the Roman Empire.\nThe basilica at Leptis Magna, built by the Septimius Severus a century later in about 216 is a notable 3rd century AD example of the traditional type, most notable among the works influenced by the Basilica Ulpia. The basilica at Leptis was built mainly of limestone ashlar, but the apses at either end were only limestone in the outer sections and built largely of rubble masonry faced with brick, with a number of decorative panels in \"opus reticulatum\". The basilica stood in a new forum and was accompanied by a programme of Severan works at Leptis including \"thermae\", a new harbour, and a public fountain. At Volubilis, principal city of Mauretania Tingitana, a basilica modelled on Leptis Magna's was completed during the short reign of Macrinus.\nLate antiquity.\nThe aisled-hall plan of the basilica was adopted by a number of religious cults in late antiquity. At Sardis, a monumental basilica housed the city's synagogue, serving the local Jewish diaspora. New religions like Christianity required space for congregational worship, and the basilica was adapted by the early Church for worship. Because they were able to hold large number of people, basilicas were adopted for Christian liturgical use after Constantine the Great. The early churches of Rome were basilicas with an apsidal tribunal and used the same construction techniques of columns and timber roofing.\nAt the start of the 4th century at Rome there was a change in burial and funerary practice, moving away from earlier preferences for inhumation in cemeteries \u2013 popular from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD \u2013 to the newer practice of burial in catacombs and inhumation inside Christian basilicas themselves. Conversely, new basilicas often were erected on the site of existing early Christian cemeteries and \"martyria\", related to the belief in Bodily Resurrection, and the cult of the sacred dead became monumentalised in basilica form. Traditional civic basilicas and \"bouleuteria\" declined in use with the weakening of the curial class () in the 4th and 5th centuries, while their structures were well suited to the requirements of congregational liturgies. The conversion of these types of buildings into Christian basilicas was also of symbolic significance, asserting the dominance of Christianity and supplanting the old political function of public space and the city-centre with an emphatic Christian social statement. Traditional monumental civic amenities like \"gymnasia\", \"palaestrae\", and \"thermae\" were also falling into disuse, and became favoured sites for the construction of new churches, including basilicas.\nUnder Constantine, the basilica became the most prestigious style of church building, was \"normative\" for church buildings by the end of the 4th century, and were ubiquitous in western Asia, North Africa, and most of Europe by the close of the 7th century. Christians also continued to hold services in synagogues, houses, and gardens, and continued practising baptism in rivers, ponds, and Roman bathhouses.\nThe development of Christian basilicas began even before Constantine's reign: a 3rd-century mud-brick house at Aqaba had become a Christian church and was rebuilt as a basilica. Within was a rectangular assembly hall with frescoes and at the east end an ambo, a cathedra, and an altar. Also within the church were a catecumenon (for catechumens), a baptistery, a diaconicon, and a prothesis: all features typical of later 4th century basilica churches. A Christian structure which included the prototype of the triumphal arch at the east end of later Constantinian basilicas. Known as the Megiddo church, it was built at Kefar 'Othnay in Palestine, possibly c. 230, for or by the Roman army stationed at Legio (later Lajjun). Its dedicatory inscriptions include the names of women who contributed to the building and were its major patrons, as well as men's names. A number of buildings previously believed to have been Constantinian or 4th century have been reassessed as dating to later periods, and certain examples of 4th century basilicas are not distributed throughout the Mediterranean world at all evenly. Christian basilicas and \"martyria\" attributable to the 4th century are rare on the Greek mainland and on the Cyclades, while the Christian basilicas of Egypt, Cyprus, Syria, Transjordan, Hispania, and Gaul are nearly all of later date. The basilica at Ephesus's \"Magnesian Gate\", the episcopal church at Laodicea on the Lycus, and two extramural churches at Sardis have all been considered 4th century constructions, but on weak evidence. Development of pottery chronologies for Late Antiquity had helped resolve questions of dating basilicas of the period.\nThree examples of a \"basilica discoperta\" or \"hypaethral basilica\" with no roof above the nave are inferred to have existed. The 6th century Anonymous pilgrim of Piacenza described a \"basilica built with a \"quadriporticus\", with the middle atrium uncovered\" at Hebron, while at P\u00e9cs and near Salona two ruined 5th buildings of debated interpretation might have been either roofless basilica churches or simply courtyards with an exedra at the end. An old theory by Ejnar Dyggve that these were the architectural intermediary between the Christian \"martyrium\" and the classical \"her\u00f6on\" is no longer credited.\nThe magnificence of early Christian basilicas reflected the patronage of the emperor and recalled his imperial palaces and reflected the royal associations of the basilica with the Hellenistic Kingdoms and even earlier monarchies like that of Pharaonic Egypt. Similarly, the name and association resounded with the Christian claims of the royalty of Christ \u2013 according to the \"Acts of the Apostles\" the earliest Christians had gathered at the royal \"Stoa\" of Solomon in Jerusalem to assert Jesus's royal heritage. For early Christians, the Bible supplied evidence that the First Temple and Solomon's palace were both hypostyle halls and somewhat resembled basilicas. Hypostyle synagogues, often built with apses in Palestine by the 6th century, share a common origin with the Christian basilicas in the civic basilicas and in the pre-Roman style of hypostyle halls in the Mediterranean Basin, particularly in Egypt, where pre-classical hypostyles continued to be built in the imperial period and were themselves converted into churches in the 6th century. Other influences on the evolution of Christian basilicas may have come from elements of domestic and palatial architecture during the pre-Constantinian period of Christianity, including the reception hall or () and the \"atria\" and \"triclinia\" of \u00e9lite Roman dwellings. The versatility of the basilica form and its variability in size and ornament recommended itself to the early Christian Church: basilicas could be grandiose as the Basilica of Maxentius in the \"Forum Romanum\" or more practical like the so-called Basilica of Bahira in Bosra, while the \"Basilica Constantiniana\" on the Lateran Hill was of intermediate scale. This basilica, begun in 313, was the first imperial Christian basilica. Imperial basilicas were first constructed for the Christian Eucharist liturgy in the reign of Constantine.\nBasilica churches were not economically inactive. Like non-Christian or civic basilicas, basilica churches had a commercial function integral to their local trade routes and economies. Amphorae discovered at basilicas attest their economic uses and can reveal their position in wider networks of exchange. At Dion near Mount Olympus in Macedonia, now an Archaeological Park, the latter 5th century \"Cemetery Basilica\", a small church, was replete with potsherds from all over the Mediterranean, evidencing extensive economic activity took place there. Likewise at Maroni Petrera on Cyprus, the amphorae unearthed by archaeologists in the 5th century basilica church had been imported from North Africa, Egypt, Palestine, and the Aegean basin, as well as from neighbouring Asia Minor.\nAccording to Vegetius, writing c. 390, basilicas were convenient for drilling soldiers of the Late Roman army during inclement weather.\nBasilica of Maxentius.\nThe 4th century Basilica of Maxentius, begun by Maxentius between 306 and 312 and according to Aurelius Victor's \"De Caesaribus\" completed by Constantine I, was an innovation. Earlier basilicas mostly had wooden roofs, but this basilica dispensed with timber trusses and used instead cross-vaults made from Roman bricks and concrete to create one of the ancient world's largest covered spaces: 80 m long, 25 m wide, and 35 m high. The vertices of the cross-vaults, the largest Roman examples, were 35 m. The vault was supported on marble monolithic columns 14.5 m tall. The foundations are as much as 8 m deep. The vault was supported by brick latticework ribs () forming lattice ribbing, an early form of rib vault, and distributing the load evenly across the vault's span. Similar brick ribs were employed at the Baths of Maxentius on the Palatine Hill, where they supported walls on top of the vault. Also known as the or , it chanced to be the last civic basilica built in Rome.\nInside the basilica the central nave was accessed by five doors opening from an entrance hall on the eastern side and terminated in an apse at the western end. Another, shallower apse with niches for statues was added to the centre of the north wall in a second campaign of building, while the western apse housed a colossal acrolithic statue of the emperor Constantine enthroned. Fragments of this statue are now in the courtyard of the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill, part of the Capitoline Museums. Opposite the northern apse on the southern wall, another monumental entrance was added and elaborated with a portico of porphyry columns. One of the remaining marble interior columns was removed in 1613 by Pope Paul V and set up as an honorific column outside Santa Maria Maggiore.\nConstantinian period.\nIn the early 4th century Eusebius used the word basilica () to refer to Christian churches; in subsequent centuries as before, the word basilica referred in Greek to the civic, non-ecclesiastical buildings, and only in rare exceptions to churches. Churches were nonetheless basilican in form, with an apse or tribunal at the end of a nave with two or more aisles typical. A narthex (sometimes with an exonarthex) or vestibule could be added to the entrance, together with an atrium, and the interior might have transepts, a pastophorion, and galleries, but the basic scheme with clerestory windows and a wooden truss roof remained the most typical church type until the 6th century. The nave would be kept clear for liturgical processions by the clergy, with the laity in the galleries and aisles to either side. The function of Christian churches was similar to that of the civic basilicas but very different from temples in contemporary Graeco-Roman polytheism: while pagan temples were entered mainly by priests and thus had their splendour visible from without, within Christian basilicas the main ornamentation was visible to the congregants admitted inside. Christian priests did not interact with attendees during the rituals which took place at determined intervals, whereas pagan priests were required to perform individuals' sacrifices in the more chaotic environment of the temple precinct, with the temple's fa\u00e7ade as backdrop. In basilicas constructed for Christian uses, the interior was often decorated with frescoes, but these buildings' wooden roof often decayed and failed to preserve the fragile frescoes within. Thus was lost an important part of the early history of Christian art, which would have sought to communicate early Christian ideas to the mainly illiterate Late Antique society. On the exterior, basilica church complexes included cemeteries, baptisteries, and fonts which \"defined ritual and liturgical access to the sacred\", elevated the social status of the Church hierarchy, and which complemented the development of a Christian historical landscape; Constantine and his mother Helena were patrons of basilicas in important Christian sites in the Holy Land and Rome, and at Milan and Constantinople.\nAround 310, while still a self-proclaimed \"augustus\" unrecognised at Rome, Constantine began the construction of the \"Basilica Constantiniana\" or , as a reception hall for his imperial seat at Trier (), capital of Belgica Prima. On the exterior, Constantine's palatine basilica was plain and utilitarian, but inside was very grandly decorated.\nIn the reign of Constantine I, a basilica was constructed for the Pope in the former barracks of the \"Equites singulares Augusti\", the cavalry arm of the Praetorian Guard. (Constantine had disbanded the Praetorian guard after his defeat of their emperor Maxentius and replaced them with another bodyguard, the \"Scholae Palatinae\".) In 313 Constantine began construction of the \"Basilica Constantiniana\" on the Lateran Hill. This basilica became Rome's cathedral church, known as St John Lateran, and was more richly decorated and larger than any previous Christian structure. However, because of its remote position from the \"Forum Romanum\" on the city's edge, it did not connect with the older imperial basilicas in the fora of Rome. Outside the basilica was the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius, a rare example of an Antique statue that has never been underground.\nAccording to the \"Liber Pontificalis\", Constantine was also responsible for the rich interior decoration of the Lateran Baptistery constructed under Pope Sylvester I (r. 314\u2013335), sited about . The Lateran Baptistery was the first monumental free-standing baptistery, and in subsequent centuries Christian basilica churches were often endowed with such baptisteries.\nAt Cirta, a Christian basilica erected by Constantine was taken over by his opponents, the Donatists. After Constantine's failure to resolve the Donatist controversy by coercion between 317 and 321, he allowed the Donatists, who dominated Africa, to retain the basilica and constructed a new one for the Catholic Church.\nThe original titular churches of Rome were those which had been private residences and which were donated to be converted to places of Christian worship. Above an originally 1st century AD villa and its later adjoining warehouse and Mithraeum, a large basilica church had been erected by 350, subsuming the earlier structures beneath it as a crypt. The basilica was the first church of San Clemente al Laterano. Similarly, at Santi Giovanni e Paolo al Celio, an entire ancient city block \u2013 a 2nd-century \"insula\" on the Caelian Hill \u2013 was buried beneath a 4th-century basilica. The site was already venerated as the \"martyrium\" of three early Christian burials beforehand, and part of the \"insula\" had been decorated in the style favoured by Christian communities frequenting the early Catacombs of Rome.\nBy 350 in Serdica (Sofia, Bulgaria), a monumental basilica \u2013 the Church of Saint Sophia \u2013 was erected, covering earlier structures including a Christian chapel, an oratory, and a cemetery dated to c. 310. Other major basilica from this period, in this part of Europe, is the Great Basilica in Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria) from the 4th century AD.\nValentinianic\u2013Theodosian period.\nIn the late 4th century the dispute between Nicene and Arian Christianity came to head at \"Mediolanum\" (Milan), where Ambrose was bishop. At Easter in 386 the Arian party, preferred by the Theodosian dynasty, sought to wrest the use of the basilica from the Nicene partisan Ambrose. According to Augustine of Hippo, the dispute resulted in Ambrose organising an 'orthodox' sit-in at the basilica and arranged the miraculous invention and translation of martyrs, whose hidden remains had been revealed in a vision. During the sit-in, Augustine credits Ambrose with the introduction from the \"eastern regions\" of antiphonal chanting, to give heart to the orthodox congregation, though in fact music was likely part of Christian ritual since the time of the Pauline epistles. The arrival and reburial of the martyrs' uncorrupted remains in the basilica in time for the Easter celebrations was seen as powerful step towards divine approval.\nAt Philippi, the market adjoining the 1st-century forum was demolished and replaced with a Christian basilica. Civic basilicas throughout Asia Minor became Christian places of worship; examples are known at Ephesus, Aspendos, and at Magnesia on the Maeander. The \"Great Basilica\" in Antioch of Pisidia is a rare securely dated 4th century Christian basilica and was the city's cathedral church. The mosaics of the floor credit Optimus, the bishop, with its dedication. Optimus was a contemporary of Basil of Caesarea and corresponded with him c. 377. Optimus was the city's delegate at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, so the 70 m-long single-apsed basilica near the city walls must have been constructed around that time. Pisidia had a number of Christian basilicas constructed in Late Antiquity, particularly in former \"bouleuteria\", as at Sagalassos, Selge, Pednelissus, while a civic basilica was converted for Christians' use in Cremna.\nAt Chalcedon, opposite Constantinople on the Bosporus, the relics of Euphemia \u2013 a supposed Christian martyr of the Diocletianic Persecution \u2013 were housed in a \"martyrium\" accompanied by a basilica. The basilica already existed when Egeria passed through Chalcedon in 384, and in 436 Melania the Younger visited the church on her own journey to the Holy Land. From the description of Evagrius Scholasticus the church is identifiable as an aisled basilica attached to the \"martyrium\" and preceded by an \"atrium\". The Council of Chalcedon (8\u201331 October 451) was held in the basilica, which must have been large enough to accommodate the more than two hundred bishops that attended its third session, together with their translators and servants; around 350 bishops attended the Council in all. In an ekphrasis in his eleventh sermon, Asterius of Amasea described an icon in the church depicting Euphemia's martyrdom. The church was restored under the patronage of the \"patricia\" and daughter of Olybrius\",\" Anicia Juliana. Pope Vigilius fled there from Constantinople during the Three-Chapter Controversy. The basilica, which lay outside the walls of Chalcedon, was destroyed by the Persians in the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628 during one of the Sasanian occupations of the city in 615 and 626. The relics of Euphemia were reportedly translated to a new Church of St Euphemia in Constantinople in 680, though Cyril Mango argued the translation never took place. Subsequently, Asterius's sermon \"On the Martyrdom of St Euphemia\" was advanced as an argument for iconodulism at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.\nIn the late 4th century, a large basilica church dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus was constructed in Ephesus in the former south \"stoa\" (a commercial basilica) of the Temple of Hadrian \"Olympios\". Ephesus was the centre of the Roman province of Asia, and was the site of the city's famed Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It had also been a centre of the Roman imperial cult in Asia; Ephesus was three times declared (lit.\u2009'temple-warden') and had constructed a Temple of the Sebastoi to the Flavian dynasty. The Basilica of the Virgin Mary was probably the venue for the 431 Council of Ephesus and the 449 Second Council of Ephesus, both convened by Theodosius II. At some point during the Christianisation of the Roman world, Christian crosses were cut into the faces of the colossal statues of Augustus and Livia that stood in the basilica-\"stoa\" of Ephesus; the crosses were perhaps intended to exorcise demons in a process akin to baptism. In the eastern cemetery of Hierapolis the 5th century domed octagonal \"martyrium\" of Philip the Apostle was built alongside a basilica church, while at Myra the Basilica of St Nicholas was constructed at the tomb of Saint Nicholas.\nAt Constantinople the earliest basilica churches, like the 5th century basilica at the Monastery of Stoudios, were mostly equipped with a small cruciform crypt (), a space under the church floor beneath the altar. Typically, these crypts were accessed from the apse's interior, though not always, as at the 6th century Church of St John at the Hebdomon, where access was from outside the apse. At Thessaloniki, the Roman bath where tradition held Demetrius of Thessaloniki had been martyred was subsumed beneath the 5th century basilica of Hagios Demetrios, forming a crypt.\nThe largest and oldest basilica churches in Egypt were at Pbow, a coenobitic monastery established by Pachomius the Great in 330. The 4th century basilica was replaced by a large 5th century building (36 \u00d7 72 m) with five aisles and internal colonnades of pink granite columns and paved with limestone. This monastery was the administrative centre of the Pachomian order where the monks would gather twice annually and whose library may have produced many surviving manuscripts of biblical, Gnostic, and other texts in Greek and Coptic. In North Africa, late antique basilicas were often built on a doubled plan. In the 5th century, basilicas with two apses, multiple aisles, and doubled churches were common, including examples respectively at Sufetula, Tipasa, and Dj\u00e9mila. Generally, North African basilica churches' altars were in the nave and the main building medium was \"opus africanum\" of local stone, and \"spolia\" was infrequently used.\nThe Church of the East's Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was convened by the Sasanian Emperor Yazdegerd I at his capital at Ctesiphon; according to \"Synodicon Orientale\", the emperor ordered that the former churches in the Sasanian Empire to be restored and rebuilt, that such clerics and ascetics as had been imprisoned were to be released, and their Nestorian Christian communities allowed to circulate freely and practice openly.\nIn eastern Syria, the Church of the East developed at typical pattern of basilica churches. Separate entrances for men and women were installed in the southern or northern wall; within, the east end of the nave was reserved for men, while women and children were stood behind. In the nave was a \"bema\", from which Scripture could be read, and which were inspired by the equivalent in synagogues and regularised by the Church of Antioch. The Council of 410 stipulated that on Sunday the archdeacon would read the Gospels from the \"bema\". Standing near the \"bema\", the lay folk could chant responses to the reading and if positioned near the \"\u0161q\u0101qon\u0101\" (\"a walled floor-level pathway connecting the \"bema\" to the altar area\") could try to kiss or touch the Gospel Book as it was processed from the deacons' room to the \"bema\" and thence to the altar. Some ten Eastern churches in eastern Syria have been investigated by thorough archaeology.\nA Christian basilica was constructed in the first half of the 5th century at Olympia, where the statue of Zeus by Phidias had been noted as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ever since the 2nd century BC list compiled by Antipater of Sidon. Cultural tourism thrived at Olympia and Ancient Greek religion continued to be practised there well into the 4th century. At Nicopolis in Epirus, founded by Augustus to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Actium at the end of the Last war of the Roman Republic, four early Christian basilicas were built during Late Antiquity whose remains survive to the present. In the 4th or 5th century, Nicopolis was surrounded by a new city wall.\nIn Bulgaria there are major basilicas from that time like Elenska Basilica and the Red Church.\nLeonid period.\nOn Crete, the Roman cities suffered from repeated earthquakes in the 4th century, but between c. 450 and c. 550, a large number of Christian basilicas were constructed. Crete was throughout Late Antiquity a province of the Diocese of Macedonia, governed from Thessaloniki.\nNine basilica churches were built at Nea Anchialos, ancient Phthiotic Thebes (), which was in its heyday the primary port of Thessaly. The episcopal see was the three-aisled \"Basilica A\", the Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki, and similar to the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki. Its atrium perhaps had a pair of towers to either side and its construction dates to the late 5th/early 6th century. The Elpidios Basilica \u2013 \"Basilica B\" \u2013 was of similar age, and the city was home to a large complex of ecclesiastical buildings including \"Basilica G\", with its luxurious mosaic floors and a mid-6th century inscription proclaiming the patronage of the bishop Peter. Outside the defensive wall was \"Basilica D\", a 7th-century cemetery church.\nStobi, () the capital from the late 4th century of the province of Macedonia II Salutaris, had numerous basilicas and six palaces in late antiquity. The \"Old Basilica\" had two phases of geometric pavements, the second phase of which credited the bishop Eustathios as patron of the renovations. A newer episcopal basilica was built by the bishop Philip atop the remains of the earlier structure, and two further basilicas were within the walls. The \"Central Basilica\" replaced a synagogue on a site razed in the late 5th century, and there was also a \"North Basilica\" and further basilicas without the walls. Various mosaics and sculptural decorations have been found there, and while the city suffered from the Ostrogoths in 479 and an earthquake in 518, ceasing to be a major city thereafter, it remained a bishopric until the end of the 7th century and the \"Basilica of Philip\" had its \"templon\" restored in the 8th century.\nThe Small Basilica of Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria) in Thrace was built in the second half of the 5th century AD.\nJustinianic period.\nJustinian I constructed at Ephesus a large basilica church, the Basilica of St John, above the supposed tomb of John the Apostle. The church was a domed cruciform basilica begun in 535/6; enormous and lavishly decorated, it was built in the same style as Justinian's Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. The Justinianic basilica replaced an earlier, smaller structure which Egeria had planned to visit in the 4th century, and remains of a aqueduct branch built to supply the complex with water probably dates from Justinian's reign. The Ephesians' basilicas to St Mary and St John were both equipped with baptisteries with filling and draining pipes: both fonts were flush with the floor and unsuitable for infant baptism. As with most Justinianic baptisteries in the Balkans and Asia Minor, the baptistery at the Basilica of St John was on the northern side of the basilica's nave; the 734 m2 baptistery was separated from the basilica by a 3 m-wide corridor. According to the 6th century Syriac writer John of Ephesus, a Syriac Orthodox Christian, the heterodox Miaphysites held ordination services in the courtyard of the Basilica of St John under cover of night. Somewhat outside the ancient city on the hill of Sel\u00e7uk, the Justinianic basilica became the centre of the city after the 7th century Arab\u2013Byzantine wars.\nAt Constantinople, Justinian constructed the largest domed basilica: on the site of the 4th century basilica Church of Holy Wisdom, the emperor ordered construction of the huge domed basilica that survives to the present: the Hagia Sophia. This basilica, which \"continues to stand as one of the most visually imposing and architecturally daring churches in the Mediterranean\", was the cathedral of Constantinople and the patriarchal church of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Hagia Sophia, originally founded by Constantine, was at the social and political heart of Constantinople, near to the Great Palace, the Baths of Zeuxippus, and the Hippodrome of Constantinople, while the headquarters of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was within the basilica's immediate vicinity.\nThe mid-6th century Bishop of Pore\u010d ( or ; ) replaced an earlier 4th century basilica with the magnificent Euphrasian Basilica in the style of contemporary basilicas at Ravenna. Some column capitals were of marble from Greece identical to those in Basilica of San Vitale and must have been imported from the Byzantine centre along with the columns and some of the \"opus sectile\". There are conch mosaics in the basilica's three apses and the fine \"opus sectile\" on the central apse wall is \"exceptionally well preserved\".\nThe 4th century basilica of Saint Sophia Church at Serdica (Sofia, Bulgaria) was rebuilt in the 5th century and ultimately replaced by a new monumental basilica in the late 6th century, and some construction phases continued into the 8th century. This basilica was the cathedral of Serdica and was one of three basilicas known to lie outside the walls; three more churches were within the walled city, of which the Church of Saint George was a former Roman bath built in the 4th century, and another was a former Mithraeum. The basilicas were associated with cemeteries with Christian inscriptions and burials.\nAnother basilica from this period in Bulgaria was the Belovo Basilica (6th century AD).\nThe Miaphysite convert from the Church of the East, Ahudemmeh constructed a new basilica c.\u2009565 dedicated to Saint Sergius at \"\u02bf\"Ain Qenoye (or \"\u02bf\"Ain Qena according to Bar Hebraeus) after being ordained bishop of Beth Arbaye by Jacob Baradaeus and while proselytizing among the Bedouin of Arbayistan in the Sasanian Empire. According to Ahudemmeh's biographer this basilica and its \"martyrium\", in the upper Tigris valley, was supposed to be a copy of the Basilica of St Sergius at Sergiopolis (Resafa), in the middle Euphrates, so that the Arabs would not have to travel so far on pilgrimage. More likely, with the support of Khosrow I for its construction and defence against the Nestorians who were Miaphysites' rivals, the basilica was part of an attempt to control the frontier tribes and limit their contact with the Roman territory of Justinian, who had agreed in the 562 Fifty-Year Peace Treaty to pay 30,000 \"nomismata\" annually to Khosrow in return for a demilitarization of the frontier after the latest phase of the Roman\u2013Persian Wars. After being mentioned in 828 and 936, the basilica at \"\u02bf\"Ain Qenoye disappeared from recorded history, though it may have remained occupied for centuries, and was rediscovered as a ruin by Carsten Niebuhr in 1766. The name of the modern site Qasr Ser\u012bj is derived from the basilica's dedication to St Sergius. Qasr Ser\u012bj's construction may have been part of the policy of toleration that Khosrow and his successors had for Miaphysitism \u2013 a contrast with Justinian's persecution of heterodoxy within the Roman empire. This policy itself encouraged many tribes to favour the Persian cause, especially after the death in 569 of the Ghassanid Kingdom's Miaphysite king al-Harith ibn Jabalah (, ) and the 584 suppression by the Romans of his successors' dynasty.\nPalace basilicas.\nIn the Roman Imperial period (after about 27 BC), a basilica for large audiences also became a feature in palaces. In the 3rd century of the Christian era, the governing elite appeared less frequently in the forums.\nThey now tended to dominate their cities from opulent palaces and country villas, set a little apart from traditional centers of public life. Rather than retreats from public life, however, these residences were the forum made private.\n\u2014 Peter Brown, in Paul Veyne, 1987\nSeated in the tribune of his basilica, the great man would meet his dependent \"clientes\" early every morning.\nConstantine's basilica at Trier, the Aula Palatina (AD 306), is still standing. A private basilica excavated at Bulla Regia (Tunisia), in the \"House of the Hunt\", dates from the first half of the 5th century. Its reception or audience hall is a long rectangular nave-like space, flanked by dependent rooms that mostly also open into one another, ending in a semi-circular apse, with matching transept spaces. Clustered columns emphasised the \"crossing\" of the two axes.\nChristian adoption of the basilica form.\nIn the 4th century, once the Imperial authorities had decriminalised Christianity with the 313 Edict of Milan, and with the activities of Constantine the Great and his mother Helena, Christians were prepared to build larger and more handsome edifices for worship than the furtive meeting-places (such as the Cenacle, cave-churches, house churches such as that of the martyrs John and Paul) they had been using. Architectural formulas for temples were unsuitable due to their pagan associations, and because pagan cult ceremonies and sacrifices occurred outdoors under the open sky in the sight of the gods, with the temple, housing the cult figures and the treasury, as a backdrop. The usable model at hand, when Constantine wanted to memorialise his imperial piety, was the familiar conventional architecture of the basilicas.\nThere were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica, always some kind of rectangular hall, but the one usually followed for churches had a central nave with one aisle at each side and an apse at one end opposite to the main door at the other end. In (and often also in front of) the apse was a raised platform, where the altar was placed, and from where the clergy officiated. In secular building this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors, governors, and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes. Constantine built a basilica of this type in his palace complex at Trier, later very easily adopted for use as a church. It is a long rectangle two storeys high, with ranks of arch-headed windows one above the other, without aisles (there was no mercantile exchange in this imperial basilica) and, at the far end beyond a huge arch, the apse in which Constantine held state.\nDevelopment.\nPutting an altar instead of the throne, as was done at Trier, made a church. Basilicas of this type were built in western Europe, Greece, Syria, Egypt, and Palestine, that is, at any early centre of Christianity. Good early examples of the architectural basilica include the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem (6th century), the church of St\u00a0Elias at Thessalonica (5th century), and the two great basilicas at Ravenna.\nThe first basilicas with transepts were built under the orders of Emperor Constantine, both in Rome and in his \"New Rome\", Constantinople:\nAround 380, Gregory Nazianzen, describing the Constantinian Church of the Holy Apostles at Constantinople, was the first to point out its resemblance to a cross. Because the cult of the cross was spreading at about the same time, this comparison met with stunning success.\n\u2014 Yvon Th\u00e9bert, in Veyne, 1987\nThus, a Christian symbolic theme was applied quite naturally to a form borrowed from civil semi-public precedents. The first great Imperially sponsored Christian basilica is that of St John Lateran, which was given to the Bishop of Rome by Constantine right before or around the Edict of Milan in 313 and was consecrated in the year 324. In the later 4th century, other Christian basilicas were built in Rome: Santa Sabina, and St Paul's Outside the Walls (4th century), and later St Clement (6th century).\nA Christian basilica of the 4th or 5th century stood behind its entirely enclosed forecourt ringed with a colonnade or arcade, like the stoa or peristyle that was its ancestor or like the cloister that was its descendant. This forecourt was entered from outside through a range of buildings along the public street. This was the architectural ground-plan of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, until in the 15th century it was demolished to make way for a modern church built to a new plan.\nIn most basilicas, the central nave is taller than the aisles, forming a row of windows called a clerestory. Some basilicas in the Caucasus, particularly those of Armenia and Georgia, have a central nave only slightly higher than the two aisles and a single pitched roof covering all three. The result is a much darker interior. This plan is known as the \"oriental basilica\", or \"pseudobasilica\" in central Europe. A peculiar type of basilica, known as three-church basilica, was developed in early medieval Georgia, characterised by the central nave which is completely separated from the aisles with solid walls.\nGradually, in the Early Middle Ages there emerged the massive Romanesque churches, which still kept the fundamental plan of the basilica.\nIn Medieval Bulgaria the Great Basilica was finished around 875. The architectural complex in Pliska, the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire, included a cathedral, an archbishop's palace and a monastery. The basilica was one of the greatest Christian cathedrals in Europe of the time, with an area of . The still in use Church of Saint Sophia in Ohrid is another example from Medieval Bulgaria.\nIn Romania, the word for church both as a building and as an institution is \"biseric\u0103\", derived from the term basilica.\nIn the United States the style was copied with variances. An American church built imitating the architecture of an Early Christian basilica, St. Mary's (German) Church in Pennsylvania, was demolished in 1997.\nCatholic basilicas.\nIn the Catholic Church, a basilica is a church with special privileges. It is typically housed in a large and important building. This designation may be made by the Pope or may date from time immemorial. Basilica churches are distinguished for ceremonial purposes from other churches. The building does not need to be a basilica in the architectural sense. Basilicas are either major basilicas \u2013 of which there are four, all in the diocese of Rome\u2014or minor basilicas, of which there were 1,810 worldwide as of 2019[ [update]]. The Umbraculum is displayed in a basilica to the right side (i.e. the Epistle side) of the altar to indicate that the church has been awarded the rank of a basilica. \nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This predictability can potentially reveal the identity of the sender. To address this weakness, Type II and Type III remailers were developed.

However, there are still websites and systems which rely on the general ideas of layered encryption and identity obfuscation behind Type I remailers.\nHistory.\nThe Cypherpunk movement emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consisting of activists, cryptographers, and computer scientists who believed in the use of cryptography as a means to safeguard privacy and resist government interference.

That is, assuming a solution for \"H\" takes 1 unit time, \"H\"'s solution can be used to solve \"L\" in polynomial time. As a consequence, finding a polynomial time algorithm to solve a single NP-hard problem would give polynomial time algorithms for all the problems in the complexity class NP. As it is suspected, but unproven, that P\u2260NP, it is unlikely that any polynomial-time algorithms for NP-hard problems exist.\nA simple example of an NP-hard problem is the subset sum problem.\nInformally, if \"H\" is NP-hard, then it is at least as difficult to solve as the problems in NP. However, the opposite direction is not true: some problems are undecidable, and therefore even more difficult to solve than all problems in NP, but they are probably not NP-hard (unless P=NP).\nDefinition.\nA decision problem \"H\" is NP-hard when for every problem \"L\" in NP, there is a polynomial-time many-one reduction from \"L\" to \"H\".\nAnother definition is to require that there be a polynomial-time reduction from an NP-complete problem \"G\" to \"H\". As any problem \"L\" in NP reduces in polynomial time to \"G\", \"L\" reduces in turn to \"H\" in polynomial time so this new definition implies the previous one. It does not restrict the class NP-hard to decision problems, and it also includes search problems or optimization problems.\nConsequences.\nIf P \u2260 NP, then NP-hard problems could not be solved in polynomial time.\nSome NP-hard optimization problems can be polynomial-time approximated up to some constant approximation ratio (in particular, those in APX) or even up to any approximation ratio (those in PTAS or FPTAS). There are many classes of approximability, each one enabling approximation up to a different level. \nExamples.\nAll NP-complete problems are also NP-hard (see List of NP-complete problems). For example, the optimization problem of finding the least-cost cyclic route through all nodes of a weighted graph\u2014commonly known as the travelling salesman problem\u2014is NP-hard. The subset sum problem is another example: given a set of integers, does any non-empty subset of them add up to zero? That is a decision problem and happens to be NP-complete.\nThere are decision problems that are \"NP-hard\" but not \"NP-complete\" such as the halting problem. That is the problem which asks \"given a program and its input, will it run forever?\" That is a \"yes\"/\"no\" question and so is a decision problem. It is easy to prove that the halting problem is NP-hard but not NP-complete. For example, the Boolean satisfiability problem can be reduced to the halting problem by transforming it to the description of a Turing machine that tries all truth value assignments and when it finds one that satisfies the formula it halts and otherwise it goes into an infinite loop. It is also easy to see that the halting problem is not in \"NP\" since all problems in NP are decidable in a finite number of operations, but the halting problem, in general, is undecidable. There are also NP-hard problems that are neither \"NP-complete\" nor \"Undecidable\". For instance, the language of true quantified Boolean formulas is decidable in polynomial space, but not in non-deterministic polynomial time (unless NP = PSPACE).\nNP-naming convention.\nNP-hard problems do not have to be elements of the complexity class NP.\nAs NP plays a central role in computational complexity, it is used as the basis of several classes:\nApplication areas.\nNP-hard problems are often tackled with rules-based languages in areas including:\nNP-hard problems.\nProblems that are decidable but not NP-complete, often are optimization problems:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Generically, reductions stricter than polynomial-time reductions are used, since all languages in P (except the empty language and the language of all strings) are P-complete under polynomial-time reductions. If we use NC reductions, that is, reductions which can operate in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors, then all P-complete problems lie outside NC and so cannot be effectively parallelized, under the unproven assumption that NC\u00a0\u2260\u00a0P. If we use the stronger log-space reduction, this remains true, but additionally we learn that all P-complete problems lie outside L under the weaker unproven assumption that L\u00a0\u2260\u00a0P. In this latter case the set P-complete may be smaller.\nMotivation.\nThe class P, typically taken to consist of all the \"tractable\" problems for a sequential computer, contains the class NC, which consists of those problems which can be efficiently solved on a parallel computer. This is because parallel computers can be simulated on a sequential machine. \nIt is not known whether NC\u00a0=\u00a0P. In other words, it is not known whether there are any tractable problems that are inherently sequential. Just as it is widely suspected that P does not equal NP, so it is widely suspected that NC does not equal P.\nSimilarly, the class L contains all problems that can be solved by a sequential computer in logarithmic space. Such machines run in polynomial time because they can have a polynomial number of configurations. It is suspected that L\u00a0\u2260\u00a0P; that is, that some problems that can be solved in polynomial time also require more than logarithmic space.\nSimilarly to the use of NP-complete problems to analyze the P\u00a0=\u00a0NP question, the P-complete problems, viewed as the \"probably not parallelizable\" or \"probably inherently sequential\" problems, serves in a similar manner to study the NC\u00a0=\u00a0P question. Finding an efficient way to parallelize the solution to some P-complete problem would show that NC\u00a0=\u00a0P. It can also be thought of as the \"problems requiring superlogarithmic space\"; a log-space solution to a P-complete problem (using the definition based on log-space reductions) would imply L\u00a0=\u00a0P.\nThe logic behind this is analogous to the logic that a polynomial-time solution to an NP-complete problem would prove P\u00a0=\u00a0NP: if we have a NC reduction from any problem in P to a problem A, and an NC solution for A, then NC\u00a0=\u00a0P. Similarly, if we have a log-space reduction from any problem in P to a problem A, and a log-space solution for A, then L\u00a0=\u00a0P.\nReductions.\nThere are many many-one reduction used when defining P-completeness, with variable strengths.Section 3.3\nAt the lowest level is NC1-reduction, then L-reduction, then NC2-reduction, NC3-reduction, and so on. Their union is NC-reduction. They are ordered since formula_1. \nFor NCk-reduction and NC-reduction, uniformity is imposed, because the intention of P-completeness theory is to prove upper bounds. Non-uniformity is useful for proving lower bounds, but for upper bounds, non-uniformity is unsatisfactory, since they are too powerful for this purpose. The standard uniformity condition is L-uniformity, meaning that the circuit family should be constructable by a Turing machine, such that given formula_2 as input, it outputs a description of the formula_3-th circuit using formula_4 working tape.\nGiven two languages formula_5, define formula_6 iff there exists a L-uniform NCk boolean circuit family that together computes a function formula_7, such that formula_8 iff formula_9.\nDefine formula_10 iff formula_6 for some formula_12.\nDefine formula_13 iff there exists a function formula_7 that is implicitly logspace computable, such that formula_8 iff formula_9.\nP-complete.\nDefine a language formula_17 to be P-complete relative to NCk-reduction iff for any language formula_17 in P, formula_6. Similarly for the other cases. \nUsually for P-completeness, NC-reduction is meant by default, though many results in the literature concerning P-completeness still holds even under the strongest assumption of NC1-reduction.\nP-completeness is usually used thus: First, a problem is shown to be P-complete relative to NCk-reduction. Next, assuming that the L-uniform NCk complexity class is strictly smaller than the P class, one immediately conclude that all P-complete and P-hard problems (assuming the same reduction type) are impossible to solve by L-uniform NCk circuit families. In other words, such problems cannot be parallelized, for a certain sense of \"parallelization\".\nP-complete problems.\nThe most basic P-complete problem under logspace many-one reductions is following: given a Turing machine formula_20, an input for that machine x, and a number \"T\" (written in unary), formula_21 does that machine halt on that input within the first \"T\" steps? For any x in formula_22 in P, output the encoding of the Turing machine which accepts it in polynomial-time, the encoding of x itself, and a number of steps formula_23 corresponding to the p which is there polynomial-time bound on the operation of the Turing Machine formula_24 deciding formula_22, formula_26. The machine M halts on x within formula_27 steps if and only if x is in L. Clearly, if we can parallelize a general simulation of a sequential computer (ie. The Turing machine simulation of a Turing machine), then we will be able to parallelize any program that runs on that computer. If this problem is in NC, then so is every other problem in P. If the number of steps is written in binary, the problem is EXPTIME-complete.\nThis problem illustrates a common trick in the theory of P-completeness. We aren't really interested in whether a problem can be solved quickly on a parallel machine. We're just interested in whether a parallel machine solves it \"much more\" quickly than a sequential machine. Therefore, we have to reword the problem so that the sequential version is in P. That is why this problem required \"T\" to be written in unary. If a number \"T\" is written as a binary number (a string of \"n\" ones and zeros, where \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a0log\u00a0\"T\"), then the obvious sequential algorithm can take time 2\"n\". On the other hand, if \"T\" is written as a unary number (a string of \"n\" ones, where \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"T\"), then it only takes time \"n\". By writing \"T\" in unary rather than binary, we have reduced the obvious sequential algorithm from exponential time to linear time. That puts the sequential problem in P. Then, it will be in NC if and only if it is parallelizable.\nMany other problems have been proved to be P-complete, and therefore are widely believed to be inherently sequential. These include the \nfollowing problems which are P-complete under at least logspace reductions, either as given, or in a decision-problem form:\nMost of the languages above are P-complete under even stronger notions of reduction, such as uniform formula_28 many-one reductions, DLOGTIME reductions, or polylogarithmic projections.\nIn order to prove that a given problem in P is P-complete, one typically tries to reduce a known P-complete problem to the given one.\nIn 1999, Jin-Yi Cai and D. Sivakumar, building on work by Ogihara, showed that if there exists a sparse language that is P-complete, then L\u00a0=\u00a0P.\nP-complete problems may be solvable with different time complexities. For instance, the circuit value problem can be solved in linear time by a topological sort. Of course, because the reductions to a P-complete problem may have different time complexities, this fact does not imply that all the problems in P can also be solved in linear time."}

The problems that are PSPACE-complete can be thought of as the hardest problems in PSPACE, the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial space, because a solution to any one such problem could easily be used to solve any other problem in PSPACE.\nProblems known to be PSPACE-complete include determining properties of regular expressions and context-sensitive grammars, determining the truth of quantified Boolean formulas, step-by-step changes between solutions of combinatorial optimization problems, and many puzzles and games.\nTheory.\nA problem is defined to be PSPACE-complete if it can be solved using a polynomial amount of memory (it belongs to PSPACE) and every problem in PSPACE can be transformed in polynomial time into an equivalent instance of the given problem.\nThe PSPACE-complete problems are widely suspected to be outside the more famous complexity classes P (polynomial time) and NP (non-deterministic polynomial time), but that is not known. It is known that they lie outside of the class NC, a class of problems with highly efficient parallel algorithms, because problems in NC can be solved in an amount of space polynomial in the logarithm of the input size, and the class of problems solvable in such a small amount of space is strictly contained in PSPACE by the space hierarchy theorem.\nThe transformations that are usually considered in defining PSPACE-completeness are polynomial-time many-one reductions, transformations that take a single instance of a problem of one type into an equivalent single instance of a problem of a different type. However, it is also possible to define completeness using Turing reductions, in which one problem can be solved in a polynomial number of calls to a subroutine for the other problem. It is not known whether these two types of reductions lead to different classes of PSPACE-complete problems. Other types of reductions, such as many-one reductions that always increase the length of the transformed input, have also been considered.\nA version of the Berman\u2013Hartmanis conjecture for PSPACE-complete sets states that all such sets look alike, in the sense that they can all be transformed into each other by polynomial-time bijections.\nExamples.\nFormal languages.\nGiven a regular expression formula_1, determining whether it generates every string over its alphabet is PSPACE-complete.\nThe first known PSPACE-complete problem was the word problem for deterministic context-sensitive grammars. In the word problem for context-sensitive grammars, one is given a set of grammatical transformations which can increase, but cannot decrease, the length of a sentence, and wishes to determine if a given sentence could be produced by these transformations. The technical condition of \"determinism\" (implying roughly that each transformation makes it obvious that it was used) ensures that this process can be solved in polynomial space, and showed that every (possibly non-deterministic) program computable in linear space could be converted into the parsing of a context-sensitive grammar, in a way which preserves determinism. In 1970, Savitch's theorem showed that PSPACE is closed under nondeterminism, implying that even non-deterministic context-sensitive grammars are in PSPACE.\nLogic.\nA standard PSPACE-complete problem, used in many other PSPACE-completeness results, is the quantified Boolean formula problem, a generalization of the Boolean satisfiability problem. The quantified Boolean formula problem takes as input a Boolean expression, with all of its variables quantified either universally or existentially, for example:\nformula_2\nThe output of the problem is the value of the quantified expression. Finding this value is PSPACE-complete.\nReconfiguration.\nReconfiguration problems concern the connectivity of a state space of solutions to a combinatorial problem. For instance, testing whether two 4-colorings of a graph can be connected to each other by moves that change the color of one vertex at a time, maintaining at each step a valid 4-coloring, is PSPACE-complete, even though the same problem for 3-colorings can be solved in polynomial time. Another family of reconfiguration problems, used similarly to quantified Boolean formulas as the basis for PSPACE-completeness proofs of many other problems in this area, involve nondeterministic constraint logic, in which the states are orientations of a constraint graph subject to certain constraints on how many edges must be oriented inwards at each vertex, and in which the moves from state to state reverse the orientation of a single edge.\nPuzzles and games.\nThe quantified Boolean formula problem can be interpreted as a game by two players, a verifier and a falsifier. The players make moves that fill in values for the quantified variables, in the order they are nested, with the verifier filling in existentially quantified variables and the falsifier filling in universally quantified variables; the game is won by the verifier if the filled-in formula becomes true, and by the falsifier otherwise. A quantified formula is true if and only if the verifier has a winning strategy. Similarly, the problem of determining the winner or loser of many other combinatorial games turns out to be PSPACE-complete. Examples of games that are PSPACE-complete (when generalized so that they can be played on an formula_3 board) are the games Hex and Reversi. Some other generalized games, such as chess, checkers (draughts), and Go are EXPTIME-complete because a game between two perfect players can be very long, so they are unlikely to be in PSPACE. But they will become PSPACE-complete if a polynomial bound on the number of moves is enforced.\nIt is also possible for puzzles played by a single player to be PSPACE-complete. These often can be interpreted as reconfiguration problems, and include the solitaire games Rush Hour, Mahjong, Atomix and Sokoban, and the mechanical computer Turing Tumble.\nPSPACE-completeness is based on complexity as a function of the input size formula_4, in the limit as formula_4 grows without bound. Puzzles or games with a bounded number of positions such as chess on a conventional formula_6 board cannot be PSPACE-complete, because they could be solved in constant time and space using a very large lookup table. To formulate PSPACE-complete versions of these games, they must be modified in a way that makes their number of positions unbounded, such as by playing them on an formula_3 board instead. In some cases, such as for chess, these extensions are artificial.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This means that given an oracle for Y, there exists an algorithm that solves X in polynomial time (possibly by repeatedly using that oracle).\nNP-easy is another name for FPNP (see the function problem article) or for F\u03942P (see the polynomial hierarchy article).\nAn example of an NP-easy problem is the problem of sorting a list of strings. The decision problem \"is string A greater than string B\" is in NP.

Therefore, sorting is NP-easy.\nThere are also more difficult problems that are NP-easy. See NP-equivalent for an example.\nThe definition of NP-easy uses a Turing reduction rather than a many-one reduction because the answers to problem \"Y\" are only TRUE or FALSE, but the answers to problem \"X\" can be more general.

Given a set of integers, FIND-SUBSET-SUM is the problem of finding some nonempty subset of the integers that adds up to zero (or returning the empty set if there is no such subset). This optimization problem is similar to the decision problem SUBSET-SUM. Given a set of integers, SUBSET-SUM is the problem of finding whether there exists a subset summing to zero. SUBSET-SUM is NP-complete.\nTo show that FIND-SUBSET-SUM is NP-equivalent, we must show that it is both NP-hard and NP-easy.\nClearly it is NP-hard.

Simply ask the black box to find the subset that sums to zero, then check whether it returned a nonempty set.\nIt is also NP-easy.

The term was coined by IBM to describe devices that allowed random access to data, the main examples being drum memory and hard disk drives. Later, optical disc drives and flash memory units are also classified as DASD.\nThe term DASD contrasts with sequential access storage device such as a magnetic tape drive, and unit record equipment such as a punched card device. A record on a DASD can be accessed without having to read through intervening records from the current location, whereas reading anything other than the \"next\" record on tape or deck of cards requires skipping over intervening records, and requires a proportionally long time to access a distant point in a medium. Access methods for DASD include sequential, partitioned, indexed, and direct. \nThe DASD storage class includes both fixed and removable media.\nArchitecture.\nIBM mainframes access I/O devices including DASD through \"channels\", a type of subordinate mini-processor. \"Channel programs\" write to, read from, and control the given device. IBM direct access storage devices prior to System/360 have a variety of architectures, as do newer devices outside of the S/360 line, but the DASD in IBM mainframe for S/360 to IBM Z use only three DASD architectue\nCTR (CHR).\nThe operating system uses a four byte relative track and record (TTR) for some access methods and for others an eight-byte extent-bin-cylinder-track-record block address, or MBBCCHHR Channel programs address DASD using a six byte seek address and a five byte record identifier (CCHHR).\nFor devices prior to extended address volumes, the seek address is\nWhen the 2321 data cell was discontinued in January 1975, the addressing scheme and the device itself was referred to as CHR or CTR for cylinder-track-record, as the bin number was always 0.\nIBM refers to the data records programmers work with as \"logical records\", and the format on DASD as blocks or \"physical records\". One block might contain several logical (or user) records or, in some schemes, called \"spanned records\", partial logical records.\nPhysical records can have any size up to the limit of a track, but some devices have a track overflow feature that allows breaking a large block into track-size segments within the same cylinder.\nThe queued-access methods, such as QSAM, are responsible for \"blocking\" and \"deblocking\" logical records as they are written to or read from external media. The basic-access methods, such as BSAM, require the user program to do it. \nCKD.\nCKD is an acronym for \"Count Key Data\", the physical layout of a block on a DASD device, and should not be confused with BBCCH and CCHHR, which are the addresses used by the channel program. CTR in this context may refer to either type of address, depending on the channel command.\nFBA.\nIn 1979 IBM introduced \"Fixed-block architecture\" (FBA) for mainframes. At the programming level, these devices do not use the traditional CHR addressing, but reference fixed-length blocks by number, much like sectors in mini-computers. More correctly, the application programmer remains unaware of the underlying storage arrangement, which stores the data in fixed physical block lengths of 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096, depending on the device type. As part of the FBA interface IBM introduced new channel commands for asynchronous operation that are very similar to those introduced for ECKD.\nFor some applications, FBA not only offers simplicity, but an increase in throughput.\nFBA is supported by VM/370 and DOS/VSE, but not MVS or successor operating systems in the OS/360 line.\nFCP attached SCSI.\nProcessors with FICON channels can access SCSI drives using Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP). While z/VM and z/VSE fully support FCP, z/OS provides only limited support through IOSFBA.\nAccess.\nSome programming interface macros and routines are collectively referred to as \"access methods\" with names ending in Access Method.\nDOS/360 and successors.\nDOS/360 through z/VSE support datasets on DASD with the following access methods:\nOS/360 and successors.\nOS/360 through z/OS support datasets on DASD with the following access methods:\nIn MVS, starting with OS/VS2 Release 2 and continuing through z/OS, all of the access methods including EXCP[VR], use the privileged STARTIO macro.\nTerminology.\nIBM in its 1964 first version of the \"IBM System/360 System Summary\" used the term \"File\" to collectively described devices now called DASD. Files provided \"random-access storage'\" At the same time IBM's product reference manual described such devices as \"direct-access storage devices\" without any acronym.\nAn early public use of the acronym DASD is in IBM's March 1966 manual, \"Data File Handbook.\" The earliest non-IBM use of the acronym DASD found by the \"Google ngram viewer\" to refer to storage devices dates from 1968. From then on use of the term grew exponentially until 1990 after which its usage declined substantially.\nBoth drums and data cells have disappeared as products, so DASD remains as a synonym of disk, flash and optical devices. Modern DASD used in mainframes only very rarely consist of single disk-drives. Most commonly \"DASD\" means large disk arrays utilizing RAID schemes.

This is one way to see that PSPACE \u2286 EXPTIME, since an alternating Turing machine is at least as powerful as a deterministic Turing machine.\nEXPTIME-complete.\nA decision problem is EXPTIME-complete if it is in EXPTIME and every problem in EXPTIME has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it. In other words, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that transforms instances of one to instances of the other with the same answer. Problems that are EXPTIME-complete might be thought of as the hardest problems in EXPTIME. Notice that although it is unknown whether NP is equal to P, we do know that EXPTIME-complete problems are not in P; it has been proven that these problems cannot be solved in polynomial time, by the time hierarchy theorem.\nIn computability theory, one of the basic undecidable problems is the halting problem: deciding whether a deterministic Turing machine (DTM) halts. One of the most fundamental EXPTIME-complete problems is a simpler version of this, which asks if a DTM halts on a given input in at most \"k\" steps. It is in EXPTIME because a trivial simulation requires O(\"k\") time, and the input \"k\" is encoded using O(log \"k\") bits which causes exponential number of simulations. It is EXPTIME-complete because, roughly speaking, we can use it to determine if a machine solving an EXPTIME problem accepts in an exponential number of steps; it will not use more. The same problem with the number of steps written in unary is P-complete.\nOther examples of EXPTIME-complete problems include the problem of evaluating a position in generalized chess, checkers, or Go (with Japanese ko rules). These games have a chance of being EXPTIME-complete because games can last for a number of moves that is exponential in the size of the board. In the Go example, the Japanese ko rule is known to imply EXPTIME-completeness, but it is not known if the American or Chinese rules for the game are EXPTIME-complete (they could range from PSPACE to EXPSPACE).\nBy contrast, generalized games that can last for a number of moves that is polynomial in the size of the board are often PSPACE-complete. The same is true of exponentially long games in which non-repetition is automatic.\nSuccinct circuits.\nAnother set of important EXPTIME-complete problems relates to succinct circuits. The idea is that if we can exponentially compress the description of a problem that requires polynomial time, then that compressed problem would require exponential time.\nAs one example, some graphs can be succinctly described by a small Boolean circuit. The circuit has formula_1 inputs, 1 output and formula_2 gates, thus requiring formula_2 bits to describe. The circuit represents a graph with formula_4 vertices. For each pair of vertices, if the binary code for the two vertices are put into the circuit, then the output of the circuit states whether the two vertices are connected by an edge.\nFor many naturally occurring P-complete decision problems about graphs, where the graph is expressed in a natural representation such as an adjacency matrix, solving the same problem on a succinct circuit representation is EXPTIME-complete, because the input is exponentially smaller; but this requires nontrivial proof, since succinct circuits can only describe a subclass of graphs.\nGenerically, a Boolean circuit with formula_5 inputs and a single output is a succinct representation of a string of formula_4 bits, which can be used to describe some other object, such as a graph, a 3-CNF formula, etc. For essentially all known NP-complete problems, the succinct version of it is NEXP-complete. In particular, SUCCINCT 3-SAT is NEXP-complete under polynomial-time reductions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is in contrast to the previous concept of highly reliable mainframe disk drives known as \"single large expensive disk\" (\"SLED\").\nData is distributed across the drives in one of several ways, referred to as RAID levels, depending on the required level of redundancy and performance. The different schemes, or data distribution layouts, are named by the word \"RAID\" followed by a number, for example RAID\u00a00 or RAID\u00a01. Each scheme, or RAID level, provides a different balance among the key goals: reliability, availability, performance, and capacity. RAID levels greater than RAID\u00a00 provide protection against unrecoverable sector read errors, as well as against failures of whole physical drives.\nHistory.\nThe term \"RAID\" was invented by David Patterson, Garth Gibson, and Randy Katz at the University of California, Berkeley in 1987. In their June 1988 paper \"A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)\", presented at the SIGMOD Conference, they argued that the top-performing mainframe disk drives of the time could be beaten on performance by an array of the inexpensive drives that had been developed for the growing personal computer market. Although failures would rise in proportion to the number of drives, by configuring for redundancy, the reliability of an array could far exceed that of any large single drive.\nAlthough not yet using that terminology, the technologies of the five levels of RAID named in the June 1988 paper were used in various products prior to the paper's publication, including the following:\nIndustry manufacturers later redefined the RAID acronym to stand for \"redundant array of \"independent\" disks\".\nOverview.\nMany RAID levels employ an error protection scheme called \"parity\", a widely used method in information technology to provide fault tolerance in a given set of data. Most use simple XOR, but RAID\u00a06 uses two separate parities based respectively on addition and multiplication in a particular Galois field or Reed\u2013Solomon error correction.\nRAID can also provide data security with solid-state drives (SSDs) without the expense of an all-SSD system. For example, a fast SSD can be mirrored with a mechanical drive. For this configuration to provide a significant speed advantage, an appropriate controller is needed that uses the fast SSD for all read operations. Adaptec calls this \"hybrid RAID\".\nStandard levels.\nOriginally, there were five standard levels of RAID, but many variations have evolved, including several nested levels and many non-standard levels (mostly proprietary). RAID levels and their associated data formats are standardized by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) in the Common RAID Disk Drive Format (DDF) standard:\n By contrast, a spanned volume, which stores files sequentially, loses data stored on the failed drive but preserves data stored on the remaining drives. However, recovering the files after drive failure can be challenging and often depends on the specifics of the filesystem. Regardless, files that span onto or off a failed drive will be permanently lost.\n On the other hand, the benefit of RAID\u00a00 is that the throughput of read and write operations to any file is multiplied by the number of drives because, unlike spanned volumes, reads and writes are performed concurrently. The cost is increased vulnerability to drive failures\u2014since any drive in a RAID\u00a00 setup failing causes the entire volume to be lost, the average failure rate of the volume rises with the number of attached drives. This makes RAID\u00a00 a poor choice for scenarios requiring data reliability or fault tolerance.\nNested (hybrid) RAID.\nIn what was originally termed \"hybrid RAID\", many storage controllers allow RAID levels to be nested. The elements of a \"RAID\" may be either individual drives or arrays themselves. Arrays are rarely nested more than one level deep.\nThe final array is known as the top array. When the top array is RAID\u00a00 (such as in RAID\u00a01+0 and RAID\u00a05+0), most vendors omit the \"+\" (yielding RAID\u00a010 and RAID\u00a050, respectively).\nNon-standard levels.\nMany configurations other than the basic numbered RAID levels are possible, and many companies, organizations, and groups have created their own non-standard configurations, in many cases designed to meet the specialized needs of a small niche group. Such configurations include the following:\nImplementations.\nThe distribution of data across multiple drives can be managed either by dedicated computer hardware or by software. A software solution may be part of the operating system, part of the firmware and drivers supplied with a standard drive controller (so-called \"hardware-assisted software RAID\"), or it may reside entirely within the hardware RAID controller.\nHardware-based.\nHardware RAID controllers can be configured through card BIOS or Option ROM before an operating system is booted, and after the operating system is booted, proprietary configuration utilities are available from the manufacturer of each controller. Unlike the network interface controllers for Ethernet, which can usually be configured and serviced entirely through the common operating system paradigms like ifconfig in Unix, without a need for any third-party tools, each manufacturer of each RAID controller usually provides their own proprietary software tooling for each operating system that they deem to support, ensuring a vendor lock-in, and contributing to reliability issues.\nFor example, in FreeBSD, in order to access the configuration of Adaptec RAID controllers, users are required to enable Linux compatibility layer, and use the Linux tooling from Adaptec, potentially compromising the stability, reliability and security of their setup, especially when taking the long-term view.\nSome other operating systems have implemented their own generic frameworks for interfacing with any RAID controller, and provide tools for monitoring RAID volume status, as well as facilitation of drive identification through LED blinking, alarm management and hot spare disk designations from within the operating system without having to reboot into card BIOS. For example, this was the approach taken by OpenBSD in 2005 with its bio(4) pseudo-device and the bioctl utility, which provide volume status, and allow LED/alarm/hotspare control, as well as the sensors (including the drive sensor) for health monitoring; this approach has subsequently been adopted and extended by NetBSD in 2007 as well.\nSoftware-based.\nSoftware RAID implementations are provided by many modern operating systems. Software RAID can be implemented as:\nSome advanced file systems are designed to organize data across multiple storage devices directly, without needing the help of a third-party logical volume manager:\nMany operating systems provide RAID implementations, including the following:\nIf a boot drive fails, the system has to be sophisticated enough to be able to boot from the remaining drive or drives. For instance, consider a computer whose disk is configured as RAID\u00a01 (mirrored drives); if the first drive in the array fails, then a first-stage boot loader might not be sophisticated enough to attempt loading the second-stage boot loader from the second drive as a fallback. The second-stage boot loader for FreeBSD is capable of loading a kernel from such an array.\nFirmware- and driver-based.\nSoftware-implemented RAID is not always compatible with the system's boot process, and it is generally impractical for desktop versions of Windows. However, hardware RAID controllers are expensive and proprietary. To fill this gap, inexpensive \"RAID controllers\" were introduced that do not contain a dedicated RAID controller chip, but simply a standard drive controller chip, or the chipset built-in RAID function, with proprietary firmware and drivers. During early bootup, the RAID is implemented by the firmware and, once the operating system has been more completely loaded, the drivers take over control. Consequently, such controllers may not work when driver support is not available for the host operating system. An example is Intel Rapid Storage Technology, implemented on many consumer-level motherboards.\nBecause some minimal hardware support is involved, this implementation is also called \"hardware-assisted software RAID\", \"hybrid model\" RAID, or even \"fake RAID\". If RAID\u00a05 is supported, the hardware may provide a hardware XOR accelerator. An advantage of this model over the pure software RAID is that\u2014if using a redundancy mode\u2014the boot drive is protected from failure (due to the firmware) during the boot process even before the operating system's drivers take over.\nIntegrity.\nData scrubbing (referred to in some environments as \"patrol read\") involves periodic reading and checking by the RAID controller of all the blocks in an array, including those not otherwise accessed. This detects bad blocks before use. Data scrubbing checks for bad blocks on each storage device in an array, but also uses the redundancy of the array to recover bad blocks on a single drive and to reassign the recovered data to spare blocks elsewhere on the drive.\nFrequently, a RAID controller is configured to \"drop\" a component drive (that is, to assume a component drive has failed) if the drive has been unresponsive for eight seconds or so; this might cause the array controller to drop a good drive because that drive has not been given enough time to complete its internal error recovery procedure. Consequently, using consumer-marketed drives with RAID can be risky, and so-called \"enterprise class\" drives limit this error recovery time to reduce risk. Western Digital's desktop drives used to have a specific fix. A utility called WDTLER.exe limited a drive's error recovery time. The utility enabled TLER (time limited error recovery), which limits the error recovery time to seven seconds. Around September 2009, Western Digital disabled this feature in their desktop drives (such as the Caviar Black line), making such drives unsuitable for use in RAID configurations. However, Western Digital enterprise class drives are shipped from the factory with TLER enabled. Similar technologies are used by Seagate, Samsung, and Hitachi. For non-RAID usage, an enterprise class drive with a short error recovery timeout that cannot be changed is therefore less suitable than a desktop drive. In late 2010, the Smartmontools program began supporting the configuration of ATA Error Recovery Control, allowing the tool to configure many desktop class hard drives for use in RAID setups.\nWhile RAID may protect against physical drive failure, the data is still exposed to operator, software, hardware, and virus destruction. Many studies cite operator fault as a common source of malfunction, such as a server operator replacing the incorrect drive in a faulty RAID, and disabling the system (even temporarily) in the process.\nAn array can be overwhelmed by catastrophic failure that exceeds its recovery capacity and the entire array is at risk of physical damage by fire, natural disaster, and human forces, however backups can be stored off site. An array is also vulnerable to controller failure because it is not always possible to migrate it to a new, different controller without data loss.\nWeaknesses.\nCorrelated failures.\nIn practice, the drives are often the same age (with similar wear) and subject to the same environment. Since many drive failures are due to mechanical issues (which are more likely on older drives), this violates the assumptions of independent, identical rate of failure amongst drives; failures are in fact statistically correlated. In practice, the chances for a second failure before the first has been recovered (causing data loss) are higher than the chances for random failures. In a study of about 100,000 drives from at least four different vendors, the probability of two drives in the same cluster failing within one hour was four times larger than predicted by the exponential statistical distribution\u2014which characterizes processes in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. The probability of two failures in the same 10-hour period was twice as large as predicted by an exponential distribution.\nAn avoidable mode of correlated disk failure is the \"batch-correlated disk failure\", in which the array is built out of disks from the same batch and ends up with disks failing in quick succession. Such events are rare but not unheard of. The standard recommendation is to mix disks from different batches, possibly different manufacturers. A 2021 study describes the batch-correlated failure patterns in multiple SSD-based datacenters at Alibaba, where 88.6% of nodes with at least 2 SSDs are using the same model.\nAnother source of correlated disk failure lies not in the disk, but in the interconnects, CPU, or memory. Jiang et al. (2008) showed that only 20\u201355% of storage system failures were due to disks. These parts also have a bursty, correlated failure mode.\nUnrecoverable read errors during rebuild.\nUnrecoverable read errors (URE) present as sector read failures, also known as latent sector errors (LSE). The associated media assessment measure, unrecoverable bit error (UBE) rate, is typically guaranteed to be less than one bit in 1015 for enterprise-class drives (SCSI, FC, SAS or SATA), and less than one bit in 1014 for desktop-class drives (IDE/ATA/PATA or SATA). Increasing drive capacities and large RAID\u00a05 instances have led to the maximum error rates being insufficient to guarantee a successful recovery, due to the high likelihood of such an error occurring on one or more remaining drives during a RAID set rebuild. When rebuilding, parity-based schemes such as RAID\u00a05 are particularly prone to the effects of UREs as they affect not only the sector where they occur, but also reconstructed blocks using that sector for parity computation.\nDouble-protection parity-based schemes, such as RAID\u00a06, attempt to address this issue by providing redundancy that allows double-drive failures; as a downside, such schemes suffer from elevated write penalty\u2014the number of times the storage medium must be accessed during a single write operation. Schemes that duplicate (mirror) data in a drive-to-drive manner, such as RAID\u00a01 and RAID\u00a010, have a lower risk from UREs than those using parity computation or mirroring between striped sets. Data scrubbing, as a background process, can be used to detect and recover from UREs, effectively reducing the risk of them happening during RAID rebuilds and causing double-drive failures. The recovery of UREs involves remapping of affected underlying disk sectors, utilizing the drive's sector remapping pool; in case of UREs detected during background scrubbing, data redundancy provided by a fully operational RAID set allows the missing data to be reconstructed and rewritten to a remapped sector.\nThe behavior of the RAID implementation on encountering on a rebuild also matters. Some implementations \"puncture\" the array when a URE is encountered, marking the sector/block as inaccessible but continuing with the rebuild. Others may simply abort the procedure.\nIncreasing rebuild time and failure probability.\nDrive capacity has grown at a much faster rate than transfer speed, and error rates have only fallen a little in comparison. Therefore, larger-capacity drives may take hours if not days to rebuild, during which time other drives may fail or yet undetected read errors may surface. The rebuild time is also limited if the entire array is still in operation at reduced capacity. Given an array with only one redundant drive (which applies to RAID levels 3, 4 and 5, and to \"classic\" two-drive RAID\u00a01), a second drive failure would cause complete failure of the array. Even though individual drives' mean time between failure (MTBF) have increased over time, this increase has not kept pace with the increased storage capacity of the drives. The time to rebuild the array after a single drive failure, as well as the chance of a second failure during a rebuild, have increased over time.\nSome commentators have declared that RAID\u00a06 is only a \"band aid\" in this respect, because it only kicks the problem a little further down the road. However, according to the 2006 NetApp study of Berriman et al., the chance of failure decreases by a factor of about 3,800 (relative to RAID\u00a05) for a proper implementation of RAID\u00a06, even when using commodity drives. Nevertheless, if the currently observed technology trends remain unchanged, in 2019 a RAID\u00a06 array will have the same chance of failure as its RAID\u00a05 counterpart had in 2010.\nMirroring schemes such as RAID\u00a010 have a bounded recovery time as they require the copy of a single failed drive, compared with parity schemes such as RAID\u00a06, which require the copy of all blocks of the drives in an array set. Triple parity schemes, or triple mirroring, have been suggested as one approach to improve resilience to an additional drive failure during this large rebuild time.\nAtomicity.\nA system crash or other interruption of a write operation can result in states where the parity is inconsistent with the data due to non-atomicity of the write process, such that the parity cannot be used for recovery in the case of a disk failure. This is commonly termed the \"write hole\" which is a known data corruption issue in older and low-end RAIDs, caused by interrupted destaging of writes to disk. The write hole can be addressed in a few ways:\nWrite hole is a little understood and rarely mentioned failure mode for redundant storage systems that do not utilize transactional features. Database researcher Jim Gray wrote \"Update in Place is a Poison Apple\" during the early days of relational database commercialization.\nWrite-cache reliability.\nThere are concerns about write-cache reliability, specifically regarding devices equipped with a write-back cache, which is a caching system that reports the data as written as soon as it is written to cache, as opposed to when it is written to the non-volatile medium. If the system experiences a power loss or other major failure, the data may be irrevocably lost from the cache before reaching the non-volatile storage. For this reason good write-back cache implementations include mechanisms, such as redundant battery power, to preserve cache contents across system failures (including power failures) and to flush the cache at system restart time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was educated at Shrewsbury School, where he was not particularly successful academically but met his future \"Private Eye\" colleagues Richard Ingrams, Paul Foot and Christopher Booker. He also contributed to the satirical magazine \"The Wallopian\" (a play on the school magazine name \"The Salopian\"), mocking school spirit, traditions and the masters. Later, he said he recalled little of his schooldays, except that \"it was Blandings country. The sort of place where you go to die, not to be educated.\"\nAfter school, Rushton had to undertake two years of national service in the army, where he failed officer selection. He later commented, \"The Army is, God bless it, one of the funniest institutions on earth and also a sort of microcosm of the world. It's split almost perfectly into our class system. Through serving in the ranks I discovered the basic wit of my fellow man\u00a0\u2013 whom basically, to tell the truth, I'd never met before.\" On leaving the army, he worked in a solicitor's office for a short period.\n\"Private Eye\" and the satire boom.\nRushton remained in contact with his friends from Shrewsbury School, who had added John Wells to their number and were now running their own humour magazines at Oxford University, \"Parsons Pleasure\" and \"Mesopotamia\", to which Rushton made many contributions during his frequent visits to meet them. A cartoon of a giraffe in a bar saying \"The high balls are on me\" was not met with approval by everyone in the university administrative quarters. Rushton suggested that \"Mesopotamia\" could continue after they left university. During his time as a clerk he had been sending his cartoons out to \"Punch\" but none had been accepted. After being knocked over by a bus, he gave up his job as a clerk, determined not to waste another day.\nAfter almost but not quite being accepted by \"Tribune\" (a Labour-supporting newspaper edited by Michael Foot, Paul Foot's uncle), Rushton found a place at the \"Liberal News\", which was also employing Christopher Booker as a journalist. From June 1960 until March 1961, he contributed a weekly strip, \"Brimstone Belcher\", following the exploits of the titular journalist (a forerunner of \"Private Eye\"'s Lunchtime O'Booze), from bizarre skulduggery in the British colonies (where the soldiers holding back the politicised rabble bear a strong resemblance to privates Rushton and Ingrams), travelogues through the US, and the hazards of by-electioneering as the independent candidate for the constituency of Gumboot North. After the strip folded, Rushton still contributed a weekly political cartoon to the \"Liberal News\" until mid-1962.\nThe Salopians finally found a financier for their magazine and the first issue of \"Private Eye\" was published on 25 October 1961. Rushton created the magazine in his bedroom in Scarsdale Villas using Letraset and cow-gumming illustrations onto cards which were taken away to be photo-lithographed. He also contributed all the illustrations and the mast-head figure of Little Gnitty (who still appears on the cover, a blended caricature of John Wells and the \"Daily Express\" standard-head). One critic described the original lay-out of the magazine as owing much to \"Neo-Brechtian Nihilism\", although Rushton thought it resembled a betting shop floor. One feature in the early issues was the \"Aesop Revisited\", a full-page comic strip which let him work in a wealth of puns and background jokes.\nWith \"Private Eye\" riding the satire boom, Peter Cook soon took an interest and contributed two serials recounting the bizarre adventures of Sir Basil Nardly-Stoads and the Rhandi Phurr, both of which were illustrated by Rushton, as was \"Mrs Wilson's Diary\". In the early days the team also worked on two books, \"Private Eye on London\" and \"Private Eye's Romantic England\" that made heavy use of Rushton's cartooning talents. One of the first \"Private Eye\"-published books was Rushton's first collection of cartoons, \"Willie Rushton's Dirty Weekend Book\", which was subsequently banned in Ireland on the grounds of its explicitness.\nReuniting with his Salopian friends had also reawakened Rushton's taste for acting. After they had finished university, he had accompanied his friends in a well-received revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. (Richard Burton even appeared one night in their parody of \"Luther\".) In 1961, Richard Ingrams directed a production of Spike Milligan's surreal post-nuclear apocalypse farce \"The Bed-Sitting Room\", in which Rushton was hailed by Kenneth Tynan as \"brilliant\". But it was a cabaret at the Room at the Top, a chicken-in-a-basket nightclub at the top of a department store in Ilford, that really launched his career. Rushton recalled meeting the Kray twins in the audience one night and that fellow performer Barbara Windsor \"wouldn't come out for a drink that night\". The revue also starred John Wells.\nRushton's impersonation of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan caught the attention of Ned Sherrin, a young BBC producer searching for talent to appear in a forthcoming TV satire series. \"That Was the Week That Was\" (aka \"TW3\") ran from November 1962 until December 1963. It drew audiences of up to 13 million, making stars of its cast, particularly David Frost. Rushton became known for his impersonation of the Prime Minister, a daring novelty in those respectful days. \"It's the only impersonation that people have ever actually recognised\u00a0\u2013 so I'm very grateful to the old bugger\u00a0... But then I had voted for him, so he owed me something.\" Rushton also appeared on the original flexi-discs of skits, squibs and invective that \"Private Eye\" gave away, having success with two self-penned songs: \"Neasden\" and the \"Bum Song\". He also wrote songs for \"TW3\", many of which were revisited on later solo albums like \"Now in Bottles\" and \"The Complete Works\".\nIn the autumn of 1963, a health scare led Macmillan to resign and Alec Douglas-Home became prime minister. It was necessary that Douglas-Home resign his peerage to find a safe Parliamentary seat. The \"Private Eye\" team were so disgusted by the Conservative Party's machinations that they decided to stand their own protest candidate in the Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election. Since he was the most well-known member of the team, Rushton was the obvious choice to stand. Rushton gained much attention from journalists, since he stood under the slogan \"Death to the Tories\". He polled only 45 votes, having advised his supporters at the last minute to vote Liberal, the Conservatives' only credible challenger. Douglas-Home won.\nRushton described his political beliefs as being \"left of Limbo\" stating that he had always voted for Labour because he felt their attitude to life was \"more generous than anyone else's\" but would happily take potshots at anyone who said something silly.\nFilms, television and radio.\nWhen \"TW3\" was cancelled in anticipation of the 1964 election, Rushton and some of the cast, as well as some of the members of the Cambridge University revue \"Cambridge Circus\" (including future Goodies Tim Brooke-Taylor and Bill Oddie), went on tour in America as \"David Frost Presents TW3\". Rushton and Barry Fantoni (another \"Private Eye\" contributor) entered a painting titled \"Nude Reclining\", a satirical portrait of three establishment types, for the 1963 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition under the name of Stuart Harris, which excited much controversy. He also began a career as a character actor for films in 1963. In late 1964 Rushton was involved as one of the hosts in the early episodes of another satirical programme, \"Not So Much a Programme\", but drifted away as it became the vehicle that launched David Frost as a chat show host. In 1964 he appeared as Richard Burbage in Sherrin and Caryl Brahms' musical of \"No Bed for Bacon\", while his early stature as a personality was confirmed by a cartoon advert he devised for the Brewers' Society proclaiming the charms of the local pub. Rushton performed his own host duties for \"New Stars and Garters\", a variety entertainment show in 1965, where he first met Arlene Dorgan. He also appeared as a guest in programmes including \"Not Only... But Also\" with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.\nDuring the late 1960s, Rushton spent much of his time in Australia, following Dorgan back to her homeland. He married her in 1968. He also had several series of his own on Australian television, \"Don\u2019t Adjust Your Set \u2013 The Programme is at Fault\" and \"From Rushton with Love\". He said of Australia, \"They've got their priorities right, they're dedicated to lying in the sun, knocking back ice-cold beer\". During this period he found time to model for \"She\" magazine and also appear in a 1967 stage production of \"Treasure Island\" as Squire Trelawney, alongside Spike Milligan and Barry Humphries, at the Mermaid Theatre in London. It was on one of his return visits to the UK in 1968 that he also brought back the late Tony Hancock's ashes to the UK in an Air France bag\u00a0\u2013 \"My session with the Customs was a Hancock's Half Hour in itself.\"\nHe appeared in cameo roles in films, including \"Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\" (1965), \"Monte Carlo or Bust\" (1969), \"The Best House in London\" (1969) and \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\" (1972). He played Tim Brooke-Taylor's gay husband in Sharon Tate's last film before her murder, \"The Thirteen Chairs\" (1969), and Tobias Cromwell in \"Flight of the Doves\" (1971), as well as appearing in sex comedies such as \"Keep It Up Downstairs\" (1976), \"Adventures of a Private Eye\" (1977) and \"Adventures of a Plumber's Mate\" (1978). His final film appearance was as Big Teddy in \"Consuming Passions\" released in 1988. As a TV actor in the 1970s he appeared in episodes of popular programmes as different as \"The Persuaders!\", \"Colditz\" (episode: \"The Guests\" \u2013 Major Trumpington in a kilt) and \"Up Pompeii!\" as the narrator Plautus. He was Dr Watson to John Cleese's Sherlock Holmes in N. F. Simpson's surreal comedy \"Elementary, My Dear Watson\". In 1975 and 1976 he appeared in well-received pantomimes of \"Gulliver\u2019s Travels\"; in 1981 in Eric Idle's \"Pass the Butler\"; and in 1988 as Peter Tinniswood's irascible Brigadier in \"Tales from a Long Room\". Rushton also wrote two musicals:\nIn this period, he also found time to contribute seven humorous, spoken word pieces for the double LP, \"http://\".\nHis last major solo TV project was \"Rushton's Illustrated\" (1980; partially wiped by ATV which often did not keep programmes considered of no international sales value). By now he was an established guest on quiz shows and celebrity panel games: \"Celebrity Squares\", \"Blankety Blank\", \"Countdown\" and \"Through the Keyhole\". When asked why he appeared on these \"ludicrous programmes\", his answer was simple: \"Because I meet everybody there\".\nFor 22 years until his death, he was a panellist in the long-running BBC Radio 4 panel comedy game show \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\", which he joined as a regular team member in the third series in 1974. In its later years, the show's wealth of silliness, smut and punning was drawing audiences of up to a thousand people for its recordings. In 1990 he teamed up with his co-panellist Barry Cryer in their own show \"Two old Farts in the Night\", performing to full audiences at the Edinburgh festival, the Royal Albert Hall and the Festival Hall, touring the country irregularly until Rushton's death.\nHe played a recurring character as a policeman in Southern Television's 1970\u201373 children's show \"Little Big Time\" with Freddie Garrity; his policeman's helmet bore a blue flashing light. His manner and voice meant Rushton was in constant demand for adverts, voice-overs and presenting jobs. In the mid-1970s, his reading of \"Winnie the Pooh\" for the BBC's \"Jackanory\" was particularly popular. He also provided all the voices for the claymation animated series \"The Trap Door\" in the late 1980s. He was a popular choice for narrating audio books, especially those for children. In particular he recorded 18 of the books by the Rev. W. Awdry for \"The Railway Stories\" series. He also recorded adaptations of Asterix books and \"Alice in Wonderland\", and provided the voice of the King in the early animated Muzzy films. In the early 1980s he wrote and illustrated a series of children's books about \"The Incredible Cottage\", and provided illustrations for many children's books.\nRushton had not been involved in \"Private Eye\" since the latter part of the 1960s, other than a brief stint illustrating \"Mrs Wilson's Diary\" when the Labour Party came back into power in the mid-1970s. He returned to \"Private Eye\" in 1978 to take over the task of illustrating \"Auberon Waugh's Diary\", which continued until 1986. The cartoons perfectly complemented Auberon Waugh's scabrous and surreal flights of invective, and when Waugh moved his column to \"The Daily Telegraph\" as the \"Way of the World\" in 1990, Rushton followed, drawing at Waugh's instruction such surreal concepts as Richard Ingrams pretending to be a seven-year-old choirgirl, the head of a dead cow coming out of a computer connected to the then-new (in common usage) internet and a nude statue of Benjamin Britten with a bird bath discreetly covering its private parts.\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum, recognising his accomplishments, commissioned 24 large colour illustrations which were collected as \"Willie Rushton's Great Moments of History\". (Rushton had previous experience with the V&amp;A when he had pulled a prank on the institution by labelling an electric plug socket in one of the galleries: \"Plug hole designed by Hans Plug (b. 1908)\", which remained for a full year \u2013 to the great annoyance of a cleaner who had to use a hefty extension lead for 12 months so as not to damage the exhibit.) This large-scale excursion into the use of colour was good practice for the monthly colour covers he created for the \"Literary Review\" when Waugh became its editor in 1986. Rushton drew these covers along with the fortnightly caricatures for \"Private Eye\"'s literary review page until he died.\nRushton had always been conscious of his weight, listing his recreations in \"Who's Who\" as \"gaining weight, losing weight and parking\", and in 1973 he had been the host of a slimming programme, \"Don't Just Sit There\". His first major health scare had been the onset of diabetes (the cause of his father's death in 1958). Having to give up beer, Rushton became, according to Ingrams, \"quite grumpy as a result, but his grumpiness had an admirable and jaunty quality to it.\" A sudden loss of three stone had prevented him from playing in Prince Rainier's XI at Monte Carlo, Monaco. Rushton was always passionate about cricket. His father had sent him for coaching at Lord's before he went to Shrewsbury. His cricket and general knowledge were called upon in his role as a regular team captain on BBC Radio 4's quiz show \"Trivia Test Match\" with Tim Rice and Brian Johnston, which ran from 1986 to 1993. Rushton was always an enthusiastic cricketer, playing in the Lord's Taverners, a charity celebrity cricket team.\nIn 1989 he performed in \"The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball\". His act consisted of singing \"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\" and acting out the lyrics, which left him standing in a top hat, white tie, and tails\u00a0\u2013 but no trousers. In July 1992 Rushton appeared as the King in a performance of Cole Porter's musical satire on the British monarchy \"Jubilee\". He played Uncle Zed in EMI's 40th anniversary recording of \"Salad Days\", conducted by John Owen Edwards, in 1994.\nIn his later years his cartoons were part of an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.\nDeath and memorials.\nRushton died of a heart attack at Cromwell Hospital, Kensington on 11 December 1996, aged 59. Ten years earlier, he had made a jocular prediction that he would die that year. In the first episode of Series 13 of \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\", which aired on 26 July 1986, Chairman Humphrey Lyttelton asked the panellists to \"gaze into their crystal balls\" and make predictions for 1996. Rushton said, \"I'm sorry you introduced this round, because I just spotted a memorial service for myself in Westminster Abbey in January\".\nAmong his last words was the advice, \"Tell Bazza he's too old to do pantomime\", meant for his long-time friend Barry Cryer.\nRushton is honoured by a Comic Heritage blue plaque at Mornington Crescent tube station, a reference to the game Mornington Crescent on \"I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue\".\nBBC Radio 7 showcased his contribution to \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\", in the week of the 10th anniversary of his death, by rebroadcasting five episodes of the show, one on each weekday night (11\u201315 December 2006). The broadcasts chosen included the last shows he recorded for the programme.\nAccording to the autobiography of Nicholas Parsons, Rushton's ashes were buried by the boundary at The Oval cricket ground.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Glottolog considers Kru an independent language family.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Kru\" is of unknown origin. According to Westermann (1952) it was used by Europeans to denote a number of tribes speaking related dialects. Marchese (1989) notes the fact that many of these peoples were recruited as \"crew\" by European seafarers; \"the homonymy with crew is obvious, and is at least one source of the confusion among Europeans that there was a Kru/crew tribe\". \nHistory.\nAndrew Dalby noted the historical importance of the Kru languages for their position at the crossroads of African-European interaction. He wrote that \"Kru and associated languages were among the first to be encountered by European voyagers on what was then known as the Pepper Coast, a centre of the production and export of Guinea and melegueta pepper; a once staple African seaborne trade\". The Kru languages are known for some of the most complex tone systems in Africa, rivaled perhaps only by the Omotic languages.\nCurrent status.\nRecent documentation has noted \"Kru societies can now be found along the coast of Monrovia, Liberia to Bandama River in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire\". \"Villages maintain their ties based on presumed common descent, reinforced by ceremonial exchanges and gifts\". The Kru people and their languages, although now many speak English (in Liberia) or French (in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) as a second language, are said to be \"dominant in the southwest region where the forest zone reaches the coastal lagoons\". The Kru people rely on the forest for farming, supplemented by hunting for their livelihood.\nSubgroups and associated languages.\nThe Kru languages include many subgroups such as Kuwaa, Grebo, Bassa, Belle, Belleh, Kwaa and many others. According to Breitbonde, categorization of communities based on cultural distinctiveness, historical or ethnic identity, and socio-political autonomy \"may have brought about the large number of distinct Kru dialects; \"Although the natives were in many respects similar in type and tribe, every village was an independent state; there was also very little intercommunication\". Breitbonde notes the Kru people were categorized based on their cultural distinctiveness, separate historical or ethnic identities, and social and political autonomy. This is the possible reason for so many subgroups of the Kru language. As noted by Fisiak, there is very little documentation on the Kru and associated languages.\nMarchese's (1989) classification of Kru languages is as follows. Many of these languages are dialect clusters and are sometimes considered more than a single language.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Ethnologue\" adds Neyo, which may be closest to Dida or Godie.\nGrammar.\nKru word order is primarily subject-verb-object (SVO), but can also often be subject-object-verb (SOV).\nComparative vocabulary.\nSample basic vocabulary of 12 Kru languages from Marchese (1983):\nAn additional sample basic vocabulary of 21 Kru languages from Marchese (1983):\nNumerals.\nComparison of numerals in individual languages:\nComparison of numerals in Kru languages from Marchese (1983):\nBody parts (head).\nParts of the head from Marchese (1983):\nBody parts (lower).\nOther body parts from Marchese (1983):\nOther nouns.\nMiscellaneous nouns from Marchese (1983):\nNature.\nNature-related words from Marchese (1983):\nVerbs (1).\nSome basic verbs from Marchese (1983):\nVerbs (2).\nOther basic verbs from Marchese (1983):\nReconstruction.\nAccording to Marchese Zogbo (2012), Proto-Kru had:\nProto-Kru consonants (Marchese Zogbo 2012):\nDerived consonants:\nProto-Kru vowels (Marchese Zogbo 2012):\nThere is a clear bipartite division between Western and Eastern Kru marked by phonological and lexical distinctions.

{"id": "54712", "revid": "150564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54712", "title": "Abdominal obesity", "text": "Excess fat around the stomach and abdomen\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nAbdominal obesity, also known as central obesity and truncal obesity, is the human condition of an excessive concentration of visceral fat around the stomach and abdomen to such an extent that it is likely to harm its bearer's health. Abdominal obesity has been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other metabolic and vascular diseases.\nVisceral fat, central abdominal fat, and waist circumference show a strong association with type 2 diabetes.\nVisceral fat, also known as organ fat or \"intra-abdominal fat\", is located inside the peritoneal cavity, packed in between internal organs and torso, as opposed to subcutaneous fat, which is found underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat, which is found interspersed in skeletal muscle. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal fat. An excess of adipose visceral fat is known as central obesity, the \"pot belly\" or \"beer belly\" effect, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. This body type is also known as \"apple shaped\", as opposed to \"pear shaped\" in which fat is deposited on the hips and buttocks.\nResearchers first started to focus on abdominal obesity in the 1980s when they realized it had an important connection to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Abdominal obesity was more closely related with metabolic dysfunctions connected with cardiovascular disease than was general obesity. In the late 1980s and early 1990s insightful and powerful imaging techniques were discovered that would further help advance the understanding of the health risks associated with body fat accumulation. Techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to categorize mass of adipose tissue located at the abdominal level into intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat.\nAbdominal obesity is linked with higher cardiovascular events among South Asian ethnic populations.\nHealth risks.\nHeart disease.\nAbdominal obesity is typically associated with a statistically higher risk of heart disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (see below). With an increase in the waist to hip ratio and overall waist circumference the risk of death increases as well. Metabolic syndrome is associated with abdominal obesity, blood lipid disorders, inflammation, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. It is now generally believed that intra-abdominal fat is the depot that conveys the biggest health risk.\nRecent validation has concluded that total and regional body volume estimates correlate positively and significantly with biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and that BVI calculations correlate significantly with all biomarkers of cardiovascular risk.\nDiabetes.\nThere are numerous theories as to the exact cause and mechanism in type 2 diabetes. Central obesity is known to predispose individuals for insulin resistance. Abdominal fat is especially active hormonally, secreting a group of hormones called adipokines that may possibly impair glucose tolerance. But adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, which is found in lower concentration in obese and diabetic individuals has shown to be beneficial and protective in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nInsulin resistance is a major feature of diabetes mellitus type 2, and central obesity is correlated with both insulin resistance and T2DM itself. Increased adiposity (obesity) raises serum resistin levels, which in turn directly correlate to insulin resistance. Studies have also confirmed a direct correlation between resistin levels and T2DM. And it is waistline adipose tissue (central obesity) which seems to be the foremost type of fat deposits contributing to rising levels of serum resistin. Conversely, serum resistin levels have been found to \"decline\" with decreased adiposity following medical treatment.\nAsthma.\nDeveloping asthma due to abdominal obesity is also a main concern. As a result of breathing at low lung volume, the muscles are tighter and the airway is narrower. Obesity causes decreased tidal volumes due to a reduction in chest expansion that is caused both by the weight on the chest itself and the effect of abdominal obesity on flattening the diaphragm. It is commonly seen that people who are obese breathe quickly and often, while inhaling small volumes of air. People with obesity are also more likely to be hospitalized for asthma. A study has stated that 75% of patients treated for asthma in the emergency room were either overweight or obese.\nAlzheimer's disease.\nBased on studies, it is evident that obesity has a strong association with vascular and metabolic disease which could potentially be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have also shown an association between mid-life obesity and dementia, but the relationship between later life obesity and dementia is less clear. A study by Debette et al. (2010) examining over 700 adults found evidence to suggest higher volumes of visceral fat, regardless of overall weight, were associated with smaller brain volumes and increased risk of dementia. Alzheimer's disease and abdominal obesity has a strong correlation and with metabolic factors added in, the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease was even higher. Based on logistic regression analyses, it was found that obesity was associated with an almost 10-fold increase risk of Alzheimer's disease.\nOther health risks.\nCentral obesity can be a feature of lipodystrophies, a group of diseases that is either inherited, or due to secondary causes (often protease inhibitors, a group of medications against AIDS). Central obesity is a symptom of Cushing's syndrome and is also common in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Central obesity is associated with glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Once dyslipidemia becomes a severe problem, an individual's abdominal cavity would generate elevated free fatty acid flux to the liver. The effect of abdominal adiposity occurs not just in those who are obese, but also affects people who are non-obese and it also contributes to insulin sensitivity.\nGhroubi et al. (2007) examined whether abdominal circumference is a more reliable indicator than BMI or the presence of knee osteoarthritis in obese patients. They found that it actually appears to be a factor linked with the presence of knee pain as well as osteoarthritis in obese study subjects. Ghroubi et al. (2007) concluded that a high abdominal circumference is associated with great functional repercussion.\nResearch published in The Lancet (2023) found that high levels of visceral fat were related to poorer cognitive performance. The findings suggest that maintaining a healthy weight and metabolic health may be important for preserving cognitive function.\nCauses.\nDiet.\nThe currently prevalent belief is that the immediate cause of obesity is net energy imbalance\u2014the organism consumes more usable calories than it expends, wastes, or discards through elimination. Some studies indicate that visceral adiposity, together with lipid dysregulation and decreased insulin sensitivity, is related to the excessive consumption of fructose. Some evidence shows that in regards to juveniles, when free fructose is present as children's fat cells mature, it makes more of these cells mature into fat cells in the abdominal region. It also caused both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat to be less sensitive to insulin. These effects were not attenuated when compared to similar glucose consumption.\nIntake of trans fat from industrial oils has been associated with increased abdominal obesity in men and increased weight and waist circumference in women. These associations were not attenuated when fat intake and calorie intake was accounted for. Greater meat (processed meat, red meat, and poultry) consumption has also been positively associated with greater weight gain, and specifically abdominal obesity, even when accounting for calories. Conversely, studies suggest that oily fish consumption is negatively associated with total body fat and abdominal fat distribution even when body mass remains constant. Similarly, increased soy protein consumption is correlated with lower amounts of abdominal fat in postmenopausal women even when calorie consumption is controlled.\nNumerous large studies have demonstrated that ultra-processed foods have a positive dose-dependent relationship with both abdominal obesity and general obesity in both men and women. Consuming a diet rich in unprocessed food and minimally processed food is linked with lower obesity risk, lower waist circumference and less chronic disease. These findings are consistent among American, Canadian, Latin American, Australian, British, French, Spaniard, Swedish, South Korean, Chinese and Sub-Saharan African populations.\nObesity plays an important role in the impairment of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism shown in high-carbohydrate diets. It has also been shown that quality protein intake during a 24-hour period and the number of times the essential amino acid threshold of approximately 10\u00a0g has been achieved is inversely related to the percentage of central abdominal fat. Quality protein uptake is defined as the ratio of essential amino acids to daily dietary protein.\nVisceral fat cells will release their metabolic by-products in the portal circulation, where the blood leads straight to the liver. Thus, the excess of triglycerides and fatty acids created by the visceral fat cells will go into the liver and accumulate there. In the liver, most of it will be stored as fat. This concept is known as 'lipotoxicity'.\nAlcohol consumption.\nA study has shown that alcohol consumption is directly associated with waist circumference and with a higher risk of abdominal obesity in men, but not in women. After controlling for energy under-reporting, which have slightly attenuated these associations, it was observed that increasing alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of exceeding recommended energy intakes in male participants \u2013 but not in the small number of female participants (2.13%) with elevated alcohol consumption, even after establishing a lower number of drinks per day to characterize women as consuming a high quantity of alcohol. Further research is needed to determine whether a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and abdominal obesity exists among women who consume higher amounts of alcohol.\nA systemic review and meta-analysis failed to find data pointing towards a dose-dependent relationship between beer intake and general obesity or abdominal obesity at low or moderate intake levels (under ~500\u00a0mL/day). However, high beer intake (above ~4\u00a0L/wk) appeared to be associated with a higher degree of abdominal obesity specifically, particularly among men.\nOther factors.\nThe prevalence of abdominal obesity is increasing in Western populations, possibly due to a combination of low physical activity and high-calorie diets, and also in developing countries, where it is associated with the urbanization of populations.\nOther environmental factors, such as maternal smoking, estrogenic compounds in the diet, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be important also.\nHypercortisolism, such as in Cushing's syndrome, also leads to central obesity. Many prescription drugs, such as dexamethasone and other steroids, can also have side effects resulting in central obesity, especially in the presence of elevated insulin levels.\nDiagnosis.\nThere are various ways of measuring abdominal obesity including:\nIn those with a body mass index (BMI) under 35, intra-abdominal body fat is related to negative health outcomes independent of total body fat. Intra-abdominal or visceral fat has a particularly strong correlation with cardiovascular disease.\nBMI and waist measurements are well recognized ways to characterize obesity. However, waist measurements are not as accurate as BMI measurements. Waist measurement (\"e.g.\", for BFP standard) is more prone to errors than measuring height and weight (\"e.g.\", for BMI standard). BMI will illustrate the best estimate of one's total body fatness, while waist measurement gives an estimate of visceral fat and risk of obesity-related disease. It is recommended to use both methods of measurements.\nWhile central obesity can be obvious just by looking at the naked body (see the picture), the severity of central obesity is determined by taking waist and hip measurements. The absolute waist circumference in men and in women and the waist\u2013hip ratio (&gt;0.9 for men and &gt;0.85 for women) are both used as measures of central obesity. A differential diagnosis includes distinguishing central obesity from ascites and intestinal bloating. In the cohort of 15,000 people participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), waist circumference explained obesity-related health risk better than BMI when metabolic syndrome was taken as an outcome measure and this difference was statistically significant. In other words, excessive waist circumference appears to be more of a risk factor for metabolic syndrome than BMI. Another measure of central obesity which has shown superiority to BMI in predicting cardiovascular disease risk is the Index of Central Obesity (waist-to-height ratio, WHtR), where a ratio of &gt;=0.5 (i.e. a waist circumference at least half of the individual's height) is predictive of increased risk.\nAnother diagnosis of obesity is the analysis of intra-abdominal fat having the most risk to one's personal health. The increased amount of fat in this region relates to the higher levels of plasma lipid and lipoproteins as per studies mentioned by Eric Poehlman (1998) review.\nAn increasing acceptance of the importance of central obesity within the medical profession as an indicator of health risk has led to new developments in obesity diagnosis such as the Body Volume Index, which measures central obesity by measuring a person's body shape and their weight distribution. The effect of abdominal adiposity occurs not just in those who are obese, but also affects people who are non-obese and it also contributes to insulin sensitivity.\nIndex of central obesity.\nIndex of Central Obesity (ICO) is the ratio of waist circumference and height first proposed by a Parikh \"et al.\" in 2007 as a better substitute to the widely used waist circumference in defining metabolic syndrome. The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III suggested cutoff of and for males and females as a marker of central obesity. The same was used in defining metabolic syndrome. Misra et al. suggested that these cutoffs are not applicable among Indians and the cutoffs be lowered to and for males and females. Various race specific cutoffs were suggested by different groups. The International Diabetes Federation defined central obesity based on these various race and gender specific cutoffs. The other limitation of waist circumference is that it the measurement procedure has not been standardized and in children there are no, or few, comparison standards or reference data.\nParikh et al. looked at the average heights of various races and suggested that by using ICO various race- and gender-specific cutoffs of waist circumference can be discarded. An ICO cutoff of 0.53 was suggested as a criterion to define central obesity. Parikh \"et al.\" further tested a modified definition of metabolic syndrome in which waist circumference was replaced with ICO in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and found the modified definition to be more specific and sensitive.\nThis parameter has been used in the study of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.\nCentral obesity in individuals with normal BMI is referred to as normal weight obesity.\nSex differences.\nThere are sex-dependent differences in regional fat distribution.\nMales are more susceptible to upper-body fat accumulation, most likely in the belly, due to sex hormone differences. When comparing the body fat of men and women it is seen that men have close to twice the visceral fat as that of pre-menopausal women.\nIn women, estrogen is believed to cause fat to be stored in the buttocks, thighs, and hips. When women reach menopause and the estrogen produced by ovaries declines, fat at their buttocks, hips, and thighs decreases while fat at their belly increases.\n50% of men and 70% of women in the United States between the ages of 50 and 79 years now exceed the waist circumference threshold for central obesity.\nCentral obesity is positively associated with coronary heart disease risk in women and men. It has been hypothesized that the sex differences in fat distribution may explain the sex difference in coronary heart disease risk. Even with the differences, at any given level of central obesity measured as waist circumference or waist to hip ratio, coronary artery disease rates are identical in men and women.\nManagement.\nA permanent routine of exercise, eating healthily, and, during periods of being overweight, consuming the same number or fewer calories than used will prevent and help fight obesity. A single pound of fat yields approximately 3500 calories of energy (32 000 kJ energy per kilogram of fat), and weight loss is achieved by reducing energy intake, or increasing energy expenditure, thus achieving a negative balance. Adjunctive therapies which may be prescribed by a physician are orlistat or sibutramine, although the latter has been associated with increased cardiovascular events and strokes and has been withdrawn from the market in the US, the UK, the EU, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Thailand.\nA 2006 study published in the \"International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism\" suggests that combining cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise with resistance training is more effective than cardiovascular training alone in getting rid of abdominal fat. An additional benefit to exercising is that it reduces stress and insulin levels, which reduce the presence of cortisol, a hormone that leads to more belly fat deposits and leptin resistance.\nSelf-motivation by understanding the risks associated with abdominal obesity is widely regarded as being far more important than worries about cosmetics. In addition, understanding the health issues linked with abdominal obesity can help in the self-motivation process of losing the abdominal fat. As mentioned above, abdominal fat is linked with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Specifically it is the deepest layer of belly fat (the fat that cannot be seen or grabbed) that poses health risks, as these \"visceral\" fat cells produce hormones that can affect health (e.g. increased insulin resistance and/or breast cancer risk). The risk increases considering the fact that they are located in the proximity or in between organs in the abdominal cavity. For example, fat next to the liver drains into it, causing a fatty liver, which is a risk factor for insulin resistance, setting the stage for type 2 diabetes. However, visceral fat is more responsive to the circulation of catecholamines.\nIn the presence of type 2 diabetes, the physician might instead prescribe metformin and thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) as antidiabetic drugs rather than sulfonylurea derivatives. Thiazolidinediones may cause slight weight gain but decrease \"pathologic\" abdominal fat (visceral fat), and therefore may be prescribed for diabetics with central obesity.\nThiazolidinedione has been associated with heart failure and increased cardiovascular risk; so it has been withdrawn from the market in Europe by EMA in 2010.\nLow-fat diets may not be an effective long-term intervention for obesity: as Bacon and Aphramor wrote, \"The majority of individuals regain virtually all of the weight that was lost during treatment.\" The Women's Health Initiative (\"the largest and longest randomized, controlled dietary intervention clinical trial\") found that long-term dietary intervention increased the waist circumference of both the intervention group and the control group, though the increase was smaller for the intervention group. The conclusion was that mean weight decreased significantly in the intervention group from baseline to year 1 by 2.2\u00a0kg (P&lt;.001) and was 2.2\u00a0kg less than the control group change from baseline at year 1. This difference from baseline between control and intervention groups diminished over time, but a significant difference in weight was maintained through year 9, the end of the study.\nSociety and culture.\nMyths.\nThere is a common misconception that spot exercise (that is, exercising a specific muscle or location of the body) most effectively burns fat at the desired location, but this is not the case. Spot exercise is beneficial for building specific muscles, but it has little effect, if any, on fat in that area of the body, or on the body's distribution of body fat. The same logic applies to sit-ups and belly fat. Sit-ups, crunches and other abdominal exercises are useful in building the abdominal muscles, but they have little effect, if any, on the adipose tissue located there.\nColloquialisms.\nA large central adiposity deposit has been assigned many common use names, including \"spare tire\", \"love handle\", \"paunch\", \"boiler\", and \"potbelly\". Several colloquial terms used to refer to central obesity, and to people who have it, refer to beer drinking. However, there is little scientific evidence that beer drinkers are more prone to central obesity, despite its being known colloquially as \"beer belly\", \"beer gut\", or \"beer pot\". One of the few studies conducted on the subject did not find that beer drinkers are more prone to central obesity than nondrinkers or drinkers of wine or spirits. Chronic alcoholism can lead to cirrhosis, symptoms of which include gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) and ascites (abdominal fluid). These symptoms can suggest the appearance of central obesity.\nEconomics.\nResearchers in Copenhagen examined the relationship between waist circumferences and costs among 31,840 subjects aged 50\u201364 years of age with different waist circumferences. Their study showed that an increase in just an additional centimetre above normal waistline caused a 1.25% and 2.08% rise in health care costs in women and men respectively. To put this in perspective, a woman with a waistline of 95\u00a0cm (approx 37.4 in) and without underlying health problems or co-morbidities can incur economic costs that are 22%, or US$397, higher per year than a woman with a normal waist circumference.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The culture was unusual in that it supported a sedentary or semi-sedentary population even before the introduction of agriculture. Natufian communities may be the ancestors of the builders of the region's first Neolithic settlements, which may have been the earliest in the world. Some evidence suggests deliberate cultivation of cereals, specifically rye, by the Natufian culture at Tell Abu Hureyra, the site of the earliest evidence of agriculture in the world.\nThe world's oldest known evidence of the production of bread-like foodstuff has been found at Shubayqa 1, a 14,400-year-old site in Jordan's northeastern desert, 4,000 years before the emergence of agriculture in Southwest Asia. In addition, the oldest known evidence of possible beer-brewing, dating to approximately 13,000 BP, was found in Raqefet Cave on Mount Carmel, although the beer-related residues may be a result of spontaneous fermentation.\nGenerally, though, Natufians exploited wild cereals and hunted animals, notably mountain gazelles. Archaeogenetic analysis has revealed derivation of later (Neolithic to Bronze Age) Levantines primarily from Natufians, along with substantial later gene flow from Anatolia.\nDorothy Garrod coined the term Natufian based on her excavations at the Shuqba Cave at Wadi Natuf.\nDiscovery.\nThe Natufian culture was discovered by British archaeologist Dorothy Garrod during her excavations of Shuqba Cave in the Judaean Mountains of Mandatory Palestine in the Cisjordan, now the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate of Palestine. Before the 1930s, the majority of archaeological work taking place in Palestine was biblical archaeology focused on historic periods, and little was known about the region's prehistory.\nIn 1928, Garrod was invited by the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (BSAJ, now the Kenyon Institute) to excavate Shuqba Cave, where prehistoric stone tools had been discovered by P\u00e8re Mallon four years earlier. She found a layer sandwiched between the Upper Paleolithic and Bronze Age deposits characterised by the presence of microliths. She identified this with the Mesolithic, a transitional period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic well-represented in Europe but which had not yet been found in West Asia. A year later, when she discovered similar material at el Wad (now in the Nahal Me'arot Nature Reserve), Garrod suggested the name \"the Natufian culture\" after the Wadi Natuf, which runs close to Shuqba.\nOver the next two decades, Garrod found Natufian material at several of her pioneering excavations in the Mount Carmel region, including el-Wad, Kebara and Tabun, as did the French archaeologist Ren\u00e9 Neuville, firmly establishing the Natufian culture in the regional prehistoric chronology. As early as 1931, both Garrod and Neuville drew attention to the presence of stone sickles in Natufian assemblages and the possibility that this represented a very early agriculture.\nDating.\nRadiocarbon dating places the Natufian culture at an epoch from the terminal Pleistocene to the very beginning of the Holocene, a time period between 12,500 and 9,500 BC.\nThe period is commonly split into two subperiods: Early Natufian (12,000\u201310,800 BC) and Late Natufian (10,800\u20139,500 BC). The Late Natufian most likely occurred in tandem with the Younger Dryas (10,800 to 9,500 BC). The Levant hosts more than a hundred kinds of cereals, fruits, nuts, and other edible parts of plants, and the flora of the Levant during the Natufian period was not the dry, barren, and thorny landscape of today, but rather woodland.\nPrecursors and associated cultures.\nThe Natufian developed in the same region as the earlier Kebaran culture. It is generally seen as a successor, which evolved out of elements within that preceding culture. There were also other industries in the region, such as the Mushabian culture of the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula, which are sometimes distinguished from the Kebaran culture or believed to have been involved in the evolution of the Natufian culture.\nMore generally there has been discussion of the similarities of these cultures with those found in coastal North Africa. Graeme Barker notes there are: \"similarities in the respective archaeological records of the Natufian culture of the Levant and of contemporary foragers in coastal North Africa across the late Pleistocene and early Holocene boundary\". According to Isabelle De Groote and Louise Humphrey, Natufians practiced the Iberomaurusian and Capsian custom of sometimes extracting their maxillary central incisors (upper front teeth).\nOfer Bar-Yosef has argued that there are signs of influences coming from North Africa to the Levant, citing the microburin technique and \"microlithic forms such as arched backed bladelets and La Mouillah points.\" But recent research has shown that the presence of arched backed bladelets, La Mouillah points, and the use of the microburin technique was already apparent in the Nebekian industry of the Eastern Levant. And Maher et al. state that, \"Many technological nuances that have often been always highlighted as significant during the Natufian were already present during the Early and Middle EP [Epipalaeolithic] and do not, in most cases, represent a radical departure in knowledge, tradition, or behavior.\"\nAuthors such as Christopher Ehret have built upon the little evidence available to develop scenarios of intensive usage of plants having built up first in North Africa, as a precursor to the development of true farming in the Fertile Crescent, but such suggestions are considered highly speculative until more North African archaeological evidence can be gathered. In fact, Weiss et al. have shown that the earliest known intensive usage of plants was in the Levant 23,000 years ago at Ohalo II on the shores of the Sea of Galilee by Kinneret.\nAnthropologist C. Loring Brace (1993) cross-analysed the craniometric traits of Natufian specimens with those of various ancient and modern groups from the Near East, Africa and Europe. The Late Pleistocene Epipalaeolithic Natufian sample was described as problematic due to its small size (consisting of only three males and one female), as well as the lack of a comparative sample from the Natufians' putative descendants in the Neolithic Near East, such as the PPNB. Nonetheless, Brace observed that the Natufian fossils lay between those of the Niger\u2013Congo-speaking series included and the other samples (Near East, Europe), which he suggested may point to a Sub-Saharan influence in their constitution. Subsequent ancient DNA analysis of Natufian skeletal remains by Lazaridis et al. (2016) instead found that the specimens were a mix of 50% Basal Eurasian ancestral component (see Genetics) and 50% West Eurasian Unknown Hunter Gatherer (UHG) related to the western hunter-gatherers of Europe. Natufians have also been described by other anthropologists as a Proto-Mediterranean population, being similar to the Kebarans.\nAccording to Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen, \"It seems that certain preadaptive traits, developed already by the Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran populations within the Mediterranean park forest, played an important role in the emergence of the new socioeconomic system known as the Natufian culture.\"\nSettlements.\nSettlements occur mostly in Israel and the Palestinian territories. This could be deemed the core zone of the Natufian culture, but Israel is a place that has been excavated more frequently than other places hence the greater number of sites. During the years more sites have been found outside the core zone of Israel and the Palestinian territories stretching into what now is Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the Sinai Peninsula and the Negev desert. The settlements in the Natufian culture were larger and more permanent than in preceding ones. Some Natufian sites had stone built architecture; Ain Mallaha is an example of round stone structures. Cave sites are also seen frequently during the Natufian culture. El Wad is a Natufian cave site with occupation in the front part of the cave also called the terrace. Some Natufian sites were located in forest/steppe areas and others near inland mountains. The Natufian settlements appear to be the first to exhibit evidence of food storage; not all Natufian sites have storage facilities, but they have been identified at certain sites. Natufians are also suggested to have visited Cyprus, requiring travel over significant distances of water.\nMaterial culture.\nLithics.\nThe Natufian had a microlithic industry centered on short blades and bladelets. The microburin technique was used. Geometric microliths include lunates, trapezes, and triangles. There are backed blades as well. A special type of retouch (Helwan retouch) is characteristic for the early Natufian. In the late Natufian, the Harif-point, a typical arrowhead made from a regular blade, became common in the Negev. Some scholars use it to define a separate culture, the Harifian.\nSickle blades also appear for the first time in the Natufian lithic industry. The characteristic sickle-gloss shows that they were used to cut the silica-rich stems of cereals, indirectly suggesting the existence of incipient agriculture. Shaft straighteners made of ground stone indicate the practice of archery. There are heavy ground-stone bowl mortars as well.\nArt.\nThe \"Ain Sakhri lovers\", a carved stone object held at the British Museum, is the oldest known depiction of a couple having sex. It was found in the Ain Sakhri cave in the Judean desert. A Natufian clay figurine uncovered from Nahal Ein Gev II, shows that prehistoric artists also used intimate, intertwined bodies to express spiritual beliefs and human\u2013animal relationships.\nBurials.\nNatufian grave goods are typically made of shell, teeth (of red deer), bones, and stone. There are pendants, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, and belt-ornaments as well.\nIn 2008, the 12,400\u201312,000 cal BC grave of an apparently significant Natufian female was discovered in a ceremonial pit in the Hilazon Tachtit cave in northern Israel. Media reports referred to this person as a \"shaman\" or \"witch doctor.\" The burial contained the remains of at least three aurochs and 86 tortoises, all of which are thought to have been brought to the site during a funeral feast. The body was surrounded by tortoise shells, the pelvis of a leopard, forearm of a boar, a wingtip of a golden eagle, and skull of a beech marten.\nLong-distance exchange.\nAt Ain Mallaha (in Northern Israel), Anatolian obsidian and shellfish from the Nile valley have been found. The source of malachite beads is still unknown. Epipaleolithic Natufians carried parthenocarpic figs from Africa to the southeastern corner of the Fertile Crescent, c.\u200910,000 BC.\nOther finds.\nThere was a rich bone industry, including harpoons and fish hooks. Stone and bone were worked into pendants and other ornaments. There are a few human figurines made of limestone (El-Wad, Ain Mallaha, Ain Sakhri), but the favorite subject of representative art seems to have been animals. Ostrich-shell containers have been found in the Negev.\nIn 2018, the world's oldest brewery was found, with the residue of 13,000-year-old beer, in a prehistoric cave near Haifa in Israel when researchers were looking for clues into what plant foods the Natufian people were eating. This is 8,000 years earlier than experts previously thought beer was produced.\nA study published in 2019 shows an advanced knowledge of lime plaster production at a Natufian cemetery in Nahal Ein Gev II site in the Upper Jordan Valley dated to 12 thousand (calibrated) years before present [k cal BP]. Production of plaster of this quality was previously thought to have been achieved some 2,000 years later.\nSubsistence.\nThe Natufian people lived by hunting and gathering. The preservation of plant remains is poor because of the soil conditions, but at some sites such as Tell Abu Hureyra substantial amounts of plant remains discovered through flotation have been excavated. However wild cereals like legumes, almonds, acorns and pistachios have been collected throughout most of the Levant. Animal bones show that mountain and goitered gazelles (\"Gazella gazella\" and \"Gazella subgutturosa\") were the main prey.\nAdditionally, deer, aurochs and wild boar were hunted in the steppe, as well as onagers and caprids (ibex). Waterfowl and freshwater fish formed part of the diet in the Jordan river valley. Animal bones from Salibiya I (12,300 \u2013 10,800 cal BP) have been interpreted as evidence for communal hunts with nets, however, the radiocarbon dates are far too old compared to the cultural remains of this settlement, indicating contamination of the samples.\nDevelopment of agriculture.\nA pita-like bread has been found from 12,500 BC attributed to Natufians. This bread is made of wild cereal seeds and papyrus cousin tubers, ground into flour.\nAccording to one theory, it was a sudden change in climate, the Younger Dryas event (c.\u200910,800 to 9500 BC), which inspired the development of agriculture in the region. The Younger Dryas was a 1,000-year-long interruption in the higher temperatures prevailing since the Last Glacial Maximum, which produced a sudden drought in the Levant. This would have endangered the wild cereals, which could no longer compete with dryland scrub, but upon which the population had become dependent to sustain a relatively large sedentary population. By artificially clearing scrub and planting seeds obtained from elsewhere, they began to practice agriculture. However, this theory of the origin of agriculture is controversial in the scientific community.\nDomesticated dog.\nAt the Natufian site of \u02bfAin Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together. At another Natufian site at the cave of Hayonim, humans were found buried with two canids.\nGenetics.\nAncient DNA analysis of Natufian skeletal remains found that the Natufian ancestry could be modelled as a mix of about 50% Basal Eurasian ancestry and 50% from a West-Eurasian Unknown Hunter Gatherer (UHG) population, which was related to the western hunter-gatherer group of Mesolithic Europe. Vallini et al. (2024) modeled the amount of Basal Eurasian ancestry among Natufians at roughly 15%, with the remainder being associated with West Eurasian sources.\nThe Natufian population also displays ancestral ties to Paleolithic Taforalt samples, the makers of the Epipaleolithic Iberomaurusian culture of the Maghreb, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture of the Levant, the Early Neolithic Ifri N'Amr Ou Moussa and the Late Neolithic Kelif el Boroud culture of North Africa, with samples associated with these early cultures all sharing a common genomic component dubbed the \"Natufian component\", which diverged from other West Eurasian lineages ~26,000 years ago, and is most closely linked to the Arabian lineage. Possible bidirectional geneflow events between these groups has also been suggested, with particular evidence for affinity between the Natufians and Iberomaurusians. Taforalt individuals belonged to the Y-DNA haplogroup E1b1b1a1 (M78), which is closely related to the E1b1b1b (M123) sublineage that has been observed in skeletal remains belonging to the Epipaleolithic Natufian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic cultures of the Levant, possibly suggesting geneflow.\nContact between Natufians, other Neolithic Levantines, Caucasus Hunter Gatherers (CHG), Anatolian and Iranian farmers is believed to have decreased genetic variability among later populations in the Middle East. Migrations from the Near-East also occurred towards Africa, and the West Eurasian geneflow into the Horn of Africa is best represented by the Levant Neolithic, and may be associated with the spread of Afroasiatic languages. The scientists suggest that the Levantine early farmers may have spread southward into East Africa, bringing along the associated ancestral components. Lazaridis et al. (2016) did not find a greater genetic affinity between Natufians and modern sub-Saharan Africans than that existing between present-day sub-Saharan Africans and other ancient populations of Western Eurasia, and also stated that the ancestry of a primitive population from North Africa could not be tested because modern North Africans are largely descended from late migrant populations from Eurasia. \nAs summarized by Rosa Fregel (2021), a later preprint from Lazaridis et al. (2018) has contested Loosdrecht's conclusion and argues for a minor sub-Saharan African component in Natufians, stating \"that [the Iberomaurusians of] Taforalt can be better modeled as a mixture of a Dzudzuana component and a sub-Saharan African component\" (or an ancient and now-extinct North African component that diverged prior to the Out-of-Africa migration) and \"also argue that (...) the Taforalt people (...) contributed to the genetic composition of Natufians and not the other way around\", which, according to Lazaridis et al., would be consistent with morphological and archaeological studies that indicate a dissemination of morphological characteristics and artifacts from North Africa to the Near East, as well as explaining the presence of Y-chromosome haplogroup E in Natufians and Levantine farmers. Fregel summarizes that \"More evidence will be needed to determine the specific origin of the North African Upper Paleolithic populations\". Later, Iosif Lazardis documented that the Natufians had a total of 9.1% non-Eurasian ancestry, and the explanation by the geneticist was because of their partial descent from the Paleolithic Iberomaurusians, whose contributions were estimated at 22% in Natufians. In fact, a total of 41.4% non-Eurasian ancestry is present in Taforalt from Morocco.\nA study in 2025 by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig sequenced two individuals from Takarkori (7,000 YBP), and discovered that most of their ancestry was from an unknown ancestral North African lineage, related to the non-Eurasian admixture component found in Iberomaurusians and Natufians. The study concluded that the Takarkori people derive 93% of their ancestry from an unknown population native to North Africa that diverged there before the Out-of-Africa migration that gave rise to Eurasians, but never left Africa and became mostly isolated (both from sub-Saharan African and Eurasian groups). According to the study, the Takarkori people were distinct, both from contemporary sub-Saharan Africans and from non-Africans/Eurasians, and had \"only a minor component of non-African ancestry\" but did \"not carry sub-Saharan African ancestry, suggesting that, contrary to previous interpretations, the Green Sahara was not a corridor connecting Northern and sub-Saharan Africa.\"\nModern groups with Natufian ancestry.\nIn their 2017 paper, Ranajit Das, Paul Wexler, Mehdi Pirooznia and Eran Elhaik analyzed the Lazaridis et al. (2016) study concluding that the Natufians, together with one Neolithic Levantine sample, clustered in the proximity to modern Palestinians and Bedouins, and also \"marginally overlapped\" with Yemenite Jews.\nDaniel Shriner (2018), using modern populations as a reference, found 28% autosomal African ancestry in Natufian samples, with 21.2% related to North Africa and 6.8% related to Omotic-speaking populations in southern Ethiopia, which reveals a plausible source for haplogroup E in Natufians; still according to Shriner, the Natufian samples had 61.2% ancestry related to Arabs and 10.8% ancestry related to West Asians.\nFerreira et al. (2021) and Almarri et al. (2021) found that ancient Natufians cluster with modern Arabian groups, such as Saudi Arabians and Yemenis, which derive most of their ancestry from local Natufian-like hunter-gatherer peoples and have less Neolithic Anatolian ancestry than Levantines. Sirak et al. (2024) found that medieval Socotra (the Soqotri people), similar to modern Saudis, Yemenis and Bedouins, have a majority component that is \"maximized in Late Pleistocene (Epipaleolithic) Natufian hunter\u2013gatherers from the Levant\".\nLanguage.\nAlexander Militarev, Vitaly Shevoroshkin and others have linked the Natufian culture to the proto-Afroasiatic language, which they in turn believe has a Levantine origin. Some scholars, for example Christopher Ehret, Roger Blench and others, contend that the Proto-Afroasiatic homeland is to be found in North Africa or Northeast Africa, probably in the area of Egypt, the Sahara, Horn of Africa or Sudan. Within this group, Ehret, who like Militarev believes Afroasiatic may already have been in existence in the Natufian period, would associate Natufians only with the Near Eastern Proto-Semitic branch of Afroasiatic.\nJohn Bengtson documented that archeological and physical anthropological evidence showed Natufians are closely related to modern Semitic-speaking people from the Levant. Under his hypothesis, Afro-Asiatic branches originated in North Africa proper (Egypt), and the age of these languages can be dated to the periods of the Natufian culture around ~12,000 years ago. He postulated this based on the biological discontinuity between Pleistocene and Holocene North Africa, where there was population replacement and admixture in this region involving external migrants from northern areas, who were the ancestral Afro-Asiatic speakers.\nSites.\nThe Natufian culture has been documented at dozens of sites. Around 90 have been excavated, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54717", "revid": "49685307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54717", "title": "De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory", "text": "Interpretation of quantum mechanics\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is an interpretation of quantum mechanics which postulates that, in addition to the wavefunction, an actual configuration of particles exists, even when unobserved. The evolution over time of the configuration of all particles is defined by a guiding equation. The evolution of the wave function over time is given by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The theory is named after Louis de Broglie and David Bohm.\nThe theory is deterministic and explicitly nonlocal: the velocity of any one particle depends on the value of the guiding equation, which depends on the configuration of all the particles under consideration.\nMeasurements are a particular case of quantum processes described by the theory\u2014for which it yields the same quantum predictions as other interpretations of quantum mechanics. The theory does not have a \"measurement problem\", due to the fact that the particles have a definite configuration at all times. The Born rule in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is not a postulate. Rather, in this theory, the link between the probability density and the wave function has the status of a theorem, a result of a separate postulate, the \"quantum equilibrium hypothesis\", which is additional to the basic principles governing the wave function.\nThere are several equivalent mathematical formulations of the theory.\nOverview.\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is based on the following postulates:\nEven though this latter relation is frequently presented as an axiom of the theory, Bohm presented it as derivable from statistical-mechanical arguments in the original papers of 1952. This argument was further supported by the work of Bohm in 1953 and was substantiated by Vigier and Bohm's paper of 1954, in which they introduced stochastic \"fluid fluctuations\" that drive a process of asymptotic relaxation from quantum non-equilibrium to quantum equilibrium (\u03c1 \u2192 |\u03c8|2).\nDouble-slit experiment.\nThe double-slit experiment is an illustration of wave\u2013particle duality. In it, a beam of particles (such as electrons) travels through a barrier that has two slits. If a detector screen is on the side beyond the barrier, the pattern of detected particles shows interference fringes characteristic of waves arriving at the screen from two sources (the two slits); however, the interference pattern is made up of individual dots corresponding to particles that had arrived on the screen. The system seems to exhibit the behaviour of both waves (interference patterns) and particles (dots on the screen).\nIf this experiment is modified so that one slit is closed, no interference pattern is observed. Thus, the state of both slits affects the final results. It can also be arranged to have a minimally invasive detector at one of the slits to detect which slit the particle went through. When that is done, the interference pattern disappears.\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the wavefunction is defined at both slits, but each particle has a well-defined trajectory that passes through exactly one of the slits. The final position of the particle on the detector screen and the slit through which the particle passes is determined by the initial position of the particle. Such initial position is not knowable or controllable by the experimenter, so there is an appearance of randomness in the pattern of detection. In Bohm's 1952 papers he used the wavefunction to construct a quantum potential that, when included in Newton's equations, gave the trajectories of the particles streaming through the two slits. In effect the wavefunction interferes with itself and guides the particles by the quantum potential in such a way that the particles avoid the regions in which the interference is destructive and are attracted to the regions in which the interference is constructive, resulting in the interference pattern on the detector screen.\nTo explain the behavior when the particle is detected to go through one slit, one needs to appreciate the role of the conditional wavefunction and how it results in the collapse of the wavefunction; this is explained below. The basic idea is that the environment registering the detection effectively separates the two wave packets in configuration space.\nTheory.\nPilot wave.\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory describes a pilot wave formula_15 in a configuration space formula_3 and trajectories formula_17 of particles as in classical mechanics but defined by non-Newtonian mechanics. At every moment of time there exists not only a wavefunction, but also a well-defined configuration of the whole universe (i.e., the system as defined by the boundary conditions used in solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation). \nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory works on particle positions and trajectories like classical mechanics but the dynamics are different. In classical mechanics, the accelerations of the particles are imparted directly by forces, which exist in physical three-dimensional space. In de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the quantum \"field exerts a new kind of \"quantum-mechanical\" force\". Bohm hypothesized that each particle has a \"complex and subtle inner structure\" that provides the capacity to react to the information provided by the wavefunction by the quantum potential. Also, unlike in classical mechanics, physical properties (e.g., mass, charge) are spread out over the wavefunction in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, not localized at the position of the particle.\nThe wavefunction itself, and not the particles, determines the dynamical evolution of the system: the particles do not act back onto the wave function. As Bohm and Hiley worded it, \"the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the quantum field does not have sources, nor does it have any other way by which the field could be directly affected by the condition of the particles [...] the quantum theory can be understood completely in terms of the assumption that the quantum field has no sources or other forms of dependence on the particles\". P. Holland considers this lack of reciprocal action of particles and wave function to be one \"[a]mong the many nonclassical properties exhibited by this theory\". Holland later called this a merely \"apparent\" lack of back reaction, due to the incompleteness of the description.\nIn what follows below, the setup for one particle moving in formula_18 is given followed by the setup for \"N\" particles moving in 3 dimensions. In the first instance, configuration space and real space are the same, while in the second, real space is still formula_18, but configuration space becomes formula_20. While the particle positions themselves are in real space, the velocity field and wavefunction are on configuration space, which is how particles are entangled with each other in this theory.\nExtensions to this theory include spin and more complicated configuration spaces.\nWe use variations of formula_21 for particle positions, while formula_22 represents the complex-valued wavefunction on configuration space.\nGuiding equation.\nFor a spinless single particle moving in formula_18, the particle's velocity is\nformula_24\nFor many particles labeled formula_4 for the formula_26-th particle their velocities are\nformula_27\nThe main fact to notice is that this velocity field depends on the actual positions of all of the formula_5 particles in the universe. As explained below, in most experimental situations, the influence of all of those particles can be encapsulated into an effective wavefunction for a subsystem of the universe.\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation.\nThe one-particle Schr\u00f6dinger equation governs the time evolution of a complex-valued wavefunction on formula_18. The equation represents a quantized version of the total energy of a classical system evolving under a real-valued potential function formula_30 on formula_18:\n formula_32\nFor many particles, the equation is the same except that formula_22 and formula_30 are now on configuration space, formula_20:\n formula_36\nThis is the same wavefunction as in conventional quantum mechanics.\nRelation to the Born rule.\nIn Bohm's original papers, he discusses how de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory results in the usual measurement results of quantum mechanics. The main idea is that this is true if the positions of the particles satisfy the statistical distribution given by formula_37. And that distribution is guaranteed to be true for all time by the guiding equation if the initial distribution of the particles satisfies formula_37.\nFor a given experiment, one can postulate this as being true and verify it experimentally. But, as argued by D\u00fcrr et al., one needs to argue that this distribution for subsystems is typical. The authors argue that formula_37, by virtue of its equivariance under the dynamical evolution of the system, is the appropriate measure of typicality for initial conditions of the positions of the particles. The authors then prove that the vast majority of possible initial configurations will give rise to statistics obeying the Born rule (i.e., formula_37) for measurement outcomes. In summary, in a universe governed by the de Broglie\u2013Bohm dynamics, Born rule behavior is typical.\nThe situation is thus analogous to the situation in classical statistical physics. A low-entropy initial condition will, with overwhelmingly high probability, evolve into a higher-entropy state: behavior consistent with the second law of thermodynamics is typical. There are anomalous initial conditions that would give rise to violations of the second law; however in the absence of some very detailed evidence supporting the realization of one of those conditions, it would be quite unreasonable to expect anything but the actually observed uniform increase of entropy. Similarly in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, there are anomalous initial conditions that would produce measurement statistics in violation of the Born rule (conflicting the predictions of standard quantum theory), but the typicality theorem shows that absent some specific reason to believe one of those special initial conditions was in fact realized, the Born rule behavior is what one should expect.\nIt is in this qualified sense that the Born rule is, for the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, a theorem rather than (as in ordinary quantum theory) an additional postulate.\nIt can also be shown that a distribution of particles which is \"not\" distributed according to the Born rule (that is, a distribution \"out of quantum equilibrium\") and evolving under the de Broglie\u2013Bohm dynamics is overwhelmingly likely to evolve dynamically into a state distributed as formula_37.\nThe conditional wavefunction of a subsystem.\nIn the formulation of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, there is only a wavefunction for the entire universe (which always evolves by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation). Here, the \"universe\" is simply the system limited by the same boundary conditions used to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. However, once the theory is formulated, it is convenient to introduce a notion of wavefunction also for subsystems of the universe. Let us write the wavefunction of the universe as formula_42, where formula_43 denotes the configuration variables associated to some subsystem (I) of the universe, and formula_44 denotes the remaining configuration variables. Denote respectively by formula_45 and formula_46 the actual configuration of subsystem (I) and of the rest of the universe. For simplicity, we consider here only the spinless case. The \"conditional wavefunction\" of subsystem (I) is defined by\nformula_47\nIt follows immediately from the fact that formula_48 satisfies the guiding equation that also the configuration formula_45 satisfies a guiding equation identical to the one presented in the formulation of the theory, with the universal wavefunction formula_22 replaced with the conditional wavefunction formula_51. Also, the fact that formula_52 is random with probability density given by the square modulus of formula_53 implies that the conditional probability density of formula_45 given formula_46 is given by the square modulus of the (normalized) conditional wavefunction formula_56 (in the terminology of D\u00fcrr et al. this fact is called the \"fundamental conditional probability formula\").\nUnlike the universal wavefunction, the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem does not always evolve by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, but in many situations it does. For instance, if the universal wavefunction factors as\nformula_57\nthen the conditional wavefunction of subsystem (I) is (up to an irrelevant scalar factor) equal to formula_51 (this is what standard quantum theory would regard as the wavefunction of subsystem (I)). If, in addition, the Hamiltonian does not contain an interaction term between subsystems (I) and (II), then formula_51 does satisfy a Schr\u00f6dinger equation. More generally, assume that the universal wave function formula_22 can be written in the form\nformula_61\nwhere formula_62 solves Schr\u00f6dinger equation and, formula_63 for all formula_14 and formula_43. Then, again, the conditional wavefunction of subsystem (I) is (up to an irrelevant scalar factor) equal to formula_51, and if the Hamiltonian does not contain an interaction term between subsystems (I) and (II), then formula_51 satisfies a Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nThe fact that the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem does not always evolve by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is related to the fact that the usual collapse rule of standard quantum theory emerges from the Bohmian formalism when one considers conditional wavefunctions of subsystems.\nExtensions.\nRelativity.\nPilot-wave theory is explicitly nonlocal, which is in ostensible conflict with special relativity. Various extensions of \"Bohm-like\" mechanics exist that attempt to resolve this problem. Bohm himself in 1953 presented an extension of the theory satisfying the Dirac equation for a single particle. However, this was not extensible to the many-particle case because it used an absolute time.\nA renewed interest in constructing Lorentz-invariant extensions of Bohmian theory arose in the 1990s; see \"Bohm and Hiley: The Undivided Universe\" and references therein. Another approach is given by D\u00fcrr et al., who use Bohm\u2013Dirac models and a Lorentz-invariant foliation of space-time.\nThus, D\u00fcrr et al. (1999) showed that it is possible to formally restore Lorentz invariance for the Bohm\u2013Dirac theory by introducing additional structure. This approach still requires a foliation of space-time. While this is in conflict with the standard interpretation of relativity, the preferred foliation, if unobservable, does not lead to any empirical conflicts with relativity. In 2013, D\u00fcrr et al. suggested that the required foliation could be covariantly determined by the wavefunction.\nThe relation between nonlocality and preferred foliation can be better understood as follows. In de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, nonlocality manifests as the fact that the velocity and acceleration of one particle depends on the instantaneous positions of all other particles. On the other hand, in the theory of relativity the concept of instantaneousness does not have an invariant meaning. Thus, to define particle trajectories, one needs an additional rule that defines which space-time points should be considered instantaneous. The simplest way to achieve this is to introduce a preferred foliation of space-time by hand, such that each hypersurface of the foliation defines a hypersurface of equal time.\nInitially, it had been considered impossible to set out a description of photon trajectories in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in view of the difficulties of describing bosons relativistically. In 1996, Partha Ghose presented a relativistic quantum-mechanical description of spin-0 and spin-1 bosons starting from the Duffin\u2013Kemmer\u2013Petiau equation, setting out Bohmian trajectories for massive bosons and for massless bosons (and therefore photons). In 2001, Jean-Pierre Vigier emphasized the importance of deriving a well-defined description of light in terms of particle trajectories in the framework of either the Bohmian mechanics or the Nelson stochastic mechanics. The same year, Ghose worked out Bohmian photon trajectories for specific cases. Subsequent weak-measurement experiments yielded trajectories that coincide with the predicted trajectories. The significance of these experimental findings is controversial.\nChris Dewdney and G. Horton have proposed a relativistically covariant, wave-functional formulation of Bohm's quantum field theory and have extended it to a form that allows the inclusion of gravity.\nNikoli\u0107 has proposed a Lorentz-covariant formulation of the Bohmian interpretation of many-particle wavefunctions. He has developed a generalized relativistic-invariant probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory, in which formula_37 is no longer a probability density in space, but a probability density in space-time. He uses this generalized probabilistic interpretation to formulate a relativistic-covariant version of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory without introducing a preferred foliation of space-time. His work also covers the extension of the Bohmian interpretation to a quantization of fields and strings.\nRoderick I. Sutherland at the University in Sydney has a Lagrangian formalism for the pilot wave and its beables. It draws on Yakir Aharonov's retrocasual weak measurements to explain many-particle entanglement in a special relativistic way without the need for configuration space. The basic idea was already published by Olivier Costa de Beauregard in the 1950s and is also used by John Cramer in his transactional interpretation except the beables that exist between the von Neumann strong projection operator measurements. Sutherland's Lagrangian includes two-way action-reaction between pilot wave and beables. Therefore, it is a post-quantum non-statistical theory with final boundary conditions that violate the no-signal theorems of quantum theory. Just as special relativity is a limiting case of general relativity when the spacetime curvature vanishes, so, too is statistical no-entanglement signaling quantum theory with the Born rule a limiting case of the post-quantum action-reaction Lagrangian when the reaction is set to zero and the final boundary condition is integrated out.\nSpin.\nTo incorporate spin, the wavefunction becomes complex-vector-valued. The value space is called spin space; for a spin-1/2 particle, spin space can be taken to be formula_69. The guiding equation is modified by taking inner products in spin space to reduce the complex vectors to complex numbers. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is modified by adding a Pauli spin term:\nformula_70\nwhere\nStochastic electrodynamics.\nStochastic electrodynamics (SED) is an extension of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, with the electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) playing a central role as the guiding pilot-wave. Modern approaches to SED, like those proposed by the group around late Gerhard Gr\u00f6ssing, among others, consider wave and particle-like quantum effects as well-coordinated emergent systems. These emergent systems are the result of speculated and calculated sub-quantum interactions with the zero-point field.\nQuantum field theory.\nIn D\u00fcrr et al., the authors describe an extension of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory for handling creation and annihilation operators, which they refer to as \"Bell-type quantum field theories\". The basic idea is that configuration space becomes the (disjoint) space of all possible configurations of any number of particles. For part of the time, the system evolves deterministically under the guiding equation with a fixed number of particles. But under a stochastic process, particles may be created and annihilated. The distribution of creation events is dictated by the wavefunction. The wavefunction itself is evolving at all times over the full multi-particle configuration space.\nHrvoje Nikoli\u0107 introduces a purely deterministic de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory of particle creation and destruction, according to which particle trajectories are continuous, but particle detectors behave as if particles have been created or destroyed even when a true creation or destruction of particles does not take place.\nCurved space.\nTo extend de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory to curved space (Riemannian manifolds in mathematical parlance), one simply notes that all of the elements of these equations make sense, such as gradients and Laplacians. Thus, we use equations that have the same form as above. Topological and boundary conditions may apply in supplementing the evolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nFor a de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory on curved space with spin, the spin space becomes a vector bundle over configuration space, and the potential in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation becomes a local self-adjoint operator acting on that space.\nThe field equations for the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in the relativistic case with spin can also be given for curved space-times with torsion.\nIn a general spacetime with curvature and torsion, the guiding equation for the four-velocity formula_90 of an elementary fermion particle isformula_91where the wave function formula_22 is a spinor, formula_93 is the corresponding adjoint, formula_94 are the Dirac matrices, and formula_95 is a tetrad. If the wave function propagates according to the curved Dirac equation, then the particle moves according to the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations of motion, which are an extension of the geodesic equation. This relativistic wave-particle duality follows from the conservation laws for the spin tensor and energy-momentum tensor, and also from the covariant Heisenberg picture equation of motion. \nExploiting nonlocality.\nDe Broglie and Bohm's causal interpretation of quantum mechanics was later extended by Bohm, Vigier, Hiley, Valentini and others to include stochastic properties. Bohm and other physicists, including Valentini, view the Born rule linking formula_96 to the probability density function formula_97 as representing not a basic law, but a result of a system having reached \"quantum equilibrium\" during the course of the time development under the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. It can be shown that, once an equilibrium has been reached, the system remains in such equilibrium over the course of its further evolution: this follows from the continuity equation associated with the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution of formula_22. It is less straightforward to demonstrate whether and how such an equilibrium is reached in the first place.\nAntony Valentini has extended de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory to include signal nonlocality that would allow entanglement to be used as a stand-alone communication channel without a secondary classical \"key\" signal to \"unlock\" the message encoded in the entanglement. This violates orthodox quantum theory but has the virtue of making the parallel universes of the chaotic inflation theory observable in principle.\nUnlike de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, Valentini's theory the wavefunction evolution also depends on the ontological variables. This introduces an instability, a feedback loop that pushes the hidden variables out of \"sub-quantal heat death\". The resulting theory becomes nonlinear and non-unitary. Valentini argues that the laws of quantum mechanics are emergent and form a \"quantum equilibrium\" that is analogous to thermal equilibrium in classical dynamics, such that other \"quantum non-equilibrium\" distributions may in principle be observed and exploited, for which the statistical predictions of quantum theory are violated. It is controversially argued that quantum theory is merely a special case of a much wider nonlinear physics, a physics in which non-local (superluminal) signalling is possible, and in which the uncertainty principle can be violated.\nThree wave hypothesis.\nMore complex variants of this type of approach have appeared, for instance the \"three wave hypothesis\" of Ryszard Horodecki as well as other complicated combinations of de Broglie and Compton waves. To date there is no evidence that these are useful.\nResults.\nBelow are some highlights of the results that arise out of an analysis of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. Experimental results agree with all of quantum mechanics' standard predictions insofar as it has them. But while standard quantum mechanics is limited to discussing the results of \"measurements\", de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory governs the dynamics of a system without the intervention of outside observers (p.\u00a0117 in Bell).\nThe basis for agreement with standard quantum mechanics is that the particles are distributed according to formula_37. This is a statement of observer ignorance: the initial positions are represented by a statistical distribution so deterministic trajectories will result in a statistical distribution.\nMeasuring spin and polarization.\nAccording to ordinary quantum theory, it is not possible to measure the spin or polarization of a particle directly; instead, the component in one direction is measured; the outcome from a single particle may be 1, meaning that the particle is aligned with the measuring apparatus, or \u22121, meaning that it is aligned the opposite way. An ensemble of particles prepared by a polarizer to be in state 1 will all measure polarized in state 1 in a subsequent apparatus. A polarized ensemble sent through a polarizer set at angle to the first pass will result in some values of 1 and some of \u22121 with a probability that depends on the relative alignment. For a full explanation of this, see the Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment.\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the results of a spin experiment cannot be analyzed without some knowledge of the experimental setup. It is possible to modify the setup so that the trajectory of the particle is unaffected, but that the particle with one setup registers as spin-up, while in the other setup it registers as spin-down. Thus, for the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the particle's spin is not an intrinsic property of the particle; instead spin is, so to speak, in the wavefunction of the particle in relation to the particular device being used to measure the spin. This is an illustration of what is sometimes referred to as contextuality and is related to naive realism about operators. Interpretationally, measurement results are a deterministic property of the system and its environment, which includes information about the experimental setup including the context of co-measured observables; in no sense does the system itself possess the property being measured, as would have been the case in classical physics.\nMeasurements, the quantum formalism, and observer independence.\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory gives almost the same results as (non-relativisitic) quantum mechanics. It treats the wavefunction as a fundamental object in the theory, as the wavefunction describes how the particles move. This means that no experiment can distinguish between the two theories. This section outlines the ideas as to how the standard quantum formalism arises out of quantum mechanics.\nCollapse of the wavefunction.\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is a theory that applies primarily to the whole universe. That is, there is a single wavefunction governing the motion of all of the particles in the universe according to the guiding equation. Theoretically, the motion of one particle depends on the positions of all of the other particles in the universe. In some situations, such as in experimental systems, we can represent the system itself in terms of a de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in which the wavefunction of the system is obtained by conditioning on the environment of the system. Thus, the system can be analyzed with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the guiding equation, with an initial formula_37 distribution for the particles in the system (see the section on the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem for details).\nIt requires a special setup for the conditional wavefunction of a system to obey a quantum evolution. When a system interacts with its environment, such as through a measurement, the conditional wavefunction of the system evolves in a different way. The evolution of the universal wavefunction can become such that the wavefunction of the system appears to be in a superposition of distinct states. But if the environment has recorded the results of the experiment, then using the actual Bohmian configuration of the environment to condition on, the conditional wavefunction collapses to just one alternative, the one corresponding with the measurement results.\nCollapse of the universal wavefunction never occurs in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. Its entire evolution is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and the particles' evolutions are governed by the guiding equation. Collapse only occurs in a phenomenological way for systems that seem to follow their own Schr\u00f6dinger equation. As this is an effective description of the system, it is a matter of choice as to what to define the experimental system to include, and this will affect when \"collapse\" occurs.\nOperators as observables.\nIn the standard quantum formalism, measuring observables is generally thought of as measuring operators on the Hilbert space. For example, measuring position is considered to be a measurement of the position operator. This relationship between physical measurements and Hilbert space operators is, for standard quantum mechanics, an additional axiom of the theory. The de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, by contrast, requires no such measurement axioms (and measurement as such is not a dynamically distinct or special sub-category of physical processes in the theory). In particular, the usual operators-as-observables formalism is, for de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, a theorem. A major point of the analysis is that many of the measurements of the observables do not correspond to properties of the particles; they are (as in the case of spin discussed above) measurements of the wavefunction.\nIn the history of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, the proponents have often had to deal with claims that this theory is impossible. Such arguments are generally based on inappropriate analysis of operators as observables. If one believes that spin measurements are indeed measuring the spin of a particle that existed prior to the measurement, then one does reach contradictions. De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory deals with this by noting that spin is not a feature of the particle, but rather that of the wavefunction. As such, it only has a definite outcome once the experimental apparatus is chosen. Once that is taken into account, the impossibility theorems become irrelevant.\nThere are also objections to this theory based on what it says about particular situations usually involving eigenstates of an operator. For example, the ground state of hydrogen is a real wavefunction. According to the guiding equation, this means that the electron is at rest when in this state. Nevertheless, it is distributed according to formula_37, and no contradiction to experimental results is possible to detect.\nOperators as observables leads many to believe that many operators are equivalent. De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, from this perspective, chooses the position observable as a favored observable rather than, say, the momentum observable. Again, the link to the position observable is a consequence of the dynamics. The motivation for de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is to describe a system of particles. This implies that the goal of the theory is to describe the positions of those particles at all times. Other observables do not have this compelling ontological status. Having definite positions explains having definite results such as flashes on a detector screen. Other observables would not lead to that conclusion, but there need not be any problem in defining a mathematical theory for other observables; see Hyman et al. for an exploration of the fact that a probability density and probability current can be defined for any set of commuting operators.\nHidden variables.\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is often referred to as a \"hidden-variable\" theory. Bohm used this description in his original papers on the subject, writing: \"From the point of view of the usual interpretation, these additional elements or parameters [permitting a detailed causal and continuous description of all processes] could be called 'hidden' variables.\" Bohm and Hiley later stated that they found Bohm's choice of the term \"hidden variables\" to be too restrictive. In particular, they argued that a particle is not actually hidden but rather \"is what is most directly manifested in an observation [though] its properties cannot be observed with arbitrary precision (within the limits set by uncertainty principle)\". However, others nevertheless treat the term \"hidden variable\" as a suitable description.\nGeneralized particle trajectories can be extrapolated from numerous weak measurements on an ensemble of equally prepared systems, and such trajectories coincide with the de Broglie\u2013Bohm trajectories. In particular, an experiment with two entangled photons, in which a set of Bohmian trajectories for one of the photons was determined using weak measurements and postselection, can be understood in terms of a nonlocal connection between that photon's trajectory and the other photon's polarization. However, not only the De Broglie\u2013Bohm interpretation, but also many other interpretations of quantum mechanics that do not include such trajectories are consistent with such experimental evidence.\nDifferent predictions.\nA specialized version of the double slit experiment has been devised to test characteristics of the trajectory predictions.\nResults from one such experiment agreed with the predictions of standard quantum mechanics and disagreed with the Bohm predictions when they conflicted. These conclusions have been the subject of debate.\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle.\nThe Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that when two complementary measurements are made, there is a limit to the product of their accuracy. As an example, if one measures the position with an accuracy of formula_102 and the momentum with an accuracy of formula_103, then formula_104\nIn de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, there is always a matter of fact about the position and momentum of a particle. Each particle has a well-defined trajectory, as well as a wavefunction. Observers have limited knowledge as to what this trajectory is (and thus of the position and momentum). It is the lack of knowledge of the particle's trajectory that accounts for the uncertainty relation. What one can know about a particle at any given time is described by the wavefunction. Since the uncertainty relation can be derived from the wavefunction in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, it can be likewise derived (in the epistemic sense mentioned above) on the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\nTo put the statement differently, the particles' positions are only known statistically. As in classical mechanics, successive observations of the particles' positions refine the experimenter's knowledge of the particles' initial conditions. Thus, with succeeding observations, the initial conditions become more and more restricted. This formalism is consistent with the normal use of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nFor the derivation of the uncertainty relation, see Heisenberg uncertainty principle, noting that this article describes the principle from the viewpoint of the Copenhagen interpretation.\nQuantum entanglement, Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox, Bell's theorem, and nonlocality.\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory highlighted the issue of nonlocality: it inspired John Stewart Bell to prove his now-famous theorem, which in turn led to the Bell test experiments.\nIn the Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox, the authors describe a thought experiment that one could perform on a pair of particles that have interacted, the results of which they interpreted as indicating that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory.\nDecades later John Bell proved Bell's theorem (see p.\u00a014 in Bell), in which he showed that, if they are to agree with the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics, all such \"hidden-variable\" completions of quantum mechanics must either be nonlocal (as the Bohm interpretation is) or give up the assumption that experiments produce unique results (see counterfactual definiteness and many-worlds interpretation). In particular, Bell proved that any local theory with unique results must make empirical predictions satisfying a statistical constraint called \"Bell's inequality\".\nAlain Aspect performed a series of Bell tests that test Bell's inequality using a variant of the EPR scenario. Aspect's results show experimentally that Bell's inequality is in fact violated, meaning that the relevant quantum-mechanical predictions are correct. In these Bell tests, spin-entangled pairs of particles are created; the particles are then separated, traveling to remote measuring devices. The orientation of the measuring devices can be changed while the particles are in flight, demonstrating the apparent nonlocality of the effect.\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory makes the same empirically verified predictions for the Bell test experiments as ordinary quantum mechanics. The de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is non relativistic and manifestly nonlocal. It is often criticized or rejected based on this; Bell's attitude was: \"It is a merit of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm version to bring this [nonlocality] out so explicitly that it cannot be ignored.\"\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory describes the physics in the Bell test experiments as follows: to understand the evolution of the particles, we need to set up a wave equation for both particles; the orientation of the apparatus affects the wavefunction. The particles in the experiment follow the guidance of the wavefunction. It is the wavefunction that carries the faster-than-light effect of changing the orientation of the apparatus. Maudlin provides an analysis of exactly what kind of nonlocality is present and how it is compatible with relativity. Bell has shown that the nonlocality does not allow superluminal communication. Maudlin has shown this in greater detail.\nClassical limit.\nBohm's formulation of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in a classical-looking version has the merits that the emergence of classical behavior seems to follow immediately for any situation in which the quantum potential is negligible, as noted by Bohm in 1952. Modern methods of decoherence are relevant to an analysis of this limit. See Allori et al. for steps towards a rigorous analysis.\nQuantum trajectory method.\nWork by Robert E. Wyatt in the early 2000s attempted to use the Bohm \"particles\" as an adaptive mesh that follows the actual trajectory of a quantum state in time and space. In the \"quantum trajectory\" method, one samples the quantum wavefunction with a mesh of quadrature points. One then evolves the quadrature points in time according to the Bohm equations of motion. At each time step, one then re-synthesizes the wavefunction from the points, recomputes the quantum forces, and continues the calculation. (QuickTime movies of this for H + H2 reactive scattering can be found on the http:// at UT Austin.)\nThis approach has been adapted, extended, and used by a number of researchers in the chemical physics community as a way to compute semi-classical and quasi-classical molecular dynamics. A 2007 issue of The Journal of Physical Chemistry A was dedicated to Prof. Wyatt and his work on \"computational Bohmian dynamics\".\nEric R. Bittner's group at the University of Houston has advanced a statistical variant of this approach that uses Bayesian sampling technique to sample the quantum density and compute the quantum potential on a structureless mesh of points. This technique was recently used to estimate quantum effects in the heat capacity of small clusters Nen for \"n\" \u2248 100.\nThere remain difficulties using the Bohmian approach, mostly associated with the formation of singularities in the quantum potential due to nodes in the quantum wavefunction. In general, nodes forming due to interference effects lead to the case where formula_105 This results in an infinite force on the sample particles forcing them to move away from the node and often crossing the path of other sample points (which violates single-valuedness). Various schemes have been developed to overcome this; however, no general solution has yet emerged.\nThese methods, as does Bohm's Hamilton\u2013Jacobi formulation, do not apply to situations in which the full dynamics of spin need to be taken into account.\nThe properties of trajectories in the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory differ significantly from the Moyal quantum trajectories as well as the quantum trajectories from the unraveling of an open quantum system.\nSimilarities with the many-worlds interpretation.\nKim Joris Bostr\u00f6m has proposed a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory that combines elements of de Broglie-Bohm mechanics and Everett's many-worlds. In particular, the unreal many-worlds interpretation of Hawking and Weinberg is similar to the Bohmian concept of unreal empty branch worlds:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The second issue with Bohmian mechanics may, at first sight, appear rather harmless, but which on a closer look develops considerable destructive power: the issue of empty branches. These are the components of the post-measurement state that do not guide any particles because they do not have the actual configuration \"q\" in their support. At first sight, the empty branches do not appear problematic but on the contrary very helpful as they enable the theory to explain unique outcomes of measurements. Also, they seem to explain why there is an effective \"collapse of the wavefunction\", as in ordinary quantum mechanics. On a closer view, though, one must admit that these empty branches do not actually disappear. As the wavefunction is taken to describe a really existing field, all their branches really exist and will evolve forever by the Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics, no matter how many of them will become empty in the course of the evolution. Every branch of the global wavefunction potentially describes a complete world which is, according to Bohm's ontology, only a possible world that would be the actual world if only it were filled with particles, and which is in every respect identical to a corresponding world in Everett's theory. Only one branch at a time is occupied by particles, thereby representing the actual world, while all other branches, though really existing as part of a really existing wavefunction, are empty and thus contain some sort of \"zombie worlds\" with planets, oceans, trees, cities, cars and people who talk like us and behave like us, but who do not actually exist. Now, if the Everettian theory may be accused of ontological extravagance, then Bohmian mechanics could be accused of ontological wastefulness. On top of the ontology of empty branches comes the additional ontology of particle positions that are, on account of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, forever unknown to the observer. Yet, the actual configuration is never needed for the calculation of the statistical predictions in experimental reality, for these can be obtained by mere wavefunction algebra. From this perspective, Bohmian mechanics may appear as a wasteful and redundant theory. I think it is considerations like these that are the biggest obstacle in the way of a general acceptance of Bohmian mechanics.\nMany authors have expressed critical views of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory by comparing it to Everett's many-worlds approach. Many (but not all) proponents of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory (such as Bohm and Bell) interpret the universal wavefunction as physically real. According to some supporters of Everett's theory, if the (never collapsing) wavefunction is taken to be physically real, then it is natural to interpret the theory as having the same many worlds as Everett's theory. In the Everettian view the role of the Bohmian particle is to act as a \"pointer\", tagging, or selecting, just one branch of the universal wavefunction (the assumption that this branch indicates which \"wave packet\" determines the observed result of a given experiment is called the \"result assumption\"); the other branches are designated \"empty\" and implicitly assumed by Bohm to be devoid of conscious observers. H. Dieter Zeh comments on these \"empty\" branches:\nDavid Deutsch has expressed the same point more \"acerbically\":\nThis conclusion has been challenged by Detlef D\u00fcrr and Justin Lazarovici:\nThe Bohmian, of course, cannot accept this argument. For her, it is decidedly the particle configuration in three-dimensional space and not the wave function on the abstract configuration space that constitutes a world (or rather, the world). Instead, she will accuse the Everettian of not having local beables (in Bell's sense) in her theory, that is, the ontological variables that refer to localized entities in three-dimensional space or four-dimensional spacetime. The many worlds of her theory thus merely appear as a grotesque consequence of this omission.\nOccam's-razor criticism.\nMany authors such as nobel laureates Werner Heisenberg, Sir Anthony James Leggett and Sir Roger Penrose have criticized it for not adding anything new.\nBoth Hugh Everett III and Bohm treated the wavefunction as a physically real field. Everett's many-worlds interpretation is an attempt to demonstrate that the wavefunction alone is sufficient to account for all our observations. When we see the particle detectors flash or hear the click of a Geiger counter, Everett's theory interprets this as our \"wavefunction\" responding to changes in the detector's \"wavefunction\", which is responding in turn to the passage of another \"wavefunction\" (which we think of as a \"particle\", but is actually just another wave packet). No particle (in the Bohm sense of having a defined position and velocity) exists according to that theory. For this reason Everett sometimes referred to his own many-worlds approach as the \"pure wave theory\". Of Bohm's 1952 approach, Everett said:\nIn the Everettian view, then, the Bohm particles are superfluous entities, similar to, and equally as unnecessary as, for example, the luminiferous ether, which was found to be unnecessary in special relativity. This argument is sometimes called the \"redundancy argument\", since the superfluous particles are redundant in the sense of Occam's razor.\nAccording to Brown &amp; Wallace, the de Broglie\u2013Bohm particles play no role in the solution of the measurement problem. For these authors, the \"result assumption\" (see above) is inconsistent with the view that there is no measurement problem in the predictable outcome (i.e. single-outcome) case. They also say that a standard tacit assumption of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory (that an observer becomes aware of configurations of particles of ordinary objects by means of correlations between such configurations and the configuration of the particles in the observer's brain) is unreasonable. This conclusion has been challenged by Valentini, who argues that the entirety of such objections arises from a failure to interpret de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory on its own terms. According to Peter R. Holland, in a wider Hamiltonian framework, theories can be formulated in which particles \"do\" act back on the wave function.\nDerivations.\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory has been derived many times and in many ways. Below are six derivations, all of which are very different and lead to different ways of understanding and extending this theory.\n The guiding equation can be derived in a similar fashion. We assume a plane wave: formula_108. Notice that formula_109. Assuming that formula_110 for the particle's actual velocity, we have that formula_111. Thus, we have the guiding equation.\n Notice that this derivation does not use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n Decomposition: formula_114 Note that formula_115 corresponds to the probability density formula_116.\n Continuity equation: formula_117.\n Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation: formula_118\n The Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation is the equation derived from a Newtonian system with potential formula_119 and velocity field formula_120 The potential formula_30 is the classical potential that appears in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and the other term involving formula_96 is the quantum potential, terminology introduced by Bohm.\n This leads to viewing the quantum theory as particles moving under the classical force modified by a quantum force. However, unlike standard Newtonian mechanics, the initial velocity field is already specified by formula_123, which is a symptom of this being a first-order theory, not a second-order theory.\n This formulation allows for stochastic theories such as the creation and annihilation of particles.\nHistory.\nThe theory was historically developed in the 1920s by de Broglie, who, in 1927, was persuaded to abandon it in favour of the then-mainstream Copenhagen interpretation. David Bohm, dissatisfied with the prevailing orthodoxy, rediscovered de Broglie's pilot-wave theory in 1952. Bohm's suggestions were not then widely received, partly due to reasons unrelated to their content, such as Bohm's youthful communist affiliations. The de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory was widely deemed unacceptable by mainstream theorists, mostly because of its explicit non-locality. On the theory, John Stewart Bell, author of the 1964 Bell's theorem wrote in 1982: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSince the 1990s, there has been renewed interest in formulating extensions to de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, attempting to reconcile it with special relativity and quantum field theory, besides other features such as spin or curved spatial geometries.\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory has a history of different formulations and names. In this section, each stage is given a name and a main reference.\nPilot-wave theory.\nLouis de Broglie presented his pilot wave theory at the 1927 Solvay Conference, after close collaboration with Schr\u00f6dinger, who developed his wave equation for de Broglie's theory. At the end of the presentation, Wolfgang Pauli pointed out that it was not compatible with a semi-classical technique Fermi had previously adopted in the case of inelastic scattering. Contrary to a popular legend, de Broglie actually gave the correct rebuttal that the particular technique could not be generalized for Pauli's purpose, although the audience might have been lost in the technical details and de Broglie's mild manner left the impression that Pauli's objection was valid. He was eventually persuaded to abandon this theory nonetheless because he was \"discouraged by criticisms which [it] roused\". De Broglie's theory already applies to multiple spin-less particles, but lacks an adequate theory of measurement as no one understood quantum decoherence at the time. An analysis of de Broglie's presentation is given in Bacciagaluppi et al. Also, in 1932 John von Neumann published a no hidden variables proof in his book \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\", that was widely believed to prove that all hidden-variable theories are impossible. This sealed the fate of de Broglie's theory for the next two decades.\nIn 1926, Erwin Madelung had developed a hydrodynamic version of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is incorrectly considered as a basis for the density current derivation of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory. The Madelung equations, being quantum analog of Euler equations of fluid dynamics, differ philosophically from the de Broglie\u2013Bohm mechanics and are the basis of the stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nPeter R. Holland has pointed out that, earlier in 1927, Einstein had actually submitted a preprint with a similar proposal but, not convinced, had withdrawn it before publication. According to Holland, failure to appreciate key points of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory has led to confusion, the key point being \"that the trajectories of a many-body quantum system are correlated not because the particles exert a direct force on one another (\"\u00e0 la\" Coulomb) but because all are acted upon by an entity \u2013 mathematically described by the wavefunction or functions of it \u2013 that lies beyond them\". This entity is the quantum potential.\nAfter publishing his popular textbook \"Quantum Theory\" that adhered entirely to the Copenhagen orthodoxy, Bohm was persuaded by Einstein to take a critical look at von Neumann's no hidden variables proof. The result was 'A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden Variables\" I and II' [Bohm 1952]. It was an independent origination of the pilot wave theory, and extended it to incorporate a consistent theory of measurement, and to address a criticism of Pauli that de Broglie did not properly respond to; it is taken to be deterministic (though Bohm hinted in the original papers that there should be disturbances to this, in the way Brownian motion disturbs Newtonian mechanics). This stage is known as the \"de Broglie\u2013Bohm Theory\" in Bell's work [Bell 1987] and is the basis for 'The Quantum Theory of Motion' [Holland 1993].\nThis stage applies to multiple particles, and is deterministic.\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is an example of a hidden-variables theory. Bohm originally hoped that hidden variables could provide a local, causal, objective description that would resolve or eliminate many of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, such as Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, the measurement problem and the collapse of the wavefunction. However, Bell's theorem complicates this hope, as it demonstrates that there can be no local hidden-variable theory that is compatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics. The Bohmian interpretation is causal but not local.\nBohm's paper was largely ignored or panned by other physicists. Albert Einstein, who had suggested that Bohm search for a realist alternative to the prevailing Copenhagen approach, did not consider Bohm's interpretation to be a satisfactory answer to the quantum nonlocality question, calling it \"too cheap\", while Werner Heisenberg considered it a \"superfluous 'ideological superstructure' \". Wolfgang Pauli, who had been unconvinced by de Broglie in 1927, conceded to Bohm as follows:\nI just received your long letter of 20th November, and I also have studied more thoroughly the details of your paper. I do not see any longer the possibility of any logical contradiction as long as your results agree completely with those of the usual wave mechanics and as long as no means is given to measure the values of your hidden parameters both in the measuring apparatus and in the observe [sic] system. As far as the whole matter stands now, your 'extra wave-mechanical predictions' are still a check, which cannot be cashed.\nHe subsequently described Bohm's theory as \"artificial metaphysics\".\nAccording to physicist Max Dresden, when Bohm's theory was presented at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, many of the objections were ad hominem, focusing on Bohm's sympathy with communists as exemplified by his refusal to give testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee.\nIn 1979, Chris Philippidis, Chris Dewdney and Basil Hiley were the first to perform numeric computations on the basis of the quantum potential to deduce ensembles of particle trajectories. Their work renewed the interests of physicists in the Bohm interpretation of quantum physics.\nEventually John Bell began to defend the theory. In \"Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics\" [Bell 1987], several of the papers refer to hidden-variables theories (which include Bohm's).\nThe trajectories of the Bohm model that would result for particular experimental arrangements were termed \"surreal\" by some. Still in 2016, mathematical physicist Sheldon Goldstein said of Bohm's theory: \"There was a time when you couldn't even talk about it because it was heretical. It probably still is the kiss of death for a physics career to be actually working on Bohm, but maybe that's changing.\"\nBohmian mechanics.\nBohmian mechanics is the same theory, but with an emphasis on the notion of current flow, which is determined on the basis of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis that the probability follows the Born rule. The term \"Bohmian mechanics\" is also often used to include most of the further extensions past the spin-less version of Bohm. While de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory has Lagrangians and Hamilton-Jacobi equations as a primary focus and backdrop, with the icon of the quantum potential, Bohmian mechanics considers the continuity equation as primary and has the guiding equation as its icon. They are mathematically equivalent in so far as the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation applies, i.e., spin-less particles.\nAll of non-relativistic quantum mechanics can be fully accounted for in this theory. Recent studies have used this formalism to compute the evolution of many-body quantum systems, with a considerable increase in speed as compared to other quantum-based methods.\nCausal interpretation and ontological interpretation.\nBohm developed his original ideas, calling them the \"Causal Interpretation\". Later he felt that \"causal\" sounded too much like \"deterministic\" and preferred to call his theory the \"Ontological Interpretation\". The main reference is \"The Undivided Universe\" (Bohm, Hiley 1993).\nThis stage covers work by Bohm and in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Vigier and Basil Hiley. Bohm is clear that this theory is non-deterministic (the work with Hiley includes a stochastic theory). As such, this theory is not strictly speaking a formulation of de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory, but it deserves mention here because the term \"Bohm Interpretation\" is ambiguous between this theory and de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\nIn 1996 philosopher of science Arthur Fine gave an in-depth analysis of possible interpretations of Bohm's model of 1952.\nWilliam Simpson has suggested a hylomorphic interpretation of Bohmian mechanics, in which the cosmos is an Aristotelian substance composed of material particles and a substantial form. The wave function is assigned a dispositional role in choreographing the trajectories of the particles.\nHydrodynamic quantum analogs.\nExperiments on hydrodynamical analogs of quantum mechanics beginning with the work of Couder and Fort (2006) have purported to show that macroscopic classical pilot-waves can exhibit characteristics previously thought to be restricted to the quantum realm. Hydrodynamic pilot-wave analogs have been claimed to duplicate the double slit experiment, tunneling, quantized orbits, and numerous other quantum phenomena which have led to a resurgence in interest in pilot wave theories. \nThe analogs have been compared to the \"Faraday wave\".\nThese results have been disputed: experiments fail to reproduce aspects of the double-slit experiments. High precision measurements in the tunneling case point to a different origin of the unpredictable crossing: rather than initial position uncertainty or environmental noise, interactions at the barrier seem to be involved. \nAnother classical analog has been reported in surface gravity waves.\nSurrealistic trajectories.\nIn 1992, Englert, Scully, Sussman, and Walther proposed experiments that would show particles taking paths that differ from the Bohm trajectories. They described the Bohm trajectories as \"surrealistic\"; their proposal was later referred to as ESSW after the last names of the authors.\nIn 2016, Mahler et al. verified the ESSW predictions. However they propose the surrealistic effect is a consequence of the nonlocality inherent in Bohm's theory.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

{"id": "54727", "revid": "4637213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54727", "title": "Scotland Yard (board game)", "text": "1983 board game\nScotland Yard is a board game in which a team of players controlling different detectives cooperate to track down a player controlling a criminal as they move around a board representing the streets of London. It was first published in 1983 by Ravensburger and is named after Scotland Yard which is the headquarters of London's Metropolitan Police Service in real-life. \"Scotland Yard\" is an asymmetric board game, during which the detective players cooperatively solve a variant of the pursuit\u2013evasion problem.\nThe game is published by Ravensburger in most of Europe and Canada and by Milton Bradley in the United States. It received the \"Spiel des Jahres\" (Game of the Year) award in 1983, the same year that it was published.\nGameplay.\nOne player controls 'Mr. X': a criminal whose location is only revealed periodically throughout gameplay. The other players each control at least one detective, all of which are always present on the board. In the Milton Bradley version, there are always five detectives on the board, so with less than six players, one player can control two or three detectives.\nSetup.\nEach player draws one card for each piece under their control to determine their starting location(s), with Mr. X drawing first. The detectives place their tokens at the locations they drew, but Mr. X does not. The locations on the cards are spaced far enough apart to ensure that Mr. X cannot be caught in the first round of play. There are a total of 199 spaces (\"stations\") on the board.\nMovement.\nMovement is governed by using transportation tokens (\"tickets\"), which allow passage between spaces according to the following modes:\nEach detective begins with a finite mix of taxi, bus, and underground tickets. Mr. X starts with the remaining transport tickets; however, detectives must turn their used tickets over to Mr. X, effectively giving that player unlimited travel resources.\nFrom any given space, movement is possible along a line matching the mode of transportation (taxi, bus, or underground) to the closest adjacent space for that mode. Each space is coloured to indicate the modes of transportation available there: yellow for taxis, green for buses, red for the Underground. For example, a player at space #74 could move as follows:\nMr. X also has a supply of black tickets that are valid for any mode of transport available at their current location. These tickets can also be used to move between the ferry stops on the River Thames, joined by black lines; Mr. X is the only one who can travel in this manner. In addition, the player assuming the role of Mr. X is given several double-move tokens, which allows them to make two moves in a single turn.\nA space may be occupied by only one (visible) pawn at a time. If an adjacent space is already occupied, the pawn may not be moved there. However, a player travelling by bus or underground may bypass an occupied space if the closest adjacent stop in that direction is open.\nMr. X's movements are documented through a \"travel log\" with paper inserts, divided into slots that are covered by used tickets. For each move that Mr. X makes, they write down their destination secretly and then cover it with the ticket they have used to reach it, thus providing the detectives with clues as to their whereabouts. The first number written down is not the starting space, but is the first destination using the ticket displayed. If a double move is used, Mr. X must log both moves separately, use a transportation ticket for each one, and surrender one of the double move tickets. Mr. X moves first on every turn, after which the detectives move in any order. \nDetectives may not trade, give away, or combine their tickets, and a player controlling multiple detectives must keep their ticket supplies separate. If a detective reaches a location from which they cannot move (e.g. holding only Underground tickets while at a taxi/bus stop), they become stranded and must remain at that location until the game is over.\nAt five specific times during the game, Mr. X has to reveal their current position. The windows on the travel log for these moves are shaped differently to remind the player to do so. Detectives may take this opportunity to refine their search and, if possible, plan ways to encircle them based on where they are and the next few moves they make. Should one of these five moments occur on the first half of a double move, Mr. X makes the first move, places their pawn on the space visited and allows the detectives to see it, then removes it and makes the second move.\nObjective.\nThe detectives win the game if any of them lands on Mr. X's current location, or if it becomes impossible for Mr. X to move without landing on a detective. Mr. X wins by avoiding capture until all detectives can no longer move because they have either exhausted their ticket supplies or reached positions from which they cannot move because they have no usable tickets.\nEquipment.\nThe game was updated with slightly different rules and equipment in 2013. The 2013 Ravensburger and 1985 Milton Bradley editions vary slightly in the number of transportation tickets, double-move, and starting position cards included, as noted. In the Milton Bradley version, there are 18 starting position cards, shared by both the detectives and Mr. X. In the 2013 edition, the 29 start cards are split into two separate pools, one for Mr. X and another for the detectives.\nIn a game with five or fewer players, up to two of the pawns meant to represent the detectives may instead be designated as \"bobbies\", indicated by placing a circular ring on them. Bobbies can move freely throughout the city without using tickets; during the detectives' turn, they decide by consensus whether and where to move each one.\nAs published by Ravensburger in 2013, it contains:\nThe main game board also varies slightly between the Milton Bradley (1985) and Ravensburger editions. The primary difference between these is in the numbering of the stations: five stations are numbered differently, with 108 missing from the Milton Bradley boards and 200 missing from the Ravensburger boards. Aside from the numbering differences, some of the routes have been revised since the initial publication. For instance, stations 198 and 199 are connected by a bus line in earlier boards, which is changed to a taxi line, and the taxi line between stations 13 and 14 in early boards was later removed.\nAlternative versions.\nThe game has been adapted to take place on maps of different cities. \"Scotland Yard Tokyo\", also distributed by Ravensburger is set on the streets of Tokyo; the major difference is game aesthetics. \"Scotland Yard: Swiss Edition\" uses the same gameplay and is set in Switzerland, with the addition of more boat routes and ski areas available only to Mr. X.\n\"NY Chase\" is a version based on New York City. In this version, detectives do not hand their used tokens over, and they have access to roadblocks and a helicopter, tilting the game more in favour of those playing as detectives.\nA faster travel version called \"Die Jagd Nach Mister X\" exists that functions quite differently. In this version, Mr. X's location is only hidden when a black travel token is used, and the game is essentially an open chase around London. Evasion is accomplished with black tokens and using the fastest travel to distant locations. In this version, each player takes turns as Mr. X, and points collected (in the form of the detectives' used travel tokens) determine the overall winner.\nAlternative rules.\nIn 1986, Alain Munoz and Serge Laget posted an article in the French magazine \"Jeux &amp; Strat\u00e9gie\" suggesting alternative rules to balance and expand the game.\nSpanish company Cefa published https:// in 1986, which is generally a remake of Scotland Yard with minor variations to the rules and a different theme (secret agents chase a nuclear terrorist though the sewers of a futuristic city).\nBeginners.\nRavensburger has published rules designed to introduce new players to the game. In the \"beginners version\", Mr. X starts on space 82, and the detectives start on 41, 46, and/or 124, with 142 added if four detectives are playing. The number of turns is reduced to 13, underground tickets are not used, and Mr. X is limited to one concealed-move ticket and one double-move ticket.\nAdaptations.\nThe game was first adapted for the Game Boy in 1990, and then as \"Scotland Yard Interactive\" for the Philips CD-I in 1993. It was adapted for Windows by Cryo Interactive in 1998, for the Nintendo DS by Sproing Interactive in 2008, as well as for iPhone (2012) and Android (2015) by Ravensburger Digital.\nReception.\n\"Games\" included \"Scotland Yard\" in its top 100 games of 1986, calling it \"a suspenseful chase through the streets of London in this game of deduction and bluff.\" The reviewer noted \"Trapping Mr. X requires logic and teamwork; eluding the detectives takes sneakiness and an occasional risky move by Mr. X.\" A review from \"Lautapeliopas\" praised the game's accessibility and functionality, but said the playing as detectives is less engaging.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n21. https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:AP:9dd9a0bb-2dd5-425a-bf4d-d62a84c99839 (Apex Predator variant)"}

The north-east is taken up by Kensington Gardens, containing the Albert Memorial, the Serpentine Gallery and Speke's monument. South Kensington and Gloucester Road are home to Imperial College London, the Royal College of Music, the Royal Albert Hall, Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Science Museum. The area is also home to many embassies and consulates.\nName.\nThe manor of \"Chenesitone\" is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, which in the Anglo-Saxon language means \"Chenesi's ton\" (homestead/settlement). One early spelling is \"Kesyngton\", as written in 1396.\nHistory.\nThe manor of Kensington, in the county of Middlesex, was one of several hundred granted by King William the Conqueror (1066\u20131089) to Geoffrey de Montbray (or Mowbray), Bishop of Coutances in Normandy, one of his inner circle of advisors and one of the wealthiest men in post-Conquest England. He granted the tenancy of Kensington to his follower Aubrey de Vere I, who was holding the manor from him as overlord in 1086, according to the Domesday Book. The bishop's heir, Robert de Mowbray, rebelled against King William II and his vast feudal barony was forfeited to the Crown. Aubrey de Vere I thus became a tenant-in-chief, holding directly from the king after 1095, which increased his status in feudal England. He granted the church and an estate within the manor to Abingdon Abbey in Oxfordshire, at the deathbed request of his eldest son Geoffrey. As the de Veres became Earls of Oxford, their principal manor at Kensington came to be known as Earl's Court, as they were not resident in the manor, and their manorial business was not conducted in the great hall of a manor house but in a courthouse. In order to differentiate it, the new sub-manor granted to Abingdon Abbey became known as \"Abbot's Kensington\" and the church \"St Mary Abbots\".\nThe original Kensington Barracks, built at Kensington Gate in the late 18th century, were demolished in 1858 and new barracks were built in Kensington Church Street.\nGeography.\nThe focus of the area is Kensington High Street, a busy commercial centre with many shops, typically upmarket. The street was declared London's second best shopping street in February 2005 due to its wide range and number of shops. However, since October 2008 the street has faced competition from the Westfield shopping centre in nearby White City.\nKensington's second group of commercial buildings is at South Kensington, where several streets of small to medium-sized shops and service businesses are situated close to South Kensington tube station. This is also the southern end of Exhibition Road, the thoroughfare which serves the area's museums and educational institutions.\nThe boundaries of Kensington are not well-defined; in particular, the southern part of Kensington has conflicting and complex borders with Chelsea (another ancient manor) whether electoral or postal definitions are used, and has similar architecture. To the west, a border is clearly defined by the line of the Counter Creek marked by the West London railway line. To the north, the only obvious border line is Holland Park Avenue, to the north of which is the district of Notting Hill (another ancient manor), usually classed as within \"North Kensington\".\nIn the north east is situated the large public Royal Park of Kensington Gardens (contiguous with its eastern neighbour, Hyde Park). The other main green area in Kensington is Holland Park, on the north side of the eastern end of Kensington High Street. Many residential roads have small communal garden squares, for the exclusive use of the residents.\nThe sub districts of Kensington: South Kensington and Earl's Court also consist largely of private housing. North Kensington and West Kensington are largely devoid of features to attract the visitor.\nKensington is, in general, an extremely affluent area, a trait that it shares with Chelsea, its neighbour to the south. The area has some of London's most expensive streets and garden squares, and at about the turn of the 21st century the Holland Park neighbourhood became particularly high-status. In early 2007 houses sold in Upper Phillimore Gardens, immediately east of Holland Park, for over \u00a320 million. Brompton is another definable area of Kensington.\nThe Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea forms part of the most densely populated local government district in the United Kingdom. This high density has come about through the subdivision of large mid-rise Georgian and Victorian terraced houses (generally of four to six floors) into flats. The less-affluent northern extremity of Kensington has high-rise residential buildings, while this type of building in the southern part is only represented by the Holiday Inn's London Kensington Forum Hotel in Cromwell Road, a 27-storey building.\nNotable attractions and institutions in Kensington include Kensington Palace in Kensington Gardens, the Royal Albert Hall opposite the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park, the Royal College of Music, the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Heythrop College, Imperial College, the Royal College of Art, and Kensington and Chelsea College. The Olympia Exhibition Hall is just over the western border in West Kensington.\nAdministration.\nKensington is administered within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and lies within the Kensington parliamentary constituency.\nMedia sector.\nThe head office of newspaper group DMGT is located in Northcliffe House off Kensington High Street in part of the large Barkers department store building. In addition to housing the offices for the DMGT newspapers \"Daily Mail\", \"Mail on Sunday\" and \"Metro\", Northcliffe House also accommodates the offices of the newspapers owned by Evgeny Lebedev: \"The Independent\", \"The Independent on Sunday\", and the \"Evening Standard\". The \"i\" newspaper, sold to Johnston Press in 2016, is still produced from offices in Northcliffe House. Most of these titles were for many decades produced and printed in Fleet Street in the City of London.\nThe building also houses Lebedev's TV channel London Live, with its news studio situated in part of the former department store, using St Mary Abbots church and Kensington Church Street as live backdrop.\nTransport.\nKensington is crossed east\u2013west by three main roads, the most important of which is the A4 \"Cromwell Road\" which connects it to Central London on the east and to Hounslow and Heathrow Airport on the west. Parallel to the north is Kensington Road (of which Kensington High Street forms the eastern part), linking central London and Hammersmith and Hounslow to the area. To the south is Fulham Road, which connects South Kensington with Fulham to the south-west. North-south connections are not as well-developed and there is no obvious single north\u2013south route through the area.\nKensington is well served by public transport. Most of Kensington is served by three stations in the London fare zone 1: High Street Kensington, Gloucester Road and South Kensington. All three are served by the Circle line which connects them to London's railway terminals. The District line also serves all three stations, albeit on different branches; it links the latter two to Westminster and the City. The Piccadilly line also links South Kensington and Gloucester Road to the West End in about 10 minutes, and in the other direction to Chiswick, Ealing, Hounslow and Heathrow Airport in around 20\u201340 minutes, depending on the area of choice. In addition Kensington (Olympia) in London fare zone 2 serves the western part of Kensington, with District line trains to Earl's Court and High Street Kensington. Nearby West Kensington station takes its name from the former boundaries with Hammersmith and is not in the Borough.\nA number of local bus services link Kensington into the surrounding districts, and key hubs are Kensington High Street and South Kensington station. These bus services were improved in frequency and spread from 2007 until 2010 when the western extension of the London congestion charge area existed (which required drivers of cars and vans during the charging hours Monday-Friday to pay a daily fee of \u00a38).\nIn 2020 a temporary cycle lane on Kensington High Street caused a nationwide media stir. The temporary cycle lane was installed by the local council in September 2020 with \u00a3700,000 in funding from central government grants, but it was removed in December 2020.\nSports.\nKensington has one football team, Kensington Borough F.C., which currently plays in the Combined Counties Football League.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54737", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54737", "title": "Letter of marque", "text": "Governmental authorization of privateering\nA letter of marque and reprisal was a government license in the Age of Sail that authorized a private person, known as a privateer or corsair, to attack and capture vessels of a foreign state at war with the issuer, licensing international military operations against a specified enemy as reprisal for a previous attack or injury. Captured naval prizes were judged before the government's admiralty court for condemnation and transfer of ownership to the privateer. \nA common practice among Europeans from the late Middle Ages to the 19th century, cruising for enemy prizes with a letter of marque was considered an honorable calling that combined patriotism and profit. Such legally authorized privateering contrasted with unlicensed captures of random ships, known as piracy, which was universally condemned. In practice, the differences between privateers and pirates were sometimes slight, even merely a matter of interpretation.\nThe terms \"letter of marque\" and \"privateer\" were sometimes used to describe the ships which typically operated under the marque-and-reprisal licences. In this context, a letter of marque was a lumbering, square-rigged cargo carrier that might pick up a prize if the opportunity arose in its normal commerce. In contrast, the term privateer generally referred to a fighting vessel, fore-and-aft rigged, fast, and weatherly.\nLetters of marque allowed governments to fight their wars using mercenary private captains and sailors in place of their own navies as a measure to save time and money. Instead of building, funding, and maintaining a navy in times of peace, governments would wait until the start of a war to issue letters of marque to privateers, who financed their own ships in expectation of prize money.\nEtymology and history of nomenclature.\nMarque derives from the Old English \"mearc\", which is from the Germanic *\"mark-\", which means boundary, or boundary marker. This is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*mer\u01f5-\", meaning boundary, or border. The French \"marque\" is from the Proven\u00e7al language \"marca\", which is from \"marcar\", also Proven\u00e7al, meaning to seize as a pledge.\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the first recorded use of \"letters of marque and reprisal\" was in an English statute in 1354 during the reign of King Edward III. The phrase referred to \"a licen[c]e granted by a sovereign to a subject, authorizing him to make reprisals on the subjects of a hostile state for injuries alleged to have been done to him by the enemy's army\".\nEarly history.\nDuring the Middle Ages, armed private vessels enjoying their sovereign's tacit consent, if not always an explicit formal commission, regularly raided shipping of other states, as in the case of the English Sir Francis Drake's attacks on Spanish shipping. Queen Elizabeth I (despite protestations of innocence) took a share of the prizes. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius's 1604 seminal work on international law, \"De Iure Praedae\" (\"Of The Law of Prize and Booty\"), was an advocate's brief defending Dutch raids on Spanish and Portuguese shipping.\nKing Henry III of England first issued what later became known as privateering commissions in 1243. These early licences were granted to specific individuals to seize the King's enemies at sea in return for splitting the proceeds between the privateers and the Crown.\nThe letter of marque and reprisal was documented in 1295, 50 years after wartime privateer licenses were first issued. According to Grotius, letters of marque and reprisal were akin to a \"private war\", a concept alien to modern sensibilities but related to an age when the ocean was lawless and all merchant vessels sailed armed for self-defense. A reprisal involved seeking the sovereign's permission to exact private retribution against some foreign prince or subject. The earliest instance of a licensed reprisal recorded in England was in the year 1295 under the reign of King Edward I. The notion of reprisal, and behind it that just war involved avenging a wrong, was associated with the letter of marque until 1620 in England. To apply for such a letter, a shipowner had to submit to the Admiralty Court an estimate of actual losses incurred.\nLicensing privateers during wartime became widespread in Europe by the 16th century, when most countries began to enact laws regulating the granting of letters of marque and reprisal. Such business could be very profitable; during the eight years of the American Revolutionary War, ships from the tiny island of Guernsey carrying letter of marque captured French and American vessels to the value of \u00a3900,000 (). Privateers from Guernsey continued to operate during the Napoleonic Wars.\nAlthough privateering commissions and letters of marque were originally distinct legal concepts, such distinctions became purely technical by the 18th century. Article I of the United States Constitution, for instance, states that \"The Congress shall have Power To ... grant Letters of marque and reprisal ...\", without separately addressing privateer commissions.\nDuring the American War of Independence, the Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812, it was common to distinguish verbally between privateers (also known as private ships of war) on the one hand, and armed merchantmen, which were referred to as \"letters of marque\", on the other, though both received the same commission. The \"Sir John Sherbrooke\" (Halifax) was a privateer; the \"Sir John Sherbrooke\" (Saint John) was an armed merchantman. The East India Company arranged for letters of marque for its East Indiamen ships, such as the \"Lord Nelson\". They did not need permission to carry cannons to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China but, the letters of marque provided that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the \"Earl of Mornington\", an East India Company packet ship of only six guns, also carried a letter of marque.\nLetters of marque and privateers are largely credited for the age of Elizabethan exploration, because privateers were used to explore the seas. Under the Crown, Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Martin Frobisher sailed the seas as privateers; their expedition reports helped shape the age of Elizabethan exploration.\nIn July 1793, the East Indiamen , \"Triton\", and \"Warley\" participated in the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry by maintaining a blockade of the port. Afterwards, while sailing to China, the same three East Indiamen participated in an action in the Straits of Malacca. They came upon a French frigate, with some six or seven British prizes, with a crew replenishing her water casks ashore. The three British vessels immediately gave chase. The frigate fled towards the Sunda Strait. The Indiamen were able to catch up with a number of the prizes, and, after a few cannon shots, were able to retake them. Had they not carried letters of marque, such behaviour might well have qualified as piracy. Similarly, on 10 November 1800, the East Indiaman \"Phoenix\" captured the French privateer \"General Malartic\", under Jean-Marie Dutertre, an action made legal by a letter of marque. Additionally, vessels with a letter of marque were exempt from having to sail in convoy, and nominally their crew members were exempt, during a voyage, from impressment.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the \"Dart\" and \"Kitty\", British privateers, spent some months off the coast of Sierra Leone hunting slave-trading vessels.\nApplying for, and legal effect of, a letter of marque.\nThe procedure for issuing letters of marque, and the issuing authority, varied by time and circumstance. In colonial British America, for instance, colonial governors issued such letters in the name of the Crown. During the American War of Independence, authorization shifted from individual state legislatures, followed by both the states and the Continental Congress, and lastly, after ratification of the Constitution, only Congress authorized and the President signed letters of marque. A shipowner applied for such a letter of marque by stating the name, description, tonnage, and force (armaments) of the vessel, the name and residence of the owner, and the intended number of crew, and tendered a bond promising strict observance of the country's laws and treaties, and of international laws and customs. The United States granted the commission to the vessel, not to its captain, often for a limited time or specified area, and stated the enemy upon whom attacks were permitted. For example, during the Second Barbary War (1815), President James Madison authorized the brig \"Grand Turk\" (out of Salem, Massachusetts) to cruise against \"Algerine vessels, public or private, goods and effects, of or belonging to the Dey of Algiers\". This particular commission was never put to use, as it was issued July 3, 1815, the same day the treaty was signed, ending the U.S. involvement in the war.\nIn Britain in the 18th century, the High Court of Admiralty issued Letters of Marque. It was customary for the proposed privateer to pay a deposit or bond, possibly \u00a31,500 () as surety for good behaviour. The details of the ship, including tonnage, crew and weapons were recorded. The ownership of these ships was often split into &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20448 shares. Prizes were assessed and valued with profits split in pre-agreed proportions among the government, the owners, and the captain and crew.\nA letter of marque and reprisal in effect converted a private merchant vessel into a naval auxiliary. A commissioned privateer enjoyed the protection and was subject to the obligations of the laws of war. If captured, the crew was entitled to honorable treatment as prisoners of war, while without the licence they were deemed mere pirates \"at war with all the world,\" criminals who were properly hanged.\nFor this reason, enterprising maritime raiders commonly took advantage of \"flag of convenience\" letters of marque, shopping for cooperative governments to license and legitimize their depredations. French/Irishman Captain Luke Ryan and his lieutenants in just over two years commanded six vessels under the flags of three different countries and on opposite sides in the same war. Likewise the notorious Lafitte brothers in New Orleans cruised under letters of marque secured by bribery from corrupt officials of tenuous Central American governments, to cloak plunder with a thin veil of legality.\nAdjudicating captures, invalid letters of marque, or illegal cruelty.\nThe letter of marque by its terms required privateers to bring captured vessels and their cargoes before admiralty courts of their own or allied countries for condemnation. Applying the rules and customs of prize law, the courts decided whether the letter of marque was valid and current, and whether the captured vessel or its cargo in fact belonged to the enemy (not always easy, when flying false flags was common practice), and if so the prize and its cargo were \"condemned\", to be sold at auction with the proceeds divided among the privateer's owner and crew. A prize court's formal condemnation was required to transfer title; otherwise the vessel's previous owners might well reclaim her on her next voyage, and seek damages for the confiscated cargo.\nQuestions sometimes arose as to the legitimacy of a letter of marque, especially in cases of disputed sovereignty during civil wars or rebellions. Following the deposition of James II of England, for instance, the new Privy Council of England did not recognize the letters of marque issued by James while in exile in France, and prosecuted captured sailors operating under them as pirates.\nDuring the American Civil War, Union authorities likewise attempted to prosecute Confederate privateers for the criminal act of piracy. When the Confederate privateer \"Savannah\" was captured in 1861, its crew was put on trial in New York. The Confederate government, however, threatened to execute captured Union soldiers in retaliation if any of the Confederate sailors were convicted and hanged, and the Union eventually agreed to treat Confederate privateers as prisoners of war.\nPrivateers were also required by the terms of their letters of marque to obey the laws of war, honour treaty obligations (avoid attacking neutrals), and in particular to treat captives as courteously and kindly as they safely could. If they failed to live up to their obligations, the admiralty courts could \u2013 and did \u2013 revoke the letter of marque, refuse to award prize money, forfeit bonds, or even award tort (personal injury) damages against the privateer's officers and crew.\nAbolition of privateering.\nStates often agreed by treaty to forgo privateering between them, as England and France repeatedly did starting with the diplomatic overtures of Edward III in 1324; privateering nonetheless recurred in every war between them for the next 500 years.\nBenjamin Franklin had attempted to persuade the French to lead by example and stop issuing letters of marque to their corsairs, but the effort foundered when war loomed with Britain once again. The French Convention did forbid the practice, but it was reinstated after the Thermidorian Reaction, in August 1795; on 26 September 1797, the Ministry of the Navy was authorized to sell small ships to private parties for this purpose.\nFinally, after the Congress of Paris at the end of the Crimean War, seven European states signed the Paris Declaration of 1856 renouncing privateering, and 45 more countries eventually joined them, which in effect abolished privateering worldwide. The United States was among a few countries that were not signatory to that declaration.\nWhen the War of the Pacific started in 1879 Bolivia did not possess any ships, but on March 26, 1879, Bolivian President Hilarion Daza formally offered letters of marque to any ships willing to go to combat for Bolivia. Bolivia had not signed the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law but the United States, Britain and France stood by the treaty and refused to accept the legality of Bolivia's act. Since Bolivia did not have any ports because Chile had occupied them, and because Peru discouraged the use of Letters of Marque, the naval conflict was left to be resolved between Chile and Peru.\n20th century.\nIn December 1941 and the first months of 1942, Goodyear commercial L-class blimp \"Resolute\" operating out of Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, California, flew anti-submarine patrols. As the civilian crew was armed with a rifle, a persistent misconception arose that this made the ship a privateer and that she and sister commercial blimps were operated under letters of marque until the Navy took over operation. Without Congressional authorization, the Navy would not have been able to legally issue any letters of marque.\n21st-century American reconsideration of letters of marque.\nArticle I of the United States Constitution lists issuing letters of marque and reprisal in Section 8 as one of the enumerated powers of Congress, alongside the power to tax and to declare war. However, since the American Civil War, the United States as a matter of policy has consistently followed the terms of the 1856 Paris Declaration forbidding the practice. The United States has not legally commissioned any privateers since 1815, although the status of submarine-hunting Goodyear airships in the early days of World War II created significant confusion. Various accounts refer to airships \"Resolute\" and \"Volunteer\" as operating under a \"privateer status\", but Congress never authorized a commission, nor did the President sign one.\nThe issue of marque and reprisal was raised before Congress after the September 11 attacks and again by Congressman Ron Paul on July 21, 2007. The attacks were defined as acts of \"air piracy\" and the \"Marque and Reprisal Act of 2001\" was introduced, which would have granted the president the authority to use letters of marque and reprisal against the specific terrorists, instead of warring against a foreign state. The terrorists were compared to pirates in that they are difficult to fight by traditional military means. On April 15, 2009, Paul also advocated the use of letters of marque to address the issue of Somali pirates operating in the Gulf of Aden. However, the bills Paul introduced were not enacted into law.\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States Congress considered a bill to \"[authorize] the President to issue letters of marque and reprisal\" in order to seize yachts owned by Russian oligarchs.\nUS Senator Mike Lee and others have suggested consideration be given to the potential use of letters of marque and reprisal in efforts to curtail the presence of Mexican cartels.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments. However, there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation. These views on interpretation differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is deterministic or stochastic, local or non-local, which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered real, and what the nature of measurement is, among other matters.\nWhile some variation of the Copenhagen interpretation is commonly presented in textbooks, many other interpretations have been developed.\nDespite a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached among physicists and philosophers of physics concerning which interpretation best \"represents\" reality.\nHistory.\nThe definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as \"wave function\" and \"matrix mechanics\", progressed through many stages. For instance, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger originally viewed the electron's wave function as its charge density smeared across space, but Max Born reinterpreted the absolute square value of the wave function as the electron's probability density distributed across space; the Born rule, as it is now called, matched experiment, whereas Schr\u00f6dinger's charge density view did not.\nThe views of several early pioneers of quantum mechanics, such as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, are often grouped together as the \"Copenhagen interpretation\", though physicists and historians of physics have argued that this terminology obscures differences between the views so designated. Copenhagen-type ideas were never universally embraced, and challenges to a perceived Copenhagen orthodoxy gained increasing attention in the 1950s with the pilot-wave interpretation of David Bohm and the many-worlds interpretation of Hugh Everett III.\nThe physicist N. David Mermin once quipped, \"New interpretations appear every year. None ever disappear.\" (Mermin also coined the saying \"Shut up and calculate\" to describe many physicists' attitude to quantum theory, a remark which is often misattributed to Richard Feynman.) As a rough guide to development of the mainstream view during the 1990s and 2000s, a \"snapshot\" of opinions was collected in a poll by Schlosshauer et al. at the \"Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality\" conference of July 2011. The authors reference a similarly informal poll carried out by Max Tegmark at the \"Fundamental Problems in Quantum Theory\" conference in August 1997. The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the Copenhagen interpretation still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the many-worlds interpretations: \"The Copenhagen interpretation still reigns supreme here, especially if we lump it together with intellectual offsprings such as information-based interpretations and the quantum Bayesian interpretation. In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\nSome concepts originating from studies of interpretations have found more practical application in quantum information science.\nInfluential interpretations.\nCopenhagen interpretation.\nThe Copenhagen interpretation is a collection of views about the meaning of quantum mechanics principally attributed to Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. It is one of the oldest attitudes towards quantum mechanics, as features of it date to the development of quantum mechanics during 1925\u20131927, and it remains one of the most commonly taught. There is no definitive historical statement of what is \"the\" Copenhagen interpretation, and there were in particular fundamental disagreements between the views of Bohr and Heisenberg. For example, Heisenberg emphasized a sharp \"cut\" between the observer (or the instrument) and the system being observed, while Bohr offered an interpretation that is independent of a subjective observer or measurement or collapse, which relies on an \"irreversible\" or effectively irreversible process that imparts the classical behavior of \"observation\" or \"measurement\".\nFeatures common to Copenhagen-type interpretations include the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic, with probabilities calculated using the Born rule, and the principle of complementarity, which states certain pairs of complementary properties cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously. Moreover, properties only result from the act of \"observing\" or \"measuring\"; the theory avoids assuming definite values from unperformed experiments. Copenhagen-type interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective, in that they are independent of physicists' mental arbitrariness. The statistical interpretation of wavefunctions due to Max Born differs sharply from Schr\u00f6dinger's original intent, which was to have a theory with continuous time evolution and in which wavefunctions directly described physical reality.\nMany worlds.\nThe many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a universal wavefunction obeys the same deterministic, reversible laws at all times; in particular there is no (indeterministic and irreversible) wavefunction collapse associated with measurement. The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by decoherence, which occurs when states interact with the environment. More precisely, the parts of the wavefunction describing observers become increasingly entangled with the parts of the wavefunction describing their experiments. Although all possible outcomes of experiments continue to lie in the wavefunction's support, the times at which they become correlated with observers effectively \"split\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories.\nQuantum information theories.\nQuantum informational approaches have attracted growing support. They subdivide into two kinds.\nThe state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements. ... A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector\u00a0... becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system\u00a0... The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.\nRelational quantum mechanics.\nThe essential idea behind relational quantum mechanics, following the precedent of special relativity, is that different observers may give different accounts of the same series of events: for example, to one observer at a given point in time, a system may be in a single, \"collapsed\" eigenstate, while to another observer at the same time, it may be in a superposition of two or more states. Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s). The state vector of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some \"degrees of freedom\" in the observer, with respect to the observed system. However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above. Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.\nQBism.\nQBism, which originally stood for \"quantum Bayesianism\", is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that takes an agent's actions and experiences as the central concerns of the theory. This interpretation is distinguished by its use of a subjective Bayesian account of probabilities to understand the quantum mechanical Born rule as a normative addition to good decision-making. QBism draws from the fields of quantum information and Bayesian probability and aims to eliminate the interpretational conundrums that have beset quantum theory.\nQBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of wavefunction superposition, quantum measurement, and entanglement. According to QBism, many, but not all, aspects of the quantum formalism are subjective in nature. For example, in this interpretation, a quantum state is not an element of reality\u2014instead it represents the degrees of belief an agent has about the possible outcomes of measurements. For this reason, some philosophers of science have deemed QBism a form of anti-realism. The originators of the interpretation disagree with this characterization, proposing instead that the theory more properly aligns with a kind of realism they call \"participatory realism\", wherein reality consists of \"more\" than can be captured by any putative third-person account of it.\nConsistent histories.\nThe consistent histories interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of quantum cosmology. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be consistent with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\nEnsemble interpretation.\nThe ensemble interpretation, also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system\u00a0\u2013 for example, a single particle\u00a0\u2013 but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. In the words of Einstein:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems.\u2014\u200a\nThe most prominent current advocate of the ensemble interpretation is Leslie E. Ballentine, professor at Simon Fraser University, author of the text book \"Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development\".\nDe Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\nThe de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory of quantum mechanics (also known as the pilot wave theory) is a theory by Louis de Broglie and extended later by David Bohm to include measurements. Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction. The wavefunction evolves according to the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation, and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single spacetime, is non-local, and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual uncertainty principle constraint. The theory is considered to be a hidden-variable theory, and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality. The measurement problem is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times. Collapse is explained as phenomenological.\nTransactional interpretation.\nThe transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by John G. Cramer is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory. It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function). This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.\nConsciousness causes collapse.\nEugene Wigner argued that human experimenter consciousness (or maybe even animal consciousness) was critical for the collapse of the wavefunction, but he later abandoned this interpretation after learning about quantum decoherence.\nSome specific proposals for consciousness caused wave-function collapse have been shown to be unfalsifiable and more broadly reasonable assumption about consciousness lead to the same conclusion.\nQuantum logic.\nQuantum logic can be regarded as a kind of propositional logic suitable for understanding the apparent anomalies regarding quantum measurement, most notably those concerning composition of measurement operations of complementary variables. This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann, who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical Boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.\nModal interpretations of quantum theory.\nModal interpretations of quantum mechanics were first conceived of in 1972 by Bas van Fraassen, in his paper \"A formal approach to the philosophy of science\". Van Fraassen introduced a distinction between a \"dynamical\" state, which describes what might be true about a system and which always evolves according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and a \"value\" state, which indicates what is actually true about a system at a given time. The term \"modal interpretation\" now is used to describe a larger set of models that grew out of this approach. The \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" describes several versions, including proposals by Kochen, Dieks, Clifton, Dickson, and Bub. According to Michel Bitbol, Schr\u00f6dinger's views on how to interpret quantum mechanics progressed through as many as four stages, ending with a non-collapse view that in respects resembles the interpretations of Everett and van Fraassen. Because Schr\u00f6dinger subscribed to a kind of post-Machian neutral monism, in which \"matter\" and \"mind\" are only different aspects or arrangements of the same common elements, treating the wavefunction as ontic and treating it as epistemic became interchangeable.\nTime-symmetric theories.\nTime-symmetric interpretations of quantum mechanics were first suggested by Walter Schottky in 1921. Several theories have been proposed that modify the equations of quantum mechanics to be symmetric with respect to time reversal. (See Wheeler\u2013Feynman time-symmetric theory.) This creates retrocausality: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future. In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of hidden-variables theory), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times. The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement. Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality. The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation.\nOther interpretations.\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed above, a number of other interpretations have been proposed that have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more occult ideas of quantum mysticism.\nRelated concepts.\nSome ideas are discussed in the context of interpreting quantum mechanics but are not necessarily regarded as interpretations themselves.\nQuantum Darwinism.\nQuantum Darwinism is a theory meant to explain the emergence of the classical world from the quantum world as due to a process of Darwinian natural selection induced by the environment interacting with the quantum system; where the many possible quantum states are selected against in favor of a stable pointer state. It was proposed in 2003 by Wojciech Zurek and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout. The development of the theory is due to the integration of a number of Zurek's research topics pursued over the course of twenty-five years including pointer states, einselection and decoherence.\nObjective-collapse theories.\nObjective-collapse theories differ from the Copenhagen interpretation by regarding both the wave function and the process of collapse as ontologically objective (meaning these exist and occur independent of the observer). In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly (\"spontaneous localization\") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role. Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories. Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; quantum mechanics would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension means that objective-collapse theories are alternatives to quantum mechanics rather than interpretations of it. Examples include \nComparisons.\nThe most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.\nNo experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality. Nevertheless, designing experiments that would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.\nMost of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued by many people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe silent approach.\nAlthough interpretational opinions are openly and widely discussed today, that was not always the case. A notable exponent of a tendency of silence was Paul Dirac who once wrote: \"The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been dealt with by many authors, and I do not want to discuss it here. I want to deal with more fundamental things.\" This position is not uncommon among practitioners of quantum mechanics. \nSimilarly Richard Feynman wrote many popularizations of quantum mechanics without ever publishing about interpretation issues like quantum measurement. \nOthers, like Nico van Kampen and Willis Lamb, have openly criticized non-orthodox interpretations of quantum mechanics.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nAlmost all authors below are professional physicists."}

The awards are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The ceremony is usually held in June.\nThe awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.\nThe awards were founded by theatre producer and director Brock Pemberton. They are named after Antoinette \"Tony\" Perry, an actress, producer, theatre director and administrator who was co-founder and secretary of the American Theatre Wing. The trophy consists of a spinnable medallion, with faces portraying an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks, mounted on a black base with a pewter swivel.\nThe rules for the Tony Awards are set forth in the official document \"Rules and Regulations of The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards\", which applies for that season only. The Tony Awards are the New York theatre industry's equivalent to the Emmy Awards for television, the Grammy Awards for music, and the Academy Awards (Oscars) for film. A person who has won all four is said to have won the EGOT. The Tony Awards are the U.S. equivalent of the United Kingdom's Laurence Olivier Awards, France's Moli\u00e8re Awards, Spain's Premios Max, Australia's Helpmann Awards and Russia's Golden Mask.\nAward categories.\nAs of 2014[ [update]], there were 26 categories of awards, in addition to several special awards. Starting with 11 awards in 1947, the names and number of categories have changed over the years. Some examples: the category Best Book of a Musical was originally called \"Best Author (Musical)\". The category of Best Costume Design was one of the original awards. For two years, in 1960 and 1961, this category was split into Best Costume Designer (Dramatic) and Best Costume Designer (Musical). It then went to a single category, but in 2005 it was divided again. For the category of Best Director of a Play, a single category was for directors of plays and musicals prior to 1960.\nA newly established non-competitive award, The Isabelle Stevenson Award, was given for the first time at the awards ceremony in 2009. The award is for an individual who has made a \"substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of one or more humanitarian, social service or charitable organizations.\"\nThe category of Best Special Theatrical Event was retired as of the 2009\u20132010 season. The categories of Best Sound Design of a Play and Best Sound Design of a Musical were retired as of the 2014\u20132015 season. On April 24, 2017, the Tony Awards administration committee announced that the Sound Design Award would be reintroduced for the 2017\u20132018 season.\nPerformance categories.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nShow and technical categories.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSpecial awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRetired awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nThe award was founded in 1947 by a committee of the American Theatre Wing (ATW), headed by Brock Pemberton. The award is named after Antoinette Perry, nicknamed Tony, an actress, director, producer and co-founder of the American Theatre Wing, who died in 1946. As her official biography at the Tony Awards website states, \"At [Warner Bros. story editor] Jacob Wilk's suggestion, [Pemberton] proposed an award in her honor for distinguished stage acting and technical achievement. At the initial event in 1947, as he handed out an award, he called it a Tony. The name stuck.\" Nevertheless, the awards were sometimes referred to as the \"Perry Awards\" in their early years.\nThe 1st Tony Awards was held on April 6, 1947, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City. The first prizes were \"a scroll, cigarette lighter and articles of jewelry such as 14-carat gold compacts and bracelets for the women, and money clips for the men\". ATW co-founder Louise Heims Beck was responsible for overseeing the organization of the first awards. It was not until the third awards ceremony in 1949 that the first Tony medallion was given to award winners.\nSince 1967, the award ceremony has been broadcast on U.S. national television and includes songs from the nominated musicals, and occasionally has included video clips of, or presentations about, nominated plays. The American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League jointly present and administer the awards. Audience size for the telecast is generally well below that of the Academy Awards shows, but the program reaches an affluent audience, which is prized by advertisers. According to a June 2003 article in \"The New York Times\": \"What the Tony broadcast does have, say CBS officials, is an all-important demographic: rich and smart. Jack Sussman, CBS's senior vice president in charge of specials, said the Tony show sold almost all its advertising slots shortly after CBS announced it would present the three hours. 'It draws upscale premium viewers who are attractive to upscale premium advertisers,' Mr. Sussman said...\" \nThe viewership has declined from the early years of its broadcast history. For example, the number of viewers in 1974 was 20\u00a0million; in 1999, it was 9.2\u00a0million. For most of the 2000s, viewership was between six and eight million viewers. In contrast, the 2009 Oscar telecast had 36.3\u00a0million viewers. From 1987 to 2004, the award ceremony was represented by long-time Broadway press agency, Keith Sherman &amp; Associates. Since 2003, all Tony awards ceremonies have ended with the Tony Award for Best Musical.\nMedallion.\nThe Tony Award medallion was designed by art director Herman Rosse and is a mix of mostly brass and a little bronze, with a nickel plating on the outside; a black acrylic glass base, and the nickel-plated pewter swivel. The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks. Originally, the reverse side had a relief profile of Antoinette Perry; this later was changed to contain the winner's name, award category, production and year. The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967.\nA larger base was introduced and first presented in the 2010 award ceremony. That base is slightly taller\u00a0\u2013 , up from \u00a0\u2013 and heavier\u00a0\u2013 , up from . This change was implemented to make the award \"feel more substantial\" and easier to handle at the moment the award is presented to the winners, according to Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theatre Wing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We know the physical scale of the Oscars, Emmys and Grammys. While we're not attempting to keep up with the Joneses, we felt this is a significant award, and it could feel and look a bit more significant... By adding height, now someone can grip the Tony, raise it over their head in triumph and not worry about keeping their grip. Believe me, you can tell the difference.\nFor the specific Tony Awards presented to a Broadway production, awards are given to the author and up to two of the producers free of charge. All other members of the above-the-title producing team are eligible to purchase the physical award. Sums collected are designed to help defray the cost of the Tony Awards ceremony itself. An award cost $400 as of at least 2000, $750 as of at least 2009, and, as of 2013, had been $2,500 \"for several years\", according to Tony Award Productions.\nDetails of the Tony Awards.\n\"Source: Tony Awards Official Site, Rules\"\nRules for a new play or musical.\nFor the purposes of the award, a new play or musical is one that has not previously been produced on Broadway and is not \"determined\u2026 to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire\", as determined by the Administration Committee (per Section (2g) of the Rules and Regulations). The rule about \"classic\" productions was instituted by the Tony Award Administration Committee in 2002, and stated (in summary) \"A play or musical that is determined ... to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire shall not be eligible for an award in the Best Play or Best Musical Category but may be eligible in that appropriate Best Revival category.\" Shows transferred from Off-Broadway or the West End are eligible as \"new\", as are productions based closely on films.\nThis rule has been the subject of some controversy, as some shows, such as \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" and \"Violet\", have been ruled ineligible for the \"new\" category, meaning that their authors did not have a chance to win the important awards of Best Play or Best Musical (or Best Score or Best Book for musicals). On the other hand, some people feel that allowing plays and musicals that have been frequently produced to be eligible as \"new\" gives them an unfair advantage because they will have benefited from additional development time as well as additional familiarity with the Tony voters.\nCommittees and voters.\nThe Tony Awards Administration Committee has twenty-four members: ten designated by the American Theatre Wing, ten by The Broadway League, and one each by the Dramatists Guild, Actors' Equity Association, United Scenic Artists and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. This committee, among other duties, determines eligibility for nominations in all awards categories.\nThe Tony Awards Nominating Committee makes the nominations for the various categories. This rotating group of theatre professionals is selected by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. Nominators serve three-year terms and are asked to see every new Broadway production. The Nominating Committee for the 2012\u201313 Broadway season (named in June 2012) had 42 members; the Nominating Committee for the 2014\u20132015 season has 50 members and was appointed in June 2014.\nThere are approximately 868 eligible Tony Award voters (as of 2014), a number that changes slightly from year to year. The number was decreased in 2009 when the first-night critics were excluded as voters. That decision was changed, and members of the New York Drama Critics' Circle were invited to be Tony voters beginning in the 2010\u20132011 season.\nThe eligible Tony voters include the board of directors and designated members of the advisory committee of the American Theatre Wing, members of the governing boards of Actors' Equity Association, the Dramatists Guild, the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, United Scenic Artists, and the Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers, members of the Theatrical Council of the Casting Society of America and voting members of The Broadway League (in 2000, what was then The League of American Theaters and Producers changed membership eligibility and Tony voting status from a lifetime honor to all above-the-title producers, to ones who had been active in the previous 10 years. This action disenfranchised scores of Tony voters, including Gail Berman, Harve Brosten, Dick Button, Tony Lo Bianco, and Raymond Serra).\nEligibility date (Season).\nTo be eligible for Tony Award consideration, a production must have officially opened on Broadway by the eligibility date that the Management Committee establishes each year. For example, the cut-off date for eligibility the 2013\u20132014 season was April 24, 2014. The season for Tony Award eligibility is defined in the Rules and Regulations.\nIn 2020, the 74th Annual Tony Awards were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 21, 2020, it was announced that the 74th Annual Tony Awards would take place digitally later in 2020.\nBroadway theatre.\nA Broadway theatre is defined as having 500 or more seats, among other requirements. While the rules define a Broadway theatre in terms of its size, not its geographical location, the list of Broadway theatres is determined solely by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. As of the 2016\u20132017 season, the list consisted solely of 41 theaters: 40 located in the vicinity of Times Square in New York City and Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater.\nCriticism.\nWhile the theatre-going public may consider the Tony Awards to be the Oscars of live theatre, critics have suggested that the Tony Awards are primarily a promotional vehicle for a small number of large production companies and theatre owners in New York City. In a 2014 \"Playbill\" article, Robert Simonson wrote that \"Who gets to perform on the Tony Awards broadcast, what they get to perform, and for how long, have long been politically charged questions in the Broadway theatre community...\" The producers \"accept the situation ... because just as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big box-office sales.\" Producer Robyn Goodman noted that, if the presentation at the ceremony shows well and the show wins a Tony, \"you're going to spike at the box office\".\nThe awards met further criticism when they eliminated the sound design awards in 2014. In 2014, a petition calling for the return of the Sound Design categories received more than 30,000 signatures. Addressing their previous concerns over Tony voters in the category, it was announced that upon the awards' return for the 2017\u20132018 season, they would be decided by a subset of voters based on their expertise.\nSome advocates of gender equality and non-binary people have criticized the separation of male and female acting categories in the Tony Awards, Academy Awards, and Emmy Awards. Though some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories, other categories are unsegregated. The Grammy Awards went gender-neutral in 2012, while the Daytime Emmy Awards introduced a single Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series category in 2019 to replace their two gender-specific younger actor and actress categories. In 2023, J. Harrison Ghee and Alex Newell became the first openly nonbinary actors to be nominated for Tony Awards, and both would go on to win in their respective categories. The same year, fellow nonbinary performer Justin David Sullivan withdrew from Tony consideration due to the gendered categories.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By analogy, the term is used in human reproduction, but more commonly refers to the genetic disorders and other consequences that may arise from expression of deleterious recessive traits resulting from incestuous sexual relationships and consanguinity. \nInbreeding results in homozygosity which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by recessive traits. In extreme cases, this usually leads to at least temporarily decreased biological fitness of a population (called inbreeding depression), which is its ability to survive and reproduce. An individual who inherits such deleterious traits is colloquially referred to as \"inbred\". The avoidance of expression of such deleterious recessive alleles caused by inbreeding, via inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, is the main selective reason for outcrossing. Crossbreeding between populations sometimes has positive effects on fitness-related traits, but also sometimes leads to negative effects known as outbreeding depression. However, increased homozygosity increases the probability of fixing beneficial alleles and also slightly decreases the probability of fixing deleterious alleles in a population. Inbreeding can result in purging of deleterious alleles from a population through purifying selection.\nInbreeding is a technique used in selective breeding. For example, in livestock breeding, breeders may use inbreeding when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock and for producing distinct families within a breed, but will need to watch for undesirable characteristics in offspring, which can then be eliminated through further selective breeding or culling. Inbreeding also helps to ascertain the type of gene action affecting a trait. Inbreeding is also used to reveal deleterious recessive alleles, which can then be eliminated through assortative breeding or through culling. In plant breeding, inbred lines are used as stocks for the creation of hybrid lines to make use of the effects of heterosis. Inbreeding in plants also occurs naturally in the form of self-pollination.\nInbreeding can significantly influence gene expression which can prevent inbreeding depression.\nOverview.\nOffspring of biologically related persons are subject to the possible effects of inbreeding, such as congenital birth defects. The chances of such disorders are increased when the biological parents are more closely related. This is because such pairings have a 25% probability of producing homozygous zygotes, resulting in offspring with two recessive alleles, which can produce disorders when these alleles are deleterious. Because most recessive alleles are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated partners will both be carriers of the same deleterious allele; however, because close relatives share a large fraction of their alleles, the probability that any such deleterious allele is inherited from the common ancestor through both parents is increased dramatically. For each homozygous recessive individual formed there is an equal chance of producing a homozygous dominant individual \u2014 one completely devoid of the harmful allele. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes; however, because the increased proportion of deleterious homozygotes exposes the allele to natural selection, in the long run its frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred populations. In the short term, incestuous reproduction is expected to increase the number of spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects. The advantages of inbreeding may be the result of a tendency to preserve the structures of alleles interacting at different loci that have been adapted together by a common selective history.\nMalformations or harmful traits can stay within a population due to a high homozygosity rate, and this will cause a population to become fixed for certain traits, like having too many bones in an area, like the vertebral column of wolves on Isle Royale or having cranial abnormalities, such as in Northern elephant seals, where their cranial bone length in the lower mandibular tooth row has changed. Having a high homozygosity rate is problematic for a population because it will unmask recessive deleterious alleles generated by mutations, reduce heterozygote advantage, and it is detrimental to the survival of small, endangered animal populations. When deleterious recessive alleles are unmasked due to the increased homozygosity generated by inbreeding, this can cause inbreeding depression.\nThere may also be other deleterious effects besides those caused by recessive diseases. Thus, similar immune systems may be more vulnerable to infectious diseases (see Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection).\nInbreeding history of the population should also be considered when discussing the variation in the severity of inbreeding depression between and within species. With persistent inbreeding, there is evidence that shows that inbreeding depression becomes less severe. This is associated with the unmasking and elimination of severely deleterious recessive alleles. However, inbreeding depression is not a temporary phenomenon because this elimination of deleterious recessive alleles will never be complete. Eliminating slightly deleterious mutations through inbreeding under moderate selection is not as effective. Fixation of alleles most likely occurs through Muller's ratchet, when an asexual population's genome accumulates deleterious mutations that are irreversible.\nDespite all its disadvantages, inbreeding can also have a variety of advantages, such as ensuring a child produced from the mating contains, and will pass on, a higher percentage of its mother/father's genetics, reducing the recombination load, and allowing the expression of recessive advantageous phenotypes. Some species with a Haplodiploidy mating system depend on the ability to produce sons to mate with as a means of ensuring a mate can be found if no other male is available. It has been proposed that under circumstances when the advantages of inbreeding outweigh the disadvantages, preferential breeding within small groups could be promoted, potentially leading to speciation.\nGenetic disorders.\nAutosomal recessive disorders occur in individuals who have two copies of an allele for a particular recessive genetic mutation. Except in certain rare circumstances, such as new mutations or uniparental disomy, both parents of an individual with such a disorder will be carriers of the gene. These carriers do not display any signs of the mutation and may be unaware that they carry the mutated gene. Since relatives share a higher proportion of their genes than do unrelated people, it is more likely that related parents will both be carriers of the same recessive allele, and therefore their children are at a higher risk of inheriting an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The extent to which the risk increases depends on the degree of genetic relationship between the parents; the risk is greater when the parents are close relatives and lower for relationships between more distant relatives, such as second cousins, though still greater than for the general population.\nChildren of parent-child or sibling-sibling unions are at an increased risk compared to cousin-cousin unions. Inbreeding may result in a greater than expected phenotypic expression of deleterious recessive alleles within a population. As a result, first-generation inbred individuals are more likely to show physical and health defects, including:\nThe isolation of a small population for a period of time can lead to inbreeding within that population, resulting in increased genetic relatedness between breeding individuals. Inbreeding depression can also occur in a large population if individuals tend to mate with their relatives, instead of mating randomly.\nDue to higher prenatal and postnatal mortality rates, some individuals in the first generation of inbreeding will not live on to reproduce. Over time, with isolation, such as a population bottleneck caused by purposeful (assortative) breeding or natural environmental factors, the deleterious inherited traits are culled.\nIsland species are often very inbred, as their isolation from the larger group on a mainland allows natural selection to work on their population. This type of isolation may result in the formation of race or even speciation, as the inbreeding first removes many deleterious genes, and permits the expression of genes that allow a population to adapt to an ecosystem. As the adaptation becomes more pronounced, the new species or race radiates from its entrance into the new space, or dies out if it cannot adapt and, most importantly, reproduce.\nThe reduced genetic diversity, for example due to a bottleneck will unavoidably increase inbreeding for the entire population. This may mean that a species may not be able to adapt to changes in environmental conditions. Each individual will have similar immune systems, as immune systems are genetically based. When a species becomes endangered, the population may fall below a minimum whereby the forced interbreeding between the remaining animals will result in extinction.\nNatural breedings include inbreeding by necessity, and most animals only migrate when necessary. In many cases, the closest available mate is a mother, sister, grandmother, father, brother, or grandfather. In all cases, the environment presents stresses to remove from the population those individuals who cannot survive because of illness.\nThere was an assumption that wild populations do not inbreed; this is not what is observed in some cases in the wild. However, in species such as horses, animals in wild or feral conditions often drive off the young of both sexes, thought to be a mechanism by which the species instinctively avoids some of the genetic consequences of inbreeding. In general, many mammal species, including humanity's closest primate relatives, avoid close inbreeding possibly due to the deleterious effects.\nExamples.\nAlthough there are several examples of inbred populations of wild animals, the negative consequences of this inbreeding are poorly documented. In the South American sea lion, there was concern that recent population crashes would reduce genetic diversity. Historical analysis indicated that a population expansion from just two matrilineal lines was responsible for most of the individuals within the population. Even so, the diversity within the lines allowed great variation in the gene pool that may help to protect the South American sea lion from extinction.\nIn lions, prides are often followed by related males in bachelor groups. When the dominant male is killed or driven off by one of these bachelors, a father may be replaced by his son. There is no mechanism for preventing inbreeding or to ensure outcrossing. In the prides, most lionesses are related to one another. If there is more than one dominant male, the group of alpha males are usually related. Two lines are then being \"line bred\". Also, in some populations, such as the Crater lions, it is known that a population bottleneck has occurred. Researchers found far greater genetic heterozygosity than expected. In fact, predators are known for low genetic variance, along with most of the top portion of the trophic levels of an ecosystem. Additionally, the alpha males of two neighboring prides can be from the same litter; one brother may come to acquire leadership over another's pride, and subsequently mate with his 'nieces' or cousins. However, killing another male's cubs, upon the takeover, allows the new selected gene complement of the incoming alpha male to prevail over the previous male. There are genetic assays being scheduled for lions to determine their genetic diversity. The preliminary studies show results inconsistent with the outcrossing paradigm based on individual environments of the studied groups.\nIn Central California, sea otters were thought to have been driven to extinction due to over hunting, until a small colony was discovered in the Point Sur region in the 1930s. Since then, the population has grown and spread along the central Californian coast to around 2,000 individuals, a level that has remained stable for over a decade. Population growth is limited by the fact that all Californian sea otters are descended from the isolated colony, resulting in inbreeding.\nCheetahs are another example of inbreeding. Thousands of years ago, the cheetah went through a population bottleneck that reduced its population dramatically so the animals that are alive today are all related to one another. A consequence from inbreeding for this species has been high juvenile mortality, low fecundity, and poor breeding success.\nIn a study on an island population of song sparrows, individuals that were inbred showed significantly lower survival rates than outbred individuals during a severe winter weather related population crash. These studies show that inbreeding depression and ecological factors have an influence on survival.\nThe Florida panther population was reduced to about 30 animals, so inbreeding became a problem. Several females were imported from Texas and now the population is better off genetically.\nMeasures.\nA measure of inbreeding of an individual A is the probability \"F\"(A) that both alleles in one locus are derived from the same allele in an ancestor. These two identical alleles that are both derived from a common ancestor are said to be identical by descent. This probability F(A) is called the \"coefficient of inbreeding\".\nAnother useful measure that describes the extent to which two individuals are related (say individuals A and B) is their coancestry coefficient f(A,B), which gives the probability that one randomly selected allele from A and another randomly selected allele from B are identical by descent. This is also denoted as the kinship coefficient between A and B.\nA particular case is the self-coancestry of individual A with itself, f(A,A), which is the probability that taking one random allele from A and then, independently and with replacement, another random allele also from A, both are identical by descent. Since they can be identical by descent by sampling the same allele or by sampling both alleles that happen to be identical by descent, we have f(A,A) = 1/2 + F(A)/2.\nBoth the inbreeding and the coancestry coefficients can be defined for specific individuals or as average population values. They can be computed from genealogies or estimated from the population size and its breeding properties, but all methods assume no selection and are limited to neutral alleles.\nThere are several methods to compute this percentage. The two main ways are the path method and the tabular method.\nTypical coancestries between relatives are as follows:\nAnimals.\nDomestic animals.\nBreeding in domestic animals is primarily assortative breeding (see selective breeding). Without the sorting of individuals by trait, a breed could not be established, nor could poor genetic material be removed.\nHomozygosity is the case where similar or identical alleles combine to express a trait that is not otherwise expressed (recessiveness). Inbreeding exposes recessive alleles through increasing homozygosity.\nBreeders must avoid breeding from individuals that demonstrate either homozygosity or heterozygosity for disease causing alleles. The goal of preventing the transfer of deleterious alleles may be achieved by reproductive isolation, sterilization, or, in the extreme case, culling. Culling is not strictly necessary if genetics are the only issue in hand. Small animals such as cats and dogs may be sterilized, but in the case of large agricultural animals, such as cattle, culling is usually the only economic option.\nThe issue of casual breeders who inbreed irresponsibly is discussed in the following quotation on cattle:\nMeanwhile, milk production per cow per lactation increased from 17,444\u00a0lbs to 25,013\u00a0lbs from 1978 to 1998 for the Holstein breed. Mean breeding values for milk of Holstein cows increased by 4,829\u00a0lbs during this period. High producing cows are increasingly difficult to breed and are subject to higher health costs than cows of lower genetic merit for production (Cassell, 2001).\nIntensive selection for higher yield has increased relationships among animals within breed and increased the rate of casual inbreeding.\nMany of the traits that affect profitability in crosses of modern dairy breeds have not been studied in designed experiments. Indeed, all crossbreeding research involving North American breeds and strains is very dated (McAllister, 2001) if it exists at all.\nAs a result of long-term cooperation between USDA and dairy farmers which led to a revolution in dairy cattle productivity, the United States has since 1992 been the world's largest supplier of dairy bull semen. However, US genomic technology has resulted in the US dairy cattle population becoming \"the most inbred it's ever been\" and the rate of increase in US national milk yield has tapered off. Efforts are now being made to identify desirable genes in cattle breeds not yet optimized by US dairy breeders in order to apply hybrid vigor to the US dairy cattle population and thus propel US dairy technology to even higher levels of productivity.\nThe BBC produced two documentaries on dog inbreeding titled \"Pedigree Dogs Exposed\" and \"\" that document the negative health consequences of excessive inbreeding.\nLinebreeding.\nLinebreeding is a form of inbreeding. There is no clear distinction between the two terms, but linebreeding may encompass crosses between individuals and their descendants or two cousins. This method can be used to increase a particular animal's contribution to the population. While linebreeding is less likely to cause problems in the first generation than does inbreeding, over time, linebreeding can reduce the genetic diversity of a population and cause problems related to a too-small gene pool that may include an increased prevalence of genetic disorders and inbreeding depression.\nOutcrossing.\nOutcrossing is where two unrelated individuals are crossed to produce progeny. In outcrossing, unless there is verifiable genetic information, one may find that all individuals are distantly related to an ancient progenitor. If the trait carries throughout a population, all individuals can have this trait. This is called the founder effect. In the well established breeds, that are commonly bred, a large gene pool is present. For example, in 2004, over 18,000 Persian cats were registered. A possibility exists for a complete outcross, if no barriers exist between the individuals to breed. However, it is not always the case, and a form of distant linebreeding occurs. Again it is up to the assortative breeder to know what sort of traits, both positive and negative, exist within the diversity of one breeding. This diversity of genetic expression, within even close relatives, increases the variability and diversity of viable stock.\nLaboratory animals.\nSystematic inbreeding and maintenance of inbred strains of laboratory mice and rats is of great importance for biomedical research. The inbreeding guarantees a consistent and uniform animal model for experimental purposes and enables genetic studies in congenic and knock-out animals. In order to achieve a mouse strain that is considered inbred, a minimum of 20 sequential generations of sibling matings must occur. With each successive generation of breeding, homozygosity in the entire genome increases, eliminating heterozygous loci. With 20 generations of sibling matings, homozygosity is occurring at roughly 98.7% of all loci in the genome, allowing for these offspring to serve as animal models for genetic studies. The use of inbred strains is also important for genetic studies in animal models, for example to distinguish genetic from environmental effects. The mice that are inbred typically show considerably lower survival rates.\nHumans.\nEffects.\nInbreeding increases homozygosity, which can increase the chances of the expression of deleterious or beneficial recessive alleles and therefore has the potential to either decrease or increase the fitness of the offspring. Depending on the rate of inbreeding, natural selection may still be able to eliminate deleterious alleles. With continuous inbreeding, genetic variation is lost and homozygosity is increased, enabling the expression of recessive deleterious alleles in homozygotes. The coefficient of inbreeding, or the degree of inbreeding in an individual, is an estimate of the percent of homozygous alleles in the overall genome. The more biologically related the parents are, the greater the coefficient of inbreeding, since their genomes have many similarities already. This overall homozygosity becomes an issue when there are deleterious recessive alleles in the gene pool of the family. By pairing chromosomes of similar genomes, the chance for these recessive alleles to pair and become homozygous greatly increases, leading to offspring with autosomal recessive disorders. However, these deleterious effects are common for very close relatives but not for those related on the 3rd cousin or greater level, who exhibit increased fitness.\nInbreeding is especially problematic in small populations where the genetic variation is already limited. By inbreeding, individuals are further decreasing genetic variation by increasing homozygosity in the genomes of their offspring. Thus, the likelihood of deleterious recessive alleles to pair is significantly higher in a small inbreeding population than in a larger inbreeding population.\nThe fitness consequences of consanguineous mating have been studied since their scientific recognition by Charles Darwin in 1839. Some of the most harmful effects known from such breeding includes its effects on the mortality rate as well as on the general health of the offspring. Since the 1960s, there have been many studies to support such debilitating effects on the human organism. Specifically, inbreeding has been found to decrease fertility as a direct result of increasing homozygosity of deleterious recessive alleles. Fetuses produced by inbreeding also face a greater risk of spontaneous abortions due to inherent complications in development. Among mothers who experience stillbirths and early infant deaths, those that are inbreeding have a significantly higher chance of reaching repeated results with future offspring. Additionally, consanguineous parents possess a high risk of premature birth and producing underweight and undersized infants. Viable inbred offspring are also likely to be inflicted with physical deformities and genetically inherited diseases. Studies have confirmed an increase in several genetic disorders due to inbreeding such as blindness, hearing loss, neonatal diabetes, limb malformations, disorders of sex development, schizophrenia and several others. Moreover, there is an increased risk for congenital heart disease depending on the inbreeding coefficient (See coefficient of inbreeding) of the offspring, with significant risk accompanied by an F =.125 or higher.\nPrevalence.\nThe general negative outlook and eschewal of inbreeding that is prevalent in the Western world today has roots from over 2000 years ago. Specifically, written documents such as the Bible illustrate that there have been laws and social customs that have called for the abstention from inbreeding. Along with cultural taboos, parental education and awareness of inbreeding consequences have played large roles in minimizing inbreeding frequencies in areas like Europe. That being so, there are less urbanized and less populated regions across the world that have shown continuity in the practice of inbreeding.\nThe continuity of inbreeding is often either by choice or unavoidably due to the limitations of the geographical area. When by choice, the rate of consanguinity is highly dependent on religion and culture. In the Western world, some Anabaptist groups are highly inbred because they originate from small founder populations that have bred as a closed population.\nOf the practicing regions, Middle Eastern and northern African nations show the greatest frequencies of consanguinity.\nAmong these populations with high levels of inbreeding, researchers have found several disorders prevalent among inbred offspring. In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel, the offspring of consanguineous relationships have an increased risk of congenital malformations, congenital heart defects, congenital hydrocephalus and neural tube defects. Furthermore, among inbred children in Palestine and Lebanon, there is a positive association between consanguinity and reported cleft lip/palate cases. Historically, populations of Qatar have engaged in consanguineous relationships of all kinds, leading to high risk of inheriting genetic diseases. As of 2014, around 5% of the Qatari population suffered from hereditary hearing loss; most were descendants of a consanguineous relationship. In 2017-2019, congenital anomalies due to inbreeding was the most common cause of death of babies belonging to the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups in England and Wales.\nRoyalty and nobility.\nInter-nobility marriage was used as a method of forming political alliances among elites. These ties were often sealed only upon the birth of progeny within the arranged marriage. Thus marriage was seen as a union of lines of nobility and not as a contract between individuals.\nRoyal intermarriage was often practiced among European royal families, usually for interests of state. Over time, due to the relatively limited number of potential consorts, the gene pool of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines of descent, such as the numerous European royalty and nobility descended from the British Queen Victoria or King Christian IX of Denmark. The House of Habsburg was known for its intermarriages; the Habsburg lip often cited as an ill-effect. The closely related houses of Habsburg, Bourbon, Braganza and Wittelsbach also frequently engaged in first-cousin unions as well as the occasional double-cousin and uncle\u2013niece marriages.\nIn ancient Egypt, royal women were believed to carry the bloodlines and so it was advantageous for a pharaoh to marry his sister or half-sister; in such cases a special combination between endogamy and polygamy is found. Normally, the old ruler's eldest son and daughter (who could be either siblings or half-siblings) became the new rulers. All rulers of the Ptolemaic dynasty uninterruptedly from Ptolemy IV (Ptolemy II married his sister but had no issue) were married to their brothers and sisters, so as to keep the Ptolemaic blood \"pure\" and to strengthen the line of succession. King Tutankhamun's mother is reported to have been the half-sister to his father, Cleopatra VII (also called Cleopatra VI) and Ptolemy XIII, who married and became co-rulers of ancient Egypt following their father's death, are the most widely known example.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

All known human cultures have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible sexual or marriage partners, making such relationships taboo. However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not. Sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called incestuous relationships.\nSome cultures proscribe sexual relations between clan-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. In many cultures, certain types of cousin relations are preferred as sexual and marital partners, whereas in others these are taboo. Some cultures permit sexual and marital relations between aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces. In some instances, brother\u2013sister marriages have been practised by the elites with some regularity. Parent\u2013child and sibling\u2013sibling unions are almost universally taboo.\nOrigin.\nDebate about the origin of the incest taboo has often been framed as a question of whether it is based in nature or nurture.\nOne explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since inbreeding may have detrimental outcomes. The most widely held hypothesis proposes that the so-called Westermarck effect discourages adults from engaging in sexual relations with individuals with whom they grew up. The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support.\nAnother school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group exogamy, which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable alliances that improve the ability for both groups to thrive. According to this view, the incest taboo is not necessarily universal, but is likely to arise and become more strict under cultural circumstances that favour exogamy over endogamy, and likely to become more lax under circumstances that favor endogamy. This hypothesis has also achieved some empirical support.\nLimits to biological evolution of taboo.\nWhile it is theoretically possible that natural selection may, under certain genetic circumstances, select for individuals that instinctively avoid mating with (close) relatives, incest will still exist in the gene pool because even genetically weakened, inbred individuals are better watchposts against predators than none at all, and weak individuals are useful for the stronger individuals in the group as looking out for predators without being able to seriously compete with the stronger individuals. Additionally, protecting the health of closer relatives and their inbred offspring is more evolutionarily advantageous than punishing said relative, especially in a context where predation and starvation are significant factors, as opposed to a rich welfare state.\nResearch.\nModern anthropology developed at a time when a great many human societies were illiterate, and much of the research on incest taboos has taken place in societies without legal codes, and, therefore, without written laws concerning marriage and incest. Nevertheless, anthropologists have found that the institution of marriage, and rules concerning appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, exist in every society. The following excerpt from \"Notes and Queries on Anthropology\" (1951), a well-established field manual for ethnographic research, illustrates the scope of ethnographic investigation into the matter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Incest is sexual intercourse between individuals related in certain prohibited degrees of kinship.\" In every society there are rules prohibiting incestuous unions, both as to sexual intercourse and recognized marriage. The two prohibitions do not necessarily coincide. There is no uniformity as to which degrees are involved in the prohibitions. The rules regulating incest must be investigated in every society by means of the genealogical method. The prohibition may be so narrow as to include only one type of parent\u2013child relationship (though this is very rare), or those within the elementary family; or so wide as to include all with whom genealogical or classificatory kinship can be traced. The more usual practice is that unions with certain relatives only are considered incestuous, the relationships being regulated by the type of descent emphasized. In some societies unions with certain persons related by affinity are also considered incestuous.\nWhat penalties fall on (a) the individuals concerned; (b) the community as a whole? Are such penalties enforced by authority, or are they believed to ensue automatically by the action of a supernatural force? Is there any correlation between the severity of the penalty and the nearness of the blood-tie of the partners in guilt? Should children be born as the result of incestuous unions, how are they treated? Are there any methods, ritual or legal, by which persons who fall within the prohibited degrees and wish to marry can break the relationship and become free to marry?\nThese theories anthropologists are generally concerned solely with brother\u2013sister incest, and are not claiming that all sexual relations among family members are taboo or even necessarily considered incestuous by that society. These theories are further complicated by the fact that in many societies people related to one another in different ways, and sometimes distantly, are classified together as siblings, and others who are just as closely related genetically are not considered family members.\nThe definition restricts itself to sexual intercourse; this does not mean that other forms of sexual contact do not occur, or are proscribed, or prescribed. For example, in some Inuit societies in the Arctic, and traditionally in Bali, mothers would routinely stroke the penises of their infant sons; such behavior was considered no more sexual than breastfeeding.\nIn these theories, anthropologists are primarily concerned with marriage rules and not actual sexual behavior. In short, anthropologists were not studying \"incest\" per se; they were asking informants what they meant by \"incest\", and what the consequences of \"incest\" were, in order to map out social relationships within the community.\nThis excerpt also suggests that the relationship between sexual and marriage practices is complex, and that societies distinguish between different sorts of prohibitions. In other words, although an individual may be prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with many people, different sexual relations may be prohibited for different reasons, and with different penalties.\nFor example, Trobriand Islanders prohibit both sexual relations between a woman and her brother, and between a woman and her father, but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations between a woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations among members of the same clan; relations between a woman and her father do not. This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations between a man and his mother's sister (and mother's sister's daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations between a man and his father's sister are not. A man and his father's sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father's sister or the daughter of his father's sister to have sexual relations or marry.\nInstinctual and genetic explanations.\nAn explanation for the taboo is that it is due to an instinctual, inborn aversion that would lower the adverse genetic effects of inbreeding such as a higher incidence of congenital birth defects. Since the rise of modern genetics, belief in this theory has grown.&lt;ref name=\"doi10.1038/ng1094-117\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nBirth defects and inbreeding.\nThe increase in frequency of birth defects often attributed to inbreeding results directly from an increase in the frequency of homozygous alleles inherited by the offspring of inbred couples. This leads to an increase in homozygous allele frequency within a population, and results in diverging effects. Should a child inherit the version of homozygous alleles responsible for a birth defect from its parents, the birth defect will be expressed; on the other hand, should the child inherit the version of homozygous alleles not responsible for a birth defect, it would actually decrease the ratio of the allele version responsible for the birth defect in that population. The overall consequences of these diverging effects depends in part on the size of the population.\nIn small populations, as long as children born with inheritable birth defects die (or are killed) before they reproduce, the ultimate effect of inbreeding will be to \"decrease\" the frequency of defective genes in the population; over time, the gene pool will be healthier. However, in larger populations, it is more likely that large numbers of carriers will survive and mate, leading to more constant rates of birth defects. Besides recessive genes, there are also other reasons why inbreeding may be harmful, such as a narrow range of certain immune systems genes in a population increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases (see Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection). The biological costs of incest also depend largely on the degree of genetic proximity between the two relatives engaging in incest. This fact may explain why the cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions against sex between close relatives but less often includes prohibitions against sex between more distal relatives. Children born of close relatives have decreased survival. Many mammal species, including humanity's closest primate relatives, avoid incest.\nWestermarck effect.\nThe Westermarck effect, first proposed by Edvard Westermarck in 1891, is the theory that children reared together, regardless of biological relationship, form a sentimental attachment that is by its nature non-erotic. Melford Spiro argued that his observations that unrelated children reared together on Israeli Kibbutzim nevertheless avoided one another as sexual partners confirmed the Westermarck effect. Joseph Shepher in a study examined the second generation in a kibbutz and found no marriages and no sexual activity between the adolescents in the same peer group. This was not enforced but voluntary. Looking at the second generation adults in all kibbutzim, out of a total of 2769 marriages, none were between those of the same peer group.\nHowever, according to a book review by John Hartung of a book by Shepher, out of 2516 marriages documented in Israel, 200 were between couples reared in the same kibbutz. These marriages occurred after young adults reared on kibbutzim had served in the military and encountered tens of thousands of other potential mates, and 200 marriages is higher than what would be expected by chance. Of these 200 marriages, five were between men and women who had been reared together for the first six years of their lives.\nA study in Taiwan of marriages where the future bride is adopted in the groom's family as an infant or small child found that these marriages have higher infidelity and divorce and lower fertility than ordinary marriages; it has been argued that this observation is consistent with the Westermarck effect.\nThird-parties' objections.\nAnother approach is looking at moral objections to third-party incest. This increases the longer a child has grown up together with another child of the opposite sex. This occurs even if the other child is genetically unrelated. Humans have been argued to have a special kin detection system that besides the incest taboo also regulates a tendency towards altruism towards kin.\nCounter arguments.\nOne objection against an instinctive and genetic basis for the incest taboo is that incest does occur. Anthropologists have also argued that the social construct \"incest\" (and the incest taboo) is not the same thing as the biological phenomenon of \"inbreeding\". For example, there is equal genetic relation between a man and the daughter of his father's sister and between a man and the daughter of his mother's sister, such that biologists would consider mating incestuous in both instances, but Trobrianders consider mating incestuous in one case and not in the other. Anthropologists have documented a great number of societies where marriages between some first cousins are prohibited as incestuous, while marriages between other first cousins are encouraged. Therefore, it is argued that the prohibition against incestuous relations in most societies is not based on or motivated by concerns over biological closeness. Other studies on cousin marriages have found support for a biological basis for the taboo. Also, current supporters of genetic influences on behavior do not argue that genes determine behavior absolutely, but that genes may create predispositions that are affected in various ways by the environment (including culture).\nSteve Stewart-Williams argues against the view that incest taboo is a Western phenomenon, arguing that while brother\u2013sister marriage was reported in a diverse range of cultures such Egyptian, Incan, and Hawaiian cultures, it was not a culture-wide phenomenon, being largely restricted to the upper classes. Stewart-Williams argues that these marriages were largely political (their function being to keep power and wealth concentrated in the family) and there is no evidence the siblings were attracted to each other and there is in fact some evidence against it (for example, Cleopatra married two of her brothers but did not have children with them, only having children with unrelated lovers). Stewart-Williams suggests that this was therefore simply a case of social pressure overriding anti-incest instincts. Stewart-Williams also observes that anti-incest behaviour has been observed in other animals and even many plant species (many plants could self-pollinate but have mechanisms that prevent them from doing so).\nSociological explanations.\nPsychoanalytic theory\u2014in particular, the claimed existence of an Oedipus complex, which is not an instinctual aversion against incest but an instinctual desire\u2014has influenced many theorists seeking to explain the incest taboo using sociological theories.\nExogamy.\nThe anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss developed a general argument for the universality of the incest taboo in human societies. His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against endogamy, and the effect is to encourage exogamy. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity. That is, L\u00e9vi-Strauss views marriage as an exchange of women between two social groups. This theory is based in part on Marcel Mauss's theory of \"The Gift\", which (in L\u00e9vi-Strauss' words) argued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;that exchange in primitive societies consists not so much in economic transactions as in reciprocal gifts, that these reciprocal gifts have a far more important function than in our own, and that this primitive form of exchange is not merely nor essentially of an economic nature but is what he aptly calls \"a total social fact\", that is, an event which has a significance that is at once social and religious, magic and economic, utilitarian and sentimental, jural and moral.\nIt is also based on L\u00e9vi-Strauss's analysis of data on different kinship systems and marriage practices documented by anthropologists and historians. L\u00e9vi-Strauss called attention specifically to data collected by Margaret Mead during her research among the Arapesh. When she asked if a man ever sleeps with his sister, Arapesh replied: \"No we don't sleep with our sisters; we give our sisters to other men, and other men give us their sisters.\" Mead pressed the question repeatedly, asking what would happen if a brother and sister did have sex with one another. L\u00e9vi-Strauss quotes the Arapesh response:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What? You would like to marry your sister? What is the matter with you anyway? Don't you want a brother-in-law? Don't you realize that if you marry another man's sister and another man marries your sister, you will have at least two brothers-in-law, while if you marry your own sister, you will have none? With whom will you hunt, with whom will you garden, whom will you visit?\nBy applying Mauss's theory to data such as Mead's, L\u00e9vi-Strauss proposed what he called alliance theory. He argued that, in \"primitive\" societies\u2014societies not based on agriculture, class hierarchies, or centralized government\u2014marriage is not fundamentally a relationship between a man and a woman, but a transaction involving a woman that forges a relationship\u2014an alliance\u2014between two men. \nSome anthropologists argue that nuclear family incest avoidance can be explained in terms of the ecological, demographic, and economic benefits of exogamy.\nWhile L\u00e9vi-Strauss generally discounted the relevance of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense than in any other sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing L\u00e9vi-Strauss's argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a dire shortage of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.\nEndogamy.\nExogamy between households or descent groups is typically prescribed in classless societies. Societies that are stratified\u2014that is, divided into unequal classes\u2014often prescribe different degrees of endogamy. Endogamy is the opposite of exogamy; it refers to the practice of marriage between members of the same social group. An example is India's caste system, in which unequal castes are endogamous. Inequality between ethnic groups and races also correlates with endogamy.\nAn extreme example of this principle, and an exception to the incest taboo, is found among members of the ruling class in certain ancient states, such as the Inca, Egypt, China, and Hawaii; brother\u2013sister marriage (usually between half-siblings) was a means of maintaining wealth and political power within one family. Some scholars have argued that in Roman-governed Egypt this practice was also found among commoners, but others have argued that this was in fact not the norm.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is caused by dispersion: the refractive index of the lens elements varies with the wavelength of light. The refractive index of most transparent materials decreases with increasing wavelength. Since the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index, this variation in refractive index affects focusing. Since the focal length of the lens varies with the color of the light, different colors of light are brought to focus at different distances from the lens or with different levels of magnification. Chromatic aberration manifests itself as \"fringes\" of color along boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of the image.\nTypes.\nThere are two types of chromatic aberration: \"axial\" (\"longitudinal\"), and \"transverse\" (\"lateral\"). Axial aberration occurs when different wavelengths of light are focused at different distances from the lens (focus \"shift\"). Longitudinal aberration is typical at long focal lengths. Transverse aberration occurs when different wavelengths are focused at different positions in the focal plane, because the magnification and/or distortion of the lens also varies with wavelength. Transverse aberration is typical at short focal lengths. The ambiguous acronym LCA is sometimes used for either \"longitudinal\" or \"lateral\" chromatic aberration.\nThe two types of chromatic aberration have different characteristics, and may occur together. Axial CA occurs throughout the image and is specified by optical engineers, optometrists, and vision scientists in diopters.\nIt can be reduced by stopping down, which increases depth of field so that though the different wavelengths focus at different distances, they are still in acceptable focus. Transverse chromatic aberration (TCA) does not occur on the optical axis of an optical system (which is typically the center of the image) and increases away from the optical axis. It is not affected by stopping down since it is caused by the different magnification of the lens with each color of light.\nIn digital sensors, axial CA results in the red and blue planes being defocused (assuming that the green plane is in focus), which is relatively difficult to remedy in post-processing, while transverse CA results in the red, green, and blue planes being at different magnifications (magnification changing along radii, as in geometric distortion), and can be corrected by radially scaling the planes appropriately so they line up.\nMinimization.\nIn the earliest uses of lenses, chromatic aberration was reduced by increasing the focal length of the lens where possible. For example, this could result in extremely long telescopes such as the very long aerial telescopes of the 17th century. Isaac Newton's theories about white light being composed of a spectrum of colors led him to the conclusion that uneven refraction of light caused chromatic aberration (leading him to build the first reflecting telescope, his Newtonian telescope, in 1668.)\nModern telescopes, as well as other catoptric and catadioptric systems, continue to use mirrors, which have no chromatic aberration.\nThere exists a point called the \"circle of least confusion\", where chromatic aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or \"achromat\", in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled together to form a compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This perfectly corrects the aberration at two wavelengths and reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a range of nearby wavelengths. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or \"apochromat\", which provides perfect correction at three wavelengths. In general, correcting at three wavelengths will make the error on other wavelengths quite small, but an achromat made with low dispersion glass may still provide better correction than an apochromat made with more conventional glass.\nMany types of glass have been developed to reduce chromatic aberration. These are low dispersion glass, most notably, glasses containing fluorite. These hybridized glasses have a very low level of optical dispersion; only two compiled lenses made of these substances can yield a high level of correction.\nThe use of achromats was an important step in the development of optical microscopes and telescopes.\nAn alternative to achromatic doublets is the use of diffractive optical elements. Diffractive optical elements are able to generate arbitrary complex wave fronts from a sample of optical material which is essentially flat. Diffractive optical elements have negative dispersion characteristics, complementary to the positive Abbe numbers of optical glasses and plastics. Specifically, in the visible part of the spectrum diffractives have a negative Abbe number of \u22123.5. Diffractive optical elements can be fabricated using diamond turning techniques.\nTelephoto lenses using diffractive elements to minimize chromatic aberration are commercially available from Canon and Nikon for interchangeable-lens cameras; these include &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/6.3, &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/5.6, and &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/4 models by Nikon (branded as \"phase fresnel\" or PF), and &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/11, &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/11, and &lt;templatestyles src=\"F//styles.css\" /&gt;f/4 models by Canon (branded as \"diffractive optics\" or DO). They produce sharp images with reduced chromatic aberration at a lower weight and size than traditional optics of similar specifications and are generally well-regarded by wildlife photographers.\nMathematics of chromatic aberration minimization.\nFor a doublet consisting of two thin lenses in contact, the Abbe number of the lens materials is used to calculate the correct focal length of the lenses to ensure correction of chromatic aberration. If the focal lengths of the two lenses for light at the yellow Fraunhofer D-line () are \"f\"1 and \"f\"2, then best correction occurs for the condition:\nformula_1\nwhere \"V\"1 and \"V\"2 are the Abbe numbers of the materials of the first and second lenses, respectively. Since Abbe numbers are positive, one of the focal lengths must be negative, i.e., a diverging lens, for the condition to be met.\nThe overall focal length of the doublet f is given by the standard formula for thin lenses in contact:\nformula_2\nand the above condition ensures this will be the focal length of the doublet for light at the blue and red Fraunhofer F and C lines ( and respectively). The focal length for light at other visible wavelengths will be similar but not exactly equal to this.\nChromatic aberration is used during a duochrome eye test to ensure that a correct lens power has been selected. The patient is confronted with red and green images and asked which is sharper. If the prescription is right, then the cornea, lens and prescribed lens will focus the red and green wavelengths just in front, and behind the retina, appearing of equal sharpness. If the lens is too powerful or weak, then one will focus on the retina, and the other will be much more blurred in comparison.\nImage processing to reduce the appearance of lateral chromatic aberration.\nIn some circumstances, it is possible to correct some of the effects of chromatic aberration in digital post-processing. However, in real-world circumstances, chromatic aberration results in permanent loss of some image detail. Detailed knowledge of the optical system used to produce the image can allow for some useful correction. In an ideal situation, post-processing to remove or correct lateral chromatic aberration would involve scaling the fringed color channels, or subtracting some of a scaled versions of the fringed channels, so that all channels spatially overlap each other correctly in the final image.\nAs chromatic aberration is complex (due to its relationship to focal length, etc.) some camera manufacturers employ lens-specific chromatic aberration appearance minimization techniques. Almost every major camera manufacturer enables some form of chromatic aberration correction, both in-camera and via their proprietary software. Third-party software tools such as PTLens are also capable of performing complex chromatic aberration appearance minimization with their large database of cameras and lenses.\nIn reality, even theoretically perfect post-processing based chromatic aberration reduction-removal-correction systems do not increase image detail as well as a lens that is optically well-corrected for chromatic aberration would for the following reasons:\nThe above are closely related to the specific scene that is captured so no amount of programming and knowledge of the capturing equipment (e.g., camera and lens data) can overcome these limitations.\nPhotography.\nThe term \"purple fringing\" is commonly used in photography, although not all purple fringing can be attributed to chromatic aberration.\nSimilar colored fringing around highlights may also be caused by lens flare. Colored fringing around highlights or dark regions may be due to the receptors for different colors having differing dynamic range or sensitivity\u00a0\u2013 therefore preserving detail in one or two color channels, while \"blowing out\" or failing to register, in the other channel or channels. On digital cameras, the particular demosaicing algorithm is likely to affect the apparent degree of this problem. Another cause of this fringing is chromatic aberration in the very small microlenses used to collect more light for each CCD pixel; since these lenses are tuned to correctly focus green light, the incorrect focusing of red and blue results in purple fringing around highlights. This is a uniform problem across the frame, and is more of a problem in CCDs with a very small pixel pitch such as those used in compact cameras. Some cameras, such as the Panasonic Lumix series and newer Nikon and Sony DSLRs, feature a processing step specifically designed to remove it.\nOn photographs taken using a digital camera, very small highlights may frequently appear to have chromatic aberration where in fact the effect is because the highlight image is too small to stimulate all three color pixels, and so is recorded with an incorrect color. This may not occur with all types of digital camera sensor. Again, the de-mosaicing algorithm may affect the apparent degree of the problem.\nBlack-and-white photography.\nChromatic aberration also affects black-and-white photography. Although there are no colors in the photograph, chromatic aberration will blur the image. It can be reduced by using a narrow-band color filter, or by converting a single color channel to black and white. This will, however, require longer exposure (and change the resulting image). (This is only true with panchromatic black-and-white film, since orthochromatic film is already sensitive to only a limited spectrum.)\nElectron microscopy.\nChromatic aberration also affects electron microscopy, although instead of different colors having different focal points, different electron energies may have different focal points.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It comprises a judiciary branch, a legislative branch, and an executive branch, and offers support and services to the Tibetan exile community.\nThe 14th Dalai Lama formally rescinded the 1951 17 Point Agreement with China in early March 1959, as he was escaping Tibet for India. On 29 April 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama in exile re-established the Kashag, which was abolished a month earlier by the government of the People's Republic of China on 28 March 1959. He later became permanent head of the Tibetan Administration and the executive functions for Tibetans-in-exile. On 11 February 1991, Tibet became a founding member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) at a ceremony held at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. After the Dalai Lama decided no longer to assume administrative authority, the Charter of Tibetans in Exile was updated in May 2011 to repeal all articles relating to his political duties.\nThe Tibetan diaspora and refugees support the Central Tibetan Administration by voting for members of its parliament, the Sikyong, and by making annual financial contributions through the use of the Green Book. The Central Tibetan Administration also receives international support from other organizations and individuals. The Central Tibetan Administration authors reports, press releases, and administers a network of schools and other cultural activities for Tibetans in India.\nPosition on Status of Tibet.\nIn 1963, the 14th Dalai Lama promulgated the Constitution of Tibet, and he became permanent head of state of Tibet. In 1974, the 14th Dalai Lama rejected calls for Tibetan independence, and he became permanent head of the Tibetan Administration and the executive functions for Tibetans-in-exile in 1991. In 2005, the 14th Dalai Lama emphasized that Tibet is a part of China, and Tibetan culture and Buddhism are part of Chinese culture. In March 2011, at 71 years of age, he decided not to assume any political and administrative authority, the Charter of Tibetans in Exile was updated immediately in May 2011, and all articles related to regents were also repealed. In 2017, the 14th Dalai Lama restated that Tibet does not seek independence from China but seeks development.\nFunding.\nThe funding of the Central Tibetan Administration comes mostly from private donations collected with the help of organisations like the Tibet Fund, revenue from the Green Book (the \"Tibetan in exile passport\") and aid from governments like India and the US.\nThe annual revenue of the Central Tibetan Administration is officially 22 million (measured in US dollars), with the biggest shares going to political activity ($7 million), and administration ($4.5 million). However, according to Michael Backman, these sums are \"remarkably low\" for what the organisation claims to do, and it probably receives millions more in donations. The CTA does not acknowledge such donations or their sources.\nAccording to a Chinese source, between 1964 and 1968, the U.S. provided 1.735 million dollars to the Dalai Lama's group each year. In October 1998, The Dalai Lama's administration stated that it had received US$1.7 million a year during the 1960s from the Central Intelligence Agency.\nIn 2002, the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 was passed in the U.S. In 2016, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded a grant of US$23 million to CTA.\nIn 2017, U.S. president Donald Trump proposed to stop aid to the CTA in 2018. Trump's proposal was criticised heavily by members of the Democratic Party like Nancy Pelosi, and co-chair of the bipartisan Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, Jim McGovern. In February 2020, at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, Pelosi prayed as Trump attended; \"Let us pray for the Panchen Lama and all the Tibetan Buddhists in prison in China or missing for following their faith\". In 2025, the Trump administration halted funds to the CTA, which amounted to half of CTA's budget at the time.\nHeadquarters.\nThe Central Tibetan Administration is headquartered in McLeod Ganj, Dharamshala, India.\nThe CTA attends to the welfare of the Tibetan exile community in India, who number around 100,000. It runs schools, health services, cultural activities and economic development projects for the Tibetan community. As of 2003, more than 1,000 refugees still arrive each year from China, usually via Nepal.\nGreen Book.\nTibetans living outside Tibet can apply at a Central Tibetan Administration office in their country of residence for a personal document called the \"Green Book\", which serves as a receipt book for the person's \"voluntary contributions\" to the CTA and the evidence of their claims for \"Tibetan citizenship\".\nFor this purpose, CTA defines a Tibetan as \"any person born in Tibet, or any person with one parent who was born in Tibet.\" As Tibetan refugees often lack documents attesting to their place of birth, the eligibility is usually established by an interview.\nBlue Book.\nThe Blue Book or Tibetan Solidarity Partnership is a project by Central Tibetan Administration, in which the CTA issues any supporter of Tibet who is of age 18 years or more a Blue Book. This initiative enables supporters of Tibet worldwide to make financial contributions to help the administration in supporting educational, cultural, developmental and humanitarian activities related to Tibetan children and refugees. The book is issued at various CTA offices worldwide.\nInternal structure.\nThe Central Tibetan Administration currently operates under the \"Charter of the Tibetans In-Exile\", adopted in 1991, amended in 2011. Executive authority is vested in the Sikyong, an office formerly held by Lobsang Sangay, who was elected in 2011. The Sikyong is supported by a cabinet of Kalons responsible for specific portfolios. Legislative authority is vested in the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration.\nThe Central Tibetan Administration's Department of Finance is made of seven departments and several special offices. Until 2003, it operated 24 businesses, including publishing, hotels, and handicrafts distribution companies.\nOn 29 April 1959, the Dalai Lama re-established the Kashag. In 1963, he promulgated Constitution of Tibet, and he became permanent head of state of Tibet. In 1974, he rejected calls for Tibetan independence, and he became permanent head of the Tibetan Administration and the executive functions for Tibetans-in-exile in 1991. On 10 March 2011, at 71 years of age, he decided not to assume any political and administrative authority, the Charter of Tibetans in Exile was updated immediately in May 2011, and all articles related to regents were also repealed, and position Sikyong was created.\nKashag.\nNotable past members of the Cabinet include Gyalo Thondup, the Dalai Lama's eldest brother, who served as Chairman of the Cabinet and as Kalon of Security, and Jetsun Pema, the Dalai Lama's younger sister, who served variously as Kalon of Health and of Education. Lobsang Nyandak Zayul who served as a representative of the 14th Dalai Lama in the Americas and a multiple cabinet member. He currently serves as president of The Tibet Fund.\nSettlements.\nThe Central Tibetan Administration, together with the Indian government, has constructed more than 45 \"settlements\" in India for Tibetan refugees as of 2020. The establishment of the Tibetan Re-settlement and Rehabilitation (TRR) settlements began in 1966, with the TRR settlements in South India, Darjeeling, and Sikkim becoming officially \"protected areas\" and requiring special entry permits for entry.\nMedia activities.\nA 1978 study by Melvyn Goldstein and a 1983 study by Lynn Pulman on Tibetan communities-in-exile in southern India argue that the CTA adopted a stance of preserving an \"idea of return\" and fostering the development of an intense feeling of Tibetan cultural and political nationalism among Tibetans\" in order to remain a necessary part of the communities. They state that this was accomplished through the creation of the Tibetan Uprising Day holiday, a Tibetan National Anthem, and the CTA control over local Tibetan-language media that promotes the idea of Chinese endeavours to \"eradicate the Tibetan race\". From the 1990s onwards, the CTA used Hollywood films in addition to local media to emphasise the Tibetan exile struggle, secure the loyalty of Tibetans both in exile and in Tibet, promote Tibetan nationalism, and foster the CTA's legitimacy to act in the name of the entire Tibetan nation.\nForeign relations.\nThe Central Tibetan Authority is not recognised as a sovereign government by any country, but it receives financial aid from governments and international organisations for its welfare work among the Tibetan exile community in India.\nUnited States.\nIn 1991, United States President George H. W. Bush signed a Congressional Act that explicitly called Tibet \"an occupied country\", and identified the Dalai Lama and his administration as \"Tibet's true representatives\".\nIn October 1998 the Dalai Lama's administration issued a statement acknowledging the Dalai Lama Group received US$1.7 million a year during the 1960s from the U.S. government through the Central Intelligence Agency, used to train volunteers, run guerrilla operations against the Chinese, and used to open offices and for international lobbying. A guerrilla force was reportedly trained at Camp Hale in Colorado.\nDuring his administration, United States President Barack Obama supported Middle Way Policy of the Central Tibetan Administration and met with the Dalai Lama four times, including at the 2015 annual National Prayer Breakfast.\nIn 2021, the Biden Administration pledged its support for the CTA, to which a representative expressed gratitude.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "54752", "revid": "34282584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54752", "title": "Liu", "text": "Liu (; or ) is an East Asian surname. pinyin: in Mandarin Chinese, in Cantonese. It is the family name of the Han dynasty emperors. The character originally meant 'battle axe', but is now used only as a surname. It is listed 252nd in the classic text \"Hundred Family Surnames\". Today, it is the 4th most common surname in mainland China as well as one of the most common surnames in the world.\nDistribution.\nIn 2019 Liu was the fourth most common surname in mainland China. Additionally, it was the most common surname in Jiangxi province. In 2013 it was found to be the 5th most common surname, shared by 67,700,000 people or 5.1% of the population, with the province with the most people being Shandong. Outside mainland China, Liu is also the 8th most common surname in Taiwan, the 30th most common in South Korea, and is present in smaller numbers in Vietnam.\nOrigin.\nOne source is that they descend from the Q\u00ed (\u7941) clan of Emperor Yao. For example, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty (one of China's golden ages), Liu Bang (Emperor Gaozu of Han) was a descendant of Emperor Yao.\nAnother origin is from the J\u012b (\u59ec) clan of King Qing of Zhou. For example, Duke Kang of Liu, the youngest son of King Qing of Zhou, founded the State of Liu and his descendants took state names as surname.\nHistory.\nLiu was a place name in ancient China (located in present-day Henan). The Liu family name has two main origins from this place name.\nKong Jia, the fourteenth king of the Xia dynasty, was given a male and a female dragon as a reward for his obedience to the god of heaven; yet he could not train them, so he hired a dragon-trainer named Liu Lei (\u5289\u7d2f), who had learned how to train dragons from Huanlong. Liu Lei was a descendant of Emperor Yao, and won the admiration of King Kong Jia for his skill at dragon-rearing. To reward Liu Lei, King Kong Jia granted him a place called Liu as his fiefdom. Liu Lei took the name of his fief as his family name. One day, the female dragon died unexpectedly, so Liu Lei secretly chopped her up, cooked her meat, and served it to the king, who loved it so much that he demanded Liu Lei to serve him the same meal again. Since Liu Lei had no means of procuring more dragon meat, he fled the palace. Liu Lei was the first person surnamed Liu in Chinese history, and his descendant Liu Bang founded the Han dynasty.\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, King Ding of Zhou granted the fiefdom of Liu to his younger brother, Ji Jizi (\u59ec\u5b63\u5b50). Ji Jizi also took Liu as his family name. Eventually, Liu became a state, and Ji Jizi ruled the State of Liu as Duke Kang of Liu. After more than a hundred years under the rule of the Liu family, the State of Liu was destroyed by the central government of the Zhou dynasty.\nLiu was the ruling family of the Han dynasty, one of the most prosperous and influential empires in Chinese history. The Han dynasty was founded by Liu Bang. Later, Emperor Liu Che helped expand the Han dynasty even further, ushering in a golden age for China.\nThe Han dynasty had 30 emperors all surnamed Liu; it was one of the Chinese dynasties with the most emperors. The Han dynasty lasted 400 years, making it one of the longest-lasting Chinese empires in history. The Han is what gives its name to the Han people as well as Han characters / Hanzi / Chinese characters.\nEven after the Han dynasty, several Liu continued to hold power within China, including Liu Bei of Shu Han (whose exploits were described in the Records of the Three Kingdoms), as well as the Han-Zhao, Liu Song, Later Han, Northern Han and Southern Han dynasties.\nOver history, several non-Han Chinese people have adopted the Liu surname, including Xiongnu and Turkic peoples.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Dmbox/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Surname listThis page lists people with the surname .

It was established in 1965 to replace the Tibet Area, a former administrative division of the Republic of China.\nThe current borders of the Tibet Autonomous Region were generally established in the 18th century and include about half of cultural Tibet, which was at times independent and at times either under the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty or Qing dynasty rule. The TAR spans more than and is the second-largest province-level division of China by area. Due to its harsh and rugged terrain, it has a total population of only 3.6 million people or approximately .\nNames.\nTibet Autonomous Region is often shortened to Tibet in English or as \"Xizang\" in Hanyu Pinyin which has been the Chinese transliteration of \u00dc-Tsang since the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. The English word \"Thibet\" dates back to 1827 and may have been derived from older terms in other languages. The official use of \"Xizang\" in Chinese records dates back to 1724 when the Kangxi Emperor of Qing dynasty wrote an edict for the Imperial Stele Inscriptions of the Pacification of Tibet in languages such as Han, Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan.\nHistory.\nIn the 6th century, the 39'th Tibetan king, Namri Songtsen, began to annex neighboring tribes by force, he was later assassinated by a coup, and his son Songtsen Gampo succeeded him and quelled rebellions in various regions. Songtsen Gampo inherited his father's will and successively conquered and annexed other kingdoms such as \"Songbo\" in the Yushu area of Qinghai, Sumpa in the west, \"Kangguo\" (called \"Dongnwu Kingdom\" in the Old Book of Tang) in Qianduo (now Chamdo), \"Fuguo (Chinese:\u9644\u56fd)\" in Ganzi, \"Fanlu (Chinese:\u8543\u7eff)\" in Litang, and Tuyuhun in Qinghai. Songtsen Gampo also led a large army to attack Zhangzhung in 642. It took him three years to conquer Zhangzhung and sent Khyungpo Pungse Sutse as the governor of Zhangzhung. Zhangzhung then became a vassal state of the Tibetan Empire. \nYarlung kings founded the Tibetan Empire in 618. By the end of the 8th century, the empire reached its greatest extent. After a civil war, the empire broke up in 842. The royal lineage fragmented and ruled over small kingdoms such as Guge and Maryul. The Mongols conquered Tibet in 1244 and later ruled it under the Yuan Dynasty but granted the region a degree of political autonomy. The Sakya lama Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa became a religious teacher to Kublai Khan in the 1250s and was made the head of the Tibetan region administration c.\u20091264.\nFrom 1354 to 1642, Central Tibet (\u00dc-Tsang) was ruled by a succession of dynasties from N\u00eadong, Shigatse and Lhasa. In 1642, the Ganden Phodrang court of the 5th Dalai Lama was established by G\u00fcshi Khan of the Khoshut Khanate, who was enthroned as King of Tibet. The Khoshuts ruled until 1717, when they were overthrown by the Dzungar Khanate. Despite politically charged historical debate concerning the nature of Sino-Tibetan relations, some historians posit that Tibet under the Ganden Phodrang (1642\u20131951) was an independent state, albeit under various foreign suzerainties for much of this period, including by the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644). The Dzungar forces were in turn expelled by the 1720 expedition to Tibet during the Dzungar\u2013Qing Wars. This began a period of Manchu-led Qing rule over Tibet.\nFrom the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912 until 1950, Tibet was \"de facto\" independent although still claimed by the successor Republic of China. The Republican regime, preoccupied with warlordism (1916\u20131928), civil war (1927\u20131949) and Japanese invasion (1937\u20131945), was not able to exert authority in Central Tibet. Other regions of ethno-cultural Tibet in eastern Kham and Amdo had been under \"de jure\" administration of the Chinese dynastic government since the mid-18th century; they form parts of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan.\nIn 1950, following the proclamation of the People's Republic of China the year before, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) defeated the Tibetan army near the city of Chamdo. In 1951, Tibetan representatives signed the Seventeen Point Agreement with the Central People's Government affirming its sovereignty over Tibet and the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China. The 14th Dalai Lama ratified the agreement in October 1951. Despite the agreement, relations between the Tibetan and Chinese governments deteriorated, and on March 10, 1959, Tibetans in Lhasa launched an uprising, which ultimately failed, but the date continues to be marked as Tibetan Uprising Day each year by Tibetan Exiles . The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India and renounced the Seventeen Point Agreement, saying he had approved it under duress. During the 1950s and 1960s, CIA-trained Tibetan agents were parachuted into Tibet to fight the PLA, but almost all of them were captured and killed.238 The establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965 made Tibet a provincial-level division of China.\nGeography.\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region is located on the Tibetan Plateau, the highest region on Earth. In northern Tibet elevations reach an average of over . Mount Everest is located on Tibet's border with Nepal.\nChina's provincial-level areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai and Sichuan lie to the north, northeast and east, respectively, of the Tibet AR. There is also a short border with Yunnan Province to the southeast. The countries to the south and southwest are Myanmar, India, Bhutan, and Nepal. China claims Arunachal Pradesh administered by India as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It also claims some areas adjoining the Chumbi Valley that are recognised as Bhutan's territory, and some areas of eastern Ladakh claimed by India. India and China agreed to respect the Line of Actual Control in a bilateral agreement signed on September 7, 1993.\nPhysically, the Tibet AR may be divided into two parts: the lakes region in the west and northwest and the river region, which spreads out on three sides of the former on the east, south and west. Both regions receive limited amounts of rainfall as they lie in the rain shadow of the Himalayas; however, the region names are useful in contrasting their hydrological structures, and also in contrasting their different cultural uses: nomadic in the lake region and agricultural in the river region. On the south the Tibet AR is bounded by the Himalayas, and on the north by a broad mountain system. The system at no point narrows to a single range; generally there are three or four across its breadth. As a whole the system forms the watershed between rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean \u2014 the Indus, Brahmaputra and Salween and its tributaries \u2014 and the streams flowing into the undrained salt lakes to the north.\nThe lake region extends from the Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh, Lake Rakshastal, Yamdrok Lake and Lake Manasarovar near the source of the Indus River, to the sources of the Salween, the Mekong and the Yangtze. Other lakes include Dagze Co, Namtso, and Pagsum Co. The lake region is a wind-swept Alpine grassland. This region is called the Chang Tang (Byang sang) or 'Northern Plateau' by the people of Tibet. It is broad and covers an area about equal to that of France. Due to its great distance from the ocean it is extremely arid and possesses no river outlet. The mountain ranges are spread out, rounded, disconnected, and separated by relatively flat valleys.\nThe Tibet AR is dotted over with large and small lakes, generally salt or alkaline, and intersected by streams. Due to the presence of discontinuous permafrost over the Chang Tang, the soil is boggy and covered with tussocks of grass, thus resembling the Siberian tundra. Salt and fresh-water lakes are intermingled. The lakes are generally without outlet, or have only a small effluent. The deposits consist of soda, potash, borax and common salt. The lake region is noted for a vast number of hot springs, which are widely distributed between the Himalayas and 34\u00b0 N, but are most numerous to the west of Tengri Nor (northwest of Lhasa). So intense is the cold in this part of Tibet that these springs are sometimes represented by columns of ice, the nearly boiling water having frozen in the act of ejection.\nThe river region is characterized by fertile mountain valleys and includes the Yarlung Tsangpo River (the upper courses of the Brahmaputra) and its major tributary, the Nyang River, the Salween, the Yangtze, the Mekong, and the Yellow River. The Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon, formed by a horseshoe bend in the river where it flows around Namcha Barwa, is the deepest and possibly longest canyon in the world. Among the mountains there are many narrow valleys. The valleys of Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse and the Brahmaputra are free from permafrost, covered with good soil and groves of trees, well irrigated, and richly cultivated.\nThe South Tibet Valley is formed by the Yarlung Tsangpo River during its middle reaches, where it travels from west to east. The valley is approximately long and wide. The valley descends from above sea level to . The mountains on either side of the valley are usually around high. Lakes here include Lake Paiku and Lake Puma Yumco.\nPolitics.\nThe Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. Chinese law nominally guarantees some autonomy in the areas of education and language policy. Like other subdivisions of China, routine administration is carried out by a People's Government, headed by a chairman, who has been an ethnic Tibetan except for an interregnum during the Cultural Revolution. As with other Chinese provinces, the chairman carries out work under the direction of the regional secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The standing committee of the regional Communist Party Committee serves as the top rung of political power in the region. The current chairman is Garma Cedain and the current party secretary is Wang Junzheng. The central leadership in Beijing formulates policies regarding Tibet through the Central Tibet Work Coordination Group, which is usually led by the chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe Autonomous Region is divided into seven prefecture-level divisions: six prefecture-level cities and one prefecture.\nThese in turn are subdivided into a total of 66 counties and 8 districts (Chengguan, Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean, Dagz\u00ea, Samzhubz\u00ea, Karub, Bayi, N\u00eadong, and Seni).\nUrban areas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWith an average of about two people per square kilometer, Tibet has the lowest population density among any of the Chinese province-level administrative regions, mostly due to its harsh and rugged terrain. In 2023, only 38.9 percent of Tibet's population was urban, with 61.1 being rural, amongst the lowest in China, though this is significantly up from 22.6 percent in 2011.\nIn 2020 the Tibetan population was three million. The ethnic Tibetans, comprising 86.0% of the population, mainly adhere to Tibetan Buddhism and B\u00f6n, although there is an ethnic Tibetan Muslim community. Other Muslim ethnic groups such as the Hui and the Salar have inhabited the region. There is also a tiny Tibetan Christian community in eastern Tibet. Smaller tribal groups such as the Monpa and Lhoba, who follow a combination of Tibetan Buddhism and spirit worship, are found mainly in the southeastern parts of the region.\nHistorically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic Tibetans. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag, are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group reside in Tibet include Bai people, Blang, Bonan, Dongxiang, Han, Hui people, Lhoba, Lisu people, Miao, Mongols, Monguor (Tu people), Menba (Monpa), Mosuo, Nakhi, Qiang, Nu people, Pumi, Salar, and Yi people.\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition published between 1910 and 1911, the total population of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity, was about 30,000, and the permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000).\nMost Han people in the Tibet Autonomous Region (12.2% of the total population) are recent migrants, because all of the Han were expelled from \"Outer Tibet\" (Central Tibet) following the British invasion until the establishment of the PRC. As of 2010, only 8% of Han people have household registration in TAR, others keep their household registration in place of origin.\nTibetan scholars and exiles claim that, with the 2006 completion of the Qingzang Railway connecting the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province, there has been an \"acceleration\" of Han migration into the region. The Tibetan government-in-exile based in northern India asserts that the PRC is promoting the migration of Han workers and soldiers to Tibet to marginalize and assimilate the locals.\nReligion.\nThe main religion in Tibet has been Buddhism since its introduction in the 8th century AD. Before the arrival of Buddhism, the main religion among Tibetans was an indigenous shamanic and animistic religion, Bon, which now comprises a sizeable minority and influenced the formation of Tibetan Buddhism.\nAccording to estimates from the International Religious Freedom Report of 2012, most Tibetans (who comprise 91% of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region) are adherents of Tibetan Buddhism, while a minority of 400,000 people are followers the native Bon or folk religions which share the image of Confucius (Tibetan: \"Kongtse Trulgyi Gyalpo\") with Chinese folk religion, though in a different light. According to some reports, the government of China has been promoting the Bon religion, linking it with Confucianism.\nMost of the Han Chinese who reside in Tibet practice their native Chinese folk religion (). There is a Guandi Temple of Lhasa () where the Chinese god of war Guandi is identified with the cross-ethnic Chinese, Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity Gesar. The temple is built according to both Chinese and Tibetan architecture. It was first erected in 1792 under the Qing dynasty and renovated around 2013 after decades of disrepair.\nBuilt or rebuilt between 2014 and 2015 is the Guandi Temple of Qomolangma (Mount Everest), on Ganggar Mount, in Tingri County.\nThere are four mosques in the Tibet Autonomous Region with approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Muslim adherents, although a 2010 Chinese survey found a higher proportion of 0.4%. There is a Catholic church with 700 parishioners, which is located in the traditionally Catholic community of Yanjing in the east of the region.\nThe mainly state-funded American advocacy group Freedom House ranked the Tibet Autonomous Region as \"not free\" in their 2025 annual world report, giving the region a rating of \u22122 out of 40 for political rights and 2 out of 60 for civil liberties. This gives the region a total score of 0 out of 100, positioning it as one of the least free places on earth.\nHuman rights.\nFrom the 1951 Seventeen Point Agreement to 2003, life expectancy in Tibet increased from thirty-six years to sixty-seven years with infant mortality and absolute poverty declining steadily.\nBefore the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in 1951, Tibet was ruled by a theocracy and had a caste-like social hierarchy. Human rights in Tibet prior to its incorporation into the People's Republic of China differed considerably from those in the modern era. Due to tight control of press in mainland China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region, it is difficult to accurately determine the scope of human rights abuses.\nWhen General Secretary Hu Yaobang visited Tibet in 1980 and 1982, he disagreed with what he viewed as heavy-handedness.240 Hu reduced the number of Han party cadre, and relaxed social controls.240\nCritics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) claim the CCP's official aim to eliminate \"the three evils of separatism, terrorism and religious extremism\" is used as a pretext for human rights abuses. A 1992 Amnesty International report stated that judicial standards in the Tibet Autonomous Region were not up to \"international standards\". The report accused the CCP government with keeping political prisoners and prisoners of conscience; ill-treatment of detainees, including torture, and inaction in the face of ill-treatment; the use of the death penalty; extrajudicial executions; and forced abortion and sterilization.\nTowns and villages in Tibet.\nComfortable Housing Program.\nBeginning in 2006, 280,000 Tibetans who lived in traditional villages and as nomadic herdsmen have been forcefully relocated into villages and towns. In those areas, new housing was built and existing houses were remodelled to serve a total of 2 million people. Those living in substandard housing were required to dismantle their houses and remodel them to government standards. Much of the expense was borne by the residents themselves, often through bank loans. The population transfer program, which was first implemented in Qinghai where 300,000 nomads were resettled, is called \"Comfortable Housing\", which is part of the \"Build a New Socialist Countryside\" program. Its effect on Tibetan culture has been criticized by exiles and human rights groups. Finding employment is difficult for relocated persons who have only agrarian skills. Income shortfalls are offset by government support programs. It was announced that in 2011 that 20,000 CCP cadres will be placed in the new towns.\nEconomy.\nIn general, Autonomous regions of China have some of the highest per capita government spending on public goods and services.366 Providing public goods and services in these areas is part of a government effort to reduce regional inequalities, reduce the risk of separatism, and stimulate economic development.366 Tibet has the highest amount of funding from the central government to the local government as of at least 2019. As of at least 2019, Tibet has the largest total per capita government expenditure of any region in China, including on health care, the highest per capita government expenditure on education, and the second highest per capita government expenditure on social security and employment.\nThe Tibetans traditionally depended upon agriculture for survival. Since the 1980s, however, other jobs such as taxi-driving and hotel retail work have become available in the wake of Chinese economic reform. By 2023, its gross domestic product (GDP) stood at nearly 239.3 billion yuan (about 33.6 billion U.S. dollars), adding that the growth rates of the region's major economic indicators, including per capita disposable income, fixed asset investment, and total retail sales of consumer goods, all ranked first in China. The added value of the service sector accounted for 54.1 percent and contributed a 57.6 percent share to economic growth. Investment in fixed assets also grew rapidly last year, with investment in infrastructure up by 34.8 percent and investment in areas related to people's livelihoods up by 31.8 percent. The region's GDP grew by an annual average of 9.5 percent from 2012 to 2023, about 3 percentage points higher than the China's national average.\nBy 2022, the GDP of the region surpassed 213 billion yuan (US$31.7 billion in nominal), while GDP per capita reached CN\u00a5 (US$ in nominal). In 2022, Tibet's GDP per capita ranked 25th highest in China, as well as higher than any South Asian country except Maldives. In 2008, Chinese news media reported that the per capita disposable incomes of urban and rural residents in Tibet averaged (CN\u00a5 (US$) and CN\u00a5 (US$) respectively.\nWhile traditional agriculture and animal husbandry continue to lead the area's economy, in 2005 the tertiary sector contributed more than half of its GDP growth, the first time it surpassed the area's primary industry.\nThe collection of caterpillar fungus (\"Cordyceps sinensis\", known in Tibetan as \"Yartsa Gunbu\") in late spring / early summer is in many areas the most important source of cash for rural households. It contributes an average of 40% to rural cash income and 8.5% to the Tibet Autonomous Region's GDP.\nThe re-opening of the Nathu La pass (on southern Tibet's border with India) should facilitate Sino-Indian border trade and boost Tibet's economy.\nThe China Western Development policy was adopted in 2000 by the central government to boost economic development in western China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region.133 Because the central government permits Tibet to have a preferentially low corporate income tax rate, many corporations have registered in Tibet.146\nEducation.\nThere are 4 universities and 3 colleges in Tibet, including Tibet University, Tibet University for Nationalities, Tibet University of Traditional Tibetan Medicine , Tibet Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College, Lhasa Teachers College, Tibet Police Officers Institute and Tibet Vocational and Technical College.\nAs of at least 2019, Tibet is the region of China with the most notable per capita government spending on education.\nTourism.\nForeign tourists were first permitted to visit the Tibet Autonomous Region in the 1980s. While the main attraction is the Potala Palace in Lhasa, there are many other popular tourist destinations including the Jokhang Temple, Namtso Lake, and Tashilhunpo Monastery. Nonetheless, tourism in TAR is still restricted for non-Chinese passport holders (including citizens of the Republic of China from Taiwan), and foreigners must apply for a Tibet Travel Permit (TTP) to enter the region, as well as Alien's Travel Permit (ATP) if travelling elsewhere in TAR outside Lhasa and Nagqu\nIn 2024, more than 63.89 million domestic and foreign tourists visited Xizang.\nTransportation.\nA 2019 white\u00a0paper from The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China reported Tibet's road system has achieved a total of 118,800\u00a0km.\nAirports.\nThe civil airports in Tibet are Lhasa Gonggar Airport, Qamdo Bangda Airport, Nyingchi Airport, and the Gunsa Airport.\nGunsa Airport in Ngari Prefecture began operations on July 1, 2010, to become the fourth civil airport in China's Tibet Autonomous Region.\nThe Peace Airport for Shigatse was opened for civilian use on October 30, 2010.\nAnnounced in 2010, Nagqu Dagring Airport was expected to become the world's highest altitude airport, at 4,436 meters above sea level. However, in 2015 it was reported that construction of the airport has been delayed due to the necessity to develop higher technological standards.\nRailway.\nThe Qinghai\u2013Tibet Railway from Golmud to Lhasa was completed on October 12, 2005. It opened to regular trial service on July 1, 2006. Five pairs of passenger trains run between Golmud and Lhasa, with connections onward to Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Xining and Lanzhou. The line includes the Tanggula Pass, which, at 5,072\u00a0m (16,640\u00a0ft) above sea level, is the world's highest railway.\nThe Lhasa\u2013Shigatse Railway branch from Lhasa to Shigatse was completed in 2014. It opened to regular service on August 15, 2014. The planned China\u2013Nepal railway will connect Shigatse to Kathmandu, capital of Nepal, and is expected to be completed around 2027.\nThe construction of the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway began in 2015. The line is expected to be completed around 2030.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Written Chinese names begin with surnames, unlike the Western tradition in which surnames are written last. Around 2,000 Han Chinese surnames are currently in use, but the great proportion of Han Chinese people use only a relatively small number of these surnames; 19 surnames are used by around half of the Han Chinese people, while 100 surnames are used by around 87% of the population. A report in 2019 gives the most common Chinese surnames as Wang and Li, each shared by over 100 million people in China. The remaining eight of the top ten most common Chinese surnames are Zhang, Liu, Chen, Yang, Huang, Zhao, Wu and Zhou.\nTwo distinct types of Chinese surnames existed in ancient China, namely xing () ancestral clan names and shi () branch lineage names. Later, the two terms were used interchangeably, and in the present day, \"xing\" refers to the surname and \"shi\" may refer either the clan or maiden name. The two terms may also be used together as \"xingshi\" for family names or surnames. Most Chinese surnames (\"xing\") in current use were originally \"shi\". The earliest \"xing\" surname might be matrilinear, but Han Chinese family name has been exclusively patrilineal for a couple of millennia, passing from father to children. This system of patrilineal surnames is unusual in the world in its long period of continuity and depth of written history, and Chinese people may view their surnames as part of their shared kinship and Han Chinese identity. Women do not normally change their surnames upon marriage, except sometimes in places with more western influences such as Hong Kong. Traditionally Chinese surnames have been exogamous in that people tend to marry those with different surnames.\nThe most common Chinese surnames were compiled in the Song dynasty work \"Hundred Family Surnames\", which lists over 400 names. The colloquial expressions \"l\u01ceob\u01ceix\u00ecng\" (\u8001\u767e\u59d3; lit. \"old hundred surnames\") and \"b\u01ceix\u00ecng\" (wikt:\u767e\u59d3, lit. \"hundred surnames\") are used in Chinese to mean \"ordinary folks\", \"the people\", or \"commoners\".\nHistory.\nChinese surnames have a history of over 3,000 years. Chinese mythology, however, reaches back further to the legendary figure Fuxi (with the surname Feng), who was said to have established the system of Chinese surnames to distinguish different families and prevent marriage of people with the same family names. Prior to the Warring States period (fifth century BC), only the ruling families and the aristocratic elite had surnames. Historically there was a difference between ancestral clan names or \"xing\" (\u59d3) and branch lineage names or \"shi\" (\u6c0f). \"Xing\" may be the more ancient surname that referred to the ancestral tribe or clan, while \"shi\" denoted a branch of the tribe or clan. For example, the ancestors of the Shang had \"Zi\" (\u5b50) as \"xing\", but the descendants were subdivided into numerous \"shi\" including Yin (\u6bb7), Song (\u5b8b), Kong (\u7a7a), Tong (\u540c) and others. The distinction between the two began to be blurred by the Warring States period. During the Qin dynasty, name usage was standardised, commoners started to acquire a surname or \"xing\", and the \"shi\" also became \"xing\". By the Han dynasty, families only had \"xing\" or \"xing-shi\". The great majority of Han Chinese surnames (now called \"xing\" or \"xingshi\") that survive to modern times have their roots in \"shi\" rather than the ancient \"xing\".\nIn modern usage, \"xing\" is the surname, but the word \"shi\" survives as a word to refer to the clan. The term \"shi\" may be appended to the surname of a person; for example, a man with the Zhang surname may be referred to as Zhang-\"shi\" instead of his full name. It is used in particular for the paternal surname of a married woman, therefore in this case \"shi\" means maiden name, which a Chinese woman would continue to use after marriage.\n\"Xing\".\nThe ancient \"xing\" were surnames held by the noble clans. They generally contain a \"female\" () radical, for example Ji (\u59ec), Jiang (\u59dc), Yao (\u59da) and Y\u00edng (\u5b34). This is taken as evidence that they originated from matriarchal societies based on maternal lineages. The character for \"xing\" itself is composed of a female radical and the character for \"give birth\" (\u751f, \"sh\u0113ng\"). \"Xing\" is believed to have been originally transmitted through women of noble birth, while noble men have \"shi\".\nScholars such as Edwin G. Pulleyblank, however, are unconvinced by the matriarchy theory of Chinese surnames due to a lack of independent evidence. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed, suggesting that the use of female radical in \"xing\" may have arisen from the clan exogamy system used during the Zhou dynasty (the words \"xing\" and \"shi\" also did not exist in the Shang dynasty oracle bones). In ancient times, people of the same \"xing\" were not permitted to marry each other and a woman married into an aristocratic clan needed to be of a different name. Based on observation of the evolution of characters in oracular scripture from the Shang dynasty through the Zhou: the \u5973 radical seems to appear during the Zhou period next to Shang sinograms indicating a clan or a tribe. This combination seems to designate specifically a female and could mean \"lady of such or such clan\". The structure of the \"xing\" sinogram could reflect the fact that in the royal court of Zhou, at least in the beginning, only females (wives married into the Zhou family from other clans) were called by their birth clan name, while the men were usually designated by their title or fief.\nWhile people of the same \"xing\" were not permitted to marry each other, those with the same \"shi\" can. By the Han dynasty when everyone had \"xing\" and the surname was transmitted paternally, the practice continued, but it had changed to marriage between families of men on the paternal side being prohibited, but not on the maternal side.\n\"Shi\".\nPrior to the Qin dynasty (3rd century BC), China was largely a \"fengjian\" (feudal) society. As fiefdoms were divided and subdivided among descendants, so additional sub-surnames known as \"shi\" were created to distinguish between noble lineages according to seniority, though in theory they shared the same ancestor. In this way, a nobleman would hold a \"shi\" and a \"xing\". \"Xing\", however, was more important than \"shi\".\nThe difference between \"xing\" and \"shi\" became blurred in the Spring and Autumn period starting with women. For example: Chunqiu referred to Duke Xuan of Lu's consort Lady Mujiang (\u7a46\u59dc), who bore the clan name (\u59d3, \"xing\") Jiang, as \"Jiangshi\" \u59dc\u6c0f, \"[lady of the] Jiang \"shi\"\" (!).\nAfter the states of China were unified by Qin Shi Huang in 221 BC, surnames gradually spread to the lower classes. Most surnames that survive to the present day were originally \"shi\".\nOrigins of Chinese surnames.\nAccording to the chapter on surnames in the Han dynasty work \"Fengsu Tong \u2013 Xingshi Pian\" (\u98a8\u4fd7\u901a\u59d3\u6c0f\u7bc7), there are 9 origins of Chinese surnames: dynasty names, posthumous titles, ranks of nobility, state names, official positions, style names, places of residence, occupations, and events. Modern scholars such as Kiang Kang-Hu proposed that there are 18 sources from which Chinese surnames may be derived, while others suggested at least 24. These may be names associated with a ruling dynasty such as the various titles and names of rulers, nobility and dynasty, or they may be place names of various territories, districts, towns, villages, and specific locations, the title of official posts or occupations, or names of objects, or they may be derived from the names of family members or clans, and in a few cases, names of contempt given by a ruler.\nThe following are some of the common sources:\nMany also changed their surnames throughout history for a number of reasons.\nUsage.\nChinese surnames or family names are written \"before\" the first name or given name. Therefore, someone named Wei (\u4f1f) from the Zhang (\u5f20) family is called \"Zhang Wei\" (\u5f20\u4f1f) and not \"Wei Zhang\". Chinese women generally retain their maiden name and use their name unchanged after marriage, but in modern times in some communities, some women may choose to attach their husband's surname to the front. Chinese surname is patrilinear where the father's surname is passed on to his children, but more recently some people have opted to use both parents' surnames; although this practice has increased in recent times, it is still relatively uncommon in China, with those who adopted both parents' surnames numbering at only 1.1 million in 2018 (up from 118,000 in 1990).\nSome Chinese outside of mainland China, particularly those from the Chinese immigrant communities around the world and those who have acquired a Christian or Western first name, have adopted the Western convention when giving their name in English, placing their surname last. Examples of those commonly known in the West include Jackie Chan (Chinese name Chan Kong-sang), Jimmy Choo (Chinese name Choo Yeang Keat), and Yo-Yo Ma. Those with a Western first name can write their name in English in various ways \u2013 some may add the Western first name in front and the Chinese given name last (the surname is therefore in the middle), or fully Westernised with both the Western and Chinese given names before the Chinese surname. Examples include Carrie Lam, originally named Cheng Yuet-ngor (Cheng is the surname), but who has acquired her husband's surname Lam and a Western first name as Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.\nDue to the different spelling conventions and dialects as well as the different spelling preferences in the various countries these Chinese find themselves in, many people of the same Chinese surname can appear differently when written in English, for example the Lin surname (\u6797) may also appear as Lam (Cantonese) or Lim (Hokkien). Some Chinese surnames that appear to be the same written in English may also be different in Chinese due to different characters having the same or similar pronunciations, dialectal differences, or non-standard romanizations (see section on variation in romanization below).\nDistribution of surnames.\nSurnames are not evenly distributed throughout China's geography. In northern China, W\u00e1ng () is the most common surname, being shared by 9.9% of the population. Next are L\u01d0 (), Zh\u0101ng (/) and Li\u00fa (/). In the south, Ch\u00e9n (/) is the most common, being shared by 10.6% of the population. Next are L\u01d0 (\u674e), Hu\u00e1ng (/), L\u00edn () and Zh\u0101ng (\u5f20/\u5f35). Around the major crossing points of the Yangzi River, the most common surname is L\u012d (\u674e), taking up 7.7%, followed by W\u00e1ng (\u738b), Zh\u0101ng (\u5f20/\u5f35), Chan/Ch\u00e9n (\u9648/\u9673) and Li\u00fa (\u5218/\u5289).\nA 1987 study showed over 450 family names in common use in Beijing, but there were fewer than 300 family names in Fujian. Furthermore, a 2012 study found that there was the lowest amount of isonymy in surnames among the population around middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River both on the provincial and county levels. Additionally, it was found that counties with the highest values of isonymy were distributed in the provinces with high proportions of ethnic minorities. According to the dendrogram of surname distances, several clusters could be identified. Most provinces in a cluster were conterminous with one another. The one exception to this pattern could be explained by demic migration observed where the Han Chinese migrated to Northeastern China.\nA study by geneticist Yuan Yida has found that of all the people with a particular surname, there tends to be a population concentration in a certain province, as tabulated to the right. It does not show, however, the most common surnames in any one province.\nThe 55th most common family name \"Xi\u00e0o\" () appears to be very rare in Hong Kong. This is explained by the fact Hong Kong uses traditional Chinese characters rather than simplified Chinese characters. Originally, the surname (Xi\u0101o) was rather common while the surname \u8096 (Xi\u00e0o) was extremely rare, if not non-existent (it is mentioned only sporadically in historical texts). The first round of simplification in 1956 simplified \u856d into , keeping \u856d/\u8427 and \u8096 distinct. However the second-round in 1977, which has long been abolished, merged \u8427 and \u8096 into \u8096. Despite the retraction of the second round, some people have kept \u8096 as their surname, so that there are now two separate surnames, \u8427 and \u8096.\nCh\u00e9n (/) is perhaps the most common surname in Hong Kong and Macau, where it is romanized as Chan. It is the most common Chinese surname in Singapore, where it is usually romanized as Tan, and is also common in Taiwan, where it is romanized as Ch\u00e9n.\nF\u0101ng (), which is only the 47th most common overall, is much more common in San Francisco's Chinatown in the United States, although the surname is more often than not romanized as Fong, as based on the Yue dialect. As with the concentration of family names, this can also be explained statistically, as a person with an uncommon name moving to an unsettled area and leaving his family name to large number of descendants.\nAfter the Song dynasty, surname distributions in China largely settled down. The Ku\u00e0ng (/) family, for example, migrated from the northern capital and settled in Guangdong after the Song dynasty revolts. Villages are often made up of a single patrilineage with individuals having the same surname, often with a common male ancestor. They usually intermarry with others from nearby villages, creating genetic clusters.\nSurnames at present.\nOf the thousands of surnames which have been identified from historical texts prior to the modern era, most have either been lost (see extinction of family names) or simplified. Historically there are close to 12,000 surnames recorded including those from non-Han Chinese ethnic groups, of which only about 3,100 are in current use, a factor of almost 4:1 (about 75%) reduction. A 2019 figure however put the total number of Chinese family names at 6,150. Of Han Chinese surnames, the largest number ever recorded was 6,363 (3,730 single-character surnames, 2,633 multiple-character surnames), around 2,000 of which are still in use. Chinese Surname extinction is due to various factors, such as people taking the names of their rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor's name, and others. A recent example of near surname extinction is the rare surname Shan (\ud849\udc89). The character may not be displayed on computer systems used by government officials, and people born after the system change as well as people who want to avoid possible problems changed their name to another character such as Xian (\u51bc). The name is still used by the older people, but some people from the village are concerned that future generations will forget their name origin.\nWhile new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing. The most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as Han and adopting Han names. In recent centuries some two-character surnames have often dropped a character. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, moreover, some surnames have been graphically simplified.\nAlthough there are thousands of Chinese family names, the 100 most common, which together make up less than 5% of those in existence, are shared by 85% of the population. The three most common surnames in Mainland China are Li, Wang and Zhang, which make up 7.9%, 7.4% and 7.1% respectively. Together they number close to 300 million and are easily the most common surnames in the world. In Chinese, the phrase \"third son of Zhang, fourth son of Li\" () is used to mean \"just anybody\".\nIn a 1990 study, the top 200 family names accounted for over 96% of a random sample of 174,900 persons, with over 500 other names accounting for the remaining 4%. In a different study (1987), which combined data from Taiwan and China (sample size of 570,000 persons), the top 19 names covered 55.6%, and the top 100 names covered 87% of the sample. Other data suggest that the top 50 names comprise 70% of the population.\nMost commonly occurring Chinese family names have only one character; however, about twenty double-character family names have survived into modern times. These include Sima ( , simp. ), Zhuge ( , simp. ), Ouyang ( , simp. ), occasionally romanized as \"O'Young\", suggesting an Irish origin to English-speakers, and Situ (or Sito ). Sima, Zhuge, and Ouyang also happen to be the surnames of four well-known pre-modern Chinese historical figures. There are family names with three or more characters, but usually those are not ethnically Han Chinese. For example, Aixinjueluo (, also romanized from the Manchu language as Aisin Gioro), was the family name of the Manchu royal family of the Qing dynasty. The longest recorded surname written using hanzi characters is Lunalouyugumuzheshuduotumuku'adebu'axi (), an extremely rare surname reportedly used by members of the Yi ethnic group in Yunnan province, with seventeen characters in total.\nVariations in romanization.\nTransliteration of Chinese family names (see List of common Chinese surnames) into foreign languages poses a number of problems. Chinese surnames are shared by people speaking a number of dialects and languages which often have different pronunciations of their surnames. The spread of the Chinese diaspora into all parts of the world resulted in the Romanization of the surnames based on different languages and Chinese dialects. Countries that have adopted the system of Chinese surnames such as Vietnam and Korea also spell them according to their own pronunciations. As a result, it is common for the same surname to be transcribed differently. For example, the Chen (\u9673) surname can appear as Chan (Cantonese, e.g. Jackie Chan), Tan (Hokkien), Tang (Teochew), Chin (Hakka and Korean), Tr\u1ea7n (Vietnamese) and others; the Li (\u674e) surname may appear as Lee (an example is Lee Kuan Yew), the Zhou (\u5468) surname can appear as Chou, Chew, Jew and many others (e.g. Wakin Chau and Jimmy Choo); while the Zheng surname (\u912d/\u90d1) can be romanized into Chang, Cheng, Chung, Teh, Tay, Tee, Tsang, Zeng or Zheng (in pinyin, Chang, Cheng, Zheng and Zeng are all different names). In certain dialects, different surnames could be homonyms so it is common for family names to appear ambiguous when transliterated. Translating Chinese surnames from foreign transliteration often presents ambiguity. For example, the surname \"Li\" are all Mandarin-based pinyin transliteration for the surnames L\u00ed (\u9ece); L\u01d0 (\u674e, \u7406 and \u91cc); and L\u00ec (\u90e6/\u9148, \u6817, \u5389/\u53b2, and \u5229) depending on the tone which is usually omitted in foreign transliterations.\nDue to the different pronunciations and romanizations, it is sometimes easy to tell whether a Chinese person has origins in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, or Taiwan. Generally, people of Mainland descent will have their surnames and names in pinyin. Those from Taiwan use Wade-Giles romanization. People from Southeast Asia (mainly Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines) and Hong Kong usually base their romanization of surnames and names on the Min, Hakka and Cantonese languages. The younger generation from Singapore often has their surname in dialect (Hokkien, Teochew, Hainanese, Cantonese, and Hakka) and given names in English, Mandarin, or both. \nSome people use non-standard romanizations, e.g. the Hong Kong media mogul \u90b5\u9038\u592b Run Run Shaw's surname \u90b5 is spelt as Shaw (Shao in pinyin).\nThe use of different systems of romanization based on different Chinese language variants from 1900~1970 also contributed to the variations.\nSome examples:\nIn Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines \"et alibi\", various spellings are used depending on name origin. See List of common Chinese surnames for the different spellings and more examples.\nSociological use of surnames.\nThroughout most of Chinese history, surnames have served sociological functions. Because of their association with the aristocratic elite in their early developments, surnames were often used as symbols of nobility. Thus nobles would use their surnames to be able to trace their ancestry and compete for seniority in terms of hereditary rank. Examples of early genealogies among the royalty can be found in Sima Qian's \"Historical Records\", which contain tables recording the descent lines of noble houses called \"shibiao\" ().\nLater, during the Han dynasty, these tables were used by prominent families to glorify themselves and sometimes even to legitimize their political power. For example, Cao Pi, who forced the abdication of the last Han emperor in his favor, claimed descent from the Yellow Emperor. Chinese emperors sometimes passed their own surnames to subjects as honors. Unlike European practice in which some surnames are obviously noble, Chinese emperors and members of the royal family had regular surnames except in cases where they came from non-Han ethnic groups. This was a result of Chinese imperial theory in which a commoner could receive the Mandate of Heaven and become emperor. Upon becoming emperor, the emperor would retain his original surname. Also as a consequence, many people also had the same surname as the emperor, but had no direct relation to the royal family.\nThe Tang dynasty was the last period when the great aristocratic families, mostly descended from the nobility of pre-Qin states, held significant centralized and regional power. The surname was used as a source of prestige and common allegiance. During the period many genealogical records called \"pudie\" () were compiled to trace the complex descent lines of families or clans and their marriage ties to other families or clans. Many of these were collected by Ouyang Xiu in his \"New History of Tang\". To differentiate between different surnames, the Tang also choronyms before stating beforehand, for example L\u01d2ngx\u012b L\u01d0sh\u00ec \u96b4\u897f\u674e\u6c0f, meaning Li of Longxi. These were generally the names of commanderies used prior to the reorganization during the Tang, so that they became exclusively associated to clans as their common use had died out. Cadet branches were also listed for further differentiation, such as G\u016bz\u0101ng F\u00e1ng \u59d1\u81e7\u623f, meaning Clan Li of Guzang.\nDuring the Song dynasty, ordinary clans began to organize themselves into corporate units and produce genealogies. This trend was led by the poet Su Shi and his father. As competition for resources and positions in the bureaucracy intensified, individuals used their common ancestry and surname to promote solidarity. They established schools to educate their sons and held common lands to aid disadvantaged families. Ancestral temples were also erected to promote surname identity. Clan cohesion was usually encouraged by successive imperial governments since it aided in social stability. During the Qing dynasty surname associations often undertook extrajudicial roles, providing primitive legal and social security functions. They played important roles in the Chinese diaspora to South-East Asia and elsewhere, providing the infrastructure for the establishment of trading networks. In southern China, however, clans sometimes engaged in armed conflict in competition for land. Clans continued the tradition of tracing their ancestry to the distant past as a matter of prestige. Most of these origin myths, though well established, are spurious.\nAs a result of the importance of surnames, rules and traditions regarding family and marriage grew increasingly complex. For example, in Taiwan, there is a clan with the so-called \"double Liao\" surname. The story is that \"Chang Yuan-zih of Liao's in Siluo married the only daughter of Liao San-Jiou-Lang who had no son, and he took the oath that he should be in the name of Liao when alive and should be in the name of Chang after death.\" In some places, there are additional taboos against marriage between people of the same surname, considered to be closely related. Conversely, in some areas, there are different clans with the same surname which are not considered to be related, but even in these cases surname exogamy is generally practiced.\nSurname identity and solidarity has declined markedly since the 1930s with the decline of Confucianism and later, the rise of Communism in Mainland China. During the Cultural Revolution, surname culture was actively persecuted by the government with the destruction of ancestral temples and genealogies. Moreover, the influx of Western culture and forces of globalization have also contributed to erode the previous sociological uses of the Chinese surnames.\nCommon Chinese surnames.\nMainland China.\nAccording to a comprehensive survey of residential permits released by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security on 24 April 2007, the ten most common surnames in mainland China are Wang (\u738b), Li (\u674e), Zhang (\u5f20), Liu (\u5218), Chen (\u9648), Yang (\u6768), Huang (\u9ec4), Zhao (\u8d75), Wu (\u5434), and Zhou (\u5468). The same names were also found (in slightly different orders) by a fairly comprehensive survey of 296 million people in 2006, and by the 1982 census. The top 100 surnames cover 84.77% of China's population. The top 10 surnames each have populations greater than 20\u00a0million. The MPS survey revealed that the top 3 surnames in China have a combined population larger than Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country.\nThe 2019 report by Chinese Ministry of Public Security gives the surnames Wang and Li as the most common ones, with each shared by over 100 million people in China. Each of the most common 23 surnames in China has more than 10 million users.\nA commonly cited fact from the 1990 edition of the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" estimated that Zhang was the most common surname in the world, but no comprehensive information from China was available at the time and more recent editions have omitted the claim.\nTaiwan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to a comprehensive survey of residential permits released by the Taiwanese Ministry of the Interior's Department of Population in February 2005, the ten most common surnames in Taiwan are Chen (\u9673), Lin (\u6797), Huang (\u9ec3), Chang or Zhang (\u5f35), Lee or Li (\u674e), Wang (\u738b), Wu (\u5433), Liu (\u5289), Tsai (\u8521), and Yang (\u694a).\nTaiwanese surnames include some local variants like Tu (\u5857), which do not even appear among the \"Hundred Family Surnames\", as well as a number of recently created names that are fusions of various conventional surnames like Changchien (\u5f35\u7c21) and Chiangfan (\u59dc\u8303). However, names in Taiwan show less diversity than China as a whole: the top ten comprise 52.63% of the Taiwanese population and the top hundred 96.11%. There were also only 1,989 surnames recorded by the Ministry's survey, against China's four or five thousand.\nAs is typical of China as a whole, these surnames conflate many different lineages and origins, although tradition may bind them to the same ancestral temples and rituals or ban intermarriage. For example, some Taiwanese converts to Presbyterianism adopted the name Kai (\u5055, pinyin \"Xi\u00e9\") in honor of the Canadian missionary George Leslie Mackay (\u99ac\u5055, Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b \"M\u00e1-kai\").\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Several of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway. He has composed 21 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass.\nSeveral of Lloyd Webber's songs have been widely recorded and widely successful outside their parent musicals, such as \"Memory\" from \"Cats\", \"The Music of the Night\" and \"All I Ask of You\" from \"The Phantom of the Opera\", \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" from \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" from \"Evita\", and \"Any Dream Will Do\" from \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\". In 2001, \"The New York Times\" referred to him as \"the most commercially successful composer in history\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" named him in 2008 the fifth-most powerful person in British culture, on which occasion lyricist Don Black said that \"Andrew more or less single-handedly reinvented the musical.\"\nLloyd Webber has received numerous awards, including a knighthood in 1992, followed by a peerage for services to the arts, seven Tony Awards, seven Laurence Olivier Awards, three Grammy Awards (as well as the Grammy Legend Award), an Academy Award, 14 Ivor Novello Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a Brit Award, the 2006 Kennedy Center Honors, and two Classic Brit Awards (for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2008, and for Musical Theatre and Education in 2018). In 2018, after \"Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\" won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), he became the thirteenth person to win an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is an inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.\nLW Entertainment (formerly The Really Useful Group), Lloyd Webber's company, is one of the largest theatre operators in London. Producers in several parts of the UK have staged productions, including national tours, of Lloyd Webber musicals under licence from LW Entertainment. He is also the president of the Arts Educational Schools, London, a performing arts school located in Chiswick, west London. Lloyd Webber is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992, he started the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture, and heritage of the UK.\nEarly life.\nLloyd Webber was born on 22 March 1948, at Westminster Hospital in London, the elder son of William Lloyd Webber (1914\u20131982), a composer and organist, and Jean Hermione Johnstone (1921\u20131993), a violinist and pianist. His younger brother, Julian Lloyd Webber, is a world-renowned solo cellist. On the BBC's genealogy series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\", he learned that his mother's great-great-uncle was the soldier Sir Peregrine Maitland who in 1815 served as a major general at the Battle of Waterloo.\nLloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age: a suite of six pieces at the age of nine. He also put on \"productions\" with Julian and his aunt Viola in his toy theatre (which he built at Viola's suggestion). In his memoir, he writes: \"mum was determined that I should be a prodigy in something or other.\" His aunt Viola, an actress, took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre. His father enrolled him as a part-time student at the Eric Gilder School of Music in 1963. At this time he was working on a Genghis Khan musical called \"Westonia!\".\nFrom 1960 to 1965, Lloyd Webber was a Queen's Scholar at Westminster School. An avid listener of 1960s rock and pop music, he called The Rolling Stones song \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" the \"best record of the Sixties\", and Dusty Springfield's rendition of \"Son of a Preacher Man\" the song that taught him \"the power of a perfect pop song\". He studied history for a term at Magdalen College, Oxford, although he abandoned the course in the winter of 1965 to study at the Royal College of Music in London and pursue his interest in musical theatre.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The names of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice are, of course, forever bound together in musical theatre history, like those of Gilbert and Sullivan.\"\n\u2014Theatre critic Mark Shenton on the partnership of Lloyd Webber and Rice.\nIn 1965, when Lloyd Webber was a 17-year-old budding musical-theatre composer, he was introduced to the 20-year-old aspiring pop-song writer Tim Rice. Their first collaboration was \"The Likes of Us\", an \"Oliver!\"-inspired musical based on the true story of Thomas John Barnardo. They produced a demo tape of that work in 1966, but the project failed to gain a backer.\nAlthough composed in 1965, \"The Likes of Us\" was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, \"The Likes of Us\" is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly Richard Rodgers, Frederick Loewe, and Lionel Bart. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly through-composed, and closer in form to opera.\nIn the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on \"The Likes of Us\" and who was the music teacher at the Colet Court school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir. Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of Herbert Chappell's \"The Daniel Jazz\" (1963) and Michael Hurd's \"Jonah-Man Jazz\" (1966), both of which had been published by Novello and were based on the Old Testament. The request for the new piece came with a 100-guinea advance from Novello. This resulted in \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\", a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph, in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, Calypso and country music. \"Joseph\" began life as a short cantata that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in \"The Times\". For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\".\nIn 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the Eurovision Song Contest called \"Try It and See\", which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics, it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" (1970). Debuting on Broadway in 1971, by 1980 the musical had grossed more than $ worldwide. Running for over eight years in London between 1972 and 1980, it held the record for longest-running West End musical before it was overtaken by \"Cats\" in 1989. The planned follow-up to \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" was a musical comedy based on the \"Jeeves and Wooster\" novels by P. G. Wodehouse. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired. Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical \"Jeeves\" with Alan Ayckbourn, who provided the book and lyrics. \"Jeeves\" failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975. Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled \"By Jeeves\" (1996).\nMid-1970s.\nLloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write \"Evita\" (1978), a musical based on the life of Eva Per\u00f3n. As with \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", \"Evita\" was released first as a concept album (1976) featuring Julie Covington singing the part of Eva Per\u00f3n. The song \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" became a hit single and the musical was staged at the West End's Prince Edward Theatre in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring Elaine Paige in the title role. This original production was enormously successful, eventually running for nearly eight years in the West End.\n\"Evita\" transferred to Broadway in 1979, in a production starring Patti LuPone as Eva and Mandy Patinkin as Che; it won seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical, helped launch the careers of both LuPone and Patinkin, and ran for almost four years. Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after \"Evita\", although they have sporadically worked together since then.\nIn 1978, Lloyd Webber embarked on a project with his cellist brother Julian, the \"Variations\", based on the 24th Caprice by Paganini; this reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom. The main theme was used as the theme tune for ITV's long-running \"South Bank Show\" throughout its 32-year run. The same year, Lloyd Webber also composed a new theme tune for the long-running documentary series \"Whicker's World\", which was used from 1978 to 1980. He also composed the instrumental \"Argentine Melody\" as the theme music for the BBC's coverage of the 1978 FIFA World Cup held in Argentina.\n1980s.\nLloyd Webber was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in November 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of Thames Television's Euston Road Studios in London. He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when Michael Aspel surprised him at the West End's Adelphi Theatre.\nLloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist, turning instead to the poetry of T. S. Eliot. \"Cats\" (1981) was to become the longest-running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances before closing. On Broadway, \"Cats\" ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, \"The Phantom of the Opera\". Elaine Paige collaborated again with Lloyd Webber, originating the role of Grizabella in \"Cats\", and had a Top\u00a010 UK hit with \"Memory\".\n\"Starlight Express\" (1984) was a commercial hit, but received negative reviews from the critics. It ran for 7,409 performances in London, making it the ninth longest-running West End show. It ran for less than two years on Broadway. The show has also seen two tours of the US, as well as an Australian/Japanese production, a three-year UK touring production, which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009. \"Starlight Express\" runs full-time in a custom-built theatre in Bochum, Germany, where it has been running since 1988. The German production holds the \"Guinness World Record\" for most visitors to a musical in a single theatre.\nLloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass dedicated to his father, William, who had died in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had been a part of the composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival. Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for \"Requiem\" in the category of best classical composition. \"Pie Jesu\" from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK Singles Chart and was certified silver. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.\nIn 1986, Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother's 60th birthday celebration. \"Cricket\" (1986), also called \"Cricket (Hearts and Wickets)\", reunited Lloyd Webber with Rice to create this short musical for the Queen's birthday, first performed at Windsor Castle. Several of the tunes were later used for \"Aspects of Love\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\".\nLloyd Webber premiered \"The Phantom of the Opera\" at Her Majesty's Theatre in the West End in 1986, inspired by the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel. He wrote the part of Christine for his then wife, Sarah Brightman, who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed \"Evita\". Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for \"Phantom\" with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe, with whom Lloyd Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in the West End; in January 2006 it overtook Lloyd Webber's \"Cats\" as the longest-running show on Broadway. On 11 February 2012, \"Phantom of the Opera\" played its 10,000th show on Broadway. With over 14,200 London productions it is the second longest-running West End musical. The Broadway production closed on 16 April 2023, having played 13,981 performances, the most in Broadway history.\n\"Aspects of Love\" followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by David Garnett. The lyrics were by Don Black and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn. \"Aspects\" had a run of four years in London, but closed after less than a year on Broadway. It has since gone on a tour of the UK. It is famous for the song \"Love Changes Everything\", which was performed by Michael Ball in both the West End and Broadway casts. It stayed in the UK Singles Chart for 14 weeks, peaking at number 2 and becoming Ball's signature tune.\n1990s.\nLloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and he composed \"Amigos Para Siempre\u00a0\u2014 Friends for Life\" with Don Black providing the lyrics. This song was performed by Sarah Brightman and Jos\u00e9 Carreras.\nLloyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on Billy Wilder's critically acclaimed movie, \"Sunset Boulevard\", since seeing the film in the early 1970s, but the project did not come to fruition until after the completion of \"Aspects of Love\" when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from Paramount Pictures, The composer worked with two collaborators, as he had done on \"Aspects of Love\"; this time Christopher Hampton and Don Black shared equal credit for the book and lyrics. \"Sunset Boulevard\" opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 12 July 1993, and ran for 1,529 performances.\nIn 1994, \"Sunset Boulevard\" became a successful Broadway show, opening with the largest advance in Broadway history, and winning seven Tony Awards that year. Even so, by its closing in 1997, \"it had not recouped its reported $13\u00a0million investment.\" From 1995 to 2000, Lloyd Webber wrote the Matters of Taste column in \"The Daily Telegraph\" where he reviewed restaurants and hotels, and these were illustrated by Lucinda Rogers.\nIn 1998, Lloyd Webber released a film version of \"Cats\", which was filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in London. David Mallet directed the film, and Gillian Lynne choreographed it. The cast consisted of performers who had been in the show before, including Ken Page (the original Old Deuteronomy on Broadway), Elaine Paige (original Grizabella in London) and John Mills as Gus: the Theatre Cat.\nIn 1998, \"Whistle Down the Wind\" made its debut, a musical written with lyrics supplied by Jim Steinman. Originally opening in Washington, Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince's production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards. The production included the Boyzone number-one hit \"No Matter What\", which remained at the top of the UK charts for three weeks. His \"The Beautiful Game\" opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway. The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London. The show was re-worked into a new musical, \"The Boys in the Photograph\", which had its world premi\u00e8re at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in April 2008.\n2000s.\nHaving achieved great popular success in musical theatre, Lloyd Webber was referred to by \"The New York Times\" in 2001 as \"the most commercially successful composer in history\". In 2002 he turned producer, bringing the musical \"Bombay Dreams\" to London. With music by Indian Music composer A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Don Black, it ran for two years at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. A revised Broadway production at the Broadway Theatre two years later ran for only 284 performances. On 16 September 2004, his production of \"The Woman in White\" opened at the Palace Theatre in London. It ran for 19 months and 500 performances. A revised production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 17 November 2005. Garnering mixed reviews from critics, due in part to the frequent absences of the show's star Maria Friedman due to breast cancer treatment, it closed only a brief three months later on 19 February 2006.\nLloyd Webber produced a staging of \"The Sound of Music\", which d\u00e9buted in November 2006. He made the controversial decision to choose an unknown to play leading lady Maria, who was found through the BBC's reality television show \"How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?\", in which he was a judge. The winner of the show was Connie Fisher. A 2006 project, \"The Master and Margarita\", was abandoned in 2007.\nIn September 2006, Lloyd Webber was named a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors with Zubin Mehta, Dolly Parton, Steven Spielberg, and Smokey Robinson. He was recognised for his outstanding contribution to American performing arts. On 11 February 2007, Lloyd Webber was featured as a guest judge on the reality television show \"\".\nBetween April and June 2007, he appeared in BBC One's \"Any Dream Will Do!\", which followed the same format as \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?\". Its aim was to find a new Joseph for his revival of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\". Lee Mead won the contest. Viewers' telephone voting during the series raised more than \u00a3500,000 for the BBC's annual \"Children in Need\" charity appeal, according to host Graham Norton on air during the final.\nIn 2007, Lloyd Webber's cat, Otto, leaped onto his Clavinova piano and \"destroyed the entire score for the new 'Phantom' in one fell swoop\". The Phantom in question was \"The Phantom of Manhattan\", a planned sequel to \"The Phantom of the Opera\". On 1 July 2007, Lloyd Webber presented excerpts from his musicals as part of the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event organised to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. BBC Radio 2 broadcast a concert of music from the Lloyd Webber musicals on 24 August 2007. Denise Van Outen introduced songs from \"Whistle Down the Wind\", \"The Beautiful Game\", \"Tell Me on a Sunday\", \"The Woman in White\", \"Evita\" and \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" \u2013 as well as Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"The Sound of Music\", which Lloyd Webber revived in 2006 at the London Palladium, and the 2002 musical \"Bombay Dreams\".\nIn April 2008, Lloyd Webber reprised his role as judge, this time in the BBC musical talent show \"I'd Do Anything\". The show followed a similar format to its \"Maria\" and \"Joseph\" predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in a West End production of Lionel Bart's \"Oliver!\", a musical based on the Charles Dickens' novel \"Oliver Twist\". The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character's role, but the show's main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by Jodie Prenger despite Lloyd Webber's stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate. Also in April 2008, Lloyd Webber was featured on the U.S. talent show \"American Idol\", acting as a mentor when the 6 finalists had to select one of his songs to perform for the judges that week.\nLloyd Webber managed the UK's entry for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Moscow. In early 2009 a series, called \"\", was broadcast to find a performer for a song that he would compose for the competition. Jade Ewen won the right to represent Britain, winning with \"It's My Time\", by Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren. At the contest, Lloyd Webber accompanied her on the piano during the performance. The United Kingdom finished fifth in the contest.\nOn 8 October 2009, Lloyd Webber launched the musical \"Love Never Dies\" at a press conference held at Her Majesty's Theatre, where the original \"Phantom\" has been running since 1986. Also present were Sierra Boggess, who had been cast as Christine Daa\u00e9, and Ramin Karimloo, who portrayed Phantom, a role he had recently played in the West End.\n2010s.\nFollowing the opening of \"Love Never Dies\", Lloyd Webber again began a search for a new musical theatre performer in the BBC One series \"Over the Rainbow\". He cast the winner, Danielle Hope, in the role of Dorothy Gale, and a dog to play Toto in his forthcoming stage production of \"The Wizard of Oz\". He and lyricist and composer Tim Rice wrote a number of new songs for the production to supplement the songs from the film.\nOn 1 March 2011, \"The Wizard of Oz\" opened at The Palladium Theatre, starring Hope as Dorothy Gale and Michael Crawford as the Wizard of Oz. In 2012, Lloyd Webber fronted a new ITV primetime show \"Superstar\" which gave the UK public the chance to decide who would play the starring role of Jesus in an arena tour of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". The arena tour started in September 2012 and also starred comedian Tim Minchin as Judas Iscariot, former Spice Girl Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as Herod Antipas. Tickets for most venues went on sale on 18 May 2012.\nIn 2013, Lloyd Webber reunited with Christopher Hampton and Don Black on \"Stephen Ward the Musical\". For his next project, a 2015 musical adaptation of the 2003 film \"School of Rock\", auditions were held for children aged nine to fifteen in cooperation with the School of Rock music education program, which predated the film by several years.\nIn April 2016, the English National Opera staged a revival of \"Sunset Boulevard\" at the London Coliseum. The limited run, semi-staged production directed by Lonny Price brought Glenn Close to reprise her star turn as Norma Desmond, which was her first time performing the role in London; she had originated the role in Los Angeles in December 1993 and then on Broadway in November 1994 (which won her the 1995 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical). The 2016 London revival was so well-received that the production transferred to the Palace Theatre on Broadway in February 2017, making Lloyd Webber the first musical-theatre composer since 1953 to have four musicals running simultaneously on Broadway \u2013 a feat that his heroes Rodgers and Hammerstein had previously achieved.\nLloyd Webber's memoir, \"Unmasked\", was published in 2018. On 9 September 2018, Lloyd Webber, along with Tim Rice and John Legend each won an Emmy for \"Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\". With this win, Lloyd Webber, Rice and Legend joined the list of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards. Lloyd Webber wrote the song \"Beautiful Ghosts\" with Taylor Swift for the film adaptation of \"Cats\", produced by Greg Wells and released in December 2019. In an interview in August 2020, Lloyd Webber called the film \"ridiculous\" in the ways that it changed the musical: \"The problem with the film was that Tom Hooper decided that he didn't want anybody involved in it who was involved in the original show.\" He said that seeing the film caused him to get a dog.\n2020s.\nLloyd Webber's new version of \"Cinderella\" opened at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in the West End in 2021. The opening, which was originally set to take place in August 2020, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a book by Emerald Fennell, Lloyd Webber wrote: \"Emerald Fennell has written something truly exciting and original, and the moment I read her outline I knew I'd found my latest collaborator.\" He garnered press attention in July 2021 for saying that he was \"prepared to be arrested\" to open \"Cinderella\" to full houses in spite of rising Covid cases and in defiance of Government advice. A 2021 feature in \"Variety\" suggested: \"Lloyd Webber, at 73, appears to have been reanimated creatively in recent years. Both \"School of Rock\" and \"Cinderella\" earned him some of the best reviews of his career and had a lightness and wit that had been missing from his work.\"\nIn 2022, Lloyd Webber appeared alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda in the BBC Platinum Jubilee Concert for Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. In 2023, Lloyd Webber was one of twelve composers asked to write a new piece for the coronation of Charles III and Camilla. His anthem, \"Make a Joyful Noise\", was performed during the enthronement of Queen Camilla.\nIn 2024, Lloyd Webber announced that his next musical will be an adaptation of the 2006 film \"The Illusionist\", which will feature lyrics by Bruno Major, book by Chris Terrio and will be directed by Jamie Lloyd and produced by Michael Harrison (following the 2023 and 2024 London and Broadway revivals of \"Sunset Boulevard\"). In 2025, Lloyd Webber will reunite with Tim Rice to create the original songs for \"Sherlock Holmes and The 12 Days of Christmas\", a comedy whodunit play written by Humphrey Ker and David Reed (members of the British sketch comedy troupe The Penny Dreadfuls) which will premiere at the Birmingham Rep for the Christmas season.\nAccusations of plagiarism.\nAmong the accusations of plagiarism that Lloyd Webber has received, the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen stated that he: \"has yet to think up a single note; in fact, the poor guy's never invented one note by himself. That's rather poor\". Lloyd Webber's biographer, John Snelson, acknowledged a similarity between the \"andante\" movement of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and the \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" song \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\", but wrote that Lloyd Webber:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...brings a new dramatic tension to Mendelssohn's original melody through the confused emotions of Mary Magdalene. The opening theme may be Mendelssohn, but the rhythmic and harmonic treatment along with new lines of highly effective melodic development are Lloyd Webber's. The song works in its own right as its many performers and audiences can witness.\nAn accusation of plagiarism regarded the 1971 Pink Floyd album \"Meddle\". The sixth track of the album, \"Echoes\", has a riff on which Lloyd Webber allegedly based the opening organ riff in \"The Phantom of the Opera\". The two riffs share very similar notes and the order of the notes played. Lloyd Webber's pipe organ riff from \"Phantom of the Opera\" plays D, C\u266f, C, B, A\u266f, then ascending A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f, D. Pink Floyd's \"Echoes\" plays C\u266f, C, B, A\u266f, A, then ascending A, A\u266f, B, C, C\u266f. Pink Floyd bassist and co-lead vocalist Roger Waters pointed this out and said it was \"probably actionable\", but stated that he did not care to take it to court.\nNoting similarities between Lloyd Webber's \"The Music of the Night\" and a recurring melody in Giacomo Puccini's 1910 opera, \"La fanciulla del West\" (\"The Girl of the Golden West\"), in 1987 the Puccini estate filed a lawsuit against Lloyd Webber, accusing him of plagiarism. The case was settled out of court, but details were not released to the public. The songwriter Ray Repp claimed in a court case that Lloyd Webber had stolen a melody from his own song \"Till You\", but the court ruled in Lloyd Webber's favour.\nPersonal life.\nLloyd Webber has been married three times. He married first Sarah Hugill, youngest daughter of Lieutenant-Commander Antony Hugill and Fanny \"n\u00e9e\" Gore Browne, on 24 July 1971; they divorced on 14 November 1983. Together they had two children, a daughter and a son:\nHe then married English soprano Sarah Brightman on 22 March 1984, in Hampshire. He cast Brightman in the lead role in his musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\", among other notable roles. They divorced on 3 January 1990, but have remained close friends and have also continued to work together.\nThirdly, he married Madeleine Gurdon in Westminster on 9 February 1991. They have three children, two sons and one daughter.\nLloyd Webber and his third wife Madeleine founded the Watership Down Stud in 1992. In 1996, they expanded their equestrian holdings by purchasing Kiltinan Castle Stud near Fethard in County Tipperary, Ireland. They were invited to ride in the King's procession at Royal Ascot 2023.\nIn a 1971 interview with \"The New York Times\", Lloyd Webber said he is an agnostic. He also said he views Jesus as \"one of the great figures of history\".\nHe is a lifelong supporter of London-based football club Leyton Orient F.C., as is his younger brother Julian.\nIn late 2009, Lloyd Webber had surgery for early-stage prostate cancer, but had to be readmitted to hospital with post-operative infection in November. In January 2010, he declared he was cancer-free. He had his prostate completely removed as a preventative measure.\nIn 2023, Lloyd Webber's son Nicholas died at the age of 43 after an 18-month battle with gastric cancer.\nLloyd Webber has a house in Eaton Square in Belgravia, London; in 2024 he revealed he had had his house blessed by a priest in an attempt to displace a \"poltergeist\" that was haunting the property.\nWealth.\nThe \"Sunday Times Rich List 2006\" ranked him the 87th-richest person in Britain with an estimated fortune of \u00a3700\u00a0million. His wealth increased to \u00a3750\u00a0million in 2007, but the publication ranked him 101st in 2008. \"The Sunday Times\" Rich List of 2019 saw him ranked the richest musician in the UK (overtaking Paul McCartney) with a fortune of \u00a3820\u00a0million ($1.074\u00a0billion). He lives at Sydmonton Court, Hampshire, and owns much of nearby Watership Down.\nLloyd Webber is an art collector, with a passion for Victorian painting. An exhibition of works from his collection was presented at the Royal Academy in 2003 under the title \"Pre-Raphaelite and Other Masters \u2013 The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection\". In 2006, Lloyd Webber planned to sell \"Portrait of Angel Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto\" by Pablo Picasso to benefit the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation. In November 2006, he withdrew the painting from auction after a claim that the previous owner had been forced to sell it under duress in Nazi Germany. An out-of-court settlement was reached, where the foundation retained ownership rights. On 23 June 2010, the painting was sold at auction for \u00a334.7\u00a0million to an anonymous telephone bidder.\nCharity.\nLloyd Webber is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992, he started the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture, and heritage of the UK.\nIn 2013, the Andrew Lloyd Webber Programme was launched to aid the Music in Secondary Schools Trust (MiSST), which aims to give every child at participating schools across the UK the opportunity to study a musical instrument as part of the curriculum. He told LBC: \"What music does in these schools, isn't actually necessarily about trying to make the children musicians. But what it does, is it really helps them as people.\"\nIn 2014, Lloyd Webber designed a \"Cats\"-themed Paddington Bear statue, which was located in Chinatown, London (one of 50 placed around London), with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).\nPolitics.\nLloyd Webber was made a life peer in 1997 as \"Baron Lloyd-Webber, of Sydmonton, in the county of Hampshire\", sitting for the Conservative Party. By the end of 2015, he had voted only 33 times in the House of Lords. Politically, Lloyd Webber has supported the Conservatives, allowing his song \"Take That Look Off Your Face\" to be used on a party promotional film seen by an estimated one million people before the 2005 general election. In August 2014, Lloyd Webber was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to \"The Guardian\" opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.\nIn October 2015, Lloyd Webber was involved in a contentious House of Lords vote over proposed cuts to tax credits, voting with the Government in favour of the plan. Lloyd Webber was denounced by his critics because he flew in from abroad on his personal plane to vote, when his voting record was scant. In October 2017, Lloyd Webber retired from the House of Lords, stating that his busy schedule was incompatible with the demands of Parliament considering the upcoming crucial Brexit legislation.\nIn July 2021, he told \"Good Morning Britain\" that he would never vote for the Conservatives again, due to their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and poor treatment of the arts sector during that time.\nAwards and honours.\nLloyd Webber was knighted in the Queen's 1992 Birthday Honours for services to the arts. He was given a life peerage in the 1997 New Year Honours and created Baron Lloyd-Webber, of Sydmonton in the County of Hampshire, on 18 February 1997. He is properly styled \"The Lord Lloyd-Webber\"; the title is hyphenated, although his surname is not. He sat as a Conservative member of the House of Lords until his retirement from the House on 17 October 2017.\nOn St George's Day 2024, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG).\nTheatre credits.\n\"Note: Music composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber unless otherwise noted.\"\nFilm adaptations.\nThere have been a number of film adaptations of Lloyd Webber's musicals: \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" (1973), directed by Norman Jewison; \"Evita\" (1996), directed by Alan Parker; \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (2004), directed by Joel Schumacher and co-produced by Lloyd Webber; and \"Cats\" (2019), directed by Tom Hooper and executive produced by Lloyd Webber. \"Cats\" (1998), \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" (1999), \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" (2000) and \"By Jeeves\" (2001) have been adapted into made-for-television films that have been released on DVD and VHS and often air on BBC.\nA special performance of \"The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall\" for the 25th anniversary was broadcast live to cinemas in early October 2011 and later released on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2012. The same was also done with a reworked version of \"Love Never Dies\". Filmed in Melbourne, it received a limited cinema release in the US and Canada in 2012, to see if it would be viable to bring the show to Broadway.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are many variations, as well as related games such as the German 32-card Tod und Leben (\"Death and Life\").\nRules.\nThe objective of the game is to win all of the cards.\nThe deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck\u2014this is a \"battle\"\u2014and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.\nIf the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a \"war\". Both players place the next card from their pile face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.\nMost descriptions of War are unclear about what happens if a player runs out of cards during a war. In some variants, that player immediately loses. In others, the player may play the last card in their deck as their face-up card for the remainder of the war or replay the game from the beginning. There also exists a variant where the player that possesses a larger amount of cards must provide the cards to fight the war.\nWar can also be played by multiple people. Each player in a three-player game receives 17 cards, while each person in a four-player game receives 13. Each player must simultaneously reveal their card, just like in the two-player version. If the highest cards played are tied, they will go to war. All players, including those who are not tied, will play one face-down card and the following face-up card. The person who has the highest card at the end of the war obtains all of the cards that have been played. When a player runs out of cards, they are eliminated and are no longer in the game. The game will continue until one player has collected all of the cards. \nGame designer Greg Costikyan has observed that since there are no choices in the game, and all outcomes are random, it cannot be considered a game by some definitions. However, the rules often do not specify in which order the cards should be returned to the deck. If they are returned in a non-random order, the decision of putting one card before another after a victory can change the overall outcome of the game. The effects of such decisions are more visible with smaller size decks as it is easier for a player to card count; however, the decisions can still affect gameplay if taken in standard decks.\nVariations.\nBeing a widely known game, War has many variations. Recorded variants include:"}
